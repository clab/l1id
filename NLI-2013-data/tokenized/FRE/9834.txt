I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do them well .
In my opinion they try new things to make themseleves more interesting people or just to show the intention from the other .
Those people always want to go further new things which isnt a good idea .
Taking risk is a very dangerous thing to do because they know what consequences they could get by doing something wrong .
For examples many famous actors are very popular for they good actings or they beauty but we always hear that there taking risks such as trying drugs which they know its very bad , instead of not taking those risk and do things wich are more inteligent .
Everyday we hear in the news paper about those successful people who are doing bad things and always talking rish instead of taking care of themselfes , looking after there familyes or enjoying life with happiness .
Most of them doesnt think that life is very short all they whant is to try new things wich dosnt help them only for dangerous risk .
I never understand those people why do they have to take those ridiculous risk and they dont know that it can bring them to very serious consequences like death , and some of them have a family with children and that may effect the childrens behavour .
They already know how to do things well so they should be intellingent in not trying risk and give good examples to everyone so that people always had a good thought of them .
