Young people are often independant and sometimes selfish .
Moreover , people who help their communities are usually quite old .
So some people can say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There is truth but I do n't totally agree and I will explain why .

It is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It is a fact that the members of this kind of associations are often old .
There are no many young people in it .
It is a pity because young people have much time and they could use it for that .
There are even some young people who have fun when they disturb their communities , it is a real problem in some areas , for example in the suburbs of Paris .

But I do n't think it is really new as the statement seems to mean .
It is a very old thing , solidarity was never very strong for young people .
Young people like to enjoy their life , they are independant , they spent all their time for their own life .
And I think it is time for them to do that .
I do n't think they have to be selfish and it will be good if they help more their community .
But I understand why young people give less time to that .

I think it is more a question of culture than a question of age .
If there is a lack for helping nowadays , it is because of everyone .
For example , a young people will be not encouraged to help his community if his parents do n't .
This kind of behaviour is helped by the education from the parents and the school .
Everybody must do something to improve the situation and putting the responsability on young people is not the best thing to do .

Finally I think that it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
But I do n't think it is new and I think it is not the main problem .
