The issue of differnt kind of knozledge is difficult because it depent of each person .
On the one hand people think that it is better to have a specialization because it per ; it to know fundamentaly one subject .
But one the other and we see that other person belive that have a broad knowledge it is have the general culture .
To my mind both point of view are interstong but the last is better .
So I will weigh the pors and cons for each argument .

Fisrt we can see that in the contry the last cycle that is say the graduate is a specialization in one discipline .
This is the reason why we can imaginem this choice is the better .
Moreover it is really difficult to learn different discipline at the same time , it may not be interesting because you have not got a good knownoldge .

Futhermore this employers prefer the majors , because they think that they are more competent than the person zho have no specialization .

But I can not help thinking that it is more interesting to learn different things because this is a way to opening your mind and have a global vision of the world .
For instance if you read read history ; economy , sociology ect you will be more co ; petent because you zill be able to understand problem by diffrent aspect .
Then to my mind a lot of students prefer to have broad knowledge ; that is why in France the Polical Institute are very fa ; ous because they porocure a lage knozledge .
It brooks no agreement that this kind of studies should be extending at all the college .

In a nuthshell we can they that have broad knomledge of ; any academic per ; it to hqve q
