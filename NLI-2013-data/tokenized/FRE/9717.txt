The success depend on what people try .
For sure someone who do only one thing and the same thing each day will performe in it , but the question we can ask is will he also perform in other activities if he tries its ?
It is not really sure .

Someone who always try new things is not sure to succed in all this things .
Maybe this person will have lots of experience in several activities but he is not good in all this activities or he does not succed in all the activities he tries .
For example somebody who tries to pass a hard test to have access to a better school he is in but who do not succed or somebody who take risk and setlle a new business which fail few month latter .
Are these persons succussful people ?
I do not think so .

But this point of view could be wrong for a person who succed in all the things he or she tries .
The question is : is this type of person current ?
I think that this type of people who succed in whaever they do is extremly rare .
That why on my opinion , successful people are the one who can do one or two maybe three things but who do it very well .

As the matter of fact , people who are specialists into two or three activities always succed in it so can be considered as successful people .
On other hand we can say that it is because they do always the same thing so ti is normal that they succed .

To my mind , successful people are people who work hard to have what they want .
they derserve their success because they have worked for it .
If they try new things and take risks to improve their situations or earn more money for example but after they work to have it they will probably succed .

So the success depend on the work of people .
The more you work , the more you will have chance to succed .
Without work , you can not go even more far .
I really think that the work is the key of the success .
