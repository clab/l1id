Is it better to learn many academic subjects or to limit oneself to a specific one ?
In my opinion , there is no true answer to this question .
A young student who does not have a clue about his future job will need to get broad knowledge to make up his mind .
Contrary to him , a student who has always known that he wanted to become a scientist for instance will have to attend special classes .

First , I think that most students who arrive in university do not know exactly what job they want to do , so they need to attend general classes .
Indeed , they often expect university classes to help them make a choice of carreer .
In this case , I am convinced that getting a broad knowledge through different academic subjects is well adapted since it gives students the time and the information to make a relevant choice for their future .
In like manner , general classes are an asset since they provide students with the necessary bases of general knowledge .
A significant evidence is that a student who wants to work on the stock market - which is a pretty specifical and technical field - will have to attend accountancy classes to know how the accounts of a firm work .
Likewise , a student who is planning to set up his own business will need to have a clear view on the grounds like marketing , law , finance , management and the like .

Second , when a student is totally convinced that he will do one specific job in the future , I think that studying one specific subject can be more strategic .
Indeed , to become efficient in one kind of technical job , you need to get specific knowledge by attending a specific class .
For instance a student who wants to become a dentist will have to do hard studies to be able to exercise this job .
In order for him not to waste time and to go straight to the point , he will need to learn subject taughts in one specifical class .

All in all , it depends on the carreer you want to have .
