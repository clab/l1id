People have to choose a major before entering in a College .
There are specialized majors such as for example Engineering , Languagues , Litterature , etc ...
but we are able to choose a study which taught many academic subjects .
Is it better to have a broad knowledge rather than having a specialization in one topic ?

On the first hand , I will talk about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I think it is very important to have a large knowledge of many academic subjects .
For instance , when I talk to a friend , if he told me a lot of informations about several subjects , I would find he is very smart .
Having a broad knowledge of many academic subject proves people thqt we have a huge culture , and it is useful when there is a discussion about a topic .
Indeed , if we had a broad knowledge , we would be able to talk about everything !
However , there is a drawback .
We just have the main points of every subjects , we wo n't be able to talk about everything of a subject .
That 's why I think that it is better to study several subjects , such as for example Maths , Biology or Litterature , when we are at high school and not at the University .
Indeed , pupils have to try every subject in order to find which way they can take after the high school .
High school helps us a lot in finding the perfect major we want to study in a University .

On the other hand , people are able to choose and to specialize in one specific subject .
I think it is better to make this choice because it is useful in order to find a job in the future .
For instance , I would like to work as a flight controller in the European Space Agency ( ESA ) .
That is why I have to specialize myself in one specific subject : Aerospace Engineering .
If I chose to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , I would have an enormous culture but I would n't be able to find a particular job .

To sum up my opinion , I do n't agree with the statement .
I think we should specialize in one specific subject in order to find the job we want to have in the future .
