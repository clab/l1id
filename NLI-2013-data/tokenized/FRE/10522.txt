The problem of knowing if being a risk taker or limiting yourself to do what you 're good at to be successful is complex and controversial .
While some people might argue that risks are likely to lead to failure , I would say that major successes have often been the results of creative and risky initiatives .

I believe that innovative thinking as well as risk taking persons are more likely to obtain huge successes .
If you do only what you 're good at , you generally do n't create new ideas nor products but you just execute something that has been already done .
Being efficient may make you the best in your field and procure you some relative success .
In my opinion , having a comfortable living situation does not necessarly means success .
In fact , success would be illustrated by more outstanding success stories , like the ones which came from a completly new concept .
This point can be illustrated by the example of the company Google .

To start a new company is a challenge itself that can lead to failure .
In the Google 's case , building a very efficient search engine and believing that it can be profitable through advertising was a completly new and innovative concept .
Financial risks related to the investment were important .
Investors had to be willing to take risks in a situation where we had no history nor statistics to anticipate success .
However , Google managed to be successful to the point where every employee gained a lot of money thanks to the enterprise success .
Even the cafeteria chef 's stock options were multiplied by more than one hundred between the time he joined Google and now !
I do n't believe we have seen such a growth in other new companies for the last years .

Today , we can definitely measure that the risk was really important as we know that a lot of companies that emerged from the Internet bubble went bankrupt .
Also , we can realize that Google 's innovative thinking as well as their will to take risks enabled his creators to have the success they have today .
