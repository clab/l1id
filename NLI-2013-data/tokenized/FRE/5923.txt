Since the invention of the first car , their amount has always increased causing a lot of damages to the environment .
Nevertheless , I believe that in twenty years , this worrying tendancy will be decrease .

First at all , it will be very harmfull to the environment if the amount of car tend to increase more and more .
That is why , in the next years , the government will have to take strict measures to prevent people from using their cars every day .
There already are some measures such as when the pollution is too high , only certain kind of car are allowed to circulate .
But , as far as I am concerned , the governement should do more and strenghten the law .

They can develop public transport and make me them cheaper .
Moreover , the price of the fuel has strongly increased , and it costs and will cost more money to move by car , even if other energy are developed .
Much of people cannot afford to pay more and will find more benefits not using their car , but rather public transport .

An other reason makes me believe that the amount of car will decrease .
Indeed , technological progress are more and more developed and performed quickly .
In few years , Cars will be replaced by some innovations who enable people to move cheaper , faster and easier .

To conclude , even if automobile firms intent to create cheaper and more ecologic cars , I think that news innovation will be created at the expanse of the cars .
And in twenty years , the supply of cars will have been collapsed , and then the amount of car will have been strongly decreased .
