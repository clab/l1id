I think that is more important to understand ideas and concept than learning facts , because when you just know facts , you do not use your brain .
You only use your knowledge and not your comprehension of the thing .
I think that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts because you can resolve a lot of thing with just your understanding of a problem for example .
If a person explain to you how something work , but you are not able to understand , you will not be able to make it work .
I think that sometimes we give too much importance to how a person know a lot of things ( facts ) .
Because when we arive in real life , I mean in the street , it is more important to be able to count for example , and that is not to learn facts , it is to understand how we do it .
I will do a example .
In math , when the teacher teach you how to do something , you cannot just learn the answer , you have to understand how you can arrive at this answer .
I always said that the intelligence , it is not just to know a lot of thing but also to know to think and to understand how we can do the things .
When we look at the persons who reach the top of the society , it is the persons who learn facts but the most important , the persons who understand the ideas and the concepts of more things that they can .
I think that when we go at school , it is to arrive in real life like at a job and to accomplish great things , so if we want to do great things , you have to be the most balance person that you can .
And my thinking is that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts more thant learn facts .
