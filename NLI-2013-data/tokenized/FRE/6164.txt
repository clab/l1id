we live in a world which is permanently changing for new technology IS increasing everyday as the progrees of industry .
But i will explain why i do n't think there will be fewer cars in use than there are today despite that .

I take an example ; if you look at the mobile phone ten years ago the first mobile was very big , nowadays they tend to be smaller and smaller with much more options than before , but in ten years i think there wo n't be any mobile left for we will have tiny mobiles stick in our jaws like it exists already in japan .
On the contrary cars exist since much long time than mobile phone and they are still here .
The only which changed is that tey can go faster , that they have much more options like GPS or ABS and we feel more secure in it , Itwenty years ther will be more cars than now maybe because new one are going to be constructed .
It is the type of cars which change not the existence of the car itself contrary to the mobile

moreover the presence of cars does not depend on time but more on the culture of each country .
In london for example everybody is travelling by bus and there is nearly no car in the center of the town except taxis .
And in holland everybody is biking whereas in the center of paris the streets are crowded with cars .

in twenty years i think that nothing will have changed
.
to conclude the only reason which could provoke a reduction of the number of cars would be that the government prohibits its use because of the pollution for example .
