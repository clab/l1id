when one weigh the pros and cons of using a car , it will lead to an inevitable conclusion : in twenty years car will become a kind of ` endangered species ' in our modern society .
Currently , this question is raising a huge controversy because , on the one hand , car is widely used as a traditional means of transportation and cars are also a part of our cultur [ especially , in the US , where car drivers are totally enamored with their cars ] .
But on the other hand , the increasingly price of petroleum and fossil fuels , the environmental issues linked to the widespred use of cars and other drawbacks make people think more deeply about cars .
As a matter of fact , I maintain that cars are going to disappear in a very close future , mainly because of economic reasons and environmental issue .

First and foremost , people are more and more concerned about the sharp growth of their expenses .
Using a car involves a lot of shortcoming since it is very expensive to purchase a car , to buy oil and to ensure your car , for instance .
So it seems that cars tend to become less available for the middle class families in developped countries .
Besides , one should bear in mind that it is not so comfortable to use a car because you have to endure traffic jams , which may end in traffic accidents sometimes , you have to commute every day and I strongly believe that people are fed up with such problems .

Moreover , cars will be fewer used in the next years because people are well aware that it is damaging to the environmemt and the nature around them .
Obviously , one should not expect modern human to renounce technological progress or to return to the Stone Age .
But , if things are left as they are , the human specie will finaly disappear .
Thus , I am sure that one should prefere rescue our planet and lives of next generation rather than keeping his car .
That is all the more crucial that the situation is obviously getting worse , so i cannot help thinking that men are able to make sacrificies if it is worth it .
Similary , we can see the harmfull impact of cars in our daily life .
In big cities there a lot of exhaust fumes , a lot of noise , smog and pollution and , to my mind citizens will not stand it any longer .

Finally , the developpement of alternative ways of transportation will also lead to a fewer use of cars .
For instance , a mayor in a big town can decide to increse the public transportation network , to make it more convenient and available in order to replace cars .
That is what happened in Paris recently .

To conclude , eventhough a lot of people are still addicted to their cars , they will soon change their mind .
Economic reasonning and ecological issue are couple of reasons which let us thinking that there will be fewer cars in use in your city .
There is no doubt that it will enhance our quality life for both generations , present generation and future generation .
