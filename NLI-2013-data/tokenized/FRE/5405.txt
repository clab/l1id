Advertissement is represented everywhere .
Every year , millions of new products born across the world .
Communication agencies develop better campaign that in the past .
A product is not anymore a good or service .
It becomes the identity of a compagny or a specified target .
The competition getting harder , the creators and infographistes use manipulation technics to sell the image of the product .

Firstly , everyday life products are more and more difficult to promote .
Every theme has been used in the past .
Agencies has to give a new identity to the product .
For example , Saatchi Saatchi , one of biggest European communication agency has developed a campaign based on erotism and exotism to sell a car .
The performance of the new motor or the shape of the car where not the main informations to communication .
In order to sell the model , the agency has created a dream situation which will transfer the customer into a harem of wonderful feminin creatures swearing only abouth this car .

Secondly , the industrial market is overcrowded .
Compagnies are developing new products which are already in the market due to their competitors .
For instance , the role of the advertissement will be to give an idea than the new product of Coca Cola is better than the one of Pepsi .
The two products are similar in a way but differ by their name and image .
On one hand , Coca Cola will be represented by young and dynamic persons singing in the street , breaking the rules .
On the other hand , Pepsi advertisement will show drawings .
The two advertissement campaigns will make the products seem much better than they really are .

To sum up , the main role of advertisement is to sell goods and service .
Whatever the real capacity or necessity of the product , the advertisement will present a product more colorful , more useful and promess to the target that it will change its life .
