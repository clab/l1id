The topic debate at university about the specialization reveals the complexity of that question .
Historicaly , sciences appear during the 19 th century , and explain evering fact analysing it particulary .
So , we can see the apparition of a lot of speciality which are interesting in only one part of the analysis : psychology , biology , economy , sociology ...
Before , this subject were a part of the global analysis of the life based on religion and philosophy .
The scientific rationality is interesting in the fact , but it can not forget the final meaning of his researches .

So , the university are fronting face to this question : must they specialized their student in one scientific subject , or must they conserve the axiology of a global understanding ?

The specialisation is a problem because it does not allow the student to understand why he is doing what he is doing .
His vision of his subject will be poor if he is not concerned by the other speciality methods , and aspects .
For example , if you do economy without notions of sociologic consequences of the economic decisions , you can not be efficient in your work .
It is the same case with every speciality because analysis is only a way toward a global understanding .
If you specialize yourself in only one specific subject , you will be narrow minded , and bader than peole who know some other subjects .

However , we need specialisation because it is a way to learn a job .
The problem of learning many acadmic subjects is that you dont have a speciality which is a prove of your level .

To have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is necesary before to know a specialization .
Weber shows the differents between the american and german university , and the solution is between this two cases .
Until 18 years old , you should not be specialized in one specific subject .
University should begin a specialization around the third years .
It is a determinant choice in the qualities of furtures workers .
