When applying to university , there are always many choices of study offered to students .
Some will be more likely to get engaged in a field such as litterature , while other will choose medecine .
I think , these two fields are really different from each other according to what you learn in each of them .
For the first , you will have to understand ideas and concept , and for the second , you will have to learn and deal with facts .
In my opinion , it is far more interesting to study facts .

First of all , when you are engaged in a field such as medecine that implies human life , you have to deal with new things everyday .
I think learning fact allows you to understand how things happened , and eventually to solve problems .
Of course , at the begining of a medical degree , you will have to learn rudimantary skills , which are somehow related to wordy idea and concepts , but then you will have to practice them , so that you will understand better what you were talking about before .
I think learn fact lead to more concrete activities .
Not just medecine is concerned .
Take the exemple of Law .
Usually , the begining of Law studies implies a lot of paper courses , lot of concepts .
These could remain very obscure for student if he does n't have any chance to practice them and to make them real .

Secondly , i think it is far easier for a teacher to communicate with students and to get their interest about a topic when it implies facts .
Of course the undertstanding of ideas and concept is very important to succeed in a class , but the lack of fact could make the previous work just redundant and less interresting .
It stimulates the student 's ability to understand better , and even more , to look foward to others subjects or disciplines .

To conclude , i think the understanding of ideas and concepts , and the study of facts are both important factors in the process of once studies .
However , it is way more interesting for students to learn fact , because it enable them to have a better understanding of what they already know , and it also allows eventually them to put their vast range of knowledge in practice .
