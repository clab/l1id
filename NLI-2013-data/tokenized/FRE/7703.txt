Nowdays , most of the people tra vel a lot due of the stress or other things .
Most of them travel in group or with their family led by a tour guide .
But it is suitable travel in group and led by a tour guide ?

Fisrt , it depends what kind of travel people do .
if it is the case of business , it is not realy good travel with your family or a group .
But its the group is part of the business , it suitable to travel with them In case or vacation , it s better to travel with a group and led by a guide because most of the people which travel do not realy know the place where they going in need a tour guide to show them the most attractives places where they can go to relax themself and some place that you can not imagine that you will be abble to see without being led by a tour guide .
The tour guide can give some advise about soem dangerous place .
And it is important to be in group because it is sometimes boring .

Also , when you travel with a group or you r family you can talk about the journey and it can you remenber some good times that you spend with some people that you already know or not .
So you can not regret to have made this trip .

But , travel with a group or your family is sometimes enoying .
So was thinking doing some activities during your vacation , but because of our family or your group you can do can persue your goal vacation .
For example , you made a trip with your father , mother , you was persuing that duirng this vacation you will go to party but they want you do that because may be by the tour guide they knew that going out the night is very dangerous , they prefer go to visit a touristics sites .
And also its cost a lot money to travel is a group led by a tour guide .

Altrough , sometimes is difficult to travel is a group led by a tour guide , people have to , because it presents many advantages that travel alone without and tour guide .
