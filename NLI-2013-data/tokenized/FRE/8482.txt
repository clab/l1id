For a long time the education was and continue to be very complex .
How is the best way to learn , how is the best way to understand ?
There has only one way or various way to learn ?
Perahps the best people who can answer at this differents questions are the students .
An important question it is to know how make young people be interested in the things , to be interested in learning ?
For me , the best way is to understand ideas and concepts .

Indeed , learns facts are very boring and a lot of time , you forget quickly what you learn .
Young people need to think by themself , we need to use our bread , to analyse and ask ourself a lot of questions to understand the why of the how .
When you learn facts in a book , everything it explains , you have a lot of time the personal opinion of the author .
This opinion will influence your thinking and make you being a lazy person , you will not have the will to find some others explanations or others ways to understand behind the lines in your book !

To ask you questions about an idea or a concept will increase your curiosity and your real satisfaction to understand an idea .
When you just learn about an author , you can have a good memories and explain his opinion but when you understand a conception you will use your personal word to explain something that you understand and it will increase your curiosity to know and know .

In conclusion , I thing that young people need that we encourage their intelligence to appear , their curiosity to increase in trying to explain them the big concept and the main idea and let they looking for explainations and solutions .
Learn fact at nowadays showed that it do not help us to learn about our fault but perhaps thinking and analzsing by ourself will help us to understand better every past fact .
