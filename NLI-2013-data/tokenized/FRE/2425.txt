It would be universally acknowledged that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
According to me , this statement can not be entirely true .
Let us consider my personal view and the comparison between a young people life and an older person life .

For the great majority of people , youngness brings all that a person want : health , beauty , love and so on .
And it is wright .
But something everybody ignores , is the notion of time .
In our society who has time to do what they want ?
Currently , young people are the most of the time students .
They have a lot of work to pass their exams and have their dilpoma .
By this way , they study a lot and spend their time working at home or on campus .
added to this question of time , a student has no money .
Studies are very expensives , above all in the United-States .
A master could cost 20 000 euros for a year .
It would be difficult to have extraordinary week-ends or travel to a foreign country or to do a very expensive sport .
All these things bring us to consider diferently a young people life .
With no time and no money , how could a student really enjoy is life ?

On the other hand , older people do not have all the daily life problems ' .
Of course , they have some healthy problems but they have time because they are retired .
They worked all their life , they accumulated money .
They can travel all over the world and make their dream possible .
They do n't have children at home , they do n't have a lot of preocupation .
They can live their life as they want , see their friends when they want .
According to me , older people could enjoy life a lot .

This brief presentation can lead us to reconsiderate the statement .
Young people are to busy to lead their life as they want .
Old people have this opportunity .
It is important to realize this .
It is my personal opinion .
