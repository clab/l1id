As we are today living in a more and more individualistic society , we may wonder whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities .
On my opinion , young people try to help their communities since I still see a lot of examples who are part of my relatives and friends , but also thanks to the different travels I have had the opportunity to do .

First , the fact that we live today in an individualistic society really matters .
Young people are looking for examples and they reproduce what they see close to them .
Although they use to be very helpful and loyal to their communities before , a lot of my friends and I still give time to help ours , by helping our families or working in different kinds of associations .
We can not generalize but my different trips allowed me to see that young people from other places in the world do help their communities .

However , I think that the most important question is not whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities but do those communities give time to helping young people ?
Young people are often lost in our modern world .
Moreover , they are looking for examples and heroes but also for values and education .
Communities have changed and do no always perpetuate their values to young people .
I have some family in Vietnam ; they explained me that parents take care of their children when they are young but when the parents get old it is the children 's turn to take care of their parents .

In conclusion , if we want young people nowadays to give more time to their communities , we have to make them understand the importance of helping their communities , but communities also have to give time to helping youmg people .
