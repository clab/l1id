Learning methods , nowadays , are different .
Students are more able to understand ideas and concepts as they have more supports , for instance books , and the `` new '' one , internet ...
However , for a student the purpose of the course is not always clear .
In this way , he can understand more precisely a concept or an idea by using the supports and therefore by increasing his knowledge by his own .

In my opinion , a student will be more interested in a subject in which he knows the basis rather than in a subject that he will only know the facts .

Understanding subjects will be clearer and easier for him to discuss , to argue for and to interpret .
He will be self-confident on what he talks about and will be able to respond to question , as the subject will be appear more sustainable for him .

Learning facts is not easy for children .
It may seems to be a succession of important things to know but without meaning for the children .
The student must be lost and confused on the subject as he will not understand from where information come from .

Moreover , if a student understand ideas and concepts he will be more able to take in mind those things for a long time and will be able to use it in the future , whereas , if he only understand facts , the subject must stay in mind for a short term period .

To conclude , from my point of view , learning facts is the basis of confused knowledge , whereas understanding ideas and concepts is the starting point of a intellectual culture .
