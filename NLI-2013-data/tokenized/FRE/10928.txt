I totally agree with this topic statement .
Being able to succeid in life is not easy .
Althought everybody wish to succeid just a few can really do so .
Succeid is an everyday fight .
I think that taking risks allow people to improve their situation .
Moreover trying new things bring a lot of knowledge .

First , by taking risks people can change their life in order to improve it .
For instance , someone who is living in a poor country and who does not earn enought money to be able to eat needs to take risks .
If he wants to be able to live in better conditions he should for example try to emigrate in a richer country .
In my point of view , this is a tremendous risk ; however , it is primordial one in order to improve his finacial situation .
He will afterward most likely be proud of himself .
Therefore his life would undoubtetly be a success !

Second , I believe that by trying new things someone can definitively have the chance to succeid .
Indeed , trying new things means also get interested in new field .
For instance a university student who takes ( tries ) different courses will at the end of his education have a lot of strong knowledge .
This knowledge will be a strong basis for his futur profesional life .
I am convinced that someone whom is bright and excellent a school will most likely succeid in his life .
He will find a stumulating job that will bring him joy as well as money in order to live in good conditions .

In conclusion , people should take risks and try new things each day .
Those risks will bring them on the top and will make them successful people .
Furthermore this sucess will make them happy .
However I acknowledge that taking risks and trying new things are not always easy thing to do but I am confident that its important to do them .
