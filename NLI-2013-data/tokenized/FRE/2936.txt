First , it is important to know the meaning of `` enjoying life '' .
Is this entertainment in its pure form , only constituted of liberal pleasures such as going out , drinking or smoking , staying late up , eat a lot , have sex , or does it mean to find a meaning in life , develop as a human being , have a family and a spiritual life ?

Actually , I think enjoying life can take as many forms as possible , depending on the persons .
Thus , I do n't think it is a question of age .
I think it 's only a question of minding .
Some people are just in the right frame of mind to enjoy whatever opportunity life brings .
An optimistic person will in general enjoy small things one after another , and face difficulties as a challenge .
We all know a negative person , so self-centered on its own problems that he or she does n't see the beauty all around him or her .
And is this a matter of age ?
Certainly not .

But being in a positive minding does n't come in any condition .
It is a matter of needs being fulfilled .
A person whose basic food , lodging , reproductive and affective needs are fulfilled will be a lot more likely to enjoy life .
Health being a main issue in this case , older people may not enjoy life as much as healthy young people .
But again , it is not a matter of age .
As we grow older , our body does not support us as well as it did when we were young .
It is common for old people to have health problems .
Therefore , anyone can be sick , even very young people .

It is known that the poorest people on Earth can be a lot happier than us , rich North-Americans , for they are often part of very close human communities .
By fulfilling completely their need of affection , they maybe need less than us , who have plenty of food and physical comfort , but suffer from an individualistic society where we are often left alone .
