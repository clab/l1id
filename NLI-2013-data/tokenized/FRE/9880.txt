It is generally agreeded that a way of succeed in life is to take risks .
Living one 's life fearfully is know as a loose of time .
People who do not dare experimenting new things are said to be coward or loosers .
I think that this question is debatable and that we have to be carefull with stereotypes .

It is undoubtable that sometimes in life you have to move on ; change your way of life to succed .
For instance , two years ago I had to leave my home , in Paris , to Aix en Provence , in southern France .
I have been accepted in a political science school to pursue my cursus .
I was afraid of living alone in another city but I take the risk and move to this new place .
Nowadays I am happy of having done the right choice .

Even if there are positive point in taking risks rather than doing what you already know sometimes it could be risky .
Risktakers are often self-confident .
My grandmother always says that too much confident is dangerous .
In my opinion taking risks becomes dangerous when you loose sens of reality ; when you think that all is easy .
Sometimes daring new things turns well , but you have to keep in ; ind that also it could turn bad .
For instance , my aunt was tired of her job , one day she decides to leave thinking of all the exciting new experiences she would experiement in a new job .
Unfotunatly it was not so easy to find a new job and she was unemployed during 3 months .
The risk she takes had tremendous consequences .

To conclude i want to say that taking risk is a good think but it has not be systematic .
fear is a normal feeeling and it contibutes to self protection .
A balance between daring new thigs and living carefully would be a ggod compromise .
