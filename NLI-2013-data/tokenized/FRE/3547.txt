Nowadays , it appears that young people do not give enough time helping their communities .

I agree with this statement .
As a teenager , I have witnessed these facts .
For instance , young people are more preoccupied by leisure time than anything else .
When they come back from school , their main wish is to let off steam , to rest or eventually have fun .
Parents do not necessarily force them to help their community , so it just does not come to their attention that their help might be needed .
Instead , they had rather watch television , go shopping or gather in groups of friends to just hang around .

Young people do not realize that even the smallest action can be of great help .
For example , helping nurses to make inventories , caring for old persons staying in hospital or even babysitting can be of genuine help .
I believe that they are not conscious of their inner selfishness .
The problem is , their parents probably never pointed it to them .
So who is the one to blaim ?
True , most teenagers would consciously refuse to give up their plans to go help people in a hospital , but on the other hand if their parents forced them to do so once or twice , they might become aware of the need for their help .

Sometimes forcing somebody to do something he does not like can have positive outcomes .
Personally speaking , this is how I realized I was becoming a selfish person .
One day my parents told me to do something useful instead of sitting on a sofa and watch television .
Since I am a rather good student , I figured I would spend most of my leisure time helping others who had difficulties .
I have been doing this for about two monthes now , and I truly do not regret it .
In addition to putting an end to my selfishness , it also taught me how to be patient and caring with people .
Most of my `` students '' have now become friends .

So , to sum up , being forced to do something for your own good is useful , and I strongly advise people to do so .
