As cars are partly responsible for pollution and global warming , it has become a big issue that the number of cars in use is always increasing .
Will our governments be able to restrain the number of cars so that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use ?
It seems to me that this is not going to happen soon .

First of all , the world population is increasing , why would the number of cars decrease in a short-term future ?
Nowadays , developping countries are developping more quickly than ever before .
And they will soon have the same demand for cars as developped countries , where nearly each one in the family owns a car .
On top of that , car constructors are providing developping countries with cars that correspond to their standard of life , so as to be able to earn money from the market in developping countries .

Then , we could also think that when there is no more oil to power the cars , the number of cars will decrease .
Well , that may happen for a time , but those cars will quickly be replaced by cars promoted by sustainable development , and powered by clean or renewable energies , which will be as performant and as accessible to everyone as the oiled-powered cars .

However , I think this increase in the number of cars wo n't last for ever .
As a matter of fact , I am convinced that with the help of the governments , the number of cars will reach a kind of limit , based on a policy to restrain the number of cars and a balance between the use of cars and the use of means of mass transport .
Otherwise , and increasing number of cars will not fit in the cities ' traffic .

To sum up , I think that twenty years from today , there will be more cars , but this phenomenon is not gonna last for a long time .
