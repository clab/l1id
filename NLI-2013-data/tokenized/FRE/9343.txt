By virtue of this text , I would like to express my opinions regarding the given subject .
As a student in research , I consider this question mind-boggling to say the least .
For years now , people have been debating on the subject in an attempt to decide whether students should learn fundamental or pragmatic knowledge .
Moreover , institutions are also pondering the issue ; wondering what is the true essence of learning and mandate of scholar institutions .

Considering my experience as a student for almost 16 years now , I truly believe that the learning of concepts and facts are tantamount in importance .
As for many things in life , homeostasis between elements is always the essential resolution in case of doubts .
Somehow , both are crucials to the attainment of a solid education and mental representations of knowledge .
On one hand , learn facted served as an empircal visualisation of our realm ; on the other , concepts and ideas help us to conceptualize the invisible such as the atom or the creation of distant galaxies .

It is my profound impression that one cannot appreciate the richness of reality and a deep phenomenological experience without both perspectives .
To illustraste my point , I could use the analogy of a student wishing to comprehend psychology .
It is in my opinion pretty simple to know as a fact that self-esteem is an important key indregient in child development .
But in itself , self-esteem doesn < t exist as tangible matter , only its mere conceptualisation guide us in knowing one particular phenomenon .

Therefore , when we look at it we can observe a fantastic process happening before our eyes .
Our conceptualisations help us identifying new phenomenon which in return , help us to establish new facts .
Thus , when we consider education as a way for students to be competent and autonomous we inescapably have to promote the acquisition of both through the learning of facts and concepts .
