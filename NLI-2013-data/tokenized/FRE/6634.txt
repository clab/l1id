When it comes to public transports and cars , people tend to take their car instead of public transports .
On the one hand , it is more easy to take public transports when you are in the city .
On the other hand , people prefer their cars because they are not disturbedby noisy people .
As far as i am concerned , i think that the use of cars will dicrease in twenty years .

First reason i believe this , it is because nowadays people tend to take public transports because they arrive at home or at their work places very quickly .
However it is true , that it is not always enjoyable to take public transports because of others people and the noise but we can tolerate each other to manage to live in peace .

The second reason i believe this , it is because it is more secure .
People can read a book in the train or can also listen music with their MP3 player .
However it is true we can listen music behind the wheel .
But when people who drive are tired , they can rest a little bit in the train or buses and they do not have to be concentrated on the road to go home. , they will not have car accidents which are more and more important nowadays .

Finally , last but not least , peolpe gain a lot of time , it is fantastic .
For example they do not have to search a car park during hours , because we know that it is very difficult to find car place in big city , such as Paris .
And also they can achieve homeworks or reading a paper for an assignement when they take public transports .

In conclusion , i believe that it will be more convienient and iwe do not use cars anymore not to use car in twenty years .
