Today , cars are the easiest way to travel .
The car is just one of the differents way to travel .
It 's probably the easiest one , but not the cheapest .
In a first time i 'll explain the differents postive point of the car , in a second time , i 'll describe the others way to travel , and in a third point compare both of them .

Today the car is the easiest way to travel .
To go from a point A to a point B. Even for short trips we take the car .
The cars get better and better day after day .
Most of the teenagers are just waitting for oine thing , a car .
They are able to go wherever they want , whenever they want and they do n't have to ask their parents , people feel that they are getting more freedom with a car .
We do n't have any rushes when we take our car , we leave whenever we want .
The car is less stressful than the others way to travel .

The car is not the only way to travel .
There is the train , the plane , the bicycle , even by foot for the most courageous of us .
The train and the plane are a safe way to go from a point A to a point B. But the plane is pretty expensive , but it 's getting cheaper .
But the train is not very expensive and it 's very easy to take a train , you do n't even have the stress of the road or getting an accident .
And today , we want to get things without any effort .
So the train is a very good way .

In twenty years , a lot of things will change .
Even right now things are changing and they are going to have an impact on our futur as the price of gaz , safety on the road ...
The train or the plane become very cheap , it 's not hard to find a plan ticket from paris to london for 20 $ .
I think in twenty years it 's going to be better .
So the car is going to be the most expensive way to travel .

I think , in the futur , we will still have a car .
But we are not going to use it as many times as we do .
Most of the big cities are getting better in transportation ( bus , metro , rental bike ) .
So i 'm not agree with this statement , we will still have a car but we will not use it very often , so one car will probably be enough for a family .
