The statement according to which young people would enjoy life more than older people do seems highly questionable .
Is at stake not less than the issue of the duality between body and mind as well as the problem of concern provided by our societies towards old people .

To begin with , I will introduce the arguments that might prove this statement to be true even if I do not share this point of view .
However , it could be assumed that young people enjoy life more than older people do thanks to their supposed greater energy and healthier body .
Thus they are not limited in their activities and can freely practice sport , participate in parties and walk on long distances .
According to me , this argument is not really receivable since it is far from being obvious that older people can not practice sport or enjoy festivities .
Some examples of old marathonians can demonstrate it .
It is a fact that the lack of physical capacities reduces the range of possibilities but it does not mean there is not any possibility anymore .
More relevant is the argument that rests on the incapacity ( or unwillingness ) of our societies of consumption to take older people in consideration .
The media and marketing campaigns are indeed largely directed towards younger people .

However I assume that life can be even more appreciated with the winsdom and experience an older people has got with time .
The feeling of accomplishment becomes possible and the joy of seeing one
