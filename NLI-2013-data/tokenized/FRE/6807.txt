First of all , it 's hard to say if there will be or if there wo n't be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today .
This issue has to be discussed , and both points of view have to be advocated through good and reliable arguments .
On the one hand , I think that the number of cars will increase in the next two decades .
Indeed , there will be more people allowed to pass the driving license .
Everyday , the earth population is increasing so , it 's mathematicly logical that there will be more cars in the next twenty years .
Furthemore , I think that there will be more automobiles because of , or should I say `` thanks to '' , the development of tourism .
Along the years , people have used to use the cars for going on vacations for exemple .
As well , the more the society is changing and evoluating , the more people can provide them with a car , this locomotion mean is no longer a good for rich people .
As well , we live in a period where it has become natural to use our cars .
Nowadays , we take the car to go to the supermarket as well as to go to the butchery with is 500 meters far from our house .
Because of the development of the automobile industry , we have become completely lazy or , at least , we tend to become very lazy ...
On the other side , I think it 's possible that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years : as a matter of fact , people are more concerned about the environment and we can see the emergence of new environmental organisations struggling against car pollution .
Furthemore , the governement might have planned to make downtown Paris , a discrict where people will have to pay for entering it .
In London , the congestion charge was implemented a couple of years ago and there is fewer cars and less pollution in the center of the British capital city , according to the environmentalists people .
Moreover , a lot of people take the commun transport to go to work , to go out at night so , why would this change ?
A lot of inhabitants of Paris have understood that it was more simple to move by the subway or bus instead of by car .
My last arguments will be that the cost of oil will increase for sure ...
That will be prevent people for using their cars as they usually do !
