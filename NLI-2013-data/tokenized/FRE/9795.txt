I have always been told that you can never get what you want if you do not try , or in other words , if you do not take risks .
I totally agree with that statement .

As I told it previously , I admit that people who take risks by trying new things can get what they really want and thereafter be very successful .
I mean that if you never try to do something different from what you are used to do at least once in your whole life , it is too bad .
Let 's talk about the actors for instance .
Some of them always act the same kind of characters and that is nice persons or on the contrary a bad person .
This is a good thing for them because they always know how to act since it is always the same thing .
However , some other actors sometimes try to act an opposite character that the one they are used to perform .
Morgan Freeman for instance has often performed nice character in his movies and one day , he accepted to play the '' Nasty '' in the movie called '' Dreamcatcher '' .
It was a very surprising to see him as a nasty but in spite of all that , the movie was great and had success and so the actor is .
