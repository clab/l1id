During the 19th century , Adam smith the first classical economist made a plea for specialisation in work .
People will know their job with inficiency and then can improve it .
But , on the other hand Marx answered specialisation make people stupid .
To do the same thing every time , do not permit to develope the mind .
So a large knowledge was resevered to an elite which can thing the society whearas the others are controled by a lake of knowledge , then cannot realise their position in the society and how they are exploited .

In some extend , the problem is in this debate .
In fact the answer depend of the context .

In our social life , it 's better to be specialised , because firms searched people with particular skills wich can use .
So specialisation is used to promote people in the society thanks to labour .
Moreover specialisation permit to have access to a knowledge very specific with its vocabulary and theirs owm issues .
Biology for instance requiere high skills to understand it .

On the contrary , the knowledge of a lot of subject permit to be aware about our environement .
It is important to understand our society which is built by a lot of diference knowledge .
It is permit more specific vocabulary , and think on different aspect of our modern live .
For instance we cannot imagine a politician which are ignorant of the main issues of his country .
And there are a lot of things as economic system , lobbies , church , poverty or military aspect etc ...

So in a democratic country as the western countries are a large is better .
Its per ; it to people to understand and participated to the politic live and to improve their point of view thanks to knowledge .
Furthermore , people who are specialised as scientis or doctor , have a wide knowledge too , in their specialisation of course , but again in others academic subject as mathematic for a physisian .
To conclued , the more knowledge we have the more efficiency we are .
During the cultural revolution in china , teachers were partiucly targeted because of their large knowledge
