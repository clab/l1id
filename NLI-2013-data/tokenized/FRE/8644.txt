The concept is the base of life .
Indeed , our world and our way of thinking are built on ideas or concepts .
We often associate school as a place where pupils have to learn facts by heart .
But where should we place the limit between a wisdom acquierd by learning the facts and a knowledge based on concepts ?

A History class would be the best example to answer this question .
Indeed , while pupils are studying a certain period of history , the most important for them is to understand the way of thinking of the people living at that time , their ideas , the circumpstances , what happened before , the consequences i.e. , the whole context .
However , I think that it is also very important for them to be able to structure every thing .
Therefore students should have to learn precise dates and events in order to illustrate by concreat examples their ideas .

The concept is the first thing that we should learn , because it is what we keep in mind after a lesson .
But if this concept is not associated to a date or illustrated by a fact , the concept does not worth anything anylonger .
On top of that , how could we explain a concept without giving any example ?
It 's just impossible .
Phylosophy , which is the science of concepts is based on example and thus on facts .

This leads me to say that it is really important for a student to have a good memory and that is why children have to learn poems by heart .
As far as I am concerned , ideas and facts are deeply linked .
We could even go further by saying that very often we start by learning the fact and then we understand the idea which is behind this fact .
In mathematics for example we learn the formules of the sinus and the cosinus before even knowing what they represent .

It follows then that even if ideas are more important when we take a step back , we do not understand them right away without any facts or dates .

To sum up I would say that after having learnt and understood something , the idea is more important , but while learing this particular thing , we cannot separate the idea and the fact .
