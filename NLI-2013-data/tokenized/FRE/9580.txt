I agree that successful people try news things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , for these reasons ; By trying new things allow you to be curious to know how someone did it and you will find out how to do it too , that way it make you make a research .

By trying new things allow you to be positive in your mind and to have a great desire to succed no matter how difficult is the situation .

By trying new things you no that you should be openminded , go through disscussion with people who have done the same thing to learn their ways of doing thing , you should meet or have conversation with a lot of these people in other to learn from their experiences .

By trying new things you take a big risks , like in `` french we say if you do n't risk you do n't have anything '' , risk in a goog way to takle something .
We never know if we might succed or not the only way to do it is to risk .
Since we do not loose anything when we risk .

As for me doing the same thing every day become boring , i can say is a waste of energy and time ,

To conclude , people who succed try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
