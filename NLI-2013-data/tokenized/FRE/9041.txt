This statement typically reflects the fight between ideas and facts .
As far as I am concerned , learning ideas and concepts is much more useful for a students than learning facts .

If I take an experience of mine , that will examplify what I mean .
I am currently a student in a great French business School , and particularly focused on Corporate Finance .
I attended scores of theoretical classes , mainly about great financial concepts .
For 6 months , I have been a trainee as financial analyst , in mergers & acqusitions , in HSBC .
I have quickly come to the conclusion that all the courses I attended were really usefull .
I mean that , professionnally , facts concretely do not teach anything , whereas ideas and concepts create those facts and explain them .
It is obviously more important to have learned how to valuate a company than to have learened how much Coca Cola is valuated .

Moreover , ideas and concepts make one 's mind more open .
They make one 's mental boundaries broader .
From a combination of ideas may stem a lot of new ideas , innovation and creation .
But hardly nothing stems from facts , except facts and history .
Facts are worth in themselves , whereas the worth of concepts and ideas results from the innovation they allow .

Eventually , some facts are clearly important to know and understand things .
But to really and fully understand the French Revolution in 1789 , for instance , one must have previously learned all the ideas and concepts prevailing in the Revolution , such as the absolute monarchy or the emertging philosophy of `` les Lumieres '' .
The Revolution is not just a succession of facts , and just learning the very dates of it is obmitting the true essence of the Revolution , what it really implied , the consequences it had for the life at that day , but also fur us , French people , today .
