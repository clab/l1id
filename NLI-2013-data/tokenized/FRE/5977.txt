The first cars were created by german factories at the end of the 19th century .
This invention encountered a real success and , consequently , from this time , was spread all over the world .
During the 20th century , the number of cars produced and bought increased considerably .
However , since the end of the economic growth , thirty years after the second world war , and the first oil crisis , it goes without saying that the idea of reducing the number of cars have been taken into account .
While it is certain that in a long-term way of thinking there will be fewer cars , it does not seem so accurate in a short-term one .

Some elements lead us to think that there may be less and less cars in a long-term perspective .
First of all , I 'd like to underline that from the second half of the 21st century , there is a high probability that there will be no more oil .
All known ressources are exploited and it is becoming more and more difficult to find oil .
Added to this , new kinds of transports are found and developed .
To illustrate that idea , I can mention the new project of traveling in space .

However , I 'd like to lay stress on that , to my mind , in twenty years , there wo n't be fewer cars .
Other locations from where we can extract oil are found .
For instance , extraction of oil from under the ocean has started .
In addition , the issue of the lack of oil is solved by the discovery of other sources that could replace oil , such as flower oil , with which a car can work .
Finally , I 'd like to emphazise the importance and the power of the car industry that lead me to think that there will be opposed to a decrease of the number of cars .
For instance , the money spent on car advertisments illustrates their financial power , so that we can think that their opposition can be efficient .

Thus , in twenty year , there are many reasons to think that there will still be as much cars as today , maybe more if we consider the interest of people in cars innovations , through the success of the Car Saloon that took place recently .
