Both types of learning supports have advantages and disadvantages .
I will name advantages for both ideas but in my opinion to understand ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts .

First , earning facts and events presents the advantage of beeing imaged and more easily understandable .
Learning facts is possible at every age .
It is strong material to link different notions altogether .
But alone , it can only make the student status on a particular combinaison of factors at a particular time .
For instance , let 's take invention : it is nice to have book where all previous discoveries are referenced but it does not help you open your mind and search for something else , it does not create a challenge or a necessity .
You just learn from facts not from their reasons , meanings and solutions .

Second , History and facts play a fundamental role on the civic aspect of an education .
It helps interactions as you always learn from the past experiences .
But does it always impact and modificate someone 's behavior ?

Of course , on the one hand , practice and real life examples are often poweful learning material and self-explanatory .
But on the other hand , it not possible for a human beeing and consequently for a student to learn all facts whereas understanding the related concepts would help him to face any type of situation .
As a result , it becomes possible to take measure risk .
The student becomes better prepared for both : his personal life and his career .

The ` Knowledge in youth is wisdom in age ' proverb well sums up my point of view .
It is more important to understand the concepts than to know their application .
