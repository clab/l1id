Most people would say that young people enjoy life more that older people do based on the fact that young healthy people have all their lives in front of us and are never eager to experience more and more things .
As far as I am concerned , I do not agree with this statement .
Indeed , whereas young people have to face life difficulties , the elderly have not to deal with stressful life anymore since they are retired .
Moreover , older people have the rest of their time to share love with their family .

First of all , when you are young , you are facing a lot of paramount difficulties and choices such as the employment and nowadays , unemployement , the right person you will marry , how many children you really want , how you will manage to earn enough money to feed your family and buy your house and so on .
Is it still obvious that young people enjoy life more than older one ?
Indeed , older people have overcome these kinds of difficulties and are becoming more peaceful in their mind than in their youth period .
Older people have nurtered a long-time experience , thereby implying they have learned from their mistakes and are accomplised individuals .
For instance , if someone were not completely satisfied with his wife/her husband , he/she has probably divorced and got married to another person and currently living with her/him .
Therefore , in comparison with his previous marriage , the person will obviously say that he is enjoying life more than he did on previous times .
Moreover , their job experience and relating stressful live is behind them .
Older people could be retired with their accumulated money earned during their employement period where they zerre young .
Although they could not afford what they want when they were young , they usually have enough time and money to buy what they really want .

Secondly , young people are usually dedicated to their work , this leading to forget their wife/husband and children .
The main goal is to earn money in order to live happily but the family suffer from this behavior .
Older people are settled in life and have usually earnt enough money to share it with their entire family and spend more time on holidays with them .

For all the above-stated reasons , I contend that older people enjoy life more than younger people do .
