Nowadays , the world is changing , the society too .
We enter in a world where individualism takes more and more place in the society than before , and where poverty and wars are increasing as well .
Is young people are affected on this ?
We going to sse in a first part that they dont give a lot of time for the community but that in an other part they are some who want to help .

Fisrt , answering the question , we can feel that today , the mojority of the young people do n't propose themselves to help the people in need .
This is he individualist behavior , nowadays young people are focusing on their project for the professional life and they are also pushing by the challenging they built up in he childhood in class , so they do n't have enough time for helping the community and they even do n't think about .

But in an other part , we see hat there is still some young people helping and giving time to the community .
We see quite a lot of young volunteers going on international aids , for people in crisis by the consequence of wars , and poverty ( like Medecin Sans Frontiere or Green peace for the environment ) .
As well , we can notice that `` generaly '' , young people apply for a work in a hospital for old people in retreat or in disablities and that they enjoy it !

In conclusion , we can understand that in this world in change , the help for the community is balanced .
Some are focusing in their professional life while other prefer helping in a social life .
