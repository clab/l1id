Generally speaking , advertisements make products attractive and desirable .
Let me start from scratch , what is the point of an advertisement ?
It is of course to make sell .
And why would someone buy an object if it seems useless and uneffective ?
As a result , advertisment naturally tries to make a product look interesting .

It is true that consequently , advertisements sometimes make a product seem much better than it really is .
Sometimes advertisements lie .
Yet it is not necessarily in its own interest to lie to consumers since they are not so stupid , and once a consumer finds out that he had been betrayed , he will not buy the product of the advertisement anymore .
It might get even worst : the betrayed consumer may not buy any other products of this company .
That is why , advertisements must be careful about what they are claiming , and they ought to win the consumer 's trust by simply telling him what the true advantages of such or such product are .

Yet , it is also true that advertisements tends to emphasize the pros of an object and to hide its disadvantages .
This is the implicit rule of business .
Unfortunatly , in occidental societies this rule is a general principle .
One cannot avoid it .
So one must not be gullible .
For these reasons , I am not shocked by advertisements even if they are false .
One must simply be careful and read magazines about products that he wants to acquire .

Besides , I believe that advertisement is a everyday enjoyment .
It is part of our lifes , and i do think that they are some advertisements that are very well done and that are very enjoyable , even if they lie a little .
I prefer an intersesting but lying commercial than a realistic boring one .
Anywaym the main goal of advertisements is to ; ake a product known right ?
And what is ; ore striking that a beautiful advertisement ?
