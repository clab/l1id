Staying young is one of developped countries inhabitants 's greatest concerns nowadays as the others still have to face survival issues such as starvation , ability to cope with natural catastrophes ...
Indeed , people nowadays often seem ready to do almost anything to preserve their youth .
Why that ?

I disagree with that common thought in developped countries which is , ageing brings with it sadness and boredom , and makes enjoying life hardly possible .
I think is is a cultural question .
Indeed , being african ; yself , I can affirm that in Africa , it is the contrary .
Only older people can really enjoy life as they have had time to figure out the meaning of life and they have been able to fulfill their destiny .
They have acquired that wiseness totally inaccessible to young because of the latest ones ' inexperience .
I think the difference of opinin between what I will called the Occidental culture and the African one stems from the fact that these cultures do n't have the same definition of enjoying life .
I would say that the Occidental view of enjoying life is much more hedonistic , epicurian whereas the African one is more ascetic .

Actually , in the developing countries ' minds , someone who enjoys life is someone who has the ability of undergoing thrilling experiences , such a person goes out a lot , has a lot of friends , is able to stay on dancefloors until the sunrise .
That is not my conception of enjoying life .
My view concurs with the African way of thinking .
It is not possible to enjoy life if you do n't even know the meaning of it .
And in my opinion , young people do n't know it .
They interes themselves a lot in superficial things and are unable before a certain time to be able to understand the true meaning of life .
How can I claim that I enjoy life while I do n't even know what makes it so important ?
And I suppose the answer to that question can only be given after having experienced a lot of ordeals .

I find it quite funny the fact that the conceptions of life between the two cultures are so unlike .
In my mind , the occidental one is rather superficial and shallow .
It may be due to the fact that Africans ca n't allow themselves to be superficial .
Seeing all that misery surrounding them , how could they ?
It may also come from the fact , Africa is a relatively quite young continent , in which ancesters ' culture is still deeply rooted .
