I agree with the fact than advertisment make products seem much better than they really are .

To begin with , advertisements do n't show real life .
They show a world created around the product they advertise for , where it is vital .
They show a world where everybody is in need of the product , and has no other alternative than using it - they are quite happy with that , by the way .
In the real world , customers have choices , most of them perhaps do n't need the product , they have alternatives .
Furthermore , everything is clean in an ad .
Even in advertisements for hoovers , the dust seems to be just put down there , and goes with one use of the hoover .
This makes the product looks better by comparison with the environment it is presented in : people think if they get the product , their lives will be cleaner and easier .

Then , in an advertisement , everything is presented to attract people .
When a demonstration is needed , as for medications for example , the product acts fast and efficiently .
The demonstration itself is made with colored drawings or animation .
The product of course never crashes down , or is never used in a way where it would n't work as well as in the best conditions .
This also make people think it will be easy to use the product , the effects occuring as fast and effective as a big colored arrow wiping the problem off .

Finally , advertisements are made to make a product look better .
It is their purpose to make people buy it .
And as there are in most of the cases many concurrents , and few really revolutionary products , you have to enhance what is good in a product .
This is not recent .
Just going back to the Middle-Age , heralds were used to sing and tell the capacities and acts of their masters .
They always made them look better than what they really were .
Most religions do as well promise better than what they can be sure to give .
For as long as humans have existed , if one wanted to sell a product , one had to make it look better than what it really was .
It is then normal to suppose modern companies selling modern products just do the same .

To conclude , it is true advertisements make products look better than what they are .
But there are no lies in them , just a little more than truth !
