Learning is a natural process that everybody owns , most of children go to school and start learning very early .
The point is , do they really know what they are doing or do they just learn without understanding ?
We will see what is the most important for a student , learn facts or understand ideas and concepts ?

In my opinion , we can not separate those two parts one from each other .
It is impossible to understand a theory or a process if we do not know the underlying elements ( the facts ) .

I would say that both parts of the statement must be given an equal importance .
It is the basis of the knowledge that to learn facts and use them in various situations ( talks , lectures or projects ) .
Otherwise we would not be able to speak or communicate to each other .
This is our general knowledge .

In the other hand , you learn facts or lessons by heart , it is often not very usefull , because a few days later it is almost impossible to remember everything we learned .
For example , for my A level in France ( Baccalaureat )
I had to learn by heart maps of Europe or USA describing either population or exchanges etc .
The month after I was not able do draw it again because it came out of my mind .
I agree that sometimes it is useless to learn facts .
Precisely in the case if we know we will not practice what we learned anymore .

Regarding understanding of ideas or concepts , this is a very important process for a student .
That is how people acquire a specific state of mind , and with practice things can be understood faster and faster .
The purpose of an idea is to be well understood and this idea has no reason to exists if not so .
Therefore I would give a special importance to the understanding of concepts and ideas too .
