I would love to believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
But it is sad to see in human history that most times we have made the good choices too late .
However two major contemporary problems seem to support this opinion : the huge ammount of air pollution caused by vehicules all around the world and the fact that we are running out of fuel reserves .

Which means that basicly we should stop using our cars as much for the sake of the environment and we are going to have to anyway in the future .
At least in what concerns cars as we know them today .

So the question is : why are n't we changing now the way our vehicules work since we are going to have to do it anyway ?
Why not find today an energy that would keep our cars running but would n't pollute ?

The truth is that modern technology is able to do that - cars that run with electricity or solar panels exist - but the finantial intrest of these massive gas and oil companies seems to come first .
I once heard a sentence that resumes this attitude .
Two oil investors , one says to the other : `` One day with all the money we make from industry we will be able to clean up the environment '' .
But this is simply not true .
At one point it does become too late .

We have to act now so that in twenty years there will be indeed fewer cars that cause pollution .
This transition can be done today with significant changes .
For example , why should every member of a family have a car when one is enough ?
We should all start taking the bus .
