Cars can be directly linked to energy and pollution .
Which means that by using cars , we improve the air pollution .
But it only concerns the actions of the consumer , as far as the producers are concerned , it is more obvious .
This industrial activity is pointed out by every environmental association even if huge firms such as General Motors are concerned .
This pressure is part of the fight for the decrease of the use of cars and of pollutants in general .
Pollution , its effect on Earth , people who fight against the development of car activity and the new means of substition which are created to replace the means of travelling are they not ways to make car disappear .

The natural resources which are used to make a car drive is petrol .
The recent financial event underlines the fact that this product is harder to get and more expensive above all .
It is necessary to find other carburants for example natural oil .
But it is forbidden in a lot of industrialised countries and the need would very important , it is not sure that every car could be provided with this element .
Instead of finding other resources to supply the car chain , it may be interesting to find other ways of travelling .

Moreover these ways already exist .
Bus , Subway , even plane are means of travelling which can be used in a lot of areas .
Some governments tend to develop these collective ways of transport .
In France especially in Paris , for example , they are some days when people are not allowed to use their cars in town .
According to me this kind of action have several impacts .
It reduces pollution in town , but it also make the population aware that there is no need for a car in day to day life .

For all these reasons I think that cars will not completely disappear in twenty years , but there will be different means of travelling and certainly more ecological way of using cars .
