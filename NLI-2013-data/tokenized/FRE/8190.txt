In University , students have both to undestand ideas and concepts and to learn facts .
In my point of view , these two things are totally complementary in a student learning-process .

It is true that , depending on the area of studies , it is sometimes more important for a student to understand ideas and concepts , or in contrary , more important to learn facts .

For example , a student in History will have to learn a lot of facts and dates to be able to talk about a war .
If you do n't know these , you are not able to explain them .
Learning facts happens first , and understanting ideas , after .

Mathematics or even Economics students would rather say that it is more important for them to understand a theory or a concept than learning facts .
If you understand an idea you can thing about it , re-use the idea , or even learn from previous mistakes than have been made in the past .
After that , it could be interesting to learn when a theory has been though or where .

Moreover , if you understand something very well first , then it is easier to remember facts about it .
For instance , when I was in high school , I had lot of difficulties in learning facts and dates in History , especially concerning the Cold War .
After speaking to an older student , I realised that I was n't able to memorize the facts because I did n't understand how it happens and why .
After understanding something , you sometimes remember everything without ever noticing it .

In my opinion , understand and learning are both important for a student .
However , during all the years of studies , students have to learn to think , to take decision , to learn from mistakes , not only in order to find a job , but also in their everyday life .
Because studying is not only being able to learn facts but it is also the development from a child to an adult , I agree that understand ideas and concepts is the more important .
