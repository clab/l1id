The main purpose of advertising and commercials is to sell and increase the profits of a specific company .
In order to maximize their profits , companies are willing to do almost anything , including giving out false information .

For many years , the cigarette was seen as a good product that was n't really harmful but provided social advantages .
Many examples can support the same idea , for example , we see a lot of advartisements today about clothing or beauty products .
In these commercials , models are used to represent beauty and to give an idea of how people should look like .
Unfortunatly , not everyone is as slim and tall as a model and people start thinking that they should be conform to '' the look '' to be socially accepted .
Therefore , advertisments often give wrong ideas to the public by forcing them to act in a certain way .

Because of the competitivity of products on the market , commercials have to make their product seem the best and will often give illusions of being '' magical '' .
This can apply to the cleaning products specially : they make us beleive that they are strong enough to vanish any stain .
According to my personal experience , they do n't really work that way !

Sometimes , advertisements can reach the point of being dangerous , specially when bieng seen by children ; they can have the same effects as violant movies because children ca n't distinguish between reality and fiction and they do n't understand the concept of especial effects .

Eventhough most of the advertisements make products look better than they really do , we ca n't say the same about all the advertisements because some companies are obliged to give away true information or else they will have serious legislative problems .
For example , advertisements for medical treatements and other products that can put people in physical dangers .

In conclusion .
we should n't always trust the media , and we should be verry careful in
