The issue of that it is true young people enjoy life more than older people do is controversial because on the one hand young people generally are more likely to be healthy and have energy , and on the other hands older people in certain conditions have more time and money to dedicate to their hobbies and their relatives .

As far as I am concerned , I believe that older people enjoy life more than young people do , and I will demonstrate why .

During the last decades , in modern countries , life expectancy has increased and generally reaches 75-80 years .
As a consequence , whether we do not consider very olde people who are more than 75 years old , people benefit from 15-20 years after the retire to enjoy life .

In this laps of time , which is more or less long depending on the country and many others criteria as the social and professional backgrounds , old people have the opportunity to do whatever they want to because they have the means .

Indeed , when you are young , even if you feel healthy and handsome , you generally do not have have or earn money to totally enjoy life , excepting very rare and dramatic cases .
Older people do , therefore , they well and truly can do what they want to in our modern and expensive societies , where every litte thing has a price .

Furthermore , older people , when retired , have more time , more friends , their own family .
In addition to this , they have more experience and thus better appreciate what they do .

Nevertheless , I am actually not trying to demonstrate that older people and forcefully and merely more happy .
To enjoy one 's life is very close to experiment happiness but is not sinonymous with .
To illustrate we can say that everybody does not need to enjoy his life to be happy .
As a consequence , I would say that I think older people have more opportunities to be happy because they benefit form both time and money , but conversely it does not mean young people are unhappy .
They just have more things to do , going to work , studying , starting their carreer , and related to this a less confortable situtation .

To conclude I would say that in developed countries old people generally have more opportunities to emjoy they life .
Nonetheless it does not mean that youger people are not happy .
