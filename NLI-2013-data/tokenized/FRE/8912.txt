I am to give my opinion on which is the most important thing for a student between undersanding ideas and learning facts .
First of all it is self evident that those things are both essencial in a student education .

Anyway , as far as i am concerned , i think that understanding ideas will help more a student in his future life .
Indeed , an idea can be usefull in much more areas than a fact and moreover , a student have to understand ideas in order to understand more deeply the impact and the meaning of facts .
A student that have perfectly understood some concept is supposed to be able to use them to interpret the facts .
Moreover some concepts or ideas are so important for our society and the way it is functionning that noone can be part of the society without knowing them because the facts are most of the time based on the ideas .
For example to understand war in general , only events wo n't give you a proper opinion but understanding the basement of it , for instance the concept of the quest for power , will certainly help you .

But on the other hand , being totally disconected with the reallity is not a good point , and a whole theorical learning is n't a good thing for a student because he must be able to use his learnings in the real life , and knowing facts would help him to identify different situations and understand them better .
Indeed , some concepts , like the concept of democracy cannot be proprely understood without the hisorical background of it and it applications in everyday life .
Furthermore , some historical facts are so essencial in our society that we cannot , for instance , understand the current news , without knowing them .

So a perfect learning is supposed to make sudents learn both concepts and facts , in order to be ready for their future life , thanks to a complete leraning , that we are in fact
