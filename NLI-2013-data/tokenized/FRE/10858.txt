Some people say that in order to be successful you must `` try new things and take risks rather than only doing what you already know how to do well '' .
Personnally , I do not agree with this statement .
I am going to give you two reasons why you should do only what you already know so as to be successful .

First let 's define ` success ' .
In my opinion , the ` successful ' characteristic should be given to someone who is good at what he 's doing and even better than others .

In this context , we must admit that the only reason for success is training .
In fact , training leads to success .
But what exactly is training ?
Actually training is all about doing what you already know over and over again .
Let 's take the example of sports .
In every sport , you spend the main part of your time training in order to be successful at the next competition .
Therefore , this is exactly the same idea in everyday 's life business .
Another example is the success of Fordism , back in its time .
Here , people were meant to perform the same task over and over again which lead to an improvement in industry .
Firms which used Fordism are now known to have been successful .

Another idea of the statement is that if you want to be successful , you must take risks .
Actually , this is completely wrong and the reason is simple : if you take no risk , you are less subject to failures .
And knowing that failures are the exact opposite of success , you should take this advice : if you want to succeed , never take risks .
Instead , you can let others taking risks and watch their results .
This way , you will see if it is a safe and efficient way to do the thing .

Finally , success can be achieved using two motos : `` Only do what you already know '' and `` Never take any risk '' .
Look at how sport champions prepare their competitions : they train a lot whithout taking any risk .
Then you will succeed like a real champion .
