Conventional wisdom has it that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they are healthier and they did n't have to many sad experiences yet .
I think that it is ironic since most of people want to live longer .
But it is also true that everybody wants to look younger .

First of all I think that old disabled persons who live with an amount of pills cannot really enjoy their life .
But older persons like my parents who are between forty and fifty years old can enjoy life more than young people .
It can be put down to the fact that they know they have less time than previously .

Teenagers often consider high school period as the worst period of their entire life .
In fact their body and their mentality change and they often suffer from these changes .
They often contest the authority of their parents or their professors .
This is the expression of an unease .
On the contrary to teenagers , adults have had the time to accept themselves and this is crucial to enjoy life .

Children do n't want to become adult because they are reluctant to have too many responsabilities .
They are not aware of the violence and of the other problems that one could encounter , if they are to protected by their parents .
Parents think that their children are happier thanks their protection but on the contrary , children will be more disappointed when they will discover how harsh the life can be .

When one looks in the past , one often thinks '' I was so dumb '' .
I do n't regret this period of my life because I was ignorant and I do n't want to balk now .
I want to go on and make new experiences .

Life is a surprise at almost any age and this is why one can always enjoy life .
