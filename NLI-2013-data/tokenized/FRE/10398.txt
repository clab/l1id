I do agree with the statement saying that successful people are the one who take risks with innovative things instead of what they knew already .
To support my idea , I will first show that innovative things such as innovations and new technologies are factors that encourage success .
Then , I will explain why people doing allways the same things may not be successful .

Innovation is one sector that has evoluated a lot during the last century .
Men are creative , they allways try to invente new tools to help them in their daily life or to allow them to do new things .
It is then easily understandable that through all the main evolutions , such as the industrial revolution , or the internet , people who wanted to take risks had very high potential of being successful .

Per example , the people who were confident that internet will become very important made the good bet .
Today , many of them have been successful and are rich and/or famous .

Then , people doing the same thing continuously are less likely to be successful because they stay focused on existing sectors and activities .
It is evident that if we do n't take any risks , we can not have any potential in success .

As an example , we can talk about a worker in a factory .
Some of them work during more than twenty years in the same position , with the same duties and salary .
Usually these people are n't like this because they are less intelligent than others , but rather because they prefer to have a confortable life with no risk .
But without risk , we can not change and evoluate .

To conclude , we can say that people who invest themselves in things which are related to innovation or new technology are more likely to get successful due to the potential of growth of it .

In the other hand , people who continue doing things they know without looking in other directions and sectors will not be able to be successful .
These are the key factors that make someone successful or not .
