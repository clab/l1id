I agree that successful people try new tthings and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
One thing is good about successful people they already know how to do what they know and succeed with it .
Now , they need to move on to another level and have more experience .
they want also to to come with new project wich can make them more successful .

Successful people should come with more project , make more reseach for their knowledge because the more they know is the more they succeed and it will worth for them too .
It is important for people who a large opportunities to what they know to attract the popularity of success .

In the other hand , people with creativity is a benefit for the world because they always come with new project and they can handle the future easily .
therefore people every body in the wold can count on them , such as the government , health care provider , section of cultural , section of education and commercial .
Wich can make their work easily by comming with new project .

Successful people who try new things and take risks wil be more success ful than other people who affraid to take the risks and try new things ; because they will limited to what they could learn and they could help .
Unfortunately , they wo n't helpfull for people who will need them , and the future will limited also for them and others .
The world will reject them and it will bee waste of time for them .
