Our population is evolving towards induvidualism more and more each day .
What was considered proper and in the line of duty is now considered boaring and out of date .
Children tend to think that spending time to help others , is wasting possible time to take care of themself .
By becoming more selfish we forget to help our community .

Young people do not see what is important in spending time with different people , they rely on themselfs for everything and think others should do the same .
But our society has not changed as fast as they think .
The world still needs help .
For example I used to live in a small village were every decitions were made with our whole community , we would attend meetings and decide on how to resolve each problem with the young and the old .
I went back to this town a few years ago and realised that children were not even attending the reunions .
This shows how much they care .

But on the other hand young people have less time on their sheschull to help others .
With the work load we have at school and the activities we attend , it does not even leave much space for leisure .
So how could we spend time helping out others when we first need to finish everything else .
I spend my time between classes during the day , in the afternoon i have tenis lessons and at night I prepare my self for the tests i have the next day , when could I possibly help others ?

I believe that us , the adults of tomoro are more preoccupied by are own problems then our community , and it is a shame to see this happening .
But at the same time our lives are filled with work and expectations for our futur , that need to be accomplished in the first place for us to go on .
