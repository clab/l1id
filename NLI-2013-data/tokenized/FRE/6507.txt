I agree completely with this statement .
I think there are various arguments to support it .
To begin , the growing number of cars is becoming a problem nowadays .
In some cities , like London , they tried to find a solution to reduce the number of users by asking a fee to drive into the city .
Having so much cars in a confined area brings a lot of problems like pollution , parking problems , accidents without even thinking about the fact that so many cars consume a lot of fluel .
Speaking of , it 's abundance is dropping dangerously , and of course the price is equally expanding .
It 's becoming a luxury to drive now .

Maybe there will be a restriction at some point , that allows each person to drive a certain amount of time in a week .
This could encourage people to drive with friends or colleagues to a work place for example .
Thanks to this , fewer cars will be in use every day !

I 'm actually wondering if certain firms could give money to people who fill up their car to drive to work .
This could even bring people closer together .

If you watch sciencefiction movies , you quickly realise that in most of them , there are not even cars !
The cars have been replaced by some kind of machines flying around .
Perhaps some scientists are currently trying to come up with new ideas to replace cars in a environmental friendly way .

A easier way to reduce the number of cars would also be to expand hugely the different forms of transport like train , bus and subways in a way that cars will become unnecessary .
If people realise that it 's easier , cheaper and faster to go anywhere by train , bus or subway , cars will become useless .
Sadly , this is still not the case nowadays .
Certains areas are to remote to acces them by any other way than by car .
It is still easier and safer as well to ride home with the car in the middle of the night .

Anyway , I 'm curious how the means of transport will evolve during the next years .
