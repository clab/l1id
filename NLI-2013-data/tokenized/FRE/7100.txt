The environmental concerns we know nowadays such as the melt of the ice cap or the thickness of the ozone layer make us wish that there would be less pollution in the future .
This result could be reached thanks to a breakdown in the use of cars , which pollute a lot because of exhaust gases .
However , I do not think that in twenty years the use of cars will be less important because cars bring us a comfort that no other way to travel can equalize .

First of all , cars are very comfortable .
Thanks to them , we can go quite fast wherever we like .
Nowadays , in every country in the world there are concrete roads which enables us to travel by car .
This is a common point of all Earth citizens .

Moreover , it is a private place .
It belongs to you as your flat or house does .
Consequently , you can adapt it to your tastes and make it looks like as you want .
For instance , we can often see cars painted with funny colours or with a lot of sticks on the windows .
You can also decide whether to clean it or not , whether to allow pets to get in , whether to listen to music loudly or not .
On the contrary it is impossible to act this way in public transports like buses .
You have to bear people 's attitude even if you disagree with it .

Finally , I reckon that only environmental concerns can prevent people from using there cars which would have been replaced by eco-friendly buses for example .
However developping countries can not afford and implement such progress .
So , inhabitants of developped countries wo n't agree to give up with the cars comfort while people in developping countries still take advantage of it .

So , to conclude briefly , I think cars will prevail for quite a long time : twenty years is a too short period to make people understand they have to stop using their cars .
