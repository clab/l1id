Our society is a society of value .
I mean people often like us for what we did rather than what we are .
This statement allows people to try new things .
That is why some people think successful people are this kind of people qnd that the other one are those who never take risk .
Cqn we challenge this statement ?
We will see in which way this affirmation is true or false .

When people try new things , it is clear that they are showing their ability to create , to manage and to anticipate .
If they took the right innovative decision , that-is-to say what they decided make them earn money for instance , they are going to be seen as succesful people .
On the contrary , if they made up their mind in the wrong way , they are going to be blamed for , especially because they did not take the usual way .
Acutally , take risk is dangerous and that is what we award when every thing goes right .
Moreover , when a ` right innovative decision ' is taken , because of its creativness , it ; akes earn more money for instance because nobody thinks using it before .
It is in that way that people are considered as successful .
It is also because medias , which play a big part in our society only talk about particular people who , according to them , only succeding because of a revolutionary method , invention or way-of-managing .

On the oher side , we find people who not take risk .
This people take usual desicions do not challenge what they have learned .
Acutally , they know how to do well , and think they do not have to try new thing to do better .
This people can also earn money , maybe without being on TV , but the result is the same .
This behaviour corresponds to more quiet people qnd maybe who are afraid of tomorrow .

To conclude , I think that medias are the reason why people think successful people are those who take risk because they talk a lot of them .
I think people have to bear in mind that even if TV only deals with people who succeed becquse of thir creativness , many who took risk are still in the dark .
