Through an academic training , you usually get broad knowledge of various topic .
But you can also decide to specialize on a subject that you may be keen on studying .
To my mind , i think it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to have a specialization .
You can have an overview of many topics and have a generalist training .
Also , you do n't get bored by such a diversity of subjects .

Firstly , having broad knowledge gives the opportunity to learn things about an unkown subject .
For example , i studied for one year in Grenoble Ecole de Management .
This first year was very generalist and i could learn the basic principles of many subjects .
I studied accounting , finances , marketing .
I reckon that a futur manager must have a knowledge on each of these subjects and master them .
It ' a condition if he wants to succeed .
Thus , i believe having broad knowledge is an opportunity to learn more things .
Above all this diversified knowledge will be useful in the future life .

Secondly , i think that if you study only one specific subject , you can get bored and became fed up with it .
Indeed , having a specialization means studying the same subject for long hours in the same day or week .
Even if it can be a subject you find really attractive and interesting , the fact to focus on it can have negative effects .
The interest can decrease so as the attention paid to the subject .
After long hours spended on the same issue , you enjoy tackling another subject and consequently another interest arises .

Thus , in my opinion i think having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more beneficial .
It allows to have a generalist training and to get the basic principles on subjects , useful for daily life .
Moreover , with such a diversity you are more involved in each subjects and do n't get bored with the training .
