Advertisement is a very important part of business nowaday and the aim is to sell .
If you turn on the television you 're most likely to fall on commercials and this is very specific of the United States .
I do think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Just by the lightening , the way it is shot , food looks systematically better on TV or in picture than in your plate .

There aim being to sell , they are not going to tell you that , in a month , your new vacuum cleaner will be broken or that it will leave dirt on your carpet .
They want to show the best feature of the product and highlight it to the extrem .

The problem is that sometimes commercials lie and that things should be defined and ruled because when you invest money on a product and expect a lot out of it , not because you are demanding but because you have been promised something , you are in your costumer 's right to demand reparation .

It seems like there is no rule in advertisements and that lying has become a common talent but I do think that this type of practice has its dark side .

In fact , anyone can tell when a commercial is over-selling a product to the point where it gets obviously and ridiculously outrageous .
Few poeple are actually fooled by these .
We are aware of it and have come to find it rather funny .
But does this gives a bad image to the company and the product ?
I do think so .
I have a tendency to think that they are not serious with their costumers and therefore I am not interested in buying such a product .

If the first answer to `` do advertisement make products seem much better than they are ? '' was `` yes '' I would give it a second thought and say that the ridicul of most of them totally diminish the work and the money spent on what is suppose to make the product look good .

For me advertisements fail at that by failing at taking poeple serioulsly .
