In my opinion young people nowaday do not give enought time to helping their communities .
Generation after generation people ere more and more selfish .
They think only by and for theirself .
Ecology , seniors and Underpriviledge people are gived up by young people today .

Since the first period of the history , humans has decided to live in community .
But until this time communities has grown more and more and then they had been dislocked .
People has forgotten how and why we lived in common .
The reasons was a better way of life in the best possible environment .

Nowaday , seniors are older and more lonely than before .
However , they are our history and we have a lot to learn from them .
Children should take care of them to learn their own family history and to have enough culture in order to do not the same mistakes done in the past .
For example , in my family without the help of my grand father I never should have known how and why the World War 2 was .
Memory is a way to never do that again .

Underpriviledge people should be helped too .
Anyone could be in the same case during his life so a children must learn : Do what you would like that people should do for you .

Morever , In those day helping community is necessary to go on to live on earth .
The temperatures are higher , the water disapear and a lot of natural ressources too .
Young people must give some times to help their planet and rescue it .
They can clean the beaches or learn to the other people what is bad im their day life for the planet .

In summary , communatory services have a lots of good sides .
to help
