At first sight it appears to be easier for young people to enjoy life .
The context of academic studies , into which most young people are , makes it a lot easier to repeatedly meet new people , and also provides them with a lot of free time .

Everything is yet to be discovered , and a lot of activities are designed for younger people .
Being in a better physical condition during youth allows you to practice sports , even if it is still possible for older people .

ln our society , adult life is mostly devoted to work .
It does not leave a lot of spare time anymore , and often its primary function is just to make a living .
It seems to be harder to find one 's life exciting then .

But enjoying life as an older person is not impossible , it is just more challenging : a good career and an exciting job , or just a happy and united family can give a feeling of acomplishment that it is impossible to have as a young .

Each stage of life thus has advantages and inconvenients , but no one is more enjoyable that another .
The feeling of happiness is only psychological ; there is no age to be an optimistic person , or to have a passion for kittens or anything else .

One should keep in mind that someone 's life is what one does with it ; there are always means to make it more enjoyable .
