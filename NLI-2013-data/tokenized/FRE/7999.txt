The issue of whether is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide is a controversial one .
On the one hand traveling in such way appear safer and well organized .
On the other hand traveling alone without anybody to direct you and exposing yourself to every thing seems to be more exiting and fun .
I agree with the second statement because i am convinced that it can be very pleasant and enjoyable to travel alone .

Those who prefer to travel in a secure group where every thing is done respecting a program have a point .
It 's clear that in those conditions it 's almost impossible to put your self into troubles and experience bad surprises .
However i believe that all the fun of a trip is in discovering things by your own even the most strange .

In additionne is practically impossible to discover for example a country when you travel in a group following a program .
I think it 's better to go alone around the places and meet local people who will help you to discover the place in all aspects by showing you what tour guides often hide .

I have experienced that once by going twice in a foreign country .
The first time i was in a group with a tour guide .
He showed us only what for him was the best aspects of the country .
The second time , i went alone and met local people issued of differents social groups .
They showed me two differents visions of the same country and i had the opportunity to make my own judgement about the country just because i did n't have one way of looking at the country but severals .

In conclusion , i think that it ' s much better to travel without any tour guide and let the place and its population led you .
