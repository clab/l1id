Most of the time , youth is remembered as days of happiness and good memories .
On the contrary , and especially in our times , becoming old is often seen as horrible and everybody tries to stay young with creams and other chemical products .
But do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
I think they do , because only a few people make the right choice when they are young and because we have an illusory vision of youth .

First and foremost , young people have a lot of free time , they are having no reponsabilities .
They are totally free to do what they want , or that what is widely believed .
In fact the large majority of young people is to attend school , obey to their parents and deal with the problem of finding their place in this world .
The difference with older people lies in the fact that they are asked to do almost everything they do as older people choose a job , a wife , a place to live and all the others things .
The time that is still left , once what is demamded is done , is really free : this time is given generously to young people and is precious to older people .
This is when they live like they want , and often so as to be the contrary their parents wanted them to be .

Once people get a job , a wife , an husband , a situation , they forget that they are free , that they can live like they want even if it is not easy .
Actually , freedom is much more dangerous for grown-up than for teenagers : parents are there to help and to rescue in case of emergency and there is little time when the dangers of freedom can be experienced .
The experience of freedom during the youth is faked because the inner feeling of freedom is not balanced by a great dangers .
On the other hand , older people see much more risks in freedom .

People do not learn fro their youth .
