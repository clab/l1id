Many people think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
After weighing the pros and cons , I will argue in favour of this opinion .

First of all , I believe it is necessary to mention the main purpose of an advertisement : it is used to sell a product .
In that way , the advertisement has to be original , that is what I personally think , colorful to involve people to pay attention to it and to the product , and sometimes humouristic .
Today , there are a lot of agencies which create advertisements .
Thanks to the development of computer , the agencies can use new efficient techniques to launch an attractive ad .
But they do not care about the truth ...

Secondly , the message said in the advertisement is also very important .
For instance , agencies try to prove that without this product you can no longer live !
You must absolutely buy it !
They also aim to prove with a well-invented sentence that the product is not expensive when referring to its incredible advantages !
A message that I really hate is the following : `` More white than white '' .
Naturally it is used to describe the effect of a powder .
I can not help thinking that such an ad is a lie .
In this case , the advertisement makes the product much better than it really is ...

I find useful to underline that a great number of `` discount products '' in supermarkets have a very good taste , for instance , and yet have not necessary been the object of an ad .

After closely examining the abose arguments , it is clear that I do not agree with everything created by advertising agencies .
Yes they have to develop a good image of the product , but unfortunately , it goes too far .
I like watching ads on TV or even in the street , but I always be reluctant to buy products whom ad seems to exagerate .
