Everytime you watch a science-fiction movie which is supposed to take place in the 21st century , you ca n't help but notice that all the cars seems to have been replaced by super space-ships , teleportation devices and similar revolutionary things .
But this is the 21st century , and apparently cars are still holding on , even though we sometimes find their presence questionable seeing the global oil crisis and the environmental problems .
Are cars going to become less and less used until they disappear ?
I rather think that the car as we know it is about to go through a major change , which does n't obviously means its end : it just needs to adapt to the world 's new conditions .

First of all , it seems rather clear that in a few years , 50 or so , there wo n't be any oil left for us to extract .
What will we do when our ressources are out ?
It 's going to be a huge problem for cars , because they ca n't work without oil .
Will we have to abandon them for another means of transport , one based on a different carburant ?
Well , maybe we just need to find a way to make cars work with something else .
Actually , the process has already started : more and more cars are built as to work with oil combined with a natural product .
In the future , it may be possible that oil wo n't be needed at all , and therefore we will be able to keep on using as many cars as nowadays .

Still , another problem remains : what about the environment ?
While people buy more and more cars , it has become obvious that the quality of the air in big cities like Bombay or Paris has been increasingly dreadful .
The solution seems to be to forbid the use of car in those cities , and to use instead other means such as the subway .
But wo n't the problem be solved if we find a new carburant for cars , one that does n't pollute the atmosphere ?
Once again , this possibility is already studied by many scientists in the world , and it might come true one day .

As a conclusion , I would then say that there really is a need to change the way cars work if we want to keep using them .
It 's their quality , not their quantity , which has to be modified : they will still exist in 20 years , but maybe under a different form .
