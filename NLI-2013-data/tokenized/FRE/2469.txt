To enjoy life is the aim of the majority of people .
Everybody wants to be happy and not to be closed on one 's problems , but it is quite difficult to be unaware of misery and all the plagues the world coneys .
One 's people life is so precious that everybody is looking for a fullfilled one and therefore there is no age to enjoy life .

Obviously there are differencies between the way of enjoying it for young people and old ones .

First of all , young people are defined by being non-experienced and so it appears as an evidence that they want to live their lives fully ; they are generally opened on everything and interested in all what they see .
Young people are insatiable .
Moreover they have the priviledges of youth and they are allowed to have fun in different ways than old people .
Being aware of their fate , young people try to do whatever they want to in order not to have the impression of having spoilt their strenght 's age .
To enjoy life is not a schedule or a precise thing so everyone trying to do it in one 's own way .

It depends on what we are keen on doing or for example it can be determinated by the money we have .
To that point of view , older people who are generally richer than young people are able to enjoy their lives thanks to the wealth .
But wealth is not a warantee for being happy , especially when it does not sound with health .

We might say that each of us enjoy life in a different way but there is no ageing consideration in happiness and for example a philosophy like the hedonism is one way to reach it and to ejoy life at every ages
