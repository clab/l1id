The three main reasons I will talk about to explain why sucessfull people like taking risks are the fact that they trust themselves , that they like creting something from scratch and that they want to learn more and reach more money .

I would like to analyse successfull people who are people who already had a good experience and who managed to face their challenge successfully .
This is very important because those people know that they are able to handle complex issues .
And this will give you trust and insurance that will help you not to doubt in unknown situations .
See the example of cars manufacturer , you will easily attact a new market if you had been successfull on another one .
For instance , BMW has few doubts about its success by developping its SUV .

Then , there is the fact that people who had been successfull like , according to me , starting from scratch .
This is something very exciting not to see the route you will follow and discovering stape by stape your environment .
You can analyse people who create their own company .
They can choose the kind of products they sell , the way they pay their employees , the way you deal with the customers and so on .
And the most important point : you have no boss and you do not receive any orders thanks to the human size of your project .

Last but not least , people who succeed often know very well their domain ( this is why they succeed ) and this can explain their will to learn more about another field of technology .
For example , a company like Dassault which has made planes launched its own computer aided design software because it was able to afford it .
And when you have been successfull in a field , you often earn lot of money which enable you to invest in new challenge .

So this is , in my opinion , the three main reasons why successfull people like taking risks .
Because they trust themselves , because they know how to do and because they can do it .
