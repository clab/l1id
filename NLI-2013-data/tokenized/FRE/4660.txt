The issue of advertisements may be considered in different ways .
It is often believed that the purpose of advertisements is only to make people aware of the existence of the product .
However it is also true that , in some cases , advertisements make products seem much beautiful or much useful than they are .
Taking all aspects into account , I strongly feel that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

The first reason for my belief is that advertisements always show products in a beautiful environment with people who seems very happy , who do not have daily life problems ...
I think that this fake representation of life make people want their life to look like advertisements and to achieve it ...
they have to buy this new product if they want to have a better life .

Another way to justify my point of view is that making products seem much better than they really are is consubstancial to the purpose of advertisements .
Indeed , the aim is to make people think that they MUST buy this product , as a result advertisements have to convince people that this one is better than all the other one .

Last but not least , I am firmly convinced that the aim of advertisements is not only to make products seem much better than they really are , it is also to brainwash people in order to make them interested only by material things .

All things considered , I would finish by saying that , in my opinion , the result of advertisements are that people just want to buy more and more things in order to lead a more happy life like people they can see in adds but , actually the fact that they have more and more desire make them more unhappy .
