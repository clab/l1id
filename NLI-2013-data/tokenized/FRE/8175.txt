I agree with the statement wich deals with the importance for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Since students chilhood , teachers teach in a way of developing students brains and so their own ideas .
The behavior of teachers is to push students to develop their own analysis about different subject more or less important .
But the aim is to increase some capability to think by themselves and not discuss about a subject only in telling the facts he or she learns before witout any construction in their comment or their way of thinking .

If a student studies scientific subjects for instance , he or she needs to have a certain knowledge that is to say , he or she needs to learn theories and history of the subject .
He or she cannot have a right thinking before learning how to understand ideas and concepts .
A student cannot talk about facts without having a minimum of knowledge .
He or she would be lost .

This example is also available when a student has to comment current events about news on televison .
If news deals with politics and the role of the government or the whole political organization , the student has to understand ideas and concepts of different parties of the government for instance , in order to understand better and to be able to learn more easily the facts of the society and understand why the society react in this way .

If students would be more encouraged to learn facts first of all , it could be a little bit `` dangerous '' for them because their own way of critic could be affected whatever the subject is .

Finally learning is in gerenal more based on knowledge that teachers can give to their students in order to improve and develop their critical analysis .
