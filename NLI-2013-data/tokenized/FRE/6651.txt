The fact to have fewer cars in twenty years than today depends on severals factors .
In fact , some people think that the number of cars in few years will grow up because of people need , other think the contrary , they assert that its must decreases because we will be in need of another type of transportation .
I support the fact in twenty year we will have more cars than what we have todays and that for the following reasons .

Many reasons show that in twenty years the numbers of cars will increase .
The foremost reasons is people want to move , to systisfy that need we have to used cars .
for exemple people will always need to go to market , to travel , to visit and to go to work they need for that the cars .

The second important reason is , population around the woprld is increasind and they need the cars .
for the old people and children the need of the cars will always be important .

The third reason , is people want to live confortably and using cars is confortable .
for exemple when you want to travel with your family to visit someone is necessary to use a cars .

In addition governement build highways for cars that made people have n't fear of traffic jam , they are motived to buy cars .
Finally , peolple use the cars to make business , indeed , it is a big ways to make money nowadays by transporting people in big town .
As conclusion i can say the need of people to move is everyday increasing , we need tha cars for business , to travel , to save time .
All theses reasons show in twenty years the numbers of cars will increase compared to what we have today
