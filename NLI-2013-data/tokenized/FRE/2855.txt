It is usually said that life is short and nobody should waste his time .
I think that it is talking about both young and older people .
However young ones are physically capable of having more enjoying experiences than older ones so does it mean that young people enjoy life more than older people ?
Not really to my mind .

The priorities of both are totally different , for instance young people can enjoy highschool or college and what goes along ( parties , trips , human experiences ) nevertheless older people would actually enjoy having time for themselves or those they love .

If we take a grand mother as an exemple , she mainly worries about her grand children and her children , she enjoys witnessing her grand son growing into a remarkable person .
Older people are more concerned about their own family instead of their own satisfation and that is what makes them happy .
Of course she still takes care of herself and has her own way to entertain herself however it will not be the same as when she was still in highschool , she might want to become gardener or travel all around the world , but her needs are more cultural and family-like than those of young people

Now , if I take a sixteen-years-old boy , it is significally different .
Indeed his first concern is his own satisfaction although he also cares for his family .
Nonetheless he wants to have fun with his friends going out or playing sports .
His needs are personal and simple .
He just have to seize the day without having to worry about his salary or his electricity fees .
He is not responsible yet so he is enjoying life without having the same concerns as an older person .

To conclude with , I would say that both enjoy life as much as they can even though there still are exceptions .
This does not apply only for teenagers and aged people but also for every category of ages .
Eventually , a teenager will grow and change , so will his interests and his way of enjoying life .
