In spite of the general economic developpment of most of the people on the planet allowing more and more citizens to earn their own car , the lack of petroleum could also stop the increasing growth of production of cars worldwide .

Petroleum is not an infinite ressource , and gasoil is made of it .
Everybody knows that there will no longer be available petroleum in fifty years !
This idea conveys a surrounding concern for environmemt , the protection of our planet and the preservation of our energetic ressources .

In order to concretize these ideas , people started already to share cars , as they share flats .
Sharing cars prevents from economic and energetic wasting .
Citizens are encouraged to take public transports such as buses or metropolitan instead of using their cars for short distances .
Scientists also lanched researched to find some ways to replace cars , or at least replace gasoil .

But we cannot deny that the general economic developpment encouraged by liberalism and globalization allows more and more people to own their cars .
In this generalized consumer society , people can easily be lent some money to buy more and more consumer goods , such as cars .
the globalization launched as well an increase in communications all over the world .
Commercial exchanges , and new communication medias such as phones or the Internet seem to be in their golden age .
Humans are developping a new way of living based on flexibility and mobility in which cars are absolutely necessary .

A major Americam research center published a theory about what the world would become in the next decades .
It states that human are unaware of their wasting petroleum , and that they will be unable to prevent the lack of it .
The study predicts the fall of globalization : people will have to save on transport to spare some gasoil , and local marked will dramatically increase .
All economic activities will return to their geographic origin and teare will no longer be delocalisations .

Up to my opinion , I donnot share such a radical point of vue but I agree that people should save on petroleum .
I predict that more and more exchange will use medias .
People will not have to move to meet others or even to work .
People will use the Internet to work at home , organizing meetings with their colleagues .

I think that , besides the decrease in the use of cars in the next two decades , there will be an expand of individuality and a loss of Humanity .
