The advertisement is a way to promote a product with the goal to sell it for the price you gave him .
In this definition is an obvious answer to the subject : advertisements have to make products seem much better than they really are to be efficient .
But today the advertisement is not only focused on the product itself , also on the image of a brand .
Those two are different ways to promote and sell a product , and therefor are different answers of the topic .
both of them will be studied in a paragraph .

The advertisement that promote directly the product is generally a demonstration of its efficiency , its power , etc .
Advertisers are obviously attracted to make the product seems much better than it really is .
It can work if the product is anyway the best of its category or for a certain period of time .
But if the customers discover a controversial `` truth '' about the real capacity of the product , the lie of the advertisement will be a very bad promotion and will result to an image of a firm not capable .
For example , Sony promoted a lot its computers with advertisements that show them very powerful .
Unfortunatly , their batterie was deficient , so Sony has now to call them back to change them .
The image of Sony is now affected by this problem , and moreover because the advertisement lied .

The second type of the advertisement is when the brand only try to give herself an attractive image instead of trying to promote a specific product .
For example , the Coca-cola company does n't promote directly its drinks , but try to give an image that is attractive for the customer .
In this kind of advertisement , there is no need to give a false image of the product because it is only the brand that will attract more customers .

To conclude , I will say that the different ways to promote a product and the problems they each carry show how the topic is too general to be a true statement .
