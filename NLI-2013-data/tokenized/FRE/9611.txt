This statement is quite extreme .
Of course there 's people meant to be inventors like Edison or Da Vinci .
But those great persons were living in another time .
The last century have witnessed a large part of the most brilliant inventions that can be made .
Now we 're living in a reproduction era .
As we can create we upgrade things from the past centuries in order to give them an other utility or aspect .
Make it thinner , stronger , more attractive or affordable but not revolutionnary .

For instance , Cinema was n't invented by one person .
It was a hundred year of effort which gave it its actual shape , which , I think , is far from being the final one .
In its first year people find it absurd and reserved to sideshows but daring director made it a real art .

From Da vinci 's '' camera oscura '' to Lumiere 's cinematographe there 's a whole world of experimentation .
We need this kind of daring person .
How can we know that an object have reached its final shape ?
How can we put frontiers to creation ?
Thirty years ago , it seems unbelievable to imagine having a phone call outside .
Now it 's essential , people ca n't live without cell phone .
That 's the evolution process of creation which is a permanent process .

It 's not given to anyone to succeed in making new things .
It required courage but also lots of imagination and self-confidence .
It 's a huge work on yourself and who you ( think you ) are .
Inventing reliable things occurred once in a lifetime but upgrading is possible .
We need both kind of people to go on evolving .
Some are meant to invent , so to upgrade of transform but both are important for our mankind .
Men ca n't live without creating of he 's giving up the greatest quality he had been given , the quality of dreaming of something else and make this dream come true .
