Travelling can be a good or a bad experience .
Some people rather travel in group with a guide ledding them through attractions because it gives them more out of their trip .
However , I am part of those who prefer to travel on their own .

First of all , travelling with a tour guide do not give you the control of your trip .
When you register for this type of trip , you have to agree that you do not have the choice to go or not at one site or to wake up early or not , because you have to follow the group .
But if you plan your own trip you can decide which activity you will do or if at one point you are tired , you can relax and change your plan because you are the one in control of your schedule .

Secondly , guide does not necessarly like the same thing then you , so you might not enjoy some part of your trip because you have visited places that you did not like or did activity that you did not enjoy .
Travelling by your own , give you the chance to visit only things that you like or want to see , maybe you will end out not seeing as many sites or attractions as with the tour guide , but you might injoy more your trip .

Finnaly , if you are travelling with a guide you cannot go as deep as you would have like in the exploration of a site or a city .
The guide has to follow a schedule , so he or she cannot spend too much time on one particular attraction .
If you are in a group tour and you visit a museum , you might only have one or two hours to complete the tour .
But what if you are a person who likes to spend full days in the museum , you might be dessapointed , rather than on your own , you can decide how long you want to stay at the museum .

Travelling with a tour guide can give a good opportunity to discover multiple places , but it would not be the type of trip I would enjoy due to the fact that I would not be in control of my personnal schedule during the trip .
