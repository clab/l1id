It is a well known fact that in nowadays society , youth is thought to be the best age [ use of young people in advertising , this willingness to appear young , and so on and so far ... ]
However I am convinced that being young is harder than being old and , therefore that older people enjoy life more than we do .

In fact , it is a period of life in which we are worried .
It is well worth mentionning that both in shool orientation and in love we are totally lost .
We are stressed by exams , think that it is too important for our future to fail it , so we have constant pression , relatives are another seamy side of the question , they really want us to succeed in life and want to be pround of us , such a responsability for a young man , or a young woman .

Besides , we do not know ourselves , how can we know if this boy , or this girl is our soul mate ?
Shakespeare said in '' all the world 's a stege '' that a period of life was the lover one ; I deeply agree .
From all this things we understand that being young is close to live in our mind , it stands for a life in which questions are the privailing activity .
We have to build our personnality , to know how to live by our own .

Then , we are like prisonners who can not do what we want to : we do not have enought money to provide for our needs so we have to cumulate both school , and job .
with the issue of finding a good job in our society , most of students have to go through a working experience , and we can not help thinking of the future .
As a consequence we don not enjoy present and turn to what will happened then .

As for me , being older is a source of serenity , we have a job , a family , good friends and are able to keep being healthy with doing some sport .
Travel around the world will be , eventually , a possible thing .

As strange as it can be for a woman of twenty years old , i want to be older soon .
