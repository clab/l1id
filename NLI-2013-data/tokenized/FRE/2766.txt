Humankind lives for the pursuit of happiness as long as it has got rid of what could seem to us a trivial point : the struggle for survival .
Kant affirms that the doxa happiness has nothing in common with what philosophers considered as happiness .
According to the doxa , eg , the common opinion , people have reached happiness when they could enjoy freely life .
To be happy all life long you need to enjoy all life long .
Nonetheless , even this restricted vision of happiness does n't seem easy to reach .
When are we able to freely enjoy in our life ?
Can we say that young people enjoy life more than older people do ?

First we may consider indeed that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
The mantra of youth could be : Life is short , party hard .
They are young , they have many time to spend .
Their behaviour toward life is therefore candide , they have no responsabilities .
They think they are able to do whatever they want , even faults , thanks to the fact that they are young .
So they enjoy life in their way : overdrinking , overdancing ...
No matter , they are inconscious !

Nonetheless , this is a very contemporan phenomenon .
For centuries until the fifties , youngs should work in the very begining of their life .
They were not considered at all as king-child as we do .
Such a statement should have seemed to everybody aukward : the only period of the life one could have been able to enjoy , if not belonging to the high part of society , was the elderly when they had enough money to think to someting else than working .

Nowdays things are different but I do n't think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
They should enjoy life louder but that 's it .
Older people have learned to enjoy life differently , for instance by building a family or taking care of it , by enjoying every single moment of what we could call happiness .
