From birth to death , life is a precious thing that we should enjoy everydays .
Older people have probably more things to enjoy life such as time , money and experience but i think that young people have more opportunities to do so .
These oportunities are for the most important , the youth of their body which can allow them of more activities and the lack of responsabilities .

First , most of young people 's body are in shape .
Their muscles and tissues are tight and they have a good breathing .
This fact allow them to enjoy outside and inside activities or different sports like tennis , soccer or football who requires a good breathing , muscles in shape and a good endurance .
An other example would be the practice of extreme and sometimes dangerous sports such as snowboarding or skyflying , parachute , a young person is more able to do it than an old person who can be scared to break something .
All these activities are fun and make you spend a great time , especially with a group of friends .
An other significant example is the sexually life in a couple .
I know this matter can be difficult to talk about for some people but i think that it 's still part of enjoying life , especially if you love your partner .
A young person is sexually more active than an old one and it is also part of enjoying life to have a good sexual life .
Being in shape

Secondly , the young people do n't usually have any responsabilities such as children , spouse or important job .
They are free of their movement and can live their life as they intend to before they get stuck in a stable situation , when it will be almost impossible to do so .

in that case , they are free to enjoy life in the fullest .
For example , travelling is a good way to have a great time and learn about different countries and cultures .
Of course an old person can still travel but they wo n't have the same dynamisn if they are really old or the same freedom if they have a family behind them .
For instance , a child can stop you in doing adult activities .

To conclude , i think that life is much more enjoyable when you are young for a lot of reasons such as the body 's ability , the freedom , friendship and parties .
So young people should n't lost time and enjoy life while they can before becoming adults .
