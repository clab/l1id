Less than 100 years ago , people could only expect to live up to 40 or 50 years of age , or even less .
But today , many elders reache 100 years or over .
Researchers show that life expectancy increases continuously .
Older people live older and many scientist believe it is a direct response to how they enjoy life .
Personnaly , I strongly support the fact that older people have a full life that is equal to the yonger people , and for many reasons .
Mainly , the improvement of infrastructure in society help older people to participate in many activites .
As well , the adaptation of these activities to the elderly increases their participation .

More people of old age composes the society of today .
This clearly emphasies the need for activities specifically targeted at older people .
But how can they participate if they cannot attend them .
City counsil are modifying their infrastructures to address this .
They created bus services for them and provided them with people to accompany them in their activites .
It resulted in an increase of participation , and elderly people like it .
This certainly shows that they can enjoy life as much as other age groups do .
But these activites also need adaptation .

Initially , the type of activities available tended to be more focused on the yonger crowds , and this for many reasons .
Yonger people were more `` seen '' around the city and were definitely more active .
These two features created the illusion that they enjoy more life .
But older people can also enjoy activities and it has an important impact on their longevity .
The increase of life expectancy is a clear example of it .
The city created activities just for the elderly , such as dances and dinner where they can meet together , share their memories , and enjoy themselves .
These new meetings definitely provided more reasons to life better and fuller for them .

To prove the point further , societies have also introduced programs of activities where both young and old people can participate together .
I participated in a program in my city where I accompanied one or two elders to shows or activites specialy designed for them .
I immensly enjoyed when they share their experience with me .
It help me understand life better and enjoy my life .
I bring them a flavor of youth that make them forget other problems they are facing .
So we both enjoy life together .

To conlude , I believe that any people , no matter their age , can enjoy life to its fulless .
To do so , societies need to provide adapted activites to the different age groups .
This can be done by modifying the infrastructures and creating specific activies .
Young people as well as older people will benefit from it equally , and will even participate together and help each other to improve their way of life .
