In the course of they studies , people are often confronted to a dilemma : should they focus on a single subject or study a broad variety of topics ?
Let me examine arguments in supports of the two options , and finally I 'll explain why an intermediate answer is needed .

In the harsh competion of modern world , finding a job often requires a high level of knowledges and performance , which can be achieved only by focusing on a speciality .
I also personnally ca n't help covering a subject in its totallity whwn I have begun to study it , else I fell frustated I had better not to start !

However , although being highly specialized and knowing little aside can ensure you a good job and intellectuall fullfillment , it can be very disturbing in your social life .
Imagine you meet someone specialized in engineering while you are spezialized in music , there can be no conversation between both of you !
The range of people you are likely to meet anf appreciate would be very short ...
And even regarding jobs , let 's think a bit further : to the extend a company uses to develop its products various fields , its technitians must know enough about the others speciality in order to work together .
For example , if a telescope manufacturer 's opticians are unable to communicate with the mechanists to share their needs and constraints , the company will never be able to manufacture any instrument .

That 's why I think we ca n't really give a sharp answer to the question .
We need to be specialized for certain things as job and academic career , but an enjoyable everyday life requires that everybody knows a little about everything .
In can be extremely important , have a look for example at the nuclear debate : here are some decisions to be taken that ca n't be left to specialists only , as every person is higly concerned .

There are several ways between the two extrem positions , and people sould be allowed to choose the specialization grade that suits them .
