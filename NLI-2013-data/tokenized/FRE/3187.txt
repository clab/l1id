A good education is important to help young people having numerous values such as generosity and solidarity .
These kind of things will help them to be more responsible in the society they will grow .
Nowadays , behavior of young people is different than before .
They do n't give no more time to helping others and the take part in the society .

Fistly , the new generation hasn ' t know the same kind of life than before .
In the past , young people had lived in the poverty of the war or somthing like that .
There were also much diseases and less person in good health than now .
So , the new generation is more lucky and happy in a modern society .
The new generation have new kind of activities which is explain by the fact that the society is being more rich .
I agree that young people do n't use their free-time in helping others .
A teenager is more selfish than before because he is only interested in his hapiness such as playing sport or going shopping .
I guess that he has not the desire to help people and be generous .
I believe that I could be better if each person would give his money in associations for cancer or others diseases .

However , some young people are more responsible than others .
They act more like an adult and they understand how the life cabn be difficult for other people who live in poverty .
They are less selfish and are more interested in helping children .
They can visit them in an hospital to give them gifts .

Finally , the main point is that it depends of the kind of people and culture .
It is also a result of a bad education .
