Stuying is a complex process that requires methodology .
On what should focus the students ?
Should they attempt to understand the more important concepts and ideas or should they try to accumulate as much knowledge in facts as they can ?
Understanding ideas and concepts is enabling students to think in a certain way that is primordial for their success .
Then , this large knowledge can be applied in different situations more specifically .
Moreover understanding concepts and ideas is making it much easier for the students to learn related facts .

Understanding ideas and concepts is building a way of thing , a process of anlysis , that are required in order to understand deeply the studies .
For example , when lerning a basket ball , it is very important to undersand that the most important defense rather than attack when the adversor is strong .
If the students players understand this idea , they will then be able to understand why they have to learn how to defense in certain situations .

Understanding concepts gives knowledge that can be applied in specific situations .
For instance , learning programming is complex .
But , if you can have a large understanding of the logic of this science and the definitions , you can then apply it to any laguages like C or Java .

Finally , these are the concepts and ideas that enable the students to learn facts .
It is very difficult to learn something by heart without understang the main ideas the surround them .
For example , it is hard to learn a fact in the actuality , without being enable to understand the concept behind .

Learning concept and ideas is definitly the most important thing the students should focus on .
