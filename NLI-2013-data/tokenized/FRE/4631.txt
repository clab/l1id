Nowadays , advertissement is one of the most used mean to communicate on a product .
Indeed , especially in the industrialized countries , we can find advertissement on billboards in the street or on the television .
The actual problem is to measure the efficiency of theses advertissements .
Advertissements are so much used that people do not know if they can trust them especially when it is an advertissement for a very competitive product .
In my opinion , advertissement is useful to launch a product .
However I do not think it is really useful to demonstrate the efficiency of a product .
If we take the example of the cosmetic industry , there are lots of advertising for anti-rinking cream , or special shampoos which create a `` magic effect '' .
I am not sure it really worth it because when we buy the products we are often deceiving .

I can bring up another example : I recently bought a shampoo to detangle my hair .
When I tried it , it did not work .
I think these products advertissement are forced to make the customer dream even if the advertising is not really true .

In an other hand , I think that all advertissements are not always deceiving .
It depends to the product the person wants to buy .
I think about an advertissement for a car for example .
When , a person wants to buy a car , he can trust the advertissement because the car will effectively have a new shape for example .

In my opinion , the advertisements make not always products seem much better than they really are when the advertisement is based on a basic element of the product such as the shape of the car for example .
However , when it is based on a superficial elements , we can say that they do not always tell the truth .

If we keep the example of the car , there are advertisements
