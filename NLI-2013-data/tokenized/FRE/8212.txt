In my country , the educational system both teaches you to understand ideas and concepts and to learn facts .
These two concepts have their own advantages .
However , I believe it is more important to understand ideas and concepts .
That is why I agree with the statement .

First , l think that learning facts is not a clever method to follow because it does not lead to create intelectual stimulation .
Indeed , even if I agree to say that it could be a nice way to strike students by giving funny or odd examples , the thing is that you cannot simply remember all the facts you are supposed to learn .
For example , during my history classes in College , I had to remember long lists of events and facts without connections between them .
This was so dense and unclever that I did not remember half of them !

On the contrary , understanding ideas and concepts is more useful .
First , by understanding them you will be able to implement them in the future , contrary to the facts or events which you cannot obviously re create .
Second , school is supposed to prepare you for your professional life .
So if you understand the ideas and concepts , you will understand how does it works and will be able to deal efficiently with challenges .
For instance , I attended some economics courses .
Thanks to my understnading of some key concepts , I now better understand how does the world works , and especially the political system .

Thus , because students are supposed to face the professional life with the most numerous keys possible in order to deal with it successfully , I strongly think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than simply learn by heart facts and events .
