Yes , I do think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
After all , it is one objective of publicity and I think it is well achieved , especially nowadays .

Today , there are ads everywhere you look .
On Internet , on the streets , in the metro , on tv and even in public washroom .
Big companies have the power to buy a lot of publicity spaces and by placing their advertissements everywhere it can definitively makes you think that their product is better then it actually .
This can make you think that a certain product is the new trend .
It is everywhere so why not in your home .
Many reality tv shows use such an approach .
They talk about it during the news , the ads are everywhere , you can chat we the `` stars '' , you can support your favorite star ...
but the show is usually not that great .

Also , a lot of advertisements feature stars .
Most Nike products refer to a professional athlete for example .
They want you to think that if you are wearing the new Jumpman basketball shoes , you might be as good as Micheal Jordan .
People do not think that they will be as good as the stars of course , but at least they will be equip just like they are .
But having a product related to a star does not tell anything about its quality .

There is also a huge focus made in publicity on the fact that a certain product is new .
Most people think that a new product or a new technology is always better than the previous one while this is not true .
Just think about the ski market .
Each year a new type of ski is released : parabolic ski , mini ski and on top of that , they are designed with new materials .
This impression of new makes the product look better than the previous one while many scientific research often prove the contrary .

Because advertissements are everywhere , it features stars and focus on new , I think it looks better than it
