There is a well known idea stating that young people enjoy life better than older people do .
We are going to show that , in a sense , it is true since one cannot deny that the craziest things and most thrilling decisions we make happen when we are young .
Then we will proove that older people enjoy life as much as younger people do , but simply in a different way .

When we are young , we think about our lives as exiting , or at least as more attractive as the ones of older people .
We travel more ( it is easier for us to travel ) , and experience lots of things .
For instance , I spent last year in Wales , and I think that it would not have been possible if I had been thirty or forty years old , with a husband , children , and a house .
This was a unique experience , and I really enjoyed it .
My young age enabled me to live it .

However , my firm belief is that older people enjoy life as much as we do , but in a different way .
Of course , when people get older , they have more and more responsabilities , and it becomes harder for them to free themselve , to spare time for their leisure if they are working , and , if they are retired , they probably do not wish to enjoy life in the same way as young people do .
They may appreciate a great deal to play with their grand children , or enjoy to play cards , for instance .
Moreover , and in my opimion , old people can actually have a definitely exiting life , and enjoy it entirely .
By the same token , I know older people who travel , cross continents , and appear to lead a life even happier and fuller than young people are supposed to do .

To conclude , we may say that the statement considering that young people enjoy life more than older people do cannot be taken for granted .
As far as I know , one can be young and lead a rather boring life , as well as one can be retired and lead an exiting life .
It all depends on each individual 's character and state of mind .
Stereotypes rarely happen to be true ... !
