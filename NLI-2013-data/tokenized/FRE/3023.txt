Young and old people have different way of living .
Yet they both enjoy life .
On the first hand I will see why it is often said that young people enjoy life more than older people .
On the other hand I will show that the statement is not always true .

First , young people are more ealthy and it easier for them to have a lot of activities .
For example , students are more likely to hang out at night and wake up early in the morning .
Yet , it is their way of enjoying life .

Then , student life such as living on campus helps partying , having meetings and doing sport .
Young people enjoy life more than olders because they are always discovering things for example they learn new things every day in class .

Finally , young people are not as conscious of the dangers as older people and so they just live without taking care of the troubles they may meet .
For an example we always say that children are innocent because they just live their life by playing , eating and sleeping .
We could go as far as to say that they enjoy more life because they have less troubles than older people who still enjoy life but differently .

First , we must bear in mind that enjoying life is an important part of our intellecutal development and that we need to be happy in order to live well .
Older people have different activities , they may prefer staying at home reading a book instead of hanging out with friends .
That do not mean that they enjoy life less than young people .

Then , if older people seem to be more calm amd to enjoy less life than young people it is probably because they have already been young , and everything youth are doing now they have done it a long time ago !

Actually , adults who have to take care of a familly may have less time to enjoy their life in the same way that they did before but that does not mean that they do not enjoy life , because familly life for them may be more enjoyable than student life .

To conclude , as far as I am concerned I would say that people enjoy their life differently wether they are young or old but they still enjoy their life .
To my mind only a person is able to say if he is enjoying is life or not , and it is difficult to compare because it depends on everyones taste .
