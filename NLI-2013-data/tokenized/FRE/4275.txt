Today , we usually heard that young people are not interesting in helping their communities .
I think that young people have a different vision of that .
They help their communities , but in a different way than ten years ago .

First , the structure of a family has changed .
There are more divorces , parents and children can live kilometers far away from each other etc .
I think this could explain why young people feel less concerned about old people for example .
But we can see some experiences in France to reduce the gap between old persons and children .
Some schools have organised meeting , every week , where each child has a grandfather or a grandmother for the meeting .
They play and make activities together .
It is an interesting experience for children because lots of them have lost their grand parents or live far away from them .
Moreover , they learn to care for old people .

In addition , youg people have different behaviours because they have different educations .
If the parents teach their children to help other people , I think they would follow this lesson later .
If they see parents helping a neighbour or someome of the family for example .

Another point is that the current society and parents ask a lot from young people .
There is a lot of competition between parents because they want to show that their children are `` better '' than others in school , sport , music , etc .
This mean that children have lots of activites during the week and the week end so they have less time to spend for their communities .

Finally , I think that young people help their communities but they could give more time for it .
Parents have to teach children that family and community are important and that they have to take care of each other .
