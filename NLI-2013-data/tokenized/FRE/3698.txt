In our current society , it is thought that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .

First , I would disagree with this statement because there are so many humanitarian organizations and associations that high school and college students are involved in during their course of study .

For example , in academic institutions , there are associations runned by young people who focuse on helping handicapped students feel more at ease and equal in class .
The services proposed are various : support during courses by working in teams and preparing collective projects or suggesting gatherings and pick nicks after class in order to meet .

Moreover , there are so many young people serving and helping poor countries to develop their education and health measures nation wide and internationally .
The Red Cross , the United Nations , the World Bank , for example , focuse their work on helping people .
For their missions , these organizations send each year thousands of young people and young graduates from developped countries to acquire work experience but mostly to share their own knowledge by making the poor and needing people who live in much further communities taste a better and happier life .

On the contrary , the statement can be partly true because some young people grow in a more selfish way nowadays .
They are brought up to be spoiled and learn to take more than to give , and that increases personal pride and self satisfaction .

Some progress and new technologies , such as mass consumption or just sating at home and playing video games , have bad influence on young people .
Consequently , they build anger , hate and jealousy between each other .

Another factor among young people is laziness and lack of responsability .

In conclusion , this statement must be debated and it cannot just reflect the one and only vision of the world .
A lot of people work hard to help improve their communities , even for free , and will try to travel in order to share the ideas they have already implemented in their commnutiy .
