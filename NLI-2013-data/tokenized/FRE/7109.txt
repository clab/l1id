Cars are the symbol of the access to a better life for a lot of people because they have the felling to be free to go everywhere they want .
However , car has no future 's life in front of all the new technologies in communication ans interaction .
That is why I am convienced that there will be fewers cars in twenty years .

My first reason to belive this is that , in twenty years cars wil representate too many disagreements .
For example , today , a lot of streets of big towns like New York or London are really overcrowded .
The streets are becoming too little for all theses cars .
For instance , it is more difficult to go outside Paris , in the subburbs , than take the plane ans go very far from France .
In twenty years , I think all big cities will be like London .
Actually in London , you cannot enter in the city without pay a right for entrance .
This solution express that people really want to reduce the numbers of cars into big cities .
In addition , that is why every big cities develop the buses or the subway , which is really more confortable for people who have to across the town everyday to go to work .
As far as I am concerned , I prefer take the subway because I do my travel in less time than if I need to take the car .
In my opinion , this solution to develop in big cities subway or buses wil be developed as far there will have no more cars in cities .

Furthermore , I think that we must take into consideration the developement in twenty years of new technologies .
First of all , we realize today , and more in twenty years , how the pollution is damagable for the environement .
And cars are one of the main reasons to explain this pollution .
That is why we really want to promote some way to travel which respect more our planet .
In twenty years , I am convinced that we will have new way to travel , faster and with less pollution .
For instance , in some little towns like Bordeaux ( in the south of France ) , there is the tramway , which allow people to across the town without breath the cars'pollution .
I think that is a really good experimentation .
Morevoer , in twenty years , we use more and more planes .
Indeed , planes are becoming less ans less expensive and I hope than in these time , all peopkle can afford it .
That is why I argue that in few years , all people use traway or subway to across their city and use planes to across some countries .

Tu summaruze my point of vue , I am really convinced and I hope also that there will be fewer cars in use than today .
In few years , we have a lot of new way to travel , without wasting all this time in our cars and , by the same way , we have the opportunity to save our earth .
