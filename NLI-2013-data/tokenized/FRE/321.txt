Everyone wants to be successful , in our personal or professional life .
This is a level showing your qualities , and this can show as well your wish to progress in your life .

As an example , if a working person wants to progress in his working life , he has to show his motivation by trying new things such as giving innovative ideas or spending more time on projects .
This will prove to his manager that he is concerned by his work and by the company itself .
He can reach to a better job by this way , being promoted and earning more money .

On the other hand , if this working person stays quiet , does not try new things , this means that he does not want to take risks .
And sometimes , this can be a security for him , he can keep his job and he will be sure that he will be paid at the end of the month .
Indeed , if this one has a family , he has to be able to buy all his family needs .
Maybe he will find a routine in his everyday life , but he will be secured that his family will have what they want .

In my opinion , I think that we have to progress in our life .
And if this means that we have to take risks , or to try new things , most of people should do this .
For example , if I have a report to do in group , I will suggest all the time new ideas , even if these are not relevant , but at least , I would have tried .
I know this can be boring for other team-mates , but by this way , the report can progress , and this could be a success if everyone tried this .

Successful people are not rare , they are part of our everyday life and they allow some works to be done in time , and with ideas of quality .
