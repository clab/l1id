Marketers are facing an increasing competition .
As they do not want to see their market share decrease , they need to find more effective ways to sell their products .
That is why I really think that marketers develop techniques to make their products seem much better than they are .
I have noticed several of these techniques in various markets .

First , most of the products are shown in a nice environment that has nothing to do with them .
For example , most advertisements for clothes show a model in a nice place like a beach or a nice restaurant .
The overall impression is very good even if the product is not great .

Second , photography technologies enable the product to look better .
For example , small objects are shot closely in order to make it appear much bigger .
I have noticed that it is a common practice for people that are selling rings with diamonts .

Another way to embelish a product is to add creative copy to a product image .
Some advertisements are misleading the consumer .
They give partial information .
I often see advertisements for computer batteries .
Most of the time , the lifetime of the battery is not really communicated .
Instead , the copy says ` Long Lifetime ' .
It could be two years or six months .

In conclusion , I think that advertisers are using techniques that are often misleading .
It is very important to look precisely at an advertisement in order to get a real sense of what the product really is .
