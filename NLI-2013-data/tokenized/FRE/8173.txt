On the one hand , I cannot but agree with this statement .
Indeed , according to me , learning facts and being capable of remembering them all does not prove that a student is clever .
It is only a memory exercise , a kind of training for one 's brain .
Students are not dictionaries , and I think we do not have to learn stupidly series of facts .

On the contrary , showing that you have understood the key concepts of a lecture is a real active process .
It shows that you have assimilated the lecture and it is the most important thing for a professor in my opinion What is more , learning facts is very boring and repetitive to me .
It is something unpleasant I have the impression to do only in order to get a good grade .
And most of the time , if this learning is passive , we forget almost everything on the day after the test .
That is why to a certain extent I dislike History courses : there is too much facts to learn .
I prefer reflection about History with concepts and ideas as tools .

Unfortunately , we have to admit that some fields of study like History require to learn facts by heart .
That is why , on the other hand , learning facts is an unescapable step for students , especially freshmen .
In many fields of study , knowing a minimum of facts by heart is an obligatory background for larger studies and reflection .

Obviously , we cannot seriously deal with specific subjects without that very background .
To a certain extent , the facts learnt are the matter and the ideas and concepts are the tools .
The two work together and it is up to the student to take the most of them .

As a conclusion , even if learning facts is something very unpleasant for most of the students , we have to admit it is an obligatory step .
We need a minimum of matter to go further in what we are interested in and to develop a personal reflection on subjects .
Maybe we could develop new ways of learning facts which could be less boring , more attractive and that students could enjoy such as active discussions with professors , with specialists ...
we could sometimes leave our books aside .
