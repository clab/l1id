Everybody has learnt from people in school , at home , concepts and ideas which we have to learn , and wee could call that education .
But , in a life in general , each is confronted to different scenarii , situation , people , which impact behaviour or vision of life .
That 's why i will try to express my opinion linking both of argument and showing importance of each .

First , let 's talk about ideas and concepts , which are essential for student in order to have key elements and after to use them to make their personal opinion .
I think learning the basis such as respect people , the law , history , are key ressources for the student , since they want to have in their possession the key values which allow them to advance in the society and to judge it by theirself .
Today , all the children should be able to follow a training dealing with ideas and main concepts , in order to have a perfect equality between young people , and so starting from the same point in the society , I mean the same potential .
After , we could be afraid by this , assuming that everybody would understand ideas and concepts in the same ways , and so follow the same route of life , But at this point , my opinion is that learning facts remain essential for student .

Then , concerning learning facts , for my part I consider this point more essential than understanding ideas and concepts .
Indeed , what is making people different and more openminded ?
I answer experience !
I consider facts as example of life , things that appenned , from what we can really learn something concrete and acting further , considering what happenned before and what we learnt from that !
The best example for that point would be for me the wars .
Indeed , living in the 21st century , we are obviously afraid by wars and we really want to avoid it for ever .
This is based on what we learnt at school and from our grand parents , so from facts .
This is an example of what we can learn by experience , and hence what we do n't want to see anymore .
This was a sad example , but we could talk about facts that we want to recover or do another time .
This would the fact from every kind of pleasure or peace in the world .

To conclude , I give importance to both points of view , becaude ideas and concept are essential to start life well , but the facts will remain the best thing we can learn because the experience will always be the most important ressource for each !
