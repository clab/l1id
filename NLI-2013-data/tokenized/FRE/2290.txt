I do agree with the following statement .
I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I have several reasons to share : First of all , young people have usually much more energy than older people .
For exemple , young people can go do all kind of sports like skydiving , scubadiving , dancing , and a lot of other sports , without really think about the heart or bones problems .

Second , yound people still have to live many years and experience many different things .
A teenage wants to become independant and go to travel all around the world to make his own experiences , but older people are often already set with husband or wife , and with children , and prefer to relax at home during the week-end .

Third , yound people have much more free mind than older people .
Young people from today in France for example , live a life with a lot of comfort and do n't worry much about wars or hunger , but some grand-parents experienced the war and remember the difficulties of this time .
Some have resentments against Germans for example , but young people live all together in peace Germans , Spanish people and all because they did n't live the war .

Fourth , young people can experience much more things with the evolution of the science .
There are many innovations today that young people can use for their everyday life , that older people did n't have at their youth time .
Like the MP3 that can carry many songs and most of the young people use it .

To conclude , i think it 's normal that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Everybody is young one day , and become old an other day .
