At the turn of the century , there was a common view that there would be fewer cars in use in a quarter of a century time , which is in twenty years from now .
And I still today do not share that view .
But , why should the public think the number of cars should decrease over the years is the question I will answer so as to justify my disagreeing with the above statement .

Let me first evoke the several grounds people resort to when argueing for a prospective slump in the numbers of cars on the streets .
Increasing concern for the environment coupled with the skyrocketing oil prices seem to push for a general decrease in car onwership .
From where I stand , the necessary adjusments will be made so that car ownership stays stable or in the increase , because we should not forget that the survival of a whole industrial branch - the automobile industry - is here at stake , and this sector is ready to adapt to new trends and new requirements from the general public .

First , research & development is a field where massive investment currently takes place .
Auto makers would not develop such extensive research with no prospects for future sales and no return on investment ( ROI ) .
For example , Toyota is investing a lot so as to come up with ever more ecologically-friendly vehicles .
Plants and labs in India have already combined efforts and launched the Toyota Prius , a city car that pride itself in being eco-friendly .
This is direclty targeted at the market which is conscious about the enviromnent , the eco-friendly share of the population , which cares for ethics and is scrupulous about social responsibility .

Second , the lack of time and parking space have been two major factors for the redirecting of car owners onto public transportation and bicycles , moppeds etc .
But public transportation has its disadvantages ( overcrowded ) , so do bicycles and motorcycles ( hazardous on slippery roads , frequent accidents , uneasy in winter conditions ) .
Therefore , auto makers have tried to answer that growing need for small cars that enable you to virtually park on any parking spots at almost any time .
To support that point , the Smart car by Mercedes , provides its drivers with the opportunity of parking horizontally to the curve , where no regular size vehicles normally could .

Last but not least , the increase in the cost of running a vehicle .
Since 9/11 , the price of the oil barrel has increased three-fold .
This means that filling your tank has become a burden on family budget and could turn out to make people refrain from using their car .
To counter that factor , innovative solutions are found : Brasilians now run their can on sugar cane and sunflower oil .
Resorting to methanol has been a solution studied by German automakers .
It would drastically reduce the cost .
Hybrid cars with their fuel-efficiency have started to penetrate the market and seduce the expense-sensible families .

In the end , it is easy to witness how the market is currently trying to adapt itself to changing trends and growing concerns that may threaten the auto market .
By successfully adaptating itself today , the automobile industry is securing its future .
