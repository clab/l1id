Firstly , I thing that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects may be , culturally speaking , really interesting but that it can also lead to a confused professional guide line in the future .
Therefore , the first objective that each student should have will be , to my point of view , to find out what they will be in ten years in order to have a clear objective during all their studies .
Even tough , it is , obviously , really hard to now at 18 years old what you will be in the future , I profundly believe that the question should be raised carefully in order to create the student motivation .

Moreover , I do believe that at one stage or another we have to find out what we really want to do and then , in order to achieve , this objective to specialize ourselves .
To take a simple example , at the end of my bachelor degree in foreign language I did realize that this section was not diversify enough , so I decided to change for another direction : international commerce .
My point , is that it is important to focus on a specific guide line but without being too specific .

Nevertheless , being stuck in a specific subject can be prove to be a handicaped for the search of a job latter on .
In fact , for some subjects a specification can put the student in a very difficult position , for example we all know that nowadays some departments or branches or no longer relevant or cannot be provided any more .
Students that are specialized in these subjects will therefore have problems to find a job at the en d of their studies and they will probably have to pass another university diploma to get a more general degree in order to find a job .
