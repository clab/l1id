Tycoons are famous examples of persons who embody success .
However , people might become successful because they took some risks and achieved something new , whereas others are successful in repeating perfectly something already existing .
I think that success is bound with innovation and that doing something already known is less impressive .

In science or technology , many scientists became successful because they discovered or invented something new .
Indeed , taking risks is similar to not following a commonplace guidance .
For Bill Gates found success in creating the first computers .
Another example is Alfred Nobel , who took huge physical risks in order to secure and then product dynamite .
Successful people are visionaries .
In art , innovation often benefits inventing artists .
Howard Hugues , an american tycoon , became famous because he dared to shot the most expensive movie ever made , and he broke many records in airplane history .

On the other hand , taking risks is not always followed by personnal success .
Success only happens when a majority of people acknowledge that someone did something outstanding .
For example , Nicolas Copernic asserted that the Earth was moving around the Sun , and not the other way round .
Even if he was right he did not became successful because no one at that time could believe that theory .
Howard Hugues , though he had great ideas will remain in memories because he failed to output its project of a giant plane .
