Over the last decades education has played an increasing role in people 's lives .
Indeed as long as education influences the future job one will have and , which will itself influence the social class one will belong to .
Therefore people are more and more concerned by the studies they will make .
One the one hand some hesitate to specialize in one specefic subject whereas other think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academics .
We will tackle this subject by seeing what would be the advantages and the drawbacks of having a broad knowledge and the specializing in one subject .

First of all let 's deal with the advantages and the drazbacks of a broad knowledge .
Broad knowledge of many academics enables one to have a good general knowledge .
Indeed people are able to tackle about with a variety if topics , they do not have to cling to a specific topic whereas people who who specialize in one specific subject .
On the other hand it can be dangerous sometimes to have a broad knowledge for people might know a lot of things but only superficial things .
therefore they may have studied many academics but in the end they only have scarcely notions on them .
And it is in that way that one can say that broad knowledge of many academics can sometimes be pointless .

nevertheless the same issues occur for the specializing in one specefic subject .
indeed studing one specific topic can seem pointless for one will only be good in one thing .
but sometimes it is better to master a topic than nothing at all as e noticed previously .
