To answer this question , i will organize in two parts .
The first part will explain who i think young people enjoy life more than older people , and ( even if i 'm not so old ) the second part will explain how i think older people can appreciate life more than youngers .

We all remember the first time , the first time we made love , the first time we went to highschool , the first time we smoked a cigarette .
I think this is one of the reasons we might say younger can appreciate life in a more intensive way than the olders , just because everything they do is knew .
Teenage is the period where you hqve lots of experiences , it 's an adventure , you discover all the time .
I remember my teenage .
It was kind of amazing and i think i would never be able to experience the same feelings i 've experienced during this period .
i was always going to partys , when i was 15 me and my freind would go to night club and everything has a important impact on me because it was knew .
An other argument is that young people have no reponsability : they do n't have money problems , or job problems or even children problem , there parents take care of everything so they do n't have to worry about all those things that makes life difficult .

But in contradiction with all that i said before , i would point that maybe older people are able to enjoy life in a better way .
adults have a larger experience witch gives them a knoweledge young people do n't have .
Having this experience they can appreciate things young people woud n't even care about .
It 's hard for me to give exemples because i do n't consider myself as an complete adult .
But maybe adult can enjoy very infime things like a good glass of an old wiskey for exemple .
One day a professor told me : the more you know , the more you like .
I think old people , as they know more about life , can enjoy it even more .

On more point is that young people do n't have the time to establish important projects .
What is life about after all ?
i think life is about being happy and making such as wonderfull things as children .
Adults have the oppurunity to live this kind of wonderfull projects .
They have the opportunity to make plans .
The plan of creating a society , the plan of creating a family .
