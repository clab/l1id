Nowadays , students can use all ways to success in their fields but they have to make attention in order to use the efficient way .
That 's why I am completely aggree with this statement '' It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn .
Actually , I think understanding ideas and concepts is more helpfull for students because this way is reliable , it help you to save your time and your memory will work successfully .

The first thing is understanding ideas and concepts is really reliable .
Actually , in order to do a good job at your exam , you have to understand the differents ideas .
Moroever , this process is the first step in the method to learn facts .
For example , a student who learns only facts ca n't have good grades because during his exam , he cannot understand the main ideas , so he will easily fail .
Furthermore , this method to understand ideas can also help you to save your time in your daily life .

The second thing which makes my opinion on this statement is the fact that this process can save your time .
Actually , it can save your time because it will take less time to understand the main ideas of a lecture than to learn something you definetly do n't understand .
For example , you can use more than three hours to learn facts but if you just try to understand what this lecture is talking about , you will know easily how this process is efficient .
Thus , you will gain time to do other thing because you did n't spent a lot of time to catch the main ideas of the lecture .
Furthermore , this process can help your memory to work with more success .

Actually , your memory will work successfully , because you will help your memory to save only the important things .
Thus , you will help your memory to be selective and to work faster than before .
Moreover , you will help your memory to react very fast in front of a situation unexpected .
In doing so undestanding ideas is better than learn facts

In conclusion , i am definetly agree with this statement .
I hope all students will use this method in order to have good grades and reach their goals easily .
