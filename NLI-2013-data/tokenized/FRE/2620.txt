It goes without saying that young people are often considered as happy people , whereas an old person epitomizes the lack of energy , or even death .

Indeed , young people stand for happiness , they are often said to be very carefree , they enjoy life .
Part of the reason is probably because they are very close to the outbreak of life , they represent life as such .
On the contrary , old people remind us that life is short , they encapsulate death , the diseases .
They often have health problems , so that they are not considered as people who enjoy life , nowadays , when eternal youth is extolled in the medias , as evidenced by the surge in aesthetic surgery over the past few years , which is a way for old people to keep looking young .
Moreover , they have achieved everything in their life , so one might assume they have no goal to reach anymore , they have no reason to keep alive .
For examples , some researches pointed out that it 's very difficult for old people to find a job since the enterprises balk at hiring them , people assume they are inefficient , or at least less efficient than young people .
On the contrary , young people are often dynamic , they yearn for action , they are said to have a lot of activities , to be ambitious , unlike old people .

However , this assertion can be disparaged as unduly pessimistic , and not a jot warts and all .
Indeed , this vision of the issue is outright shallow , since there is a lot of activities for seniors , they have accomplished everything , they have worked during their whole life , so they consider their old days as the time when they finally can relax , have a lot of leisure , do whatever they want because they do n't have to work anymore , they have a lot of free time , hence the surge in activities for old people , like sports , language courses , etc .
A lot of old people do a lot of activities with their grand children , they have a lot of time to spend with them .
On the other hand , young people are in the outset of their life , insofar as they must worry about their future , their job , etc. they are pressured into succeeding in life , they have to work hard , and it 's a tremendous obsession , that 's w they are probably less carefree than old people .
