In my point of view , old peolpe are more happy of there life than young people .
There are three reasons to this opinion .
First , young people have a lot of problems .
Then you study you have all the stress of the examination .
Furthermore , it 's in this perdiod of life that you have to decidate of your future and you know it .
You are conscient that all your decision will have a very big effect on your avenir .

Second , older persons are more able to appreciate than the young generation .
The oldest genaration have experience so they are more able to take in account what happen .
They already achive something in there life so this people are more confidente .
For exemple , when a 18 years old man felt in love we certanly not realise the chance that he have .
On the over hand a 45 years old man realise exactly the chance that he have when he is in love .

Finaly , although some people think that because students make more party they enjoy more there time .
It 's well know that alcool , who is to much drunk at this party , covert only the problems of this persons .

In conclusion , I will said that because of the too stressful situation that is accepted with alcool and the security and experience of old generation ; young people do n't enjoy life more than the older people do .
