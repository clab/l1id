I strongly support the statement .
young people play life more than older people do , because of these reasons .
First of all , young people hav n't any probleme ; for exemple when the sun arrive the young people go to play game .
second of all , young people hav n't some one to do ; for exemple the day when they hav n't school , young people prefer to sleep long time or to look at tilevision and over .

also , young people hav n't a responsability ; for exemple if they hav n't give the house propretor money heir mather or father wlould pay from him .
In conclusion , older people cannot enjoy life like young people because they have a big responsability to do .
