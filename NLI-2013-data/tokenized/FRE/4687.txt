In our technologicall world , advertisement is the key for the success and development of an old or new product .
You cannot escape the constant presence of advertisement if you live in an average totaly or developped country .
You read about it in news , magazines .
You hear about it on the radio , on TV , or at the movies .
Companies pay fortunes to advertise for their product in such a competitive way that they may override the truth about describing it or their use .
I recently saw on TV a program about the president of a famous soda company whose policy was to keep changing the advertisement of that same product very often to keep the public interested .
Part of what is true for each and every add , seem poor when you think about the real benefits of a soda .
Caffeine beeing the main incredient , it can keep you energized but does not have the same positive effect on each one .
My son is one example , if he drinks one of those sodas , he gets really hyperactive , in a negative way .

Companies in an other hand are practiccally obligated to give information on the product that is not always right , because it becomes competitive with another product .
When you think about all the different products offered for your hair , shampoos and such , for which I am very interrested , it becomes impossible to see which one you really want to buy , because they all promise to make your hair beautifull .
Where is the truth , once you 've tried , you know !

When I want to buy a product that was advertised , I look at the composition of it , the features , the cost .
I think people should be carefull not to spend a fortune on purchasing a product that could be wrongly be advertised for .
