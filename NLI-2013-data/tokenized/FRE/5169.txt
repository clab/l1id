In all compagnies of productions , people use advertisements to make a product to look better than they really are .
Advertisement , it is a kind of subtutition that people add to their product to change the naturel face of the product which will look better .
Here are three major reasons why i am agree whith this statement such as publication , the beauty of the package , and the ingredients .
First , while i am talking about the publication of the product , i am refering to how people publish the product once when the product is ready to be on the market .
To publish their products , they have many way such as to present an emission on the tv about their products , to write an announcement in the journals , or to distribuate their product in different sompagnies which will help them to sell quickly .
They also have to put a nice decoration and a good publicity , so when a clients see that , theyh can be attracted to that product .
This reason is very important because it helps the clients to have more desire to buy this product .
After , the beauty of the package is also important because you have to have a good knowlegde in order to create a nice , pretty design on the package of the product to make the products seem much better than they really are because this can also attract the clients .
For example , if you look the package of one cereal `` Capitain Crunch '' which is recognize in the whole of the world , you can see how people draw on this package to attract the clients to have a desire to buy the cereal and also give them a good appetit .
Then , ingredients are some kind of subtitutions that people add to the naturel products to change them to look better than they used to be like colarnts and many others things .
For Example , the cereal has many subtutitions on it like corns , colorants to loopk very good to eat .
