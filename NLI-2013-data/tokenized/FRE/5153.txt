Many peaple today are influenced by different sources such as television , radio , poster and also famous peaple .
In addition , advertissements is the most important things which influence peaple .
At this step there is in consequente an interresting question which is : advertissements make products seem much better than really are ?
I think there is a lot of reasons which supporte this sentence .
The advantages outweigh the disadvantages .

Firstly , there is a difference between the real product and its image .
Therefore , by definition the image of the product will be different .

In addition , in the television for example , or in all other types of advertissements , the qualities of the product are always more important than its disavantages .
Moreover , these last are often absent .

After that , the manager who are responsible to create the advertissement is incorporated in a business strategy .
At the moment there is money in the story , the description of the product is influenced .
The more important aspect is that this product must be sold .
By result manager use different technique which are not testimony of the reality .

Finally , the last aspect is that many peaple add a lot of wrong details in advertissement .

In brief , as I have shown , most advertissements make products seem much better than they really are .
