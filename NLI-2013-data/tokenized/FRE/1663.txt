I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Our current academic system creates experts , encouraging specialization of students , orienting them into specialized domains : electronic engineers , modern litterature , Greek art , South American civilization ...
Of course , the society needs experts and people able to answer specific questions , highly skilled people in order to make the science , the philosophy , the techniques , the whole society evolve and progress .
However , I believe that in order to have a comprehensive and accurate vision of the society , the world , the past , the future and the present , one needs to have a broad knowledge of various academic topics .

We should draw lessons from our ancestors who were philosophers , mathematicians , physicians , writers , politicians ...
They were truly able to relate one field of activity to another and to use the knowledge of one field to progress in another one .

Nowadays , researchers and scientists work on genetic manipulation .
Intellectuals , philosophs , writers , discuss the scientific breakthrough from an ethical point of vue .
Would this specific situation of a clear separation between the scientifical and the ethical could exist if our experts had a broader expertise ?

I really think it is dangerous to specialize in only one field of activity because thus you miss a significant contribution from other fields .

Besides , I think that it is important for the construction of one 's personality and to live in harmony with other people to be able to understand other people 's interests , to be able to question things , to be able to think ` outside the box ' ...
With over-specialized people , are we heading towards a communitarian society in which scientists live and think with scientists , artists live and think with artists ?
