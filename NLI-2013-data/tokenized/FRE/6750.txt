Will the number of cars in use be lower in twenty years from now ?

I believe the answer is probably no .
What element could support the theory in question ?
Maybe the decrease in natural resources available to produce oil and finally feed our cars .
In fact this problem is already being assessed by car manufacturers and oil makers and we can say based on real examples such as Brasil that Colza based oil can effectively replace standard petrol products .
Electricity or hydrogen engines can also be an answer to oil unavailability .

The second argument , linked with the first one , is the consciousness of our civilizations regarding car impact on pollution and environment .
This is a good point , but we can see this feeling growing today only in countries were almost all the active part of the population has one or more cars .
And these civilizations are also the ones having less demographic expansion .
In other parts of the world like Africa , India or China there are still a lot of people dreaming about having a car , the rapid growth of their population will have a huge impact on car annual sales .

In my opinion another element which could be also utilized is the development of alternative ways of tranportation .
I belive this can be true in big cities were traffic jams and pollution are not good advocates for cars .
But we can oppose the fact that it 's being the case for the last 10 years and the decrease in numbers of cars never happened .

Also in more rural regions , any public transportation system will be efficient enough to replace the cars .
And the feeling of individual liberty that the car brings will not be found while sitting in an overcrowded bus which stops only in pre-designated spots .

And to finish , the special link - almost human - between some men and their cars , the car being the external image of their supposed success , is not a sign tha indicates a potential decrease in the numbers of cars in the next 20 years ...
