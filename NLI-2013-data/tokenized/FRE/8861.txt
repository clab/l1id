The main objective of any educational system is to try to teach students concepts and facts simultaneously .
It is thought certain than people would become more complete if they could learn both from theory and experience .
However if a choice should be made what part would be better ?
I seems to me that it is more important to understand concepts than to learn facts .
Indeed , ideas and concepts are very difficult to understand and requires specific teaching whereas facts can be learnt throught experience .
Furthermore it is not the role of a teacher to have a deep knowledge of general facts .

Besides the students need to know the theory in order to understand facts .

Ideas and concepts are very vague topics which requires an intense learning program .
Indeed , an idea usually spreads out from centuries , if not millenium , of questionnig and debates and thus a rather long time is needed to understand the basis of an idea .
Therefore , only people who have dedicated their entire life to a certain topic can be able to explain clearly the true meaning of a concept .
Consequently it is merely impossible to aprehend an idea just by witnessing a consequence it might have on a person or a thing .
In the opposite , facts are easily understood by simple observation .
Thus , students might have a better comprehension of unknown facts than new concepts .
For instance , it is more difficult to learn from experience the idea of love than undertanding the reasons of a car crash .
Therefore students should learn what is less easier to experience which in this case are ideas and concepts .

Secondly , as it has been stated in the previous part , only qualified people are able to talk precisely of ideas .
Those experts are refered in the educational system as teachers .
A teacher is a person which has a deep knowledge of a sepcific field of area .
By studying and exchanging ideas with collegues , teachers are able to gain expertise on ideas and concept .
However , the very concept of their expertise is that they do not rely on specific facts but ; ore on general ideas .
For that reason they are not qualified to share their experience with students .

Finally , understanding facts requires that previously the student has been aware of the theory .
A fact can only be fully understood when the underlying ideas and concepts are known .

Students should then concentrate on learning ideas .

Besides the very principle of an idea is that it is therotical and needs to be discussed within groups such as classrooms .

Life provides examples but how could students possibly understand events without the necessary background ?
