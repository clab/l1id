Helping our community is a very important point in our world .
Do young people not give enough time to helping their communities ?
Lets see .

First of all , young people are often independant , so they care more about themselves than about other people , they think those people will never help them in return and they can only trust themselves .
A young person will often want to do what she wants when she wants and she may not understand why she should spend more time helping her community .
There is also another problem , the studies .
Studies for young persons are very important and it requires a lot of work and a lot of time to spend , because studies will help them in their future to find a job and win money , again they care more about themselves than about their communities , for example in my university people say that their first wish is to suceed in this university and be able to work in different countries , so it is a pressure for them .

So it is mainly a problem of priority , young people prefer being an important person who wins money instead of giving time for other people .
There is an intersting sicilian setence which says : `` The only person you can totally trust and you can help is only yourself . ''
I agree with this sentence because you will always do your possible to be someone , and the most important thing is our lives .
So we cannot often help other people because help ourselves takes much time and it is necessary .

As a conclusion , I agree with the following statement , but I would also say that I understand because life in nowadays is very difficult and we must first take care about ourselves .
