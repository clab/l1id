In my opinion , the main difference between understanding and learning is that everyone is able to learn something but not necessary able to understand it .
For sure , in my point of view , the most important is to understand things .
It is the main feature which diferentiate two students in term of inteligence .
I will explain why in two points .

Firt , according to my own experience in school , I can assume that it is really easier to learn something when you understand it than it is to learn it by heart .
For example , if I try to learn the economic theory of Keynes , I will maybe succeed for the exam but for sure , 10 days later , I will be unable to explain and to remember it , Otherwise , If I try to understand how really this theory could be apply on the economic system and if I can use it on my own , then I will remember this theory for a longer period .
Moreover , for the exam , students are more and more asked to understand the concepts and not only to repeat them .

Second , what is the most important thing in the work area .
My boss will not ask me to learn something by heart .
He will expect me to think and to develop ideas .
All people with high job in a company , do not spend their time to learn facts but interpreat them in order to find solutions .

For those reasons that I mentionned above , I really think that the most important is to understand concepts .
Moreover , it is so gratifying for yourself when you understand something very hard and it is a personnal reward .
