I do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
For me , enjoying life is not a question of age , it can depend on society , freedom and possible activities .

In a hedonistic society , an elderly could enjoy as much life as a middle aged man or even a child , for they would all live for fun and for the moment .
Indeed , carpe diem is a motto who could make an old person enjoy even more life than a younger one would .

Freedom is also a factor for slaves , prisonners or a paralised man can not enjoy life as much as a free man would .
To be albe to move and do what you want to do when you whant to do is esential for a full enjoyment of life .
Adopting this point of view , it is also possible to add money as a criteria to enjoyememt of live .

Possible activities is also a major factor .
By saying activities , I refer to cultural activities , in direct opposition with survival activities such as eating or sleeping .
To have nothing to do will not allow you to enjoy life .
This is where the conflict between young and older people reveals itself , for some say that older people have less numerous and interesting activities than the young .
I would argue that it is untrue .
I must first claim that the number of activities itself is not essential , as long as monotony and boredom are not reached .
The interset of the activities is a different matter .
Young people , and I must admitt that I include myself , commonly find that activities destined to older peolpe are less interesting .
Added with the fact that older people usualy addmitt to miss their activities they dissmissed a long time ago we can think that the statement is true .
On the other hand , if we ask to older people if they would start their old activities again , most would refuse .
We must see that activities for the younger are not banned from the elderly , it is them who no longer want them .
Activities are more or less interesting depending on the point of view .

Hence we may say that enjoying life is not a matter of age and that older people may enjoy life even more that young people if they encounter the right conditions .
