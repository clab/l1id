Since the last century , the world has been undergoing a globalisation movement .
Capitalism has spread over the planet and new societies considered as individualistic has been settled down .
More and more people seems to be more interested in their own success , their own life than in what could occur in the society .
But can we say that people , or especially young people are not interested or involved anymore in community problems ?
Saying that young people are not interested in helping the community would be a wrong statement .
It just has to be considered that to help the community you have to know what is needed and where you can do it .

Young people of today are often students , but also sometimes young workers or unemployed people .
These are three differents status that does not offer to intergrate the community in the same way .
Most of the students are involved in their community life within activities in their schools or universities .
Young workers have to work more on it with discovering associations and community services by themselves .
Unemplyed young people are often already in contact with community associations .
