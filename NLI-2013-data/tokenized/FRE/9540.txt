The population is not determined in two cathegories , the successful and non-successful .
Hopefully , there is many variety of people between those two catergories and social ranks can by climbed .
A person may be successful during a period of his life and then for the rest of his life become non-successful .

Today , many people that can be called ` successful ' have accomplished this by taking risks such as Donald Trumps that risks to loose its fortune everytime he finance a new project .
Howerver more common people have archive their ` successfulness ' by taking risk such as my neightbor that has come to the United State in order to get a better futur .
Not only has he accomplished that , but by risking everything to come to the USA he has now became a successful buisness man .
Other people have taken risk but hve accomplish nothing .
That prooves that bieng successful is not about taking risk but also thinking wisely .

For example , a mathmaticien might on day decide to quit math even if it is what he does best and to becom an artist .
Maybe he will becom well know and will becom ` successful ' .
At the opposit a tumandous violon player might choose to stay with violon during its life and not change to the piano .
The violonist will gain internal recognition weather if he decided to become a pianist , he might have ended up a a mediocre player .

If people had chosen not do do what they did beast , what would the world be today ?
Bill Gates might have decided not to go in electronic and so , micosoft would not have existed .
Maybe great poeple such as Monet , O Keef , Picasso would never have become artist .
Ben Franclin might have been an merchand and Jhonny Depp an electician .

However with ` If ' you can redo the world .
No one knows what would have happened if all those succeful peoplehad taken a risk and nver did what they do the best .

Being successful is not about taking risk or not , it is about having goals , determination and fate .
Without those qualites no on can ever become successful , for they will let go at any difficulties they encounter .
