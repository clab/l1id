The issue of knowing many academic subjects or to be specialized in a specific one is difficult to deal with .
On the one hand we have young students who are not always sure of what they want to do later and who tend to learn as many subjects as they can and on the other hand , firms that are looking to hire students that are specific on one subject .
Taking all aspects into account , I strongly feel that It is more valuable to be specialized in a particular topic .

To begin with , the scholar system has to deal with students that are going to secondary school or to college without knowing what they really want to do later .
Then , we find them being graduated and being looking for a job with a determination that would be so much stronger if they knew the type of job or the sector they want to work in .
That 's why , my firm belief is that a young student who knows what he wants to do after graduating will have something more than the other students , who will become opponents when it will be the time to get a job .

Another way to justify my point of view is to say that knowing young what we want to do after school is a good way to have a good knowledge on the topic and why not having a profesional experience by doing internships .

However , it is important for a student not to precipitate himself in a way , a specific subject , or an option with being to young to decide that this should be what he will do or learn for his all life .
And having a knowledge of many academic subjects could be a good way to make the good decision .

Taking all aspects into account , my firm belief is that there are so many students that have a knowledge of many academic subjects , and when you have one who knows what he wants to do and that he has a specific knowledge on one specific subject , he has such a good card to play to get a job and to make the difference with other students .
And is n't that what firms are really looking for ?
