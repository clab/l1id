To tell the truth , I do not think that concepts are more important than facts .
To my mind , both of them are significant and essential in a student 's training .

First at all , I am convinced that understanding concepts and ideas are really important for a student .
Indeed , learning facts can become very useless and it is impossible to understand those facts without understanding their origin .
Theory is essential in a student 's training and a student can not devote his time on facts he can not understand .

However , if a students only learn concepts , he rapidly has trouble likening experience and theory .
Consequently , I think it is very important to learn facts for many reasons .
First , when a student learn facts , he can on the one hand , learn a situation , and on the other hand the mistakes made during this situation .
Furthermore , general knowledge is essential .
First , in order to have his own opinion concerning a topic , and then , to liken those facts to an experience .
For example , I am major in Material .
I have learnt a lot of facts concerning different microstructures , and when I carry out an experience , I can observe a microstructure I can easily liken to what I have learnt before .

As a consequence , I think that in order to understand the theory , it is essential to learn facts .

Concepts are essential in a student 's training but a students can not make the most of those concepts if he can not liken them to an experience .
Furthermore , general knowledge is essential to have his own opinion about a topic .

To conclude , concepts and facts are not contrary notions .
A student will be well educated insofar as his education draw a parallel between an understanding of ideas and concepts , and the facts which arise from those concepts .
