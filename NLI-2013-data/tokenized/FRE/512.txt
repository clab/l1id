This issue raises lots of answers : we have to accurately weigh up the pros and cons .
In a way , it depends mainly on the type of field concerned and of the stakes given by the society .

Indeed , our highly competitive and technological world tends to become more and more specialized , so that specializing in some areas such as information technologies or science in general are very useful .

However , a minimum of competences are necessary in our wolrd nowadays because the general level of knowledge in our society has soared at an exponential pace in the last decade .
So you should have also a broad knowledge .

Thererfore , in my opinion , both strategies are valuable to have a good educationnal history .

Fist of all , as regards the increasing scientific and technical shifts witenssed in our everyday lifes , I cannot help thinking that specialists are necessary .
For instance in medicine , all kinds of progress are made everyday such as in genetics stem cells research or cancer cures .
These must be accompanied with specialization of medical school students .
These progresses are often made in very competitive areas and specializing offers the student a difference with another ones that will allow them gaining prestige and rewards .

Another example would be enginnering , while generalists were very common in the past , a better strategy would be a specialization in one or two single subjects .
Namely , in that highly competitive field , you must focus on one thing at the same time to be competitive and aiming at one single kind of job .

As a consequence , specializing in one subject area brings you a competitive advantage helping you to achieve easier than the others ; especially in scientific fields .

However , on second thoughts , because of that competitivity , we have to build also a broad education .
Putting aside a minimum of competences in other academic fields would disable in a way the student .

In fact , if you are an engineer , you have to learn another competences to be competitive .
For instance the languages such as English or Chinese provide you a serious advantage compared to others who cannot speak these languages .

Moreover , if you are profficient at different academic fields , you have more chances to find a job : it does not restrain you .

All things considered , I guess thet nor the first solution neither the second can really be preferred .
Nonetheless , I guess that a broad knowledge and a litthe specialization allowa you getting out of any situation in your professinnal life after .
