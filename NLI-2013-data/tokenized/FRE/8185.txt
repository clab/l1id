A good teaching can adopt different forms and pedagogic pathes , but the most appropriate way to learn efficiently lays in the method adopted , in order to understand things , rather than simply learning them .

At the very beginnning of our scholar ` career ' , we learn by heart a whole bunddle of things : poetry , multiplication tables , grammatic rules , definitions , and so on ...
But most of these learnings are ment to help us work faster without having to waste time in searching and understanding : this is the case for instance of the multiplication tables ( even though we know how they work ... ) .
All these items are also usually the bases to acquire a good memory and to enable us to learn more and more , always further .

Yet , in many cases , learning by heart will not be sufficient if not accompanied by a full understanding .
If considering for instance the case of a mathematics formula , it will only be efficiently applicable if its necessity and logic is understood , so it can be utilized appropriately .
An idea will be better defendable or criticable if all of its arguments are well known and understood .
A concept will be optimized and well utilized if its functioning is evident and logical .

Moreover , being aware of the origin of an idea or concept , understanding its evolution and purpose , will help undoubtfully in its appropriation and memorization .
It will help acquiring its own opinion or vision of it , as its entire process is known and understood .

Yet , other things will not necessarely need to be understood in order to learn .
Some facts cannot be understood , or their understanding would be way too complicated , useless and timewasing to enable us to advance in a learning process , depending on what the goals of the student are .
In this case , one can learn without understanding , as it will help advance further in learning more and more , which is the main objective .
