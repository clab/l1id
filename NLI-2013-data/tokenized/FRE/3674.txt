Helping the communities is a current problem .
There are more and more people need help in our communities .
But we are living in an age with less attention and concern for the community versus an increased for one 's owns needs and pleasures .

In fact , there are more old people .
The human body seems to be more resistant than before .
Medicine are more elaborate .
Some of them live alone far away or near their family .
Some of them can not be award over the new technologic .
So they need help , sometimes only for speaking and walking .

Besides there exist unalfabetic people yet .
I have heard that one by ten people in Belgium is unalfabetic , it 's enormous .
These people need help too .
There exist associations .

Finally , something is very important for me and communities is the respect .
If everybody respects each other a lot of problems in our communities will disappear .
Respect between student and teacher , police and citzens , with authorities , ...
With doing I think that it 's a big step for communities .
It 's not difficult and I would add that 's a basic thing .

Here you are a lot of things that you can do to helping your communities .
You can notice that I said ` you can do ' without specified who 's you .
In fact , I agree with this statement .
But I would clarify that it 's a problem for anybody who live in a community , not only for young people but also for adults .
