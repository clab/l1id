Yong people are the futur of a nation and the motor of its grouth and fulfillment .
They have always represented the symbol of energy and hope .
Nowadays , young people have to carry a big responsability since elementary school to acheive their dreams .
Since they have many concerns in life , they tend to give shorter time to help their community .
I think that this matter is due to the interaction of many factors .
The first major factor , is the school busy scheduale .
This limits the time given for the young people to join community work so they ca n't be very efficient since they do not have suffisiant time .

Thes second matter , is the increasing number of video games and intertainment that encourages the young people to isolate themselves in their rooms ans spend hours with technological machines rather than integrate a club or a volonteering association .

This behavior leads to a vicious circle because the more these youngs hide behind their computer screens and games the more they split from the society and the community actions and the more they will be aware of the importance of the community help .

A third factor that can contribute to this situation , is the decreasing of sensibilisation in our societies .
This is due to the fact that many media programs do n't encourage young people to volonteer work ; instead of this they focus on the role of these youngs as comsumers for commertial products rather than productive members for the community .
As an example for this statement , the number of young people who prepare for the casting of a singing show is much higher than the number of youngs who volonteer for planting new trees .

This behavior shows that youngs are influenced by the media more and more .
So to give the future generation a push to communuty work , the educational system , the medias and the parents should gather their efforts and sensibilise their children to the importance of volonteeri
