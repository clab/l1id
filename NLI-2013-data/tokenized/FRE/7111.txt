There is no denying that many politicians and scientists have raised awareness concerning the problem of car pollution since it is now usual to hear about this issue in all the media .
However successful a solution to the car problem will be , it is a thorny issue in so far as everyone agrees that something must be done for the general interest but in the same time does not want to give up driving his or her own car .
It can be inferred from the opposition between general and personal interests that these latter will win at least for the next few years .
Thus , I am strongly convinced that more cars will be used in twenty years .
I believe this because of three main reasons , which deal with wealth , the problem of fuel and the problem of space .

First , it seems obvious that some countries will use far more cars than they use today because they become wealthier every day .
These developing countries , such as India and China , are peopled by more than one billion inhabitants who cannot afford a car for the moment but will be able to do it more often , by dint of having a huge economic growth .
Thus , people who are going to give up their cars in already developed countries will not have any effect on the amount of cars in use since other people will drive more cars than before .
Moreover , it seems impossible for developed countries to prevent developing ones from driving more cars because developed countries have already done the same .

Some people would say that the problem concerning petrol will lead to a fall in using cars .
I do not agree with this statement .
There is no problem as far as fuel is concerned because two solutions exist .
Either companies find more petroleum or another type of fuel will be used .
Some countries , such as Brazil , have already changed fuels by using oil that comes from agricultural products .
So , it seems to be true that car manufacturers will not have to be worried about this problem .
Cars will keep being the unavoidable motor of our economies .

The third reason why I believe that more cars will be in use in twenty years is that I do not agree with the people who argue that fewer cars will be used because of the traffic in cities .
It is true that more and more cars in cities cause unbearable traffic jams , but it is not true that people will stop driving for this reason .
I state this because car manufacturers have already shown that they were able to solve this problem too .
Their answer consists in designing smaller cars , which take less space and are more easy to park .
The most famous example in Europe is the success of the car named Smart .
If more people drive smaller cars , then there will be no problem at all .

In my view , more cars will be used in the future because nothing
