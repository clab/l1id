I do agree with the statement .
I think that people who take risks and try new things are more successfull than people who do only what they already know how to do well .

The first reason why I think that way is very simple .
When I look to a baby I am automatically sure of my answer .
If a baby do not try new things such as walking instead of going on his arms and legs and if he never take any risk such as eating some warm meal he will never walk and will never be careful about the heat of what he eat .
He will never become a Man .

Then I think to innovations .
I think in particular to the man who invented the electricity .
I am sure that when he tried his machines which produced the first watts he took great risks because of the possibility of being electrocuted or killed by the oil companies of that time .
I also think to Pierre and Marie Curie .
When they discovered the new elements , radium , polonium and the others , they were confronted to an high rate of radioactivity .
It is also impossible to say that they were not successful people .

Finally I think about art .
Art could not have developped if some crazy - as they were called in their era - artists did not think about painting in new ways or painting different things than those painting until them .
For example Picasso invented the Cubism , and when he did it he was just trying new things and finally he has beco ; e famous all over the world and his paintings are nearly the most expensive piece of art on the world art market .

That is for this three reasons that I believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
