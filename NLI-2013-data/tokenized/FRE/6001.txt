The main point of cars is the more and more a problem in our days , it implies socials and economics statements , that are contested by ecological fact .
Even though cars pollute , I tend to disagree with the statment given by the subject : '' In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . ''
I will give three main reason why I think there will be more cars in twenty years from now .

First of all in twenty years , the Earth 's population , will tend to be almost nine billion of people , wich is a overpopulation of course , so I think the more people there are the more cars there are .

To continue , people usually prefer to take a car than to walk , now we can say that some of them will take public facilities , but after all , a bus , is only a big car ...
Whereas others facilities , are not really develloped in all contries , and people usually prefer going in a private car rather than in a common facillity .

Last but not least , the more reaserch are done to find a clean car , a car wich does'nr pollute at all , by using elctricity and even solar sistems .
As long as we have clean cars , and a very large number of person , few reasons will last in contrasting the supperiority of Car .

So , we can say after this explaination , that there wo n't be fewer cars in twenty years from now , but instead , more cars , and even more efficient cars .
