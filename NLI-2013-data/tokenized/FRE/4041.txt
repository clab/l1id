In our time , young people definitely have a real disrepute .
They are thought to be violent , drug-addicted ...
All of them would tell you that cliches are completely wrong .
Do young people give enough time in their communities ?
We will first see that some young people are completely out of their communities .
On the contrary we will see that most of them seem to get involved in their society .

That is true some young people are in a total disagreement with their community or society .
That is why they do not want to be involved in other 's life .
So they stay with their only friends and live in a total different world than their parents and their relatives .
But they are not examples for the whole '' young people community '' ...

Actually , most of them are really involved in other 's life .
And I can highlight lots of examples : in my highschool there are three or four groups [ of twenty people ] who organize some shows to get some funds to eventually help some destitute people who live in opalling conditions .
I am able to cite another examples : in my girlfriend 's school , people are giving money to the students to help them to organize a travel into the Rwanda to lead this country to go back on a better way than ever [ education , food ... ] .
Even if I live in a rich social class [ I am conscient about it ]
I do not let the needy people in their dreadful conditions and lots of my friends share the same fancy of helping our community .
That is why we spend a lot of time in doing a lot of things for our society as far as it is possible .

To sum up there is no denying that some young people are completely cut from their society , torn apart angry and sadness .
But most of young people are getting involved in their community to help others and why not the youngs ones who are not included in that community !
