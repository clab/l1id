To begin with , I do not agree with the statement which is exposed .
To my mind , I think that students must understand ideas and concepts ( absolutely ) because it 's a way for them to mature , and also learn facts .
On the one hand , when they understand ideas they can afford exposing their opinions .
The best solution to it is to attend school because it 's a good way to attend different types of class and to understand different things from each one .
The fact of speaking with students can make one 's view .
Going to school allow you to ask questions to professors if you do n't know something or do n't understand something .
For example a student who used to believing that Doctor Kelly commited suicide and whose profesor explains him the real causes of his death will be more efficient after because he understands something .
On the other hand it 's really important on a student 's life to learn facts .
Indeed , the best solution to learn facts is to be confronted by .
You can read magazines , watch television , surf on the Internet , in a word to put forward with times .
When the unbelievable War in Iraq was declared and when people seen all that happened in this country , they learned something : violence is not the best solution to solve a problem .
Besides , someone who is closed to his parents and does n't cope with the exterior will not be able to face situations and to leave the family nest , he will not stand on his own two feet .
That 's why he had to read , listen or everything else that can help him to know what happen in the world and in that way learn facts .
Anyway it 's better if you are open-minded and not narrow-minded with the world 's facts .

To sum up understand ideas and concepts are as important as learn facts because it not ban you of having a different vision and opinion of things , and it allows you to create your own personnality .
