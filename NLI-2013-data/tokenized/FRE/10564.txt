If one wants to be successful in business , one needs to take some risks and try new ideas or concepts .
However , successful people cannot limit themselves to what they already know as their environment is evolving in parallel .
They need to constantly adapt and cannot only focus on what they already know how to do well .
Therefore , they need to learn and try new things .
In a business , this becomes very obvious with the illustration of the development of the business .
For instance , Bill Gates ( Microsoft ) originally provided operating systems .
Nowadays his firm also provides antivirus , new environment ( .
NET ) and so on .
Everytime he introduces a new product on the market , there is an underlying risk related to different uncertainties : how the product will be received , the quality of the product ...

However , if one starts something totally new , one needs to have enough knowledge to control the situation and anticipate upcoming problems .
At least , one needs to ensure that knowledge and information are within their reach when needed .
On the one hand , Steve Jobs ( EasyJet ) shows that entrepreneurship and motivation can be enough to become successful but there is no guarantee .
He created EasyJet based on a simple concept : cheap flights .
On the other hand , the disappearance of ten per cent of Small and Medium Enterprises , five years after being created , shows that the risks must be measured and calculated .
Indeed , trying new things is not enough , there must be a follow up and a constant evaluation of the risk to prevent from failure .

To conclude , successful people need to have an initial idea .
As the environment is evolving , the initiators will need to consider new areas they might not know well in order to have their ideas fit in this environment .
Thus they will have to try new things and take risks , but they will not take blind risks .
