There is no single day without a new commercial with medicine or food that could help the elderly people to keep fit in their bodies and young in their mind .
We are now surrounded by the eternal youthness quest .
But why ?
Do young people really enjoy life more than the older people do ?

We first have to acknowlegde that the general trend conforts this idea .
We easily can find the reasons for it : - from a physical point of view , it makes no doubts that young people have the advantage of their age ...
and their bodies .
They can , for sure , do more physical efforts than the elderly people .
In this way , not all physical activities are opened to seniors .
eg : attractions in an entertainment park .

- Generally , the young people are studying , and therefore have commonly more free time than working people for instance .
eg : school holidays .
This time , being larger , can be alloted to more activities than for the other category .

- An important fact is that most of young people do not have to care for kids yet , and do not have the charge of a family .
Consquently , they can enjoy life more than other people , since they do not have such preoccupations .

From another point of view , this general trend is new : it only makes a while that people get to 70 , 80 or even 100 years old .
3 or 4 generations before us , it was uncommon !
Therefore , the idea of old people was the idea of people staying in a rocking chair , waiting for lunch , having strict scheddule ...
It 's not the case anymore : many older people enjoy life , go to their activities , go out with their friends , and love it !

Another fact is that what young people could find enjoyable is not enjoyable to everyone .
It creates then another point of view .

There are pros and cons about this topic .
And I have to say that I am totally divised on this subject .
I do n't think there is a YES-NO answer , but more a general one which I expressed .
