Advertisements are everywhere .
You can see in the street , watch it on television , heard it on the radio .
It is almost impossible to live without it .
The purpose of advertisements is to make the future customer buy the company 's product .
In order to make the product look good , advertisements can be very tricky .
There are some reasons what make me think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

In my opinion , the man or the woman who works in an advertisement company has to have a very well developped imagination .
For example , if you have to make an advertisement for water , it is very difficult to figure out what to put on it .
Moreover , you have to explain why your water is better than the other water on the ` water market ' .
So you say that your water is healthier or has a better taste .
People who make this type of commercial lie on the specificities of the water , they make products seem much better than they really are .

Moreover , they want to make benefits , so they have to make you buy the product .
Sometimes a comgany creates a product that you do n't even need .
They make a new product , it looks useless but the commercial is so nice and well done that people want to buy absolutly the product .
Advertisements lie and the efficient part of the product , they make it usefull but it is not .

In conclusion , the world of advertisements is very tricky .
It is very easy to fall into the trap of the ` new product ' .
Advertisers are very good to make you want the product even if you do n't need it .
I think that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are because advertisements companies wo n't show up the bad side of their products .
So they make their product look perfect and they fool the customer .
