I can not take a clear position on the fact that young people enjoy life more than odler people .
I think that they enjoy life in a different way .

Young people just experience all the things they want to .
They are not always conscient of what they are really doing and what could be the consequences of their acts .
Often , they do not have any past experiences they can related to in order to judge if they should do it or not .

I think that in a way young people enjoy life more than older people because they are not as stressed .
As a young woman , I can say that I do not considere the future as much as my parents do and in some ways it allows me to experience some situations that I would not if I was older .

I also have a very different perception of money .
For me and most of young people , money is a substantial thing .
It is very easy to have access to it and we are not affraid of credit , which is a big difference with older people .
Not having money does not stop us to try things we want to .
For example , many of us will just consent to take a loan to travel instead of waiting to have enough money as our parents would do .

On the other way , I think older people enjoy life as much as us .
With time , they readjust they expectations and their definition of what happiness is and appreciate more the little things that make your day to day life better .
They do not dream of wide spaces anymore , or at least not as much as when they were younger .

I think older people are happier to look at what they did during their life than what they are planning to do .
For instance , my grandmother was not able to walk anymore so it stopped her to do many things she used to but this did not stop her to be happy .
Her happyness and her description of what life was was to see her children and her grand children evoluate and experience things she already did .

As I said earlier , I think both young and old people enjoy life but in a very different way .
I think that maybe older people are able to enjoy more their experiences due to the fact they have seen other things before and have been through more difficulties .
I think older people can understand how youngers enjoy life , have been young already and have had the same feelings as them .
But in another way , younger people can hardly imagine that older people enjoy life because they are not there yet in their development .
The definition of an accomplished life changes during your life and that is why both young and old people enjoy life .
