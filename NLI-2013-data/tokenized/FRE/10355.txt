The issue of trying new things and taking risks to get success is controversial .
While some people think that success can comes if they keep on doing what they are used to do , others assume that they have to deal with completely new and risky issues .
According to me , the latter viewpoint is the most appropriate way to reach success .

In fact I have the feeling that one has to discover some new opportunities to be on the front scene .
One instance of this is the big computer compamy apple which launched the `` i-pod product '' a few years ago .
In fact this device was different from its competitor products .
Even the apple project was risky , the consumers adopted it and the sales successfully increased .

In addition , success can not be met if one does not take risk .
For example , in financial services company , success means important money gains which is not possible if a minimun risk is not taken .
Indeed , warrants provide more hopeful gains than options do but are seven times risky .

Finally , being successful means being the best of all competitors .
One example is the formula one team that has the goal to win the world car championship .
Each year , is has to compete with other car brands and try new technologies such as new bumpers to improve the aerodynamic profile of the vehicle , and to invest a lot of money for which it is not sure to get a profit in return .

As a conclusion , for getting success people need to try new opportunities and to take risks that can drive them to the top level situation they have ever dreamt .
