Famous French Army General and president CHARLES DE GAULE once said : '' the best ways of studying how to command is to study a broad of knowledge of many academic subjects '' .

Why did he say that ?
And is this only good to learn how to command , or is this true for everything ?
That is the question to answer .
I would say it depends on what one 's expect it 's knowlege is needed for .

On one hand , If it is for everyday living , i suppose this is very right : for exemple , during the day , we all meet many people who with we talk about very different subject ( economics , social issues , work , family or simply last night TV program ) .
In this case , the more on different subject we know , the more people will appreciate to talk with us .
If someone wants to know your own point of view on an specific event , and if you answer him '' i do n't know and i ' not interested in that '' , we can guess he will not ask you anymore ...

Ther is anothere exemple : most politics program are based on economic or social problems to solve .
if you do n't have any idear about it , how will you understand the debate , the different opinions ?
And how then , will you make your choice for the next vote ?

Moreover , i beleive , we all still have a child slleeping in our brean : so like children , we like discovering new things , being curious , this is another good reason to study many acade ; ic subjects .

On the other hand , i beleive it is difficult for a teacher or a scientist not to specialize in one subject .
same thing for peolple who have very specialized jobs such as engineers or finance administrators ...
How would these people be experts if they had not specialize in their owm specific subject .
how would a teacher answer to all the questions student ask him every lessons ?

As it seens impossible to specialize in all the subjects , i suppose these teachers , scientists or expert have no choice .
however , i beleive , they still also studied other subject , even if it is not with the same accuracy .
Also , i think they are interested in many other subjects and they can talk about other things than their owm specific subject .

I think there is no better way of studying , it depends on what you will have to do later in your jobs .
but me , i definitely followed Charles DE GAULLE advice ...
