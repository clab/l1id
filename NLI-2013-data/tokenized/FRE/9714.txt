I disagree with this sentence up to a point .

In my opinion successful people leads the world , and thanks to their works and abilities our world is evolving every day , every minute , every year .

In the world 's history many examples of famous scientits , politicians , artists and so one can proove that witout their talent our civilization would be much more primitive .
Christophe Colomb was a famous sailor of the past centuries , he was a risk taker and that characteristic of his behaviour have conducted him to discover America although his life and all the crew was is danger ...

Successful people are never satisfied of themselves that is why they always want to look further , to have new projects more and more insane .
The curiosity and the risk keep them alive , they need it .
The wolrd wo n't be so fantastic if people would all be cowards !

Ernesto Che Guevara was a good dorctor in south America but his political ideas were so strong that he leaved everything to join the Cuba 's revolution .
No matter what he has done , he tried new thing and paid with his own life ...

Successful people are the motor of our civilization and we should let them free to do what they want , they may solve some worldwide problems , deseases ...
No matter the risks they undertake if the purpose of their actions is fair , we need them to keep on evolving .
