Nowadays , sciences have so increasingly develop in a wide range of topics , from economics to medicine than it has become almost impossible to understand a topic without being a specialist .
However , people who have a broad knowledge are needed as they are a usefull link .

In our modern society , organizations are evolving towards flat organizations strutures .
Moreover , technologies , methods , financial analyses and processes have become more and more complicated .
As the consequence of this complex economy , a lot of society have decided to focus on their core activities and , as a result , to outsource to suppliers the other activities .
In it really commom for eample in the car industry , where today big companies focus more on designing , assembling and distributing .
Their purchases represent more than 60 percent ot their supply managememt costs .
So companies need white collar who are really specialized and have a lot o knowledge in terms of engineering , managememt , research and developmemt ( energy , materials ... ) .
Specialized people are so a necessity in our changing economy .

However , as corporate structures are often divided in very specific and specialized divisions , and as this latters need to exchange with suppliers and distributors , it is also important and very usefull to have people who have no specialization but who have broad knowledge , able to understand the firm activity as a whole and to have an overview of it .
As a matter of fact , today companies are more and more looking for people able to create a link between , for example the designing department of the firm and the suppliers .
People who have a broad knowledge are also very important as they can have a global vision of the firm , of its stenghts and weaknesses , and as a result can give future orientations to the corporation .

To conclude , nowadays , both specialized and broad knowledge people are appreciated by companies are they like to mix these two different profiles .
