Learning and understanding are a large part of our culture .
I totally agree with this statement because as far as I am concerned , I think that before to act , it is necessary to understand .
However , there are several advantages for students to understand ideas and concepts and advantages for them to learn facts .

First of all , some students prefer understand ideas and concepts because for us if they understand the meaning of a word , they will be able to use it again .
To support of that view , I would like to give an example of my experience .
I am currenty in a language school to learn English .
It is very important to understand the meaning of each word in order to use it .
Fortunately , professors explain all meanings of a word because In English , a word can have several meanings .

Second , for others students , learning facts is more important than understand ideas and concepts .
Indeed , for us , if they learn facts , they will be able to use it again in their real life .
For instance , I was in a law university and one of my major was Real Estate > In this class , we only learnt facts such as for example what are formalities to build a house or to obtain a loan .
For me this class was the mot interesting and above all the less boring that to learn by heart some concepts and ideas .

To summarize , I think that understanding and learning are both essential .
Nevertheless , the point of view of students can be different about of what is the most important for us
