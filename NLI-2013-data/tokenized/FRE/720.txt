Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject are , in my point of view , both very important .
But there is a time for the two and I think that it 's better to first concentrate on learning many different things when we can do it .
I mean during our studies .

First , when we know about many academic subjects , we can talk with lots of different kinds of people .
For instance , in my school , which is an engineer school , there are different departments such as biology , civil engineering , informatic ...
Before this school I made two years of `` preparating class '' , in which I learned about different academic subjects .
What is interesting is that I can now talk with my friend who are in different departments without shame because I can understand a minimum of what they say and discuss it .

Second , having a broad knowledge of many academic subject can help us to know what we want to do after and then chose the best specialization for us .
During my two years of `` preparing class '' , I learned about physic , maths , mecanics , biology , chemics ...
It helped me to chose my department and not to make a mistake and having to change my education later .
More of that , all that I learned during this two years help me in my education of biology engineer and in my everyday life .
I 'm proud when I can answer to basic question about physic that , for example , my parents ask to me and I enjoy reading easily scientific magazines about different kinds of subjects .

To conclude , I will say that the specialization must be acquire only when it is necessary .
We can specialize after , in our job , but it 's more difficult then to learn about many academic subjects because we do n't have the time and we have more difficulties to learn than when we are a student .
