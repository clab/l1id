I will support the idea that young people are more happy than older people .

The first reason is that people in their twentys for example usually have less health problems and more energy .
They are at their physical heights , strong , and beautifull !
They can go out late at night and wake up early the next day without feeling too much pain .

Another reason is that young people still have hope .
Hope in a brighter future for the world , hope in a brighter future for themselves .
They beleive , and they are theoritically right , that everything is still possible in the world and in their life , and this contributes greatly to their happiness .
Every day a new life can begin .
As a counter example , I have a friend , 40 years old , who has been a technician for the twenty first years of his career , despite the fact that he didn n't really like technical jobs .
He always thought his job was just for a living and that he would n't do that all his life .
But recently , when he wanted to finally change job and work in business , he just could n't find a single employee that aws interested in his profile .
He was very depressed about the idea of spending the rest of his life doing something he did n't really like .
Whereas for young people , it is easier to change job .

Finally , young people have less reponsibilities than older people , therefore they are less likely to suffer from stress than older people .
Their job , their familly life , and their belongings are not as important as they will be in their future .

Plus , their decisions usually involve only them , therfore increasing the satisfaction that they can get from life .
They can more or less decide according to whatever they feel is good for them , without having to find a compromise with a loved one or childrens .
For instance , if they do not have a family , they can decide to go and work abroad if they have a great opportunity , which is not so easy to do for someone that lives with his wife or husband .

As a conclusion , even though there are many benefits to growing old , young people enjoy more life than older people .
But after all , being young is in people 's minds !
