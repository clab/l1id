Tour operating is a developping and lucrative industry .
A lot of people enjoy planned and guided travels for holidays because beeing discharged of logistics details , they enjoy even more their holidays .
However I personnaly prefer to travel with some friends but not on guided trips for reasons involving flexibility , intense moments and rewarding experience .

First and foremost , traveling in a group with a tour guide is not appealing to me because I fill deprived of my freedom to go where I want or to the most interesting place depending on the conditions .
Indeed , when you are traveling in a group , you have to follow an often tight or unintersting schedule that could makes you frustrated when you feel like there where breathtaking experiences , views or sites you missed .

Beeing in a group , walking with the group might also spoil your trip .
There are some places like deserts , mountains summits , temples ...
where you want to be alone or only with close friends and share unusual atmosphere , silent or feeling that can be completely be disturbed by a noisy group of tourists .
Your holidays are a succes if you have been able to completely disconnect from your normal life , work problems ...
Traveling in a group of people that have not the same goal during their holidays often prevent you from accessing the happiness of escapism .

A last reason for planing and traveling by yourself lies into the rewardness of a successful trip you have been able to put together on your own .
If you compare a trip for which your only input has been to pay and a trip for which you have been reading books , looking for information and then drawing a raw intinerary , the second one require more work but also ensure you that you will do exatly what you want depending on the uncertainties that are along your road .

To summarize , beeing the responsible for your way rather than depending on a guide and beeing frustrated by all the limitations of a group , is the best way to travel .
It enable you to live more rare experiences , discovering as much as you can without decreasing the quality of your experience .
