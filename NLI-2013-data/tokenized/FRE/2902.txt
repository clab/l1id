To my opinion young people appreciate life more than older people .
The reason for this is towfold .

First , young people are less aware of death than the older poeple .
Usually young people are in good wealth .
They do not think about their own death on a every day basis , exept in specific cases .
There is no doubt that older people are more aware of their own death than youger people .
Most of them have already been confronted to death .
They may have loose close relatives : the husband or the wife for instance .

Not thinking about death too much is a way to enjoy life .
As youg people fear less to die they can accomplish more things .
Most of the young people do not fear to take risqs .

The youth is the feeling that life is only at the beginning .

Second , being young envolves that the person is able to have children and to build up a family .
Having children is no doubt one of the most important joy of life .
Nowadays a woman is able to have children until she is 40 years old .
In today 's society being 40 years old is regarded as mid age but still young in a way .
A child is like a sunshine in someone 's life .
Seing your child growing is such a source of happyness .
Only young people can enjoy this great experience .
One may argue that being a grand parent is olso a wonderful experience but this experience is undoubtly different from the previous one .

It is commun place to hear old people talking about their past life with a nostalgic tone .
After a certain age people tend to live in memories .
