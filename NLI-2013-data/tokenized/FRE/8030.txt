It is a well-known tradition for students to dislike dates .
Therefore , it seems that maybe they do n't like learning facts , which seems harder than `` just '' understanding an idea or concept .

Indeed , once you have understood the idea of something , theorically , it remains in your mind , whereas facts are easily forgotten .
You can then re use the concept you have learned before , only because you understood how it worked , why it was important , and so on .
And , something very important for the students , if they do n't really remember the exact words their teacher used to explain the concept , they can made up something of their own , which may still be accurate .

On the contrary , you cannot do the same withs facts .
Facts , as it is implied , are precise , occurred in special situations , and were followed by special consequences .
For example , you can explain to someone what is the concept of Epicure 's philosophy , even if you do n't really remember all the aspects of it , eventually your explanation may still be valuable for the other person .
It is more complicated with facts ; indeed , you cannot imagine how Henry 8th left the Catholic Church to create the Church of England , unless you know the facts , the dates , the consequences , and so on .

As far as I am concerned , I think that facts are as important as concepts or ideas .
Facts are needed to understand concepts , and concepts are needed to foresee facts ' consequences , for example .

Concepts may sometimes be too abstract for students , and the vocabulary generally used to explain a `` concept '' is not really words that we use in everyday 's life , and it may be a problem for some students .
Here , facts can help the teacher ( or the person explaining ) making the ideas clearer for the others .

To conclude , I would say that there is a very close relationship between understanding ideas and learning facts ; none is more important than the other , and when you are sutdying , you need to do both to succeed .
