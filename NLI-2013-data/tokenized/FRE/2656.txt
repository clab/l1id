Carnot , a very famous french physician wrote three laws , one of wich I could translate this way : `` with time you gain in organisation what you lost in energy '' .
He was speaking of fundamental physics , but I think that this could be applied to human beings .

When you are young , you are filled with energy and you intend to do or try everything , travelling around the world , practising extreme sports , as we say in french , burning the candle by both ends .
But do we enjoy life more than old people ?
Answering this question is quite difficult for me , as I still have n't tried being an old man - it will come soon enought .

But however , I think that you can enjoy your life , young or old , no matter your age .
Each age has its own pleasures : when you 're young they may be a bit more intense or demanding , but when you 're old , I suppose pleasures are more wise and simple .

Moreover , as time goes by , you can enjoy - maybe - your children , and grand children .
That 's a real advantage !
Joy comes from simple events : the visit of your family , a good meal all together , etc .

On the other hand , you may have hard time when aging : diseases , loosing memories , etc .
That 's the big advantage of being young : generally , you 're more fit , and moving around , doing sports is not a difficulty .
But being busy all the day is not allways enjoying life : you can have multiple activities and spend most of your time unhappy about everything .

To conclude , I would say that if enjoying life is having a full life , then young people enjoy life more than older do , but , if enjoying life is just being happy and taking care of yourself and other , then there 's no age for enjoying everyday 's life ...
