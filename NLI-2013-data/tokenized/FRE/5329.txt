Can we imagine a day without advertisements ?
Advertisements are nowaday a big part of our economy .
A business plan have to be prepared with a specific policy as regard advertisement .
I agree with this statement for many reasons .

First , in my opinion , something advertised is presented to the population as the best one in its best presentation .
it occur when we seean advertisement for foods .
When you have the food in your plate , you appreciate the difference .

Then , most pepole a credule .
They have not the knowledge to compare or to juge the product .
Principally the old person when they have to buy for example a television .

Next , an other big part of the population is very influenced by advertisement .
They see it , buy it thinking that is the best and seek the difference with an other different .

As long as the rules do not change , the advertisement system will still edge up .
