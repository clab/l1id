I agree with the assumption that successful people always try new things and take more risk rather than doing what they already know .
In effect , we notice that nowaday , people who are most successful in life are people who diversify their occupation .
For them in order to stay competitive in the business word , one need to broader his businees field .
Hence they are always trying a new field of business no matter for them what the risk will be .
In fact in this globalisation of the economy the better you broder your business the more you are likely to survive in th business world .
For instance we can refer to successful coorporations that intervent in several diferent business field .
These companies by diversifying their business production are able to cut down the cost of producing goods .
Therefore they can offer a very low price for the goods they are selling .
So taking risks become part of the companies policies because that allow them to survive in the business market .

In coclusion to remain successful in life , any persone or entity must try new thing and take more and more risks .
