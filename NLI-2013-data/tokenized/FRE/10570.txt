A well known proverb says : `` Life is all about risks '' .many people adopt this concept and build up thier life around risk and exciting things .
Other prefer to do only what they already know how to do well .
I personally think that successful people try nwe things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

Taking risks in life allows people to make discoveries .
This help them build up their knowledge on some areas that they were not even familiar with or enhance what they know about a subjet already .

Also by taking risk , you learn on your own and you mature quicly because you can critically thinking and solve problem from your own understanding .
You also gain experiences .
For example I recall having the task to take care of my two brothers when I was just fiftheen .
My parents have to go overseas for my father to received better medical treatment following a terrible accident .
I have to think on my own and provide good care to my brother while my parents were gone .
Sometimes I did n't know exactly what to do yet I took risk and I believe It paid off .
I know better than if my mother was to give me lessons the difficulties that parents encounter in raising up children and most importantly how they feel when children do n't listen to them .
In addition , taking risks help me progress intellectually because you need to focus on the strategies to use and the outcomes expected .

However , we need to learn from the mistakes of other so that we do n't find ourselves in the same situation .
Hence sometime it 's not wise to take risk if we know we will probably harm ourselves .
Also we need to keep in mind that we are different and wo n't always succeknow our limit and how far we can go in any situation so that we avoid deception
