Nowadays , globalisation that is to say , for a part of it , the spreading of the consumers society model all over the world , make the specialiation compulsory .
Indeed , the development of the new technoloogies of information and communication creates new jobs which needs a specific formation ( for example the hotlines and other services on the web ) .
