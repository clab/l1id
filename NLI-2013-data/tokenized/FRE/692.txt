Some people might say that having a broad knowledge is more important than focusing on one specific subject ; this discussion has been a subject of dispute for some time .
However , this argument is asserted as a general rule and omits some important concerns that must be addressed in order to substantiate this argument .

Most conspicuously , the professional life utterly requires you to be proficient in one subject .
For instance , knowing accounting standards will not be immensely useful if you are working as a nurse .

Moreover , students are likely to decide a major when they leave high shools .
As an illustration , it is worth having a specific skill in order to make this choice much easier .
Focusing on a particular subject may therefore be more effective for students .

However , it could be argued that a wide knowledge is sometimes more important that focusing on a particular subject .
For example , when a worker is made redundant , having a wide range of skills may sometimes be far more efficient in order to find a new job ; this seems to be even more important for people who do not have any degree .

Likewise , the personal life often requires you to have broad skills .
For example , borrowing money , looking after children , repairing a car are situations which require some basic skills in order to be effective .

In conclusion , this argument leaves out some key issues even if we may infer that it is a delicate subject .
It can sometimes be more important to have a broad knowledge , but it could be also asserted that in some cases , it proves most useful to be more proficient in one specific subject .
Therefore , it depends upon what kind of skills you require .
