Planning to see fewer cars in use in twenty years is a good perspective but I can hardly imagine it .
I can only consider it as an illusion .
Basically , people enjoy driving to go working , shopping or to the beach .
If you live in a city , I would encourage you to observe and count as many cars as possible for one minute .
I guess you would be surprised .

It appears to be quite clear that some people really need a car .
First , a car , it is useful .
It is useful by the fact that you can get anywhere , at any time , the way you want .
The only thing that may slow you down is traffic jams .
And when you live far from any city , any shop , any bus stop , a car is very useful .

Then , a car , it can reveal something else .
This is part of the thing you can also notice ( when you are observing on the pavement ) , it is the number of people in the cars .
You can hardly see more than two ( except when it is a family and when they are two children at the back ! ) .
Yes , because owning a car has always been a sign of power .
We live in a society where people feel like buying and owning new and often expensive thnigs in oder to be proud of them and expose them .
People who make advertisements know that and have used this idea so many times .
And especially the cliche about middle-age men driving a fast and powerful car .
It is said that you could describe people according to the car they 've got and vice-versa .
I guess in our current societies , it is a sign of power , of prosperity and modernity .
And this is not going to change ...

And the last but not least important fact it the evolution , over the last years , of the means of transport in any city all over the world .
Bangkok is a good example .
The Skytrain as well as the undergroung are sometimes crowded but not so much .
There are seats available quite often .

The only thing you can notice and you have probably been noticing it for a long time now is that the roads keep being flooded by cars !
It may be better and less than before but before seeing fewer cars in use , we will probably have to wait more than twenty years .
