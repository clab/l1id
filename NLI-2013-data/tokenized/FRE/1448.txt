First of all , knowledge is something you have in your brain for almost all your life if not all your life from the moment it 's acquired that 's going to make you useful to the society , business world , etc .

Having broad knowledge of any academic subject has always been good because it opens you doors to other skys earlier or later on .
Some people prefer acquiring knowledge from different academic subjects to tempt their lucks in any social 's sector while others prefer focusing their energy in just one to end up highly-graded .

Both points of view are good but we 'll try to balance them with a little of realism .
Nowadays , specializing in just one academic subject , no matter how you graduated , gives you less chance compare to the one who got broad knowledge of many subjects .
We 've seen so many examples of people who achieved brilliantly their only chosen courses in universities but who are still laying on their diplomas .
Let 's get the example of doctors in medecine , surveys have shown that more than 60 % of people who graduated in medicine 8 years ago are still looking for a job of their level but it 's nowhere to be found .
This small illustration shows us that with the development of so many things nowadays , having broad knowledge of different academic subjects is advantageous compare to specializing in just one academic subject just because you 're called to do so many things at the same time .
Some years ago , so many sectors were n't computerized but today almost all sectors ( economic , medical , etc ) are computerized .

In conclusion
