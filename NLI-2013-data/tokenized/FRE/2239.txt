Today , more and more often old people is showed by the society as slow and sad people .
But this point of view is really restrictive and cannot be share with everybody .

First , to my mind , the definition of `` enjoying life '' can change with your age : not because you cannot enjoy like before but just because your mind change .
For example , when you are a child , `` enjoying your life '' is just to play with your games .
When you begin to be a teenager `` enjoy life '' is to begin go in clubs , in bars .
When you are thirty years old , you need to enjoy life spending time with your friends or succeeding in your job .
I think when you are young , it is really hard to understand enjoying life of older people because you did not discover what they lived and what they need .
Then i think anybody need to enjoy his own life with his own dream or his own hobbies .

More when you become older , your body can accept everything it accept when you were young .
Something which was really sweet and so easy to do when you were young can become quickly hard and so strong .
Then a thing , you think in your childhood too hard or too string can become with your age really easy , funny or sweet .
For example , to do go in clubs or do extrem sports can become really hard when you are older , and to learn chess can become really enjoying when you are older .

To conclude , I do n't think every body can have the same one , because this term is linked to the target you gave to your life .
This target can change and is too much personnal to be shared with everybody .
And this is really hard for the different generation to understand why older or younger enjoying life with a another another activity which is not your view of `` enjoying life '' .
