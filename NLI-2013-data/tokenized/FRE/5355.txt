In the daily life , we are surrounded with advertisements , whatever we may do : listen to the radio , take the train , watch television ...
Yet , we can wonder whether these advertisements really reflect the truth .
Do not they sometimes make products seem better than they really are ?
Do truthful advertisements exist ?

On the one hand , we can think that advertisements only consist in showing a product : nothing can really be biased this way .
Indeed , in an advertisement , a product is shown , described and sometimes we see how it works ( for an electronic device for instance ) .
So , how can we possibly we cheated on ?
They make products the way they are .
For example , when you see on television an advertisement for a new type of cake for children , you see a new type of cake on the screen and nothing more .
The product seems to us just how it is .

However , we can think that a lot of marketing is involved in the conception of an advertismnent .
Consequently , every advertisment is carefully thought and designed so as to make us buy the product .
That is why the advertisement makers try to play with our feelings .
For example , more and more products in the advertisements are described as healthy , or good if people are on a diet ...
Advertsiments makers use the new trend for health , diet ...
that has been running for some months .
They try to make every prodcut look healthy , even though it is not .
For example , every product with an original high rate of fat is described as `` lighter in fat '' but hey omit to add that there is still a considerable amount of fat in it .
Another way of making products seem better is the use of small letters .
For example , for a loan , you will see in big letters that you can get a loan in no time , but when you read carefully , you notice how much it costs ...
The same thimng happen when you suscribe something with an internet supplier : an attractive price is written in big letters in the advertisement , but when you read more carefully the small letters , you notice that the rent of the modem is not included , that this price is the one if you engage for three years ...
Another tool for the advertisments makers to make the product better-looking to us is the use of a `` star '' to present it .
People who identify with this `` star '' think that if such a person uses this product , it must be wonderful .

To conclude , we can say that people have to be very careful with advertisements .
Indeed , even though they sound like truth , they are not really the truth .
Most advertisements are conceived so as to make the product seem much better than it is , so as to convince us to buy it .
