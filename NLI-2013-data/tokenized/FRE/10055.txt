Nowaday , Bill Gates is the first wealth on the hearth .
He has constructed it on a very famous firm , Microsoft .
This latter month a new product has been launched , Windows Vista which is a new software which enable every people to work more efficenctly with their computer .
What is that product ?
Only a old software which has been improved .
This leads to my point of view .
According to me , successful people are those who develope products based on their previous experience and knowledge .

If we spend so much time at the university is to gather and increase our knowledge to pretend to a good job .
At the time being it is almost impossible to succeed in the unknown .
Every people who has succeeded started with a familliar topic .
How can we be good in something we do not know at all .
A business to be launched needs strong basis or it is deemed to fail .
Once it is properous then we can decided that something new could be done .
When a manager points out that the bounds are reached and that the business is not growing anymore , at that time he can decided to find a new strategy or a new product .
New investment must be the only way for a firm to survive the growing competition .
But it is not necessary to change completely the product the firm is selling .
Pizza Hut for example , to revive the business , invented the cheezy crust pasta .
The product is still a pizza but that pizza is improved to `` grab '' new consumers , increase the profit and be better than other competitors .

So , successful people has develope a thing they were knowing very well , improved it and then renew that thing when the time has come to find new found by extended the market .
The subject is innovation .

Many people who tried to succeed in something they do not know at all were a lot to fail .
That is what we witnessed in France at the begining of 2000 .
A lot of new firms were started on the Internet thing but many of them were completely ignorant of that totally new thing and the result was appaling , more than 80 percent of those firms closed during the first year .
