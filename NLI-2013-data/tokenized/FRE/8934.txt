The French Education system put a premium on the theorycal knowledge , contrary to other education system which emphasis parctical knowledge .
which of the two could be the best ?

Understand ideas and concepts is the base to be able to undersand the reality , the current events in the entire world .
Indeed , theorical knowledge and culture permit to be open minded , to analyse a situation with the nessary competence .
For example , a brilliant manager has to know a great variety of information to make the righ choice .
Moreover , France promotes the ` Classes preparatoire '' , it is two year of hard work to integrate the best business schools .
To succed the exam , you have to learnt a great amount of concepts : you have to study mathmatics , economics , philosophy , history .
The goal of this learning is to give you kwonledge to cope with all types of situations , in every day life , at work ...

But on the other hand , to understand concepts is no suficient .
I think it is something very interresting and useful , but students have to learn facts too .
For example , certain adults did not study long time when they were young and they succed in life because they used their practical competences and their work experiences .
So it is important for students to do training periods for example .

To conclude , I think these two types of learning are linked , so they have the same impotance for me because if students know many concepts and they stay far from reality , it is a problem because in their future , for their career , both competences are required .
