Is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , or to have a more specific subject specialization ?

First , I think that this question is quite difficult .
In fact , in France we use to have plenty of different courses , therefore as we come at the age of about twenty , it appears to be a good thing .
That is to say , I got a basic knowledge on a lot of different things , and I am capable to understand basic problems or discusions , for instance on radio .
And I feel glad of it .

But , of course , a broad knowledge has also got drawbacks .
Actually when I was a child , I thought it was a wast of time learning how human beings descovered fire , how DNA functions .
It is hard to interest somebody in a subject that is not its cup of tea .
Thereas a specific learning can really be a good way of catching attention .
Thus students , that just focuse on a specific problem , are really aware of it , and when time comes for them to work , they are efficient .
I think that a reason of the American power , and the fact that often American searches recieve the Nobel price .

However , I believe that a good balance between a specific topic and a broad culture is the best .
In France we generaly agree that Americans do not even know where Europe stands .
I think it certainly is a prejudice , but It reviels may be that we cannot just consider a single subject whitout considerating the world in which we all are .

To conclude , I would say that a balance policy in teaching is almost impossible to find , but I do trust that both a broad view of the world suroundings us and a specific culture are a wounderful utopia .
