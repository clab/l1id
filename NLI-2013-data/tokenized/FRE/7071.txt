Pollution is a today burning issue .
Cars are the first point we think of when we talk about this issue .
But , even if there are more and more friendly-environment policies which work or not , what about cars using ?
Will we use less our cars in twenty years than nowadays ?

Not having utopic opinions , we are allowed to answer this question yes , according to several elements about the changements which will occur about using cars .

First , even if the lobbies which control petrol production are among the most powerful , the worlwide reserves of petrol are going decreasing .
This is a well-kown fact , but as it is `` material '' , nobody can prevent us from this .
This is a non-renewable resource and we are using a great part of it .
So our way to use this resource cannot be endless ; the situation will change .

Moreover , we heard it from the news more and more , scientists are searching and finding alternatives to petrol working cars .
Although these solutions are often complicated and remains expensive , all the works about this topic are progressing .

But , they are and will remain a certain time expensive alternatives for the consumer ; thus they appear as a factor which will probably reduce the using of cars in the coming years .
Given that it will be the only solution to use cars , the number of cars we use nowadays will certainly dercrease .

Third , to reduce our using of cars is the first mean we have to reduce pollution , one of the growing-importance issue of our modern societies .
Industrials pollution are being diminished by laws , but the next step is a control of using cars , as it is done actually in certain countries like France .
It is the best way we have to fight against pollution and the changes about climates which begin to occur throughout the world .
In fact , the other aspect of such a policy would be a very important developpement of the collective transports already existing as tubes , buses , etc ...
Transporting more people than cars , they are an advantaging solution at several levels .

As a conclusion , even if it still sounds utopic to say that it will have fewer cars in twenty years , several elements lead us to think this will come true .
