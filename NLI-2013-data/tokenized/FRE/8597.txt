Who have not been complaining about how boring are sometimes the topics and contents of courses ?
The ones who will not agree have never been students or have certainly erased this part of their life from their memory .
Even if iIdeas and concepts are key elements in learning , I am a student in law and the professors that I have loved are the ones who have made me like some topics I was not supposed to appreciate .
And their secret is they have kept our attention by not only sustainable analysis but also by relevant facts which are part of our everyday life .

First , ideas and theories are too vague for basing students .
They are far beyond of ourselves .
That is why using a concept without an example is completely nonsense and ridiculous .
That is why , teachers from the elememtary school to universities are using examples to make one of their sutudent understand one idea he has not .
So , ideas how clever they might be are pointless if we can not verify it regarding situations .

In a second matter , a certain kind of concepts are really difficult to understand .
For instance , some arguments of philosophers must appear far-fetched at first sight .
As a consequence to sustain their ideas philosophers use historical events or everyday lifeor biological situations .
Hegel shows the competition relations between men by a comparison with animals .
Facts are a way to learn and understand more efficiently theories and concepts .

Facts are more attractive than theorical ideas > They are more tangible and theories can be verified by that way .
In fact , communism theories have been their pre-conceved economic ideas questionned by facts .
And liberalism theories have been successfull regrding history .
As a result , facts are more efficient than concepts and ideas as they can show their negative consequences .

In a nutshell , facts are essential in a pedagogic method or to examine theories regarding their effciency .
But theories sseem to be very important as facts are the tools to critize them .
In fact , what would be the use of facts if there were no concepts and ideas at all .
