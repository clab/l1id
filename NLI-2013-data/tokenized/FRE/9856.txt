To be successful , we need some challenges and new idea to attract people attention on what is being developped .
In fact , Bill Gates who is the richest man in the world has been able to do so by developping its idea of computer , which is being use around the world as a communication tool .
By doing so with some friends , he is not only has the copy right , but also he has put the world in a new era : rapid communication .
Since he was the only one with this new idea , anyone else who needs to use its products has to buy his rights or products .
If he were someone who was afraid to take risk , he will not drop out of school to pursue its dream .

Life in itself is a risk .
We , as human , need to go forward by deeping in our vast background knowledge to determine for example the cause of cancer and a way to prevent or cure it .
We have the knowledge .
But we need to take risk to spend some times and money to discover some new formulas and save the world .

For example , When you open a Guiness Book , only people who have invented a new product or come with the origina ideal or attend what was never beed reached before are in it .
It never mention anywhere the second or the third .
Appollo is an example .
Until today , I cannot remember the second person who was on the moon .

If you do something every body , you miss the `` WOW '' effect .
People will not be focus on your work because it si already on the market .
However , they will welcome your new idea , finance it if needed , and be ready to buy it .

Therefore , risk taker are the best way to succeed .
