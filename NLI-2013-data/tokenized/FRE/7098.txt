During the twentieh century , cars have been in the very heart of the occidental society .
Since the early 1920's , the number of individual vehicles had increased sharply .
But today , many question themselves about the future of this kind of transportation .
Will there be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today ?
I believe there will , for three main reasons : firstly because of a ressources run out , secondly because of environmental considerations , and eventually for pratical , technical reasons due to the amount of space left .

I would start by pointing out a problem which is widespoken about in the media in these days , that is to say the lack of gas ressources .
A recent study showed that if the Chinese had as many cars as the average American , these Chinese cars will consume all the gas production on earth .
That underlines a serious problem : there is not enough gas on this planet to allow everybody to have one 's own car .
And this , I think , prevents cars from being this century 's personal transportation .
Even though it has been tried to build cars running on hydrogen , the tests that were made have shown it would be much more expensive , much more dangerous , and much less efficient than gas .
The lack of ressources is the first reason for which I believe there will be far fewer cars in twenty years .

Furthermore , cars running on gas have had a terrible effect on our planet 's environment for the last century .
People are slowly getting aware of that , even if it sometimes turns into real chestnuts , especially in French cities where 4x4 owners are told to be the main helpers of pollution , while there are plenty of other reasons .
Yet , it is a fact that cars pollute much , and that we are very unlikely to find a cleaner efficient ressource .

Finally , there is one very simple but crucial problem about cars , that is not as currently underlined as the lack of gas is : the lack of space .
Let 's say that each single person in Beijing , for instance , own one 's personal car .
What would happen ?
We all have in mind the images of Beijing 's , or Tokyo 's incredibly crowded streets .
How will how these people do to park their car , or even to get out milliom-car traffic jams with it ?
Shall we turn the whole world into a gigantic parking lot ?
This problem is already happening in developped countries 's largest cities , such as Tokyo and New-York City .
Let 's face it , it would be a disaster if everyone owns one 's car in less developped countries 's immense cities , let 's say New Delhi or Johannesburg , where the infrastructures will certainly be poor , according to these cities 's development .
In twenty years , th Earth will be crowded enough without any need for hundred-kilometer traffic jams .

By way of conclusion , I would say that cars are definetely not our future , and that one should concentrate on improving public transportation .
