It is usually admited that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Because of their youth , people enjoy life doing many things like travelling , going to night clubs , seeing friends .
They often do not have health problem to deal with .
They can make sport as much as they want .
They believe that they have the whole life in front of them , that everything can be done .
Youth is the time of positive believes .

Contrary to this open state of mind , old people usually believe that they are too old for doing things they used to do when they were young .

However , I believe that it is not because someone is young that he or she is going to enjoy life more than someone older .
It depends on the people .
We are all different and we all live our life the way we want to .

As an example we can take an overwhelmed situation : a seventy year old person , who has many energy , who is open - minded and happy to live , eats well-balanced meals , who has always done sport in his or her life , can enjoy life more than a twenty year old one who spends his or her time in front of television as a couch potato , who has got neither friends nor job and feels unhappy .

Furthermore , an old person can have accumulate much more money than a young one .
Thus if money is important to live for both people , the older one would enjoy life much more than the younger one .

Finally , a sixty year old person does not have to work anymore contrary to the twenty year old one who , then , do not have the time to enjoy life as the first one does .

As a conclusion we can say that it is not the age which makes life enjoyable or not , it is rather the people , their way of living , of thinking ...
In my opinion , every people in good health can enjoy life .

Last but not least , we all have different ways to enjoy life .
