First of all , it has to be metioned that the concept of ` enjoying life ' is dramatically different for a teenager and for an older person .
Even if this concept should be present in life from the cradle to the grave .

On the one hand , it is generally accepted that young people are physically more capable than older people .
As a result , they will normally not enjoy life by doing the same kind of things .
Indeed , going out in a club on saturday night is surely quite unusual for most elderly people .
They may prefer to travel on an organized trip or to read a good book .
Older people also have the advantage of being retired , which allows them to have more time for leisure , holidays abroad , etc ,

On the other hand , young people usually have less experience in life and have a tendency to make `` youth mistake ' .
They are usually less wise in making decisions and will sometimes face a lot of problems .
Furthermore , young people get more and more responsabilities as they become older .
for instance , the ones who study have to attend classes regularly , to do homework , to write a memoire or a these on a particular subject .
Others will have to work , to care for their children or face money problems .
Indeed , generally speaking , older people tend to have less money problems because they are not menaced by unemployment and mainly have their accomodation mortgage paid .
Undeniably , less responsabilities give you more time to enjoy life .

However , in my opinion , enjoying life is not really a matter of age , I feel that quotes like `` life begins with 40 '' are totally wrong .
For me , life begins every morning when you wake up .

In conclusion , we were all given the choice to do what we want with our life and should take advantage of this opportunity .
Life is short and enjoying it every single day , regardless of either you are young or old is definitely a conditio sine qua none to happiness .
