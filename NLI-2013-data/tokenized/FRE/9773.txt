It is hard to agree or disagree with such a statement .
In my opinion it is obviously a double edge statement .
First of all it depends on the way one may define the expression `` successful people '' .
What does `` being successful '' mean ?
Someone who does something well is successful .
Howvever it is true that if you understand the expression `` successful people '' as being rich then the statement might be relevant .
Let 's take the example of financial markets .
The more risks you take the more money you can earn .
This is what is happening nowadays and what can explain the growing number of financial mecanisms .
The success , or the money here , is considered as a counterpart of th risk one may have taken .
It does n't necessarily mean that people who simply do what they already know to do well are not successful , in fact it means that one may become even more successful taking risks .

Nevertheless , in this case success is not assured .
And the statement is a double edge one in that sense as well .
The more risk you take the more you can loose .
As a consequence the statement could turn out to be reversed .

Finally , taking risks is even different from trying new things .
Trying new things is not necessarily very risky .
And successful in this case could be understood as `` recognized '' , by society for example .

For instance , an inventor .
Someone who invents objects or who discovers phenomenas , because he is very smart and because he has tried to go beyond what he already knew , will be considered as a successful person and will be recognized and remembered as a successful person .

As a conclusion , I would say the relevance of the statement depends on the definition one can give to the words and the way you understand it .
