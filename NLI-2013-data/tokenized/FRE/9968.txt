In this point of statement , i think is difficult to people who try new thing take risk .
I disagree with statement because i think people try new thing have lot of avantages than only doing what they already know how to do well because when you try a thing likes cloth or shoes they can see if it 's good or not and if it is their size .
But only doing what they already know how to do well is extremely difficult and take risk , they just feeling if that product is good .
It 's not usually feeling show that product is good even though it is new .
The second one they can not taste it .
Maybe , after bought new think without taste and go home at far place where things were bought what whould they do ?
There many disavantage when they only doing what they already know how to do well .
I prefer try new things before , at least i would make more
