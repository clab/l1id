i think this statement is absolutely right .
when we face it we have to realize that there are less successful people than average people .
why ?
the question is why one people is succesful and the other is not .
because the succesful people have tried something that no one tried before or maybe ever tried but not as well as the succesful people did .
This means that to be sucessful you have to try something which has never be done before or work and focus more on something than other people .
For instance , why did the stars become so famous ?

At the beginning a celebrity is a person like anybody else but to become famous she has to make a movie original , try something which is gonna work something special maybe somethign that nobody has made before .
She or he has to be very imaginative .
The risk taken will bring her or him at the top or maybe down but the risk was taken .

An another example maybe more reliable. a scientist is a person who need to take huge risk to have the chance to find something to cure illness or something else .
what would we have discovered if none of scientist , chirurgian and doctors took risks .

The response is easy we wouldn t have discovered anything .
they tried something new for the cancer research for example and took risk to find something out .
It is the same stories all over again for other sectors or other professions , you can t get sucess just in doing the same things than others do .
you have to have your own personality , you have to be different in a lot of ways somehow , you must take risk , you must try until you get what you want or until you suceed .

in my opinion you can t be successful is your just get into the stream , you must get out of the stream and follow your own strategy , experiment new things and bet on risks .
you might suceed or not but at least you would have tried .
