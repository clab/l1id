I disagee , for me the best way to travel is by your slef .
Becose traveling in a group leded by a tour guide il not comfurmtabeul , and he will take you to the most touristique place , the most expensive pleases .

If you go allowne you will be abule to see the real parte of the cultur and the rieal peapul .
For exampeul , if you go to India with a guide he or she , will chow you the monumunt 's but not the villigis ...

You will not be aibul to teaste every thing becose thay will teal you that you will be sick ...
But if you go allowne you can take your time in the stors and in the monumints ...

If you go allowne you can talk to how you want ...
you can give monny to the needy , but if you go wiyh a guide he ou she , will teal you not to give them anny thing .

Som peapl licke to be allowne .
In a bus you ar not allowne and there are smells , a chidran crining ...
Wen you go by your self , you are more relaxte then in a bus ...

A guide will teal you to harry up and teak photos , but you are on a oliday , and you wante to take your time rith ?

If you go by your sel with just a travel bag you will meak meny contaks , riche and poueur peapel ...
you will lurne muche more by going by your self .
The poueur peapeul will com and beg more wen they see a goupe of with peapel then wen they see juste own .

So that is wy I disagee with the facte of traveling in a group leded by a guide .
