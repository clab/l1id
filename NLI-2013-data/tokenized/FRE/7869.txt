There is no best way to travel .
Both in group and individually travelling enlightens .
Nonetheless , I personally prefer by far the individual travel experience .
My prime argument for this conviction comes from personal experience .
As a frequent traveller , I love to discover .
The challenge of exploring pathes no traveller has walked , inspires my discoveries .
Contrary to travelling in group no tour guide will be able to decide where to go or when to leave .
This exalting freedom is essential to enrich the travel experience .

Secondly , though the security of a group travelling through well-known ground is appealing , the level of discovery is enhanced by reaching remote areas .
Once out in more distant regions , security becomes less a concern .
While few foreigners travel to these regions , curiosity from the local population is more widespread than criminal behavior .
I would even believe that a travelling group would attract more attention of a criminal than an individual wanderer .

Of course , many will state that without a good tour guide you might miss out some essential sightseeing locations of a visited area .
This lack of knowledge of the region , however , can easily be compensated by hiring an individual guide for short trips or by relying on the excellent insights of guide books such as ` The lonely planet ' .

Last but not least , I strongly recommend to travel indivudually because it enables true contact with local populations .
As a group under the leadership of a tour guide , you will probably meet with the population used to communicate with tourists .
Shopowners , the family of the tour guide , ...
will not give you the genuine impression of the country you visit .
A narrow perspective from a tourist-minded population will be the result .
As an individual traveller the chances exist that a true relationship between indivuduals can emerge .
As an example I recall the conversation with the farmer with whom I shared lunch during his break in the ricefields of Indonesia .
He elaboratly explained me his life and his misery .
This is an unique experience impossible to accomplish in a tour guide travel experience .

In conclusion , although tour guides do an excellent job securing and informing their guests , individual travelling has my predelection .
The discovery of remote areas and the enlightment of personal encounters have inspired my frequent travels .
