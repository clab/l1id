Gone are the days when grandparents were taken in charge by their children .
A lot of people are nowadays under the impression that young people are less and less helping their communities .
However , in the view of the actual situation we can say that the community life has deeply changed .
Thus , I think that young people are as involved in this community life as before , but in a different way .

Firstly , we must consider the every day life of the young people , which enable them to help their communities .
For example , there are a lot of jobs that are directly related to the community .
The growing part of ageing people in our society brings out a need of assistance , this trend generates jobs , which can be considered as helping the community and are really favoured by unemployed young people .
This way of helping is all the greater as it is supported by the government : it created some jobs of educators in suburbs .
These jobs are designed for young people they know well this environnment , and are really helpful for their communities .

Secondly , there are a lot of young people who are working as volunteers in caritative associations : for example , a lot of students want to give a sense to their life by this way .
Some french caritative associations like Emmaus or Secours Populaire are now overcrowded by volunteers who want to act for social reinsertion of homeless people .
The recent demonstrations of young people in France also demonstrate that they want to be concretely involved in the evolution of their society .
This fundamental possibility and this political awareness shows their great desire to help their communities .

The young people are currently helping their communities in a different way than before : they are now quite independent , and they are no more asked by their parents for help .
Nevertheless , they choose to be involved in associations or they favour jobs that are useful for the community .
