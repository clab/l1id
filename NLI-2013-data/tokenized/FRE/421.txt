In our society , education is a main issue .
On the one hand , people think that the education should promote a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
On the other hand , people think that society needs more specialists .
However I believe that we should specialize in one specific subject .

One reason for my belief is that we are all generalist .
We have all a knowledge on everything .
This knowledge is more or less accurate , it depends on the person .
For example , when I have an headache , I never go to the doctor , I only take an aspirin .
I have a whole knowledge on medicine care .

Another reason for my belief is that the society needs to increase its knowledge .
Specialist are the only people who are able to entertain to the development of the society .
Others copy what they have learn form the specialist .
For instance when I am ill I need the doctor , for his advice .
But after , when I have the same ill I just need to take the medicine drug .

Finally , specialist are the actors of the development of the society .
With their sharp knowledge in only one field , they are the only people who are at the border between what has been discovered and what has not yet been discovered , in this field .
To illustrate a researcher in developement of a product for a firm .
He has no concrete idea of what he will create because there are nothing similar uim society .
But he is sure that is new product had never exist before .
This product represent a new thing to add in the human culture .

Society have a lot of generalist , but few specialist .
Because society needs more specialist and because I prefer to be useful for the society , I would rather to be a specialist .
