I agree with this statement , students must more understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
One moment can amphasize my agreement , evry time teatchers are asqued their students if they understand and if they having questions .
Question like this was asked and will be asked by teachers to know if students understand leaning material .

By understandng ideas and concepts students can use these knowledge more productively .
It 's give possibility to apply ideas and concepts in another domain .
Only if the students understand ideas an concepts , they will be able keep them for a long time in their life and transmit them so clairly .
For example seriouly undestanding basis of physic may be applyed to build roads in thery bad geological conditions .
We know that knowledge of physic permit mankind to fly to cosmos .

Contrariwise , leaning facts can help some times but no so effectivly like understanding ideas an concepts .
Here , it difficult to use learning facts .
Because here information seems superficially to be applyed in a given domain .

Therefore , the very important attention may be done in the understandind of ideas and concepts than in learning facts .
It must be a credo of teatching .
And this approch will be transmitted from generation to generation of teatchers .
Only like that thde teaching will stay an art .
