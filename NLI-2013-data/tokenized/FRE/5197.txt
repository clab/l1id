Advertisements is a important part in selling products and a good advertisements will bring benefits .
This statement is controversial , in the one hand the advertisements often show a good product , better than the other and the cheapest of the range .
In the other hand , some brands are well known , has loyal customers and does not want to lose them by showing products better than they are .
However , my personal point of view think that most advertisements make products seem much better than in the reality .

Firstly , before going any further , I would like to give an example which comes in my mind , the washing powder on advertisements can fight against everything like ice cream on a jean or fruit juice pour on a tee shirt .
Moreover , the washing powder can wash efficiently in a cold water so people can save money .
According to me , this example seems exagerate to sell a product .

Secondly , some advertisements put the best product in the advertisement but show the price of a low range product .
The goal is to show that everybody can afford to have a good brand .
Everybody has already seen a car advertisement , we can see the price written in big and the thing that nobody can see is written in small letters .

Thirdly , advertising campaigns are very expensive , they use to call actors to show up the products , some professionnals are here to take the best photos they can and the best advertisement to show on television .
For instance , when a child acts for a cookie , he always enjoys the product and argue next to her mother to buy this delicious cookies .
The advertisement wants to reproduce the scene at home , and generally it works .

In a nutshell , I am totally convinced that nowadays , to have market shares , advertisements are definitely fake and they show products better than the reality .
