Do young people enjoy life more than older people ?
This is a difficult question to answer for anyone , since you lack experience about this when you are young , and often forget how it was before when you are old .
Still , I will try to give my point of view on the subject .

Young people have a lot of reason to enjoy life .
They are young , healthy , active and their life is still before them .
Most of the time young people have objectives , and they are planning their life to fullfil them .
For exemple , some are looking for the best way to get to the top of their firm , others are planning to marry and have children , etc .
In the same time , they have the ability to do exciting and physically demanding activities like sports , extreme or not .
From my point of view , being young gives a very positive attitude , and the feeling that nothing is impossible and that with efforts you can achieve whatever you planned .

On the contrary , being old is , i think , much more depressing .
That is the time where illness begin to spread among people of your age .
You do not work anymore , so you have plenty of spare time but you are not healthy enough to plainly enjoy it .
You still have objectives , but you begin to think that perhaps you will not have the time to achieve it .
All of this is does not give a very positive attitude toward life .

As I have clearly explained , I think that most of the time young people enjoy life more than old people do .
Still , I would like to point out that everything is not as simple as it seems .
For exemple , for several years now unemployment has been a great factor of depression for young people .
In the meantime , people are living longer every generation , and the progress of medicine keep people healthy until an advanced age .
That gives a lot of time to enjoy your free time when you are old , to travel to other countries or to improve in your hobbies , which is very positive .

As a conclusion , I would say that I think that being youg gives a more positive attitude to life , but that what matters most is your personnal belief in the good sides of life , and you will enjoy your life whatever your age is .
