With the decision of the governor of California to sue the biggest car-makers , the burning issue of the environmental effects of car driving seems to occupy once again the front of the political stage .
But this question is not a new one .
Indeed , for many years now , we have seen the environmentalists to support the idea that we will no longer make an extensive use of ours cars if we want to secure the future of our planet .
However , on the other hand , the petroleum and car-makers lobbyists try to explain us that we do not have any other altenative right now .
To my mind I think ( or perhaps I hope ) that the number of what we called today cars will experience an important decrease while in the same time another kind of '' car '' will emerge .

Indeed , with the rise of the new giants in the world economy I think that we will no have the choice to adapt our everyday life to environmental constraints or not .
The reason here is simple : these new world champions are currently trying to narrow the gap between the Occidental standards of living and their standards of living .
This implies that they will adopt the same means of transportation than in Occidental countries .
In other words they would want to have one car per person .
And we obviously know that this is impossible because the environmental damages would be so huge that it will but in danger humanity as a whole .
But as far as I am concerned , I do not want to believe that we will slowly continue to destroy our planet without doing anything .
I prefer rather to think that , like in the past , we are going to adapt to this new situation and that the human creativity will help us to find a solution .

And this solution will probably be the creation of a new kind of car , a pollution-free one .
Precisely , if we took attention to what currently happens in the car-making industry we can see some evidences that this prediction will occurs .
Effectively , we can already see some cars which are fueled with both gasoline and colza which accounts for more than twenty percent of the cars which are currently in use in Brazil .
Moreover , it also exists some engines which are runned by hydrogen or electricity instead of fuel .

To put it in a nutshell I definitely prefer to think that human being will succeed in creating a pollution-free way of transportation , the '' new cars '' , rather than to think that we will all disappear because of our
