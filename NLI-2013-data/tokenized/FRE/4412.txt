The purpose of advertising a product is to make it known to the public , to claim its benefits and to induce potential customers to buy the product .
Advertisements come in different forms and through different media : TV , radio , Internet , posters on streets , displays in stores and hand-outs in public spaces .
Furthermore , advertisments can be targeted to a specific group of people ( women , children , elderly ) or can interest the entire population .
Whatever the means of the advertisement , an ad wants to convey a certain image and to convince people through wise usage of colors , words , shapes , sizes and people used in the ad .

With my definition of advertisment , I agree with the statement saying that `` most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are '' .
Advertisements usually only display the advantages and upsides of a product or service , and do not show its flaws .
Even if the product or service does not have any faults , it will mos probably be shown in its best or even enhancing light in the ad .

An example that I often encounter is advertisements for low cost flights .
Web-sites and and airlines companies often advertise very low flight ticket prices .
However , the price is never what it is claimed to be .
The prices advertised always omit fuel and tax surcharges , are restricted to specific dates - on which most people do not wish to fly , and often do not allow passengers to travel with luggage without extra costs .
So even though low cost tickets may seem attractive , they often end up costing the same amount of money as other tickets once everything is paid for .

Another good example constitutes fad diets .
Fad diets are popular diets , followed by many men and women in the US , and are usually advertised through books , TV ads and Internet pop-ups .
Fad diets show healthy and smiling people eating whatever the diet prescribes and losing weight over short periods of time .
The ads however do not describe how difficult it actually is to follow that diet , how painful it may be and how easy it is to re-gain the weight just lost .
They do not either display how expensive the diet is and often do not warn od secondary effects , such as depression , self-image troubles and eating disorders .

Consequentially , I concur that advertisements are misleading and do not convey the real value of the product or service advertised .
Even though there is an increasing number of regulations to stop advertisers from lying in ads , customers keep on being lurred by the shining image that ads give of certain products .
