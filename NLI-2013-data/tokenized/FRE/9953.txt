`` You 'll never regret the risks you have taken '' ...
This is one of my way of thinking and living .

I completely agree with the statement .
You have to try new things and even take some risks if you want to be successful .
During our life , everybody has to make some choices which will completely influence their future .
The human being is never complete .
We always have to learn new things to go on .
Our mind is like a computer which need more and more informations to work .
The life is a succession of choices which increase our knowledge .
We also have to share our knowledge with other people who want to grow up .

If we want to perform in a particular field , we have to be ready to learn always more and more until we 'll feel really confident about it .

Every popular icon has had to take some risks to become somebody famous and regognized by the others .

But this way of thinking does n't only apply for the richest or world famous people of our planet .
It 's also avalaibable for the average citizen who wants to succeed or to do something from his life .
During our carrier , we are often confronted to make some choices which can influence the future .
We do n't have to be affraid of change .
When we choose to do something we can only grow up and we will not go back to our initial statement .
We do n't have to consider the fear but the proudness of our choice .

If the risk to take seems to high , we can share the idea with some members of our family or co-workers .
There will always be an experimented person who will give us the good advice to go on .

Like the animals , the human being has to follow his instinct .
