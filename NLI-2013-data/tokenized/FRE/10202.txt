Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I agree with the following statement .
I think that trying new things is good for the world and help us to do better and have a better life .
People who know about one topic want to change what they know .
For example the scientists already know a lot of things about the deseases but they are still struggling to give us a better life and better chance to stay alive .
The successful people are successful because they demonstrate a new things for the life on earth .
They want to know more because they want to improve the quality of life and also earn lot of money .
We have computers since a long time but every time people work on it to improve it and make it easy for us to work .
I think that the world is running and all the things in this world have to run too .
At the past we had the airplanes but they are not like those for today .
People make it faster and agreable for customers .
They take risks because they believe in what they are doing .
As a result they win the challenge and make a lot of money .
By trying new things they are learning new things and they use those things to create special machines .
At the past we had a telephone which was big and was very uncomfortable .
People worked to improve the quality of outgoing and incoming call and the size because they want to simplify our life .
Now we have a small telephone which is called cellphones .
We do not need to stay at home to receive a call .
With this new technology of wirelless and other i can have my with me and go out .
i 'm able to have a call .
Those new things became reality because people try new things take risks .
Those people could not do research and today we will not have all this kind of machines .
Also they are trying new things because they know that they could make money .
I agree with the statement .
