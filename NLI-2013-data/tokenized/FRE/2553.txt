As a young man i 'll logicaly say that younger people enjoy more life than older people .
why it as always been a better feeling to be young .
when you are young , in ; ost of case life is totally unknowne and so life is like a jungle you just keep walk into it without thinking about the futur .
You really just thinking of having pleasure .
And holder personn wo n't have the same state of mind for sure .
By definition somebody whois hold has been the past young and have already discover life and her pleasures , and so wo n't be as surprise by the world as a young man .

Another difference is simply natural .
A young men or women will have more energy to do more things than older men or women just because health situation .
Hold people also have more respnsabilitie in every day life , in there jobs or with their familie .
The second part of the text will defend a different point of view .
why ca n't hold people have pleasure .
just like young peole .
when youare young life is n't perfect and you cannot do what you want , when you want .
some ofthe things that you cannot do by being young are avaible to hold persons just because of their age and their experience .
When you are hold you also take life as a defferent angle and just as a `` squarre '' , for example you can build a family or start a business .
Those things doesn ` t need you to be young and healthier , but sometimes educate and experienced ...

to conclude I ay that there is not an age where you 'll have more pleasure
