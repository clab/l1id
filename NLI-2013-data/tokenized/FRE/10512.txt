At first sight , I think successful people have to take risks because it is important , when we manage everywhere , to try new things to see if we succeed in these .
The failure would not be grave .
When you are the possibility to do something you do not know , you must do it .
Although successful people are proud of them and do not change what they represent , it would be interessant for them to try other thing , to show that they are able to do something that they do not know , in order to prove their actual possibilities and value .
On the one hand , the fact they do something new , shows that they want to research the difficulty and become interessant persons who do not stop at they know already do .
Their lives have not to be borring .
Doing what we already know does not permit to meet new circumstances and events .
Taking risks stresses our volonty .
Some people who decide to try new things understood that the life is interesting so long as we want meet the surprises of the life .
For that we have to take risks when we have the possibility .
On the other hand , doing only what you already know , prevent you from discovering something which would please you .
To put it in a nutshell , take risk , it is live , when we are successful , because we have the possibility to manage the new things that we do .

On second thought , it is a security for the persons to do only what we know to do .
Somebody are not really keen on discovering new way of living and coming into the daily .
I respect this point of view .
Successful people can continue their life by doing what they already do .
In the meanwhile , to my mind , I would like to encourage successful people to take risks because it is important for them .
