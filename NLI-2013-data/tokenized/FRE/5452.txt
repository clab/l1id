Advertisement has been increasing a lot during the last 30 years .
Doest it work or is it just an illusion ?
Knowing how much money companies are willing to put in advertisement I have to say it must work .
Now there is some more reasonable ways of responding to the question .

We coud talk about packaging fo instance .
Between to products that offer the same thing , that are at the same price , I would rather choose the best looking one .
For me the product aspect reflects its real quality .
In this case the true problem is comparison .

I do n't think you make a product seem better than it really is , the point is making the product seem better as the other products !
I think this is really working .

There is another way of advertising a product : getting the buyer to know the product before he even gets to buy it : advertising in magazines , television ...
In my mind this may be more efficient because the buyer wo n't necessarily compare the product to the other ones .
He will just get in the store and search for that exact product because he has been told it is the best .

In this case it is true that advertisement is used to make the product seem better than it really is .
Now is it really working ?
It depends on the price of the product .
If you buy only once something really expensive you will really look into advertisement because you ca n't predict the quality of the product with previous ones .
Now if it 's a cheap product that you buy every week , I think advertising has no influence except the first time .
In fact buying the same product lots of time ables you to compare the real quality of the product .
