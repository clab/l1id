I am totally agree with this statement .
I am agree with , firstly because I am a forensic scientist , and so during my formation , we had to learn things of all academic branches .
For example physics , biology , chemistry , law , etc .

But more seriously , it 's really important to have a good instruction , it permits you to express yourself about a lot of conversation and so to speak with a lot of people from various speciallities .
It is not only usefull for public relations , you can use it when you watch TV or read the newspaper , too .
Sometimes it 's already really difficult for me to understand what they are talking about on the news on TV .

One other thing is that today , with all the media we have , it become really easy to learn about a lot of academic fileds , not really deaply , it 's sure , but sufficiently to understand how the world is going .

I can understand people who wo n't open their mind to other fields .
I am of these kind when you are talking about business or politics .
In fact we ca n't be interested in everything , but we can interest ourself in so a lot of thing that it would be a shame to not profite of this opportunity .

Just to put a tragic accent at this essay , we can say that the lack of knowledge is what as conduct to all the extrem nations our world has known as the fascismus or the really hard communism as in ancient Sovietic Union .
In fact , if Hitler had learned to know the juves and if the inhabitants of the ancient Sovietic Union had known what was going on outside the Union , these `` terror `` nations would n't have live so long !

To conclude , the lack of knowledge is nowadays unjustified and it 'll be something bad to not profite of the opportunities we have .
It 's about time to open our minds .
