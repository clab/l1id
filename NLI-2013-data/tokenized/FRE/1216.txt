I think it is really important nowadays to have many academic subjects .
Indeed , a person who have different skilled can easily understand different point of view in a company .
This understanding is really necessary for people who is an manager .
He has to managed people , suppliers , to understand consumers , to take decisions for his company .
For example he has to take financial decisions which are really important in a company if he does not take in account all the advantages or drawbacks of his decisions .

The survey of the company can be in danger .
Moreover , we can take the example of an individual entrepreneurs as a director of a restaurant .
If the director do not have knowledge in cooking , the cooker can do everything he wants .
This kind of advantage can be dangerous for the director because he does not really understand all about his own restaurant .
I think that sometimes is really necessary to have knowledge in different types of subjects even if we are specialized in on or few specifics subjects .

Furthermore , it can be really interesting to somebody to have different academic sujects not only for working but to his own .
As for me , I think we can have both , knowledge of many academic subjects and be specialized in on specific subject .
Both can be an advantage , a strenght .
Everything is changing so fast so people have to understand rapidly why and how things change to take efficient decision for a company .
