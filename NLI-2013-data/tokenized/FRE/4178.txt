I believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Obviously some young people do , but not enough of them .

First , I believe it is very important for young people to learn compassion .
And what better way to understand what compassion is than by practising it by helping your community .
Adolescence is a shaping time for a person .
It is probably the best moment to learn to help others .
By doing so , young people learn to become mature and good adults .
Many wars have probably been declared because adults leading a country had not been sufficiently exposed to helping others when they were younger .
Therefore , training great adults is only possible by training young people to help their community .

Second , if young people were spending more time helping their communities , they would be better integrated in it and they would show greater respect for their elders and neighbours .
We can observe many examples of what happens when young people lack respects for their community in most developped countries nowadays .
In France , early 2006 , sworms of young people from the ghettos around Paris and other large cities burnt cars and broke into shops .
This young people do not spend time helping their community .
Instead , they commit petty crimes and spend their days doing in their ghettos .
It is difficult to imagine that nobody needs help in those areas .
Another example are the gangs in many cities in the US .
There , young people spend their time killing other gangs rather than helping their community .

Third , in my experience , very few young people actually help their communities nowadays .
If I count how many people have been helping their community among the young people I met so far , they are very few .
I guess that the lack of incentives and the continuous pressure of our society tends to push young people toward enjoying themselves , avoiding work and taking an easy time .

To conclude , I would say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community .
However , it would be beneficial for them and their community as young people but as future adults as well .
