For several years the price of the gas has been increasing .
It had made people change their habits .
And because there is no evidence that it will decrease soon , people have started to change their habits .
First they are more likely to use common transports than they were in the past .
Also they use less their cars for small ride .
I think this trend will keep going and that year after year , people will use their cars fewer and fewer , only because gas is becoming to expensive .

Some cities try to encourage their citizens to drop the car .
For example in Paris , the mayor 's policy is to develop the use of public transports and to reduce the use of cars .
So for several years , buses have their own lines in the streets to be quicker and not stopped by the traffic , the days of big pollution there are restriction of the vehicules admitted in the streets , and parking ' price is cheaper for the resident so their cars do n't move .
This policy makes it so difficult to drive in the streets of Paris that I assume many people will drop the car either for a bike or a scooter than for public transports .
Of course people living in the countryside are not concerned by this policy .
But other projects , on the national level , try to incite them to buy clean cars , or having a more responsable use .

Of course this policy is difficult to accept for some people who do not feel concerned about the environmental problems .
For the youth such I , protecting the environment is a major issue , we have been taught on this topic since childhood .
But for the older , it does n't seem like a real problem such as war , economy or unemployment .
So they keep using their cars a lot .
In twenty years , when the actual youth we 'll be the older , they wo n't be acting like that because of their education .
Personnaly , I 'll use my car as less as possible .
