There is a phrase that says : Getting old begins when regrets replace dreams .

On one hand , it is true that young people are more able to enjoy their life than older ones .

When you have almost your entire life before you and you can make a lot of plans for your future .
The youngest people do not already have to many reponsabilities like children or work and they have more time to enjoy their own life .
For example , I want to go and study in Australia for the next semester and I am sure I am going to enjoy me stay and maybe me life there .
In our days , there is a lot of ways to entertain .
Young people can enjoy it because they are still physically able to do so .

Indeed , young people can do more sports , walk on the mountains , surf , parties etc .
That is a way not to find their life too boring .

On another hand , I think that being old is a beautiful thing because they can see their childlren growing up , help , advise and support them as much as they can .
And they also can enjoy visits from their grandchildren which is certainly a bit magic for anybody .

A lot of old people do travel a lot once retired and really like it .
It is much easier to make trips , see new people , make even short-term plans for your life .
I know a friend of my grandmother who is travelling all the time over the world and I think she enjoys her life a lot in discovering all these countries .
I will spend a lot of time to the same .
But when people are working during 30 , 40 years or more , they cannot travel this much and enjoy the possibility of traveling by plane wherever you want .

Finally , I think that older people can enjoy their life as much as young people .
We all aim to find happyness in our own way and the question is : How to find it ?
Who with ?
There are as many awsers as there are individuals .
