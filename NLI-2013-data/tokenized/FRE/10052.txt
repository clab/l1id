First , we have to analize what is a successful person .
In a general way , it is somebody who realize something which makes him richer in a psychic or material way .
Do we need to act in a creative and brave manner to be successful ?
Is it necessary to show all those vertues to be successful ?
Is it the only condition to be successful ?

In one hand , successsful people need to be recognized to be considered as successful .
So , it means that recognition is mandatory to be successful .
In the other hand , somebody may have a lot of vertues and those two mentioned before and however being unrecognized .
It is possible for people to try new and dangerous things like basejump , but without being outstanding and recognized , this person is not yet successful , only in a private manner like in his family which I would not call successful .

The second issue to look after is if it is possible to get successful without any of those vertues .
First , a successful person can show only one of those vertue and be successful .
Somebody creating new show but based on the same rules as another great and successful show can make him successful without taking any risks .
And somebody can risk his life all the time doing the same thing , as a circus member , and then becoming famous and successful .
Finally without any of those vertues , somebody can heird everything from another and get indirectly successful .

We have seen that success is not related to the vertues enounced in the statement .
Then , I would say that anybody can be successful , however it is not linked to any will of the person but it is due to other factor dependant on environment .
In spite of the possible random of the success , the person must act in a certain manner to attract the success knowing that could be in vain .
