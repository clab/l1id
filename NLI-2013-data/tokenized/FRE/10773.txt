Many people are trying to find the way that leads to a successful life .
The proposed theory means that to be successful you have to dare doing new things instead of focusing on what you already know to do well .
I do not agree with such a thesis .

First , many people are successful only by doing what they know how to do well .
If you do things better than others do , you have great chances to succeed in your project .
For instance , a lot of sport champions only focus on their sport and do not lose time besides .
For example , Roger Federer , the current best tennis player in the world , was learnt tennis since he was very young and went on in this way which lead him to success .
Whereas a lot of well known singers who tried to play in films did not manage in this way and went back to what they did well .

Neverlethess , many amazing success story happened to people who tried to do something new .
For instance , the famous former tennis player Yannick Noah , after a good carrier as a tennis player , has become a very famous singer .

Consequently , if I do not really agree with the thesis I have to acknowledge that it is possible to be successful in other field that the one you are meant to .
So , my point is that even if you are doing well in something , this does not mean that you can do well eslewhere .
On the contrry , I think that people who have been successful in the field they were prepared for have better chances to have great achivements in others fields because they have been learnt how to commit in a project , to be professional and to believe in themselves .
