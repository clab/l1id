I do agree on this following statement .
We all know it can be very hard to succeed in our work , in our plans of life , in our career .
It demands a lot of work and an entire contribution .
This is the price to pay to become successful .
The sensation of having succeeded something is really unique and it makes us feel we have accomplished something we have always wanted to happen .
Life is too short and all of us should have many goals in life .
Once an goal is reached , we can profite from it as much as we want but why not continue ???

Take the example of a baker .
He manages to open his first bakery in town after many months or years of working on this very difficult project .
Finally the bakery is a real success , but he thinks one is enough work to do .
I think he should continue and expand his business by opening one in another town nearby .
Of course he has the risk of failing but imagine the fantastic sensation of victory if his second bakery is as much as successful as the first one .

Wanting to be successful does n't concern only our work and career plans , it can also be in our family lives .
Successful people are right to try new things so they wo n't have any regret on what they did .
Life is too short to live without any risk .
But concerning the fact of taking risks to be successful , we have to be very careful on what it implies .
Some people are too ambitious and it can have very negative effects .
There is no need to put our family or ourselves in danger only because we want to achieve something new .
We have to think in a very realistic way before doing anything , but what a feeling if we succeed in all our accomplishments !
