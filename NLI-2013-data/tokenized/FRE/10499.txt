It has been well-established that successful people want to push their limits to the maximum and feel more and more sensations .
I will develop and explain why I believed in this statement by using two main reasons illustrated by examples .
The first reason is the money and the second one is the popularity .

It is widespread that success goes with money .
Successful people evidently are one of the part of the society where there is the less problems with money .
Indeed , some of them ( without thinking ` most of them ' ) become disgusted to have what they want , to do everything they want , to own , to buy , to offer , to live what they want to .
That is the first reason why this people try new things and take risks .
They own lots of things so they want always more and the only way for them to feel alive is to push their limits .
It is to be out of bound , to show to everybody that they can easily do what they want , more than buy what they want .

By knowing and understanding this way of thinking , it permits me to go on the second reason why they are acting as extremely as a professional skateboarder , surfer , snowboarder or others extreme sports .
It is due to their popularity .
Besides being able to buy anything they want , they are proud of their ego and of the fact that unknown people loves them .
Even though they are successful , they are also conscious on the effects they have on others who do not succeed .
And they use it to prove to everyone that they can be more than someone who succeed .
So they try new things and take unconscious risks to confirm that anyway they are a part of people they definetely succeed .

I would like to conclude that I understand them .
I do not mean I feel successful but except money and popularity I love feeling me alive by looking for new sensations , taking risks ( always under laws and rules , of course ) and prove to myself that I can do ` extra-things ' like no one else .
