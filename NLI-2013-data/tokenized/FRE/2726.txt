Today , there is a general opinion about the way young people enjoy their life , and this opinion tends to say that the young enjoy life more than older people do .
I would say that I entirely agree this opinion , for , the fact that , young people are young , gives them an advantage , because they have the strength , vitality and capability to do things that older people cannot .
For example a young man or girl can stay up all the nigth dancing and drinking in a night club ; this is something an old man could hardly do .
Moreover , the age of this young people represents an advantage , for they are ambitious , they can set themselves future purposes , in the hope to fulfill these objectives .
On the contrary , the old are always filled with the feeling that they have already make their life ; they are constantly thinking about the day of their death , and that is why , in many cases , they do not pospond themselves in the future , and adopt a dejected attitude towards life .

For all these evidences , I do persist in believing that the young enjoy life more than the old do , though the fact that you may encounter some old people who take life as it is and live it dayly , and therefore , who enjoy it more than some young people .
