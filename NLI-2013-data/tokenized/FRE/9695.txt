Why has Gandhi been so famous all around the world ?
Not only was he aware of the indian poverty and he could just have analysed the situation and published his work , but his fate was more , he has to claim for more equqlity on the planet stage and he took risks for that .
In fact everybody is able to learn from others like teachers but only people who then follow their own ways and prove to be original , which assumes taking risk , become successful people .
That is called Ambition .
Why have those famous people wnted to do more than stay on their knowledge ?
Intelligence , Innovation , Power .

First , many famous people have proved their willingness to go much deeper in the field they are interessted in .
For instance Einstein was a very bad student but fond of physics .
Thank to that passion he started sudying specific subjects related to that and discovered Relativity .
His theory was first denied in his obstination , he took risk and nowaday everyone is working on the basis of its work .
Intelligence make people focus on their interest and take risk to argue their point of view , which lead them to success .

Then , Innovation which means risk is part of a process that make someone be famous .
Look at Bill Gates , how he has improve people s lifes with Microsoft ?
This is one of the ugest innovation we have ever experience .
But this is the first step .
In order not to be forgotten , on really should continue to innovate .
Otherwise , the famous peolple die suddenly .

Finnally , what lead people to become famous id their attraction to power .
For example Nicolas Sarckosy , canditate for presidency in frence doesn t hide his which of power .
That value encourage people to take risk .
