Because I have only been young so far , I am convinced that young people seem to enjoy life in more depth that the adults or the grandparents do .
I believe that when we are children or even teenager , we have the chance to discover all the pleasure of the life and not have enough distance or experience to find reasons to not enjoy every minute of our lives .

First of all , learning by discovering brings us so much pleasure that it is hard not to be excited about .
For instance , when I think about my youth or the image I have from young people , I always see smile and imagine laugh on childrens face .

Secondly , when I look and hear about older peoples experience , I rarely observe so much good mood and pride to live .
I more often see some sadness .
This situation may be due because of todays society that tend to make things become more and more complex .
In this kind of chaos , older people often go too far to get some pleasure .
Older people tend to think too much rather than just living the moment and finding a way to enjoy .

Furthermore , when we compare an adult who always find something to complain about his work , his family or his social status , to some younger people who are not aware of those problematics , even if it by ignorance that they seem to enjoy more , they still show it .

Moreover , and in order to fulfill part of my conception of enjoying , I strongly believe that young people , because they want to learn , take more risks that their older generation .
Taking a risk is in one a way , the proof that we are enjoying the situation and that we do not try to find difficulties or reasons not to enjoy where they do not even exist .

Globally , even if children enjoy differently their lives since they can not have the ability to fully think about what enjoying really mean , they just enjoy by making life as easy as it just is .
