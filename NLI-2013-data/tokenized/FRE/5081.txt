Indeed , advertissement is one of the best ways to reach people .
But some advertissements seem the most time much better than they are really are .
In my opinoin , i agree with this statement for theses two reasons : the use of very good commercials and also the use of the celebrities persons in the commercial .

First of all , many advertisements have a really good commercials which can convince the people. , like one of the biggest problems in the USA is obesity , many of thoses commercials which want a sell a product can use a naturally skinny person to make people believe that as soon as htey will get this product they might looklike this person .
For example the increase of the production of numerous medicines to loose weight in this contry is a proof that is works but at the same time the USA still one of most important contry which has problem with weight .

Second of all , ther is a huge use of celebrities in the advertissements that gives a false image of what a product is really is .
For instance , the last campaing of Proactiv Solution which is suppose to help to relieve acne .
Personnaly , i love Jessica Simpson who is a singer and actress .
So when i saw in the commercial , i thought why not use this is my idol uses this ' it might works for me too .
So ' i use the product and im still using it but there is not such a big change like i tought .

Thus , i think that a good commercial and a use of a known person make more products look better than they are really are .
People should start to stop believe in those advertissements at hundred percent because sometimes it can work and sometimes it might not .
