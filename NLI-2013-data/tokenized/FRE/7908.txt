There are different types of travelers , those who like traveling in group led by a tour guide and the others , more courageous , who like traveling alone .
I my opinion , traveling in a group far outweights traveling alone .
There are two main reasons why I strongly agree with this statement : you travel peacefully and you do n't have to worry about where you will arrive .

Travelling is a great experience but sometimes it can be a little bit scary .
That why I prefer to travel in a group , indeed you can leave your home more peacefully and enjoy more your trip .
Furthermore you do n't have to worry about nothing because everything is organized by the tour guide .

The other reason why I certainly prefer to travel in a group is because of the tour guide .
In a the matter of fact I can be sure that he will already knows the places to visit and for sure the places to avoid .
Consequently I will not have any bad surprises or bad experiences with the native people met in the new country .
In addition the guide tour can explains clearly the culture , the importance of the monuments and the history of the unknown country .

In conclusion traveling in a group permits me to avoid the stress due to the trip and to learn more about the country I visit .
it is for thess reason i strongly recommend everyon
