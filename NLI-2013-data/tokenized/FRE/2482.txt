It 's clearly known that young people play more often than older people .
But does it means that babies and adolescents enjoy life more than their parents or their grand parents ?

I do n't think so for my part .
I do n't think that enjoying your life can only be restricted to going to parties , playing video games and taking a maximum of risk for yourself .
It really that which mainly differ young people behaviors from older people behaviors .
Many youngs think that you enjoy life when you constantly confronte your life with danger .
It 's really strange , because by definition , danger can easily catches out your life .
But it 's what many young people choose to take conscious that they are alive .

What it is essential to enjoy your life , is to have some interest points .
And I think that older people often have many .
They are often more prudents but it does n't prevent them from having hudge amount of things that they love to do .
Basically , what count is the pleasure that you are feeling when you are doing something that you like .
If it 's the case , you enjoy your life .
If a 70 years old man gets pleasure when he stays hours and hours near a lake by waiting a fish with his fisher line , it 's his fully right .
A 20 years old young man could find it so boring , but maybe the old man would find boring to go to one of his techno parties .

As a conclusion , when you grow the only thing that may change is the way that you evaluate danger .
Of course your behavior changes according to this changement in your mind .
It would be a pity for every children , if they already know that they wo n't enjoy life anymore when they will be older
