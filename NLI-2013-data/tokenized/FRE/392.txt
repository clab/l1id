I think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

Indeed , it is important not to focus on only one aspect of things and life .
The world around us is made with plenty of different things that one should be familiar with .
Having a large scale of knowledge allows us to understand almost everything that happens in our society , and therefore we do n't have to rely on others ' knowledge in order to make our own opinion .

There are many different ways of seeing things and event .
If we are able to watch things only from one point of view , we might miss the most important .
For example , when you listen to a politician you might have some economical knowledge and thus understand part of his speech .
Thus , if what he says is economically accurate you will tend to agree with him .
But if instead you have law knowledge you might understand it a totally different way and if what he says is not accurate in a law point of view , you will totally disagree with him .
On the other hand , if you have knowledge both in law and in economy , you will be able to take the speech as a whole and to make a balance between law and economic interests .
Then your opinion seems to me more valuable to me .

On a more practical point of view , I think that , in today society , we must be able to adapt to very different situation .
For example I will certainly have to change of jobs several times .
If I am very specialized in one specific subject , I wo n't have a large scale of possibility .
Thus , the larger the scale of my knowledge , the more chance I will have to find a job that suit me .
In addition , employers now ask to their employees to be able to adapt to different situation and to be able to manage very different issues .
Therefore they need to have broad knowledge of difffent subjects .

But on the other hand , I am conscious that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject should n't lead to have only superficial knowledges .
It is also important to be able to go depper into a specific subject .
But I am of the opinion that if you are able to understand a large scale of subject , it will then be easier to focus more specifically on one , being able to understand all the implications the subject can bring , not being trap in a narrow way of seeing things .
