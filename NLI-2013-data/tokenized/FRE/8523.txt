I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas than it is for them to learn fact , and I will take a controversary example , which is History .

First , when you learn History , it is important to be able to give their relative importance to the different facts .
For example , it is impossible to understand different facts of French political life , such as the Popular Front , without any idea of what the Left and the Right mean .

Moreover , sometimes ideas happen to inform reality .
It would be absurd to learn a factual history of the USSR or the history of the Cold War without any idea of what communism is .

More profoundly , there is no discourse about facts without an interpretation of the facts .
Nietzsche and , more recently , Michel Foucault have explained that all the facts are constructed .
There are no `` natural facts '' that we should examine without a theory .
Even the selection of the facts reveals an idea of what is important and what makes History .
Economics provides us with countless examples of theories that are necessary to explain facts , and even to construct them .

However , it does to mean that there is no escape to general relativism , and that there is no necessity to learn fact .
It is important to cast light on the hypothesis that are made in Economics as well as in History , but it is also important to give some information about the facts .
At the same time as they improve their critical view , students should be able to learn precise facts .
To take another time the example of History , the chronology is very important : it would not make sense to explain the facism thinking that it occured before World War I. As far as Economics is concerned , it is important to test empirically economic theories to demonstrate that they are useful to understand real economic relations .
