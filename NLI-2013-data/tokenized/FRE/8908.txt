I agree with this statement .
I think it is really important to understand ideas and concepts because thus you can open your mind and you can be more aware .
Learning facts and do not understand them is unuseful at all .
Everybody could learn and learn and do not understand a thing .
Where the interest is ?
You should understand first , like that you could have an idea about the subject and you could have an opinion , your own opinion .
Just learn is not useful in daily life , you can talk about that you just learned because you still remember but you cannot really discuss about it because you did not understand the main idea or the concept .

However you should learn thing that you are be able to understand to remember it in the future .
To understand an idea or a concept help you to remind it .
To conclude both of understanding and learning are important , but you should understand first before to learn , after that you are going to be able to learn without difficulties it will be easier for you .
