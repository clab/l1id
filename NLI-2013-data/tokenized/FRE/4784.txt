Every one is able to remember when one day he ordered to a shop , thanks to an advertisement , a beautiful green pull over and just received a kind of thing he was not sure he had one day desired ...
The power of advertising !
Indeed I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , thanks to art photography , great transformation thanks to a computer , and then by a good presentation with music , laughs ...

First , I do think that photographers make a really good job !
Actually when one sees on a newspaper a really beautiful dress , wearing by a very beautiful girl , one just imagines she will be as beautiful as this !
But be careful , photographer know how to make it so appealling !

Moreover , all the photographies are redifined by computers , with amazing logicials able to transform the whole thing in a pretty magic one !
It can appear unrealistic , but I am sure that one can rarely trust what one sees : it is a ` created product ' .

Then there is a great effort made on presentation , which sometimes can be comparated with a real show !
For instance one can see on television advertisements people dancing , laughing , smiling ...
so much happiness on the screen , and for what ?
A new burger !!
However this works ; most of the people who were watching it will surely taste it soon .

Finally , even if advertisements false the reality , I think they can be so funny that I do not care .
Just be aware of their methods .
