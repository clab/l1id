Success does n't happen overnight , it takes lots of work and dedication .
I believe that succesful people are risk taker .
In this paper I will emphasized my opinion with three points : to be successful , people need to make mistake , to be successful people need to take risk , to be successful you people to explore and try new things .

First successful people are not perfect , they learn from their mistake .
By making mistake a person depens his experience .
The person also open his mind to new ways of doing things .
Often when someone makes a mistakes he tries to not replicate the mistake later on .
Let 's take as an example Alexander Graham Bell , when he invented the telephone , he made lots of different adjustment some work some did n't .

Second , in order to make a mistake a person need to be willing to take risk .
If no risks are ever taken there is not mistake that can occur .
The same things happen over and over again .
The person is in a cycle .
Going back to our example , Mr. Bell was deaf , how could he have invented a telephone ?
Do n't you need to hear to be able to speak through a telephone ?
Mr. Bell took a risk in trying to invent abn object that he , himself , could not use .

Third taking risk also means that a person need to expore and try new things .
By trying and exploring a person acquire experience and is more able to open his mind to new things .
Opening your mind is an important aspect of being succesful because it allows you to see and experience different point of view .
Mr. Bell experience clearly show someone who had an open mind and was willing to try and explore new things otherwise he would not have tried to invent a phone but he might have tried to invent something he could have used to communicate as a deaf person .

In conclusion , Mr Bell was a successful man because he was willing to make mistake , to take risk and to explore and try new things .
Mr Bell did not just sit around and do what he already knew , he went ahead and was successful .
So now what are you going to do ?
sit around or jump into a successful life ?
