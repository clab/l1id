In this essay , I will alternatively consider the pros and cons of travelling in a group lead by a tour guide , and of travelling alone , independently .
I will come to the conclusion that it is both more gratifying and more profitable to travel by your own .
I will illustrate my point of view with the experience I have of travelling alone in Brazil .

One can think that having one 's trip organized by a tour guide offers many advantages .
When one visits a foreign country whose language and culture one completely ignores , being led by a professional , and being part of a group of tourists , can make one feel more secure .
For instance , the guide will help the tourists interact with the local population , playing the role of an interpret .
He will also lead the tourists in places he will have chosen for their cultural value and their safety .

Unfortunately , these very advantages are likely to impoverish one 's trip .
Firstly , the journey being both controled by the guide , and dependent on the dynamics of the group , one will not have an occasion to adapt the trip to his own interests .
And as one will rely on the services of the guide , one will mostly remain passive .

On the other hand , travelling alone might seem to be more dangerous , or at least more uncertain .
No one will take care of you , no one ( except maybe guide books ) will tell you where to go and who to talk to during you travel .
But the freedom you will gain will allow you to make your trip exactly what you want it to be .
And since you will have to organize yourself , since will have to face and solve unexpected problems , you will gain a lot of experience .

My trip to Brazil taught me that .
Last year I left France , all by myself , to spend several months in Brazil .
There , I had to do everything by myself .
I had to find a job to earn money , I had to look for accomodation , I had to meet people with whom I had no previous contact , and make new friends .
And I had to decide what it was that I wanted to do there , where to go , what kind of life to live .
All of this was a real challenge , but I learned a lot from it .

Really , I think that travelling alone is more positive
