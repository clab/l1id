I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts - at least at university level .

Having studied law in both England and in France , I have had the chance to compare two very different legal systems and more importantly , two different approaches to education , especially to the teaching of law .

Studying law at university in England typically takes three years .
After three years of undergraduate studies , students obtain their `` LL.B. degree '' .
It is also possible for students who have studied something else during their undergraduate studies to take a one-year-conversion course and obtain the equivalent of the LL.B. degree .
The three-year period of time is relatively short compared with the study time that is required of law students on the European continent , for instance five years in Belgium and Spain , four years in France etc .
The one-year-conversion course also seems to be a tremedously flexible alternative to the many years of studying law that are required on this side of the Channel .

This is a good illustration of diverging points of view on the question whether it is more important that students understand ideas and concepts or learn facts .

Indeed , in British universities , emphasis is put on reasoning .
Professors and students gather to discuss different topics , argue , give pros and cons ...
all for the sake of discussion and developing a critical sense .
It is believed that students will not be able to learn all the facts and memorize all the laws and/or jurisprudence so the focus remains on understanding the reasoning and legal concepts .

On the Continent however , universities focus much more on teaching students something `` substantial '' and to that end , students need to memorize a lot of material which serves as the basis of their reasoning .

To conclude , I would say that having experienced both systems , I found the British approach more constructive .
It could be compared to teaching a man how to fish instead of giving him a fish .
