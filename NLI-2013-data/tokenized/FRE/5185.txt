Our civilisation is based on consumption and economy so more and more industries resort to advertisement to sell their products .
Advertisements are everywhere so that we ca n't avoid them , that 's why innevitably we are influenced by them , the question is in a good or a bad way ?
The aim of an advertisement is make you buy its product by making you dream , by showing you things amasing .
When you see an advertisement for perfume with a gorgeous woman taking a bath in gold water , you immediatly imagine that when you will put this perfume on your nek you will feel like her you will change of life and that men will run after you !

And the day you will be shopping you will come accros this perfume and it will remind you of the good feeling you had when you saw the advertisent , so you wont resist and buy it .

What about the beautiful amburgers you can see on the front of certain food shops ? !
They always seem attractive well done with good meet and green vegetables , but when you have it in a plate , what a deception ..
you could not even recognise the one you have choosen from another !

The strategy used to convince poeple can change , it depends of the target wich advertisements have to persude .
But all the way , they have to lie to us .
Indeed do you really think that the new washing powder will transform your grey laundry to wonderful wite one in two minutes , or that the new diet product will allow you to lose five kilograms in three days without making you sick ?

Of Course advertisements make products seem much better than they are otherwise nobody would like to by them .
And the proof is that when you are proposed an offer like a banck wich would send you money there is always a very very little text on the buttom of the advertisement which mentions all the conditions you must feel to be able to have the money !

I would like to give an exemple of a prod
