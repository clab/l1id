Marketing is said to be a great field because it helps consumers become familiar to the truth about the products .
But , do the good qualities claimed by an advertisement always match with the products ?

Some companies make surveys and get some people to try out some products before they come out ; they get their feedback and make ajustments to the quality of the products accordingly to satisfy their clients and of course some do not and just care to secure the company profits .
This is when they do n't point out side effects , or some particular conditions and everyone thinks that a product will work no matter what .

For instance , we had seen a lot of advertisements about some fitness equipment , with people testifying they have lost ten , twenty or more pounds within a few days using the new machine , but they omit to talk about the environment in terms as food , daily nutrition , other related sports activities that stimulate the results .
As a fool , you acquire this new tool which since you believe is magic , will give you results you over estimate and here we go again , you have been trapped !

Also the magic `` pills '' work the same way .
Consumers get crazy to acquire them and expect the most out of them but to not estimate irreparable damages they can incurr into their body .
They talk a lot about surgery to get slimmer , younger , flat abs , face and breast lifts , but the emphasis on the post surgery time is all forgotten not to say it does not exist .

Another example of misleading resides in telemarketing calls .
People are being more and more aware of them eventhough some others still get caught without asking what is the trick ?

Definitely , beside the part of lookingadvertisements personal research is of a great help for any decision someone will have to take and that will lead in the right direction , it might take a little bit of your time , but I beleive it will be worth it .
