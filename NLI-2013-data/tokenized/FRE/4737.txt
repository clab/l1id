I think we should study towo questions te make response to the subject :
Why today products seems tobe better that they really are ?
and is the increase in advertisements explain this fact ?
First I will make a little history and the evolution of marketing .
First the productions was local and not industrial they were a little number of products on the market and to sell it was very easy to sell them the offer was more important than demand .

In a second time at the beginning of the industrial revolution , when the demand egalize the offer , all custumers could fine on the market the same product one exaple is the ford T the same car , same color for every one .

A third evolution of the industrial revolution is to propose , on the market , for a same product which have the same function , differents options .
For example a car with a choice of differents colors .
So In this phase of the evolution people could satisfie also primary needs and also desire wich is new abotu the patterns of buying something .
Maslow with his famous pyramid explain and illustrate the different needs and desire .

The technologies of indistrials production have change the market and today we have an offer more important tha the demand and the primary needs or the original function of a products are today less important than the desire of make an acquisition of a particular type of car .
For example if you buy a BMW car today you also buy a certain range in the society .
When people were buying the ford T they were buy a product which permit to go from one point to another and it was n't a for distinctions from other people .

In conclusion I think advertising contribute to clarifie and communicate on the desire wich is offer by the product to the person .
The quality bqsed on the primary function is secondary .
