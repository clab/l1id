I do agree with the statement .
But I have to moderate my claim .
Coming out of the University , I can see I have learn a lot of things , and I have forgotten an equal number of it .
What will stay after passed years ?
The ideas , and the concepts .
In courses , it , s really important to learn a way to think .
Not the same as the professor 's one , but its own one guided by teachers experience .

So , is the knowledge unusefull ?
Certainly not .
In order to develop his own way to learn , the student needs strong basis .
If he does n't have good instalements , his science building is going to fail .
In the elementary school , we already have to set up those strong basis .
Otherwise , the only way to build up a good mental structure is to receive examples to learn .
How to understand a car is riding without knowing how works an engine .
The knowledge is also important to be able to make connections between different areas , to compare some stuffs .
As an archeologist discovering some news objects .
He needs to know how was the environment , the atmosphere to figure out how those objects could be usefull for peoples who lived there .

In Belgium , we have this big issue in the high school level .
Actually , we try to reduce the knowledge of students and to give us more skills an abilities .
But the college professors start to mean their students come into their courses with too big lakes .
So , there is an emergency in finding the best middle way between pure knowledge and skills .
I think that the more we grow up , the more we have to leave knowledge to get a lot of abilities and concept .
At the and of college , student get very various jobs and have to learn again what is typically needed for their domains .
So we never stopped to learn , and college is there to give us concpets .
