I do not agree with the proposed statement and I will give different examples showing that young people nowadays are not as selfish as presented .

First of all , I must confess that there is a common image of young people depicting them as more and more selfish , only worrying about themselves , playing on their computer and waiting for the diner to be ready .
This picture is usually compared to the one presenting young people some decades ago , helping their parents at the shop , in the field or simply at home .

However , my opinion is that this selfish image is too limited .
More and more young people spend time and efforts in social organisations .
For instance , the number of boy scouts in Belgium is increasing .
Scouting is typically a place where people learn to care for their communities .
They organise activities to help homelesses , they help at the church and take part in social events .

Another example is the social work which is more and more proposed by schools to students .
Students are proposed to work for social organisations during a definite period of time .
These social works are more and more popular , showing that young people are ready to give time to their communities , as soon as they receive the opportunity to do it .

Furthermore , there are plenty of young people that each year leave their country during summer holidays to go and help other communities in need .
Some are going to build schools in Africa , others entertain small children in Asia , ...
This shows that young people nowadays care not only about their community but are also ready to spend time and money ( they usually pay their fight ticket ) to go and meet other communities that need their help .

To conclude , I think that this image of the lazy selfish youg people which is very strong in Belgium as well as in other countries should be corrected , lookimg at all the other young people who work hard to help their communities and even others .
