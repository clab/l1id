On the one hand , I think that learning facts can be an advantage for students since they can have a sort of role model to help them understand the facts .
They can easily learn how to do things by learning what someone before them did .
They can easily make out the person 's mistakes and see what went wrong and what not to do if they want to succed .

But on the other hand , I believe that understanding ideas and concepts is way better for students because if one wants to repeat something , it would be easier for him if he has understood what he wants to do instead of juste copying something he has learned .
In that way , he can avoid making the same mistakes .
Furthermore , he will be able to shape his own personality and we know that it is generally upheld that someone with a lot of personality is better treated than someone plain who just follows the flock .

Here in France , the way Philosophy is taught to students is very peculiar .
Indeed , in France , students are n't only taught the doctrine of the authors but they are also taught to become philosophers .
I know that can sound ambitious and risky but I think that it 's an exellent way to shape the students ' spirit .
Instead of just teaching them doctrines that they do n't reaaly care about , they are told what the philosophers said but also what they think about that .
They do n't have to simply learn by heart some doctrines that they do n't really understand , they are also askek to react to that doctrine and to say wether they agree or not .
I think that 's great because no matter how intelligent and brilliant these philosophers were , we ca n't reaaly take all they said for garnted .
As students and even as human beings we have to react towards some doctrine sucha as Nietzch 's .
We can really learn what he said and believe that he is right just because he was a smart man .
Indeed , let 's not forget that Hitler was inspired by him and used his work in order to justify Nazism .
Furthermore , the great philosopher , Aristotle , thought that slavery was natural .

All in all , what we can say is that as students , we can take all that our teachers tell us for granted .
We absolutely have to think by ourselves and must not simply lear facts .
Thinking by ourselves will help us in the future for example when we will have to vote .
