I really agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertising emphasizes the qualities of a product , or simply change it .
Few cases exist of a product being advertised as the worst one in order to be sold

Emphasizing the qualities of a product is the natural way people working in the advertising industry use to sell their products .
This is based on the assumption that the better the product appears , the most likely people are be to buy it .
Imagine that an advertisement shows a car which is just the reflect of the reality , that is to say , going to the car repair after breakdown , buying expensive gas to make it run : people would not buy it as the disadvantages of having car would be too important .

That is why advertisements insist on the mechanical performances of cars such as the acceleration rate or the low consumption , which are positive value for people , but highly biased .
In general the reality is far lower than the advertisememt .
The advertised car is being driven in an ideal world in straigth line with no traffic jams .
That is so surprising when you are finally aware of the real consumption rate in our today 's life .

Adverstisements can also tells false arguments in order to give the product a defined image that fits people 's needs .
It sells qualities that are not the ones of the product .
For example fast-food restaurant advertise on the nutritional qualities of their products althougth this kind of food is recognized to contain high rates of grease and sugar .

So in general this is sure that most advertisements improve the product itself because this is the aim of advertisements .
I know one case of a product being sold as the worst one : this is called `` ugly fruits '' which are fruits with no standardized shapes like those we find in supermarkets .
They do not look good .
But even behind this there is a positive and emphasized message : uglier the fruits are , the more natural and healthier , even if those fruits have no more nitrituinal virtues .
Even ugliness could make seem product better .
