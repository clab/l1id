It is often assumed that working things the right way , the way we are taught , is a major key to success .
I believe that this statement is right .
However I believe real success happens to those who bring in new ideas and take risks .

It is true that when people are taught to work on something and do it the right way they will be efficient and successful .
For example , someone who has been taught how to make cookies and how to run a shop could open a cookie shop and be successful at selling cookies .
I can see no reason at all why this person would not earn his life by selling cookies .

However , take someone pretty creative and who enjoys taking risks .
This person would open a cookie shop and sell cinnamon flavoured cookies as well as cherry flavoured cookies , and this way differentiate itself from other cookie shops .
There are two endings to this story , this new business is a complete failure or a real success .
This person has taken risks and invested in its new ideas without knowing if these would meet the costumers ' tastes or not .
And if this creative person succeeds , I am convinced that its business will outline the common cookie shop business .

Another success that is engendered by taking risks is the self satisfaction that is brings .
Being successful for its own idea is far more gratifying than doing things right .

Great successes that qre famous worldwide are always born from an innovative concept , and this in all areas .
Famous film directors would not be so famous if they did not introduce a new vision of film directing .
In finance , brokers that earn the most are those who take the most significant and relevant risks .
Bill Gate would not be worldly known ( and immensely wealthy ) if he had not invested in a revolutionary idea .
