Cars were a wealthy sign twenty years ago .
Only , those who roll in money and live in good conditions of living could buy a car .
In today 's society , in western countries , the majority of the population have a car .
We can wonder if the increase of the purchasing power have increased the number of cars for the last year and if this increase of cars is a reality or just an illusion .

To my mind , it is true that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The fisrt reason of this incresing of car is the increase of the purchasing power .
Twenty years ago , in western countrie , there were clearily two socila classes ; the haves and the have not .
So , the upper class outnumbered the wealthier .
Cars were considered as a luxious good .
Nervertheless , for few years , the middle class has represented the majority of the western population .
At the same time , cars have been developing and their price reduced .
As a consequence , with the emergence of the middle class and the decrease of few cars ' prices , several persons could buy a car .

The second reason is the development of the mobility .
In fact , in today 's society , a lot of people have to take a car to go working every day .
Commuters are more numerous and they need a car to work .
Furthemore , many firms need that their employees work in many cities and not on the head of office .

What is more , we can see every day that there are more cars today .
In fact , every evenings and every mornig , we can see on the roads many traffic jams at rush hours .
We can wonder if the increase of these traffic jams , that we can check every year , will not dilusionned many persons to take cars .

To conclude , we can notice that in spite of the development of trains and planes , the increase of cars is growing up .
