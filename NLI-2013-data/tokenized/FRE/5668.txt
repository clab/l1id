In our society , where advertisements are everywhere , one can wonder if companies do not try to convince us that some of their products are much better than what they really are .
We will first discuss why it is sometimes true , then why companies cannot really cheat , and finally , we will explain why it has no real importance in our society .

It is a commonly shared idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
As a matter of fact , the aim of an advertisement is to sell a product .
Therefore , when a company wants to sell a product , it can be more efficient to make potential customers believe that it is better than what it really is .
In our society , for example , design is widely used to make us buy things that we do not really need : the lack of efficiency of a product can be hidden by its design , or by the pictures and text shown in the advertisements .
For example , companies like Apple greatly rely on design to sell them products .
One can wonder : `` Why does this company need so to spend so much in advertisement ?
Is the product not worth its cost ? ''
.
Obiously , the way some products are presented in advertisements make them appear better than what they really are : advertisements for pastas always shows them cooked with delicious sauces ; advertisements for burgers always show us big , perfect burgers , whereas everyone knows they do not look at all like this when we go to Mac Donald 's !

But on the other hand , cheating with the actual quality of a product is not effective in a long term commercial strategy .
Obviously , people who bought a product because they believed it was much better than what it effectively is , will not buy it another time .
This is why companies know that they cannot cheat too much .
Moreover , there are several laws concerning advertisement : lying in an advertisement is forbidden for instance .
For examples , we can see on old Guiness advertisements , `` Guiness is good for you .
Gives you strength '' .
Such advertisements , which were common in the early 1900s , has completely vanished because laws have been voted to prevent this .

The most important think is , i believe , that as we all perfectly know our society , we all more or less know when advertisers lie to us and when they do not .
Even we often see monsters jump out of cereals on the television ( like for instance the tiger from Frosties ) , we know that it will not happen for real .
In the same way , we do not believe that some product will remove every kind of dirt on any clothing .
