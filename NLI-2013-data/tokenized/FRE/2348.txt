Young people do not have the necessary knowledge to enjoy life .
One could argue that their lack of experience is an obstacle for them because they sometimes give too much importance for a bad news which appear at the end not to be so bad .

With their experience older people know better what is really important .
They are wiser than young people - this is often illustrates in the tales where the old man represents wise and knowledge .

They have learn a lot from some past events the youth only knows through historical books .
They also have had the time to read a lot , tro travel ...
All these elements help them to understand better the world .

This could be a bad thing too : it is sometimes better not to be aware of the situations in order to enjoy life .
People would sometimes prefer to return to their child-time , when they were innocent .

Moreover old people do not have the same physical faculties as young people .
In the majority of cases when people are mentally matured to enjoy life , they are no more physically capable of it .

All this points are based on general observations but happiness is not only a mater of age and depends on every person .
Enjoyable moments result from on a lot of things , including some events we can provoke and some events we can not control .
