Nowadays , environnemental problems are the road map of many policies across the world and in each country .
The main cause is the important presenc eof cars on the Earth , which are polluating the atmosphere rejecting toxic products into .
Several countries started to apply their policies to protect environnement , reducing the use of oil by public and private transports , and trying to find solutions to remplace the use of cars .
However , the car is the most useful means of transport and we ca n't assume than cars will be fewer in twenty years .

Cars are well-knew to pollute atmosphere and to be a source of toxic products .
To decrease the pollution by cars , some governments asked people to use their own car only when it is a big necessity .
In big cities , authorities promoted public transports reducing their prices and urging people to travel by bus , subway , bike or tramway .
Many areas of cities became forbidden to cars , limitating the use of cars in pedestrian zones .

Moreover , scientists are trying to find an other source of energy to transports , like electricity .
In big cities for example , we can see some bus which are working with electricity to reduce pollution , and the use of cars .

Besides , people are more and more concerned by environnement and pollution , and start to be interested by the future of the Earth .
They try to part in the reduction of toxic emissions , travelling by bus or subway in big cities or travelling with their friends to go to work ans using only one car for several people .
Good citizens make efforts to improve their way of life and they care about their health .
The price of oil getting worsen , people may realize that it is better to travel by public transports than to spend money for oil .

However , I think it is to early to say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today .
If people and governements are making efforts and are trying to reduce the number of cars , they remain a very good way to travel for people : they can go where they want , when they want , and it 's free ( exept the oil ) .
Public transports remain quite expensive for people who prefer travel by themselves , in their own space , and not melting with others people .
Moreover , if car is not so useful in towns , it is in the countrysides and to holidays , because plane or train are much more expensive than cars .

thus , I really think that people are not ready to rid of their car , which is their main way of transport .

To conclude , I am not really sure than the number of cars will be less important in twenty years than today , because others ways of transport and public service are still too expensive .
Cars are very useful , and it is difficult for people to imagine their daily life without them .
In the other hand , countries are getting more and more worried about the price of oil and are acting to remplace cars , but it will take time .
