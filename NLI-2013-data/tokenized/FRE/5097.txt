Productivity and profits are the core aspects of our economy , this way , companies advertized to improve the image of their products .
The result is that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
They emphase on the main quality of their product in order to be attractive and of course do n't focus on the defects , or less attractive effects .

Fisrt of all , advertisements are maid to spread the knowledge on a specific product , in order for the customer to buy it .
Of course it has to be attractive and to show specific abilities .
It can look much better than it really is .
For example , take the pills that reduce the weight , it commounly sells miracles as one is supposed to loose kilos in one week .
That seems great , and someone willing to loose a size would be tented .
The advert does n't explain that it must be associated with a strict diet to be effective , and customers will certainly be disapointed .

On the other hand , it wo n't be as effective if they expose how it really works , people will be more carefull , and the main purpose of the advertisement would't be reached in terms of quantities .
But it also true that a satisfied customer will easily purchase again the product , and have a better effect in the length .
For example , the yogurt that explains they reduce not only the fat but also the sugar , and taste good , is explaining everything about the diet , in contradiction with a lot of produts that claim they are 0 percen fat but contain a lot of sugars

The customer can also ask for advice before purchasing and thus have a real idea of the product .
He can also compare different products and choose the one that matches his requierements .

Most advertisements make the products look better , but the customer is aware that everything is not said or explained , he must read between the lines and use his personal experience and knowledges .
