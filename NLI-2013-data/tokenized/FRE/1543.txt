While we are studying it is good to know what should I learn .
Should I keep working in a subject that I already master or shoud I developpe a wildspread culture ?
On one side I could specialize in order to become one of the best in what I am doing but having no abilities to recycle myself in another suject , while in the other hand I can learn enough to have an overall culture and knowledge but no special skill .

A lot of scientific developpement would n't have happened if scientist just focused on one subject .
For instance , even if Einstein improve the way a viewing physics , he would n't have been able to developpe his theories if he had n't mastered mathematics .
Usualy greats intellectuals have a broad knowledge that give them a new way of seeing their specific subject .
So in many ways both assertion are complementary .

Personaly I am a very curious person .
For me all knowledges are good to fulfill my intellectual curiosity .
Therefore I found it interesting to fly from one subject to another that to study one field that would allow me to become the best in a subject that I only few can understand .
For this reason I believe that it is `` better '' to have broad knowledge .
It is more social .

However our social environment and our society enhance expert .
If you want to be hire by company , wathever you are doing , you need to be good at it .
That the reason why school and university are providing student with a very precise knowledge .
You can easily find cours of developpement economy or in french Middle-Age litterature .

Our culture is driven by experise .
At any cost , you have to master at least one subject .
In my view this attitude is dangerous to culture .
Culture is diversity , therefore one shoud seek for a broad knowledge , rather than a specific subject .
