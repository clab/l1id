In general , people prefer to do or participate in something that they already masterise , but taking the opportunnity to start something new can be more relevant .
That 's what I am going to discuss in the first part .

Currently studying at a university in Paris specialized in Information Technologies and Electronics , I agree that it can be very enriching to take the opportunnity in starting something you never did .

I got this policy for a long time since I entered in this university .

I always try to be aware of the news technologies related in computer science and , then to start using it .
For instance , I am working on big project for one month now .
This project can be summarize by creating a software used by agricultor in order to help them to organise their productivity .
Thought I use the java langage of programmation , I take the initiative to learn by myself a new language called AJAX .
I never learned it before but I think that it could increase the numbers of the fonctions for the software .

Thus , I rather take a risk in learning this language because I do n't have a lot of time to learn and use it correctly .

Moreover , as a student in fourth years , I do n't have a lot of time for other extra scholar activities .
Even If I know that working for a company at the same time of studying will be difficult i do it .
For instance , the next month , I will develop the new website for a company and develop another one for an organisation .

I accepted to work on these project in order to make of course some money to pay my scholarship but also to learn new things .
Everytime I take the opportunity to enter in a new project and participating very well I always learn more .
No only on the technical field as programming but also on the human interactivity as communicaton for example .

In conclusion , I approve tis statement and use to encourage my friends in doing itm even I know that I might probably help them .
