The primary role of advertisement is to increase a firm 's profit by boosting the sales of a product .
To achieve that goal , the firm has to show the most attractive part of the thing they want to sale .

To make something really attractive , advertisers have to prove the potential customers , that their product is better than each other .
That 's why a lot of them have the desire to embellish their product .
For example , in each car advertisement , we hear that this specific car is the best one , and that girls will love you because you own it .
So we could consider that such a tv spot try to make the car much better than it really is .

Nonetheless , I 'm convinced that men who watch or read such an advertisement know that girls wo n't love them more just because they own that car .
But they keep the spot in mind and the more they see the car , the more they could desire to own it .
So in that case , advertisers have accomplished their mission , because they have succeded in increasing the car sales .

Moreover there are a lot of precise rules which make that an advertiser must not lie on the skills of a product .
If we go back to the example of the car , a spot must not claim that the car has an airbag if he has n't .
Even if they can find a way to make their products seem very beautiful or very good , the law sets some limits , and the firms must n't do what they want with the advertisement .

Finally , in a certain extent , the law provides a security for the customers , because they can be sure that the description of an object will be the same than in an advertisement .
But I know that firms often find guiles to make things seem more beautiful to be more competitive .
