I do agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks .
Firstly they try to reach new goals , but they also never refused to do something .

First , successful people always try to reach new goals .
Thus this is not because they are used to do something well that they wo n't do anything else and wo n't try to find new achievements .
For example , a man like Antoine de Saint-Exupery , who was a famous french pilot during the XXth century , always tried new things .
He contributed to the opening of the first french aircraft line , he risked his life by searching new roads , by crossing the Atlantic Ocean with small aircrafts , by flying on unknown areas ...
He never thank that it was profitable for him to stay in France teaching how to drive a plane to students .
That kind of person , who is for me very successful , always tried to achieve new goals .

Moreover successful people never resigned to do somethimg when they have a precise aim , and that is one of the main reasons of why they have success .
Let us take the example of the members of a mountain rescue patrol .
Maybe for those who live in towns they are not the most successful persons on earth , but it is not the same thing for those who live nearby mountains , or for those who have been saved by them !
They are taking risks every day to save people , they have a heavy training during many months , and if they do n't succeed to do one task , they will be asked to do it again and again , sometimes in some extreme conditions .
They never refused to go searching for a person , even if they have to risk their own life to achieve it .
We all know that many rescuers in mountain died by saving people , which shows us that they have n't resigned .

To conclude we have seen that successful persons are mainly the ones who take some risks in their every day life but moeover who never resigned to achieve a task .
