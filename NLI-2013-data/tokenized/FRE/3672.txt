Now , the generation of young pepople is seen like rebel , not nice , bad boy , ...
but it 's not right for all young children !
In the life there are two part : when you are young you do all you want without soucy and when you are an adult it 's different , you have a wife , you must work to leave , your parents are died or too old to help you !
we will see im the first part it 's a good thinif the young children help the communities and in the second part when to participate communitie 's life is not a choice but a necessity !

When you are young , you have your parents , your family to help you if you have a problem !
You have n't got any soucy , you do n't need to earn your money to live , it 's your father and your mother who make all !
Your one problem it 's just to be good at school and your parents are happy !
you have your friends and you play everytime without conscience of life 's problem !
It 's the beautiful life !
But it 's not eternel ...

...
One day you see you are a great boy , simply a man !
It 's stange because you are father , you have a wife , you work to earn your money because if you do n't work you ca n't live , you know the life what 's the problem , what 's money , who are your really friend , and you know the justice and all you have to do like you are a citizen !
You must help your communities , your city , your country where you live !
But all this it 's because your parents explained you when you were young all the things you will have to do to be a good citizen and to be accept of other !
You did n't invent all this you learnt your power and your homework !

In conclusion , I think in the life there is a time for all thing , a time to grow up , a time to learn , and a time to have important responsabilities !
It 's not a good thing to go to fast and do n't take the time to discover all the life 's things !
I 'm agree to say you have to participate to the communities but when you are able to do this and not again when you are a young boy who does n't know anything of life !
To finish i 'm not agree to the young people help the communities when they do n't know anything o life !
In some country this young pepople who help the communities are called : slaves !
