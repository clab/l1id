I first tend to agree with this statement and I actually hope there will be less cars in the world , because pollution is a serious problem .

According to me , in twenty years , they may be a problem about oil .
We use so much of this right now that it might not be available in the next decades .
If the oil becomes harder to find , then it becomes also more and more expensive .
The richest people may then be the only ones who will earn enough money to buy what is the main need to make a car work .
I can even imagine people using their own bike instead .
Why not ?
Would it not be better for our Earth ?

Moreover , new laws preventing the use of cars may be created .
Governements may take actions to prevent married couples to own more than two cars for example , or other things like that .
Anything can be done , I think too many vehicles are on the roads .

Since we are talking about close future , maybe we will wait much longer for changes to be seen , because , let us also be realistic , more and more people own a car nowadays , it is indeed so comfortable to own our own way to move from place to place in such a short period of time .
We need ten minutes to go somewhere by car , and maybe fourty by feet .

So It is hard to agree or disagree with the statement because all of this depends on how the world will turn out to become in the next few years .
It depends on people 's state of mind , on politics , and on the decisions that are going to be taken .
But anyway , my point of view is fewer cars would be a good and possible thing which would be likely to happen if each one of us are willing to make efforts to help our planet .
