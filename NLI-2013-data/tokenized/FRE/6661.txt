In tweety years , there will be fewers cars in use than there are today .
In order to explain this topic , we can show that this is a controversary point , depend on which condition you look at this situtation .

First of all , it 's easy to think that the automobile industry is growing up very quickly , and there is more and more car on the road .
This certainly du to the increasing of the price of the train and plan ticket this last ten years .
But , you can tell , that ingenior in the industry try to change this problem , not by trying to reduce the car industry , but by trying to find a new way not to polute the planet , like by biocarburant .
Furtheremore , It 's nearly impossible to avoid people to use their car , like for working people , or people living far away .
And in addition , today , having a car , is also to be part of the social world , to be autonom .

However , You can also tell that the future of cars is not clear .
When you see the fast evolution of all the other way to be drived .
Furthermore , lots of people prefere public transport as a cheaper way to go to work , and gouvernments understood this and is developping this , like in hong kong , where you can do everything without anycar , or in London , where the city does n't allowed any car .
Or even in strasbourg were the french gouvernement make cheaper ticket in order to encourage people to let their car at home .

In addition , we can not planned clearly in which way the world will evolute .
If you take as an example developped country , because it 's the one who will be more affected by this matter , you can already tell how they already try to developpe other way to move in and outside of their country .
Take as an example , the train developement and the decrease of the price in some compagny helped by gouvernment .

In order to conclude about the evolution of the number of car in use in the road in tweenty years , in my opinion , I can say I agree with the fact there will be more and more cars on the road , this due to the evolution of the population .
But with the news technologies , the bad effect of this in the environment and as a bigger scale in the planet , can be reduce , which is a good point , and as a matter of fact that the petrol ressources in the world became really rare , which can be a real turn in the car industry , I hope in the good way .
