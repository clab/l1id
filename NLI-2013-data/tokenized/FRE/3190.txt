What is really being young nowdays ?
We often talk of the problems created by young people beaking the law and respecting nothing and no one in the suburbs .
But it is not the majority of young people .
We talk less about quiet young people just trying to do their best in life and who do help their community .
This leads to the last point , even for the ones willing to help , it is not always easy to do so .
They lack opportunity and time .

When we heard about young people nowdays , what do we hear ?
We hear about the laws that were broken , the policemen that were attacked , the cars that were burnt .
Of course it is a part of the problem but as it is often the case , the worse aspect is very well known and many people tend to forget that it concerns only a minority .
So we should focus on the majority of young people , the one we rarely hear of .

In universities or graduate schools , there are clubs or groups .
These are about music , theater , art , sport , games but many concern the help that can be given by students .
For example , in the school I went to , there was at least a dozen of such clubs .
Some students gave lessons to children , some got toys for poor children , some spent time to give food to poor people and some even went to India to build a school .
These clubs were among the most popular ones as many students thought it was normal to give an afternoon per week helping those who needed it .

The last point I would like to develop is that , even it is always possible to say that the young ones do not help their communities enough , it is not always a question of lack of good will .
When you are young , you are explained that you have many responsabilities , a huge number of things to do in order to prepare your future life .
All these problems , that might seem easy to solve afterwards , are difficult to face when you are young and without experience .
They often leave little time available or no strengh to face something else .

The conclusion could be that young people 's reputation suffers from what is being said about a minority of them and that the other most certainly do what they can , even if it might not always be enough .
