I agree with that statement .
I really think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Understand ideas and concepts is the key to learn everything .
I do not think it is possible to learn in a concrete manner data things if we do not have previously clearly understand the real concept or idea of what you are talking about .
Even if certain facts have to be known , I consider facts as secondary in the process of learning .
I will demonstrate my thought in several points ;

First it is very important to clearly distinguish the concept from the fact , For exemple the Economy is a concept , although the precise amount of the American economy is considered as a fact .
As that exemple indicates , we can not clearly understant data things if we do not learnt previously what is the concept .
The concept gives the general idea of what we are talking about .
The idea or concept gives to the students the elements to understand and analyse by themselves data things .
Moreover , the understanding of a concept has to be considered as an entire intellectual activity since it requires all our attention , our curiosity , and our capacity to absorb and understand informations .
For these reasons , i think that data things must be used to represent and illustrate the concept and not the opposite .
The facts must be used to make the understanding of an idea easie , and it is too bad that the scholar system does not often give enough importance to the understanding of concept .

Finally , I believe en concepts since I think that students always keep in memory when they have understood it .
