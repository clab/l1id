Some educational experts claim that the role of schools and colleges is to teach pupils facts .
Others believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
I believe that making students understand ideas and concepts is the most important role of education .
Yet it cannot be done without the students learning the facts .

Understanding ideas and concepts is vital in the world we live in today .
Technology and sciences are evoluting so fast nowadays that the knowlege of concepts is extremely important .
Without understanding the ideas and concepts behind these technological advaces , a student will not be able to resilve problems facing him in that area .
In fact understanding ideas and concepts offers students the possibility to face any problem in each and every realm of their life .
It gives them a certain logic and methodology that widens critical thinking .

On the other hand , concepts and ideas are impossible to understand without the learning of facts .
The good knowlege of facts made the great inventors and thinkers of History ( Leonardo DaVinci , Galileo , Albert Einstein , Louis Pasteur ... )
discover and develop new concepts and ideas .
Facts are to concepts what wheels are to cars .
A car cannot drive without wheels ; a concept cannot be accurate or even invented without the knowlege of the scientific facts .

This is why students should be taught the facts .
Yet their education should not be limited to facts .
An education limited to the teaching of facts will produce students with rigid and limited thinking .
The facts ought to be the academic package that will allow students to understand the concepts and maybe come up with ideas of their own .
