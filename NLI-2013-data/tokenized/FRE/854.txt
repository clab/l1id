In today 's world , having a broad knowledge can defenitly help people in the society .
They can apply for divers jobs , or they can even have two jobs , contrary to someone who is specialized in only one subject .
But being specialized in only one subject means that the person knows his job perfectly , so he can have more chances to be hired for a specific kind of job .

In my opinion , I think that having a broad knowledge is better than specializing in only one subject .

We were spoken with my american civilisation teacher about that .
Is it better to do his master and to continue his doctorate on the same topic or we may change to show our skills ?
That day I simply told him that knowledge is one of the most important things in live , we use it at school , but we can use it to give help to some people , for example , in high school , or in middle class .
We can also be a teacher .
We can teach French and English for example .

Moreover , not only to help people but for also for us .
We can proove to ourself that we can learn different subjects , we can understand them , and finally be good at them .
It can be seen as a way to be proud of ourself and having the feeling to be part of the society , as far as we are concerned by many points .

However , having a broad knowledge means studying and also learning a lot , so we can be tired because of it , and not share time with his friends , his family , going to the cinema .
It looks like having no fun , and to considering it that way , life can be boring .

To conclude , I have tried to explain the reasons why having a broad knowledge can be useful ( help , proud ) but we must consider that this point of view can be limited .
