Most advertisements present us great products .
Advertisements use scientific explanation to make us buy them .
However most people do not believe it .
Indeed , we live in a society where speed comes first .
Virtual image is a perfect example .
Everything is made to gain time .
The way of life , inflicted by society , kills the imagination .

Advertisements create many false declarations and we can see when we buy a product that it is completely different .
It is generally always the same thing with advertisements .
The more a product is shown on the television , the more it is to avoid .
Advertising is made to earn money , consequently the product cannot be as great as it seems to be .
In my opinion , the speed of images prevent us from thinking and will cause the disappearance of human qualities .
