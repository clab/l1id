Advertisement has become a whole part of the selling product process thanks to the expansion of the media such as television , newspapers , radio .
It consists in boasting the qualities of a product , and emphasizing on them .
But most of the time , the product does n't look like the one presented on television , or in the newspapers .
It looks much better in the advertisement than it really is .

Indeed , for example in the case of a television advertisement , means such as light , special effects , different angles of shooting can be used to make the product looks better , and thus more appealing to the buyer .
An advertisement for food will be shot so that the product will look apetizing , but in reality , the product the buyer will find at the supermarket wo n't even look edible .
Sometimes advertising for frozen food , will even use fresh food , instead of the real product that is trying to be sold .
And the buyer is often deluded into thinking the image presented in the advertisement was representing the real product .
How many times did people complain about the difference between the brochure and the product , or the difference between the one seen on television and the one standing in front of them ?

Televised advertisement can also hire people to talk about how the product has changed effectively their life , or how adequate and convenient it has been to them .
But this kind of advertisement is dishonest as it lies to consummers .
They want by any means sell their products to buyers by building a fake image product , and making it seems much better than they really are but it is not the way they should sell their products .
