I am agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

In my opinion , if the advertisement make product more better is in order to encourage people to buy them .
In fact , if the television or the radio make many advertise about one product , the consumers will be more attracted and spend more money .
It is a good way to sell a product because the most important thing consist to attray people .
If the product is very sad or ugly , it is clear that poeple do n't buy it .

For example when we saw advertisement on television about fast food , in particular Mac donald , the burger seems perfect , I mean that he is bigger than the restaurant 's one and seems to have more ingredients but when we go to the restaurant , we have another vision , we have the impression that what we saw at the television is really different than what we have in our plate .
this example shows us that if we did n't see the burger on television , we has n't gone at the Mc'Donalds .

The role of the advertissement is to bring us another way to imagine the product and to push us to buy and to spend money .
All in today 's world is commercial , to spend money is the new way of life and we can see that nowadays that we buy everything even if we do n't need it .

buying give us satisfaction and we could'nt live in this world without selling .
That 's the reason why the medias take the opprtunity to shows us products which seem much better than reality .
Even if we realise that what we are buying is not the same with what the television shows us we will continue to do it because it is necessary .

To conclude , everybody do n't care if the product showed by the advertisement do n't seem like what they really are because the needed is to buy .
