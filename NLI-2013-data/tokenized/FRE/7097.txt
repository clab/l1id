Over the past few years , the growing infatuation of today 's world withs cars , and in a bigger scale , with all sorts of very useful - yet very polluting - technologies , have been relentlessly denounced .
Most people fear the results of such a phenomenon on our environment , and in the meantime , statistics display that car 's owning is still the epitome of wellness in our modern society .
Yet , contrary to the prevailing opinion , some pundits predict the end of the Car era ( at least in the way we know it ) in the years to come .
I definitely side with them on this issue .

First , there is no denying that new devices are promoted in order to stop hurting the environment .
Worries are soaring , owing to the depletion of the ozone layer , the melting of the icecaps , the increasing quantity of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere , the rising of sea levels .
Facing these phenomenon , scientists tried to find new alternatives to the use of cars .
The latter would be replaced for instance by none-polluting machines , like electric cars .

Besides , we are more and more urged to use others way of transports ( i.e buses , or bicyles ) .
Moreover , with the success of cheap flights , passengers are sometimes more inclined to fly , than to use their cars , as far as large distances are concerned .

In a world , we may say that at first sight the car industry is flourishing .
However prospects for the future do not support this view : Given the huge numbers of problems entailed by pollution ( mostly caused by cars ) , many alternatives have been launched , in order to cope with today 's new challenges .
Even if those projects are n't all efficient by now , I clearly stand fast in my conviction that in the next twenty years , their efficiency will be enhanced by new scientific discoveries .
