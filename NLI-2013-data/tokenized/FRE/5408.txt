Advertising is often considered by post-modernists as a new vicious means of propaganda .
It has penetrated almost every sphere of one 's life ; it is to be found everywhere in the public sphere , and has also entered the private sphere through television or free flyers .
Its purpose is to present a product but also increase the sales of this product .
Thus an advertisement must appeal to the consumer 's senses .
It must furthermore convince the consumer that he absolutely needs this good .
Therefore , strategies have been developed to increase one product 's sales , and making the product attractive and necessary in one of them .
But , as the statement argues , many advertisements enhance the product 's appearence and efficiency so that a gap is created between the real product and it 's image .

In the years following the end of the Second World War , occidental societies have experienced economic bonanzas coupled with increases in living-standards .
People therefore consumed more and more .
The means by which advertisers make people consume is sometimes questionable .
For instance , advertisements often manipulate unconsciously the consumer , by using subliminal messages .
This is one of the way to make a product seem much better .
Although diffusing erroneous information about a product is forbidden , some advertisements selectively describe the product and emphasize important features of a product , which are in reality irrelevant .
As an example , an advertisement for a car might put forward its comfort while its security is not mentioned .

Although we can argue that many advertisements make product seem better than the reality is , one might aknowledge that the very purpose of an advertisement is to highlight the good features of the product and silence the mediocre ones .
Advertisement have the right to emphasize the pleasant features of a product in order to sell the product to a greater extend .
But it should n't in any case lie to the consumer , at the risk of being discredited .
