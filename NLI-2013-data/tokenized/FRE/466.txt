On a personnal account , I think that everyone should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
According to me , specializing in one specific subject is extremely dangerous and could undermine the way our societies work .

Firstly , I assume that being specialized in a particular academic subject is most harmful to your intellectual skills and the way you think .
When you are being taught about a particular subject , you not only learn facts , theories or historical events but you also learn a way of thinking .
For instance , learning mathematics will help you develop a rational process of thinking , nonetheless you will not improve your human relations by resolving equations .
This could explain why some engineers , with a scientifc cultural background , find difficult to evolve in companies .

Secondly , I think that in our developped societies it has become impossible to remain specialized throughout you entire life .
Imagine an artist , she has never taken any courses but artistic ones .
She founds a galery to expose and sell her works , how will she be able to make it if she has never learnt accountancy or marketing methods ?
She will certainly go on bankrupt in a few months .
Had she followed management courses , she would have made her gallery flourish .

I recognize that society still needs very specialized people .
What make things work has become so complex that you cannot hope to succeed if you do not have deep and acurate knowledge .
However , extending this specialization to everyone could jeopardize our societies .
If people did not share the same knowledege and the same cultural background , they could no longer support themselves and live together .
Knowledge creates bounds within people and should always be shared .

In conclusion , I assume that knowledge is a precious gift , you have a right to protect it and share it .
By endorsing broad academic knowledge , you have a clearer acount about people and society , and will be more useful that if you are too specialized .
