With the globalization of the economic market in the world , some opportunists people can trye new things and take risk .
On the other hand , some persons carry on to do what they know , or in spite of the increasing economic market have no choices .

First of all , the personality of people and their targeted objectives , are the most important points .
Someone who have ideas and the business feeling would like to set up his own company and make money .
Furthertheless , it 's necessary to invest money for the beginning of a company , at this time , specific investors can help entrepreners .
Also , it 's necessary to have acknowledges to present a business plan , that 's why , the education has a important role .
If they were within a poor family or a relatively rich family who had paid good education before .
I 'm agree about the fact that people who take risk have to earn more money than others .

In addition , there are differents economic cultures and laws in so different countries in the worlds .
Certain parts of popullation could n't take a risk because they do n't have choice .
If there are no money whithin the country whithout bank , for instance in some parts of Africa .
It 's of course more difficult .
However , a new kind of credit has been appeared for poor country , in order to set up a small company .
Same if , the boss will not become rich , but it will possible to create new employee and permit to a lot of persons to eat correctly .

Therefore , a lot of characteristics are necessary to know .
Before to conclude if this person is inventive or successful or only only stay at his place whithout waiting something better .
