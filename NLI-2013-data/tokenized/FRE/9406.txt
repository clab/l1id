people will always ask themselves what 's the best way of learning things and what 's the best way of teaching things because these questions are essentials .
The world evolves and so does the ways of teaching , education is one of the most important thing because although it may sound a little bit ` cliche` , today 's children are tomorrow 's adults , Hence , it is wise to ask ourselves if understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts , when i thing about it , there 's no good answer at this kind of question because understanding concepts and learning facts are both important .
Of course if you study philosophy , understanding ideas is vital and if you study law you 'll have to learn facts but in most of other fields the best thing to do is to understand and learn .
When i was in highschool i hated learning facts because it was extremely boring , i thought that what mattered the most was understanding what the teachers were talking about , that 's why i was always paying attention in class but since i hated facts i was n't studying much at home .
I was an average student with average grades but i think that had i spent more time learning basic facts i could have had much better grades .
Of course only learning facts is n't very helpfull if you do n't understand concepts .
Some people only care for facts and could n't care less about what 's behind them , i think it 's quite sad because you ca n't base your opinion on facts alone , you have to understand what 's the true meaning of the facts you 're looking at , Now , when i learn a fact i always try to understand the idea that it 's implying and when i come to understand a concept i try to learn some facts that can be related to it , In a word , i think that students should understand concepts and learn facts , they should n't have to choose between both .
