In order to answer this question thouroughly , we first need to define what we mean under the words `` understanding '' and `` learning '' .
A student has understood an idea once he is able to explain it with his or her own words , to provide examples and to link the idea to other ideas .
He should also be able to compare it or to constrast it with other ideas .
Learning , on the other hand , refers to factual knowledge that can be acquired by means of memory .

Given the definitions above , one can easily imagine that understanding concepts requires more skills than just knwing facts by heart .
Sutdents will need to think further , to analyze and to link oncepts together when they understand them .
For example , in order to understand the literary movemement called `` naturalism '' , students will need to distinguish it from realism and to have an idea of what is determinism .
Learing facts about naturalism would not allow students to really grasp the main point about it .
They would be able to name naturalist writers such as Stephen Crane or Jack London , eventually to provide a definition learnt by heart , but not to place the movement in its literary context .

Another important advantage of understanding is that it creates a structure in the mind that can be reapplied in many different domains .
Once a students understands how a mechanical feature of the car , he will be able to understand the mechanical feature of many other cars , even if they differ .
It is basically the same principle .
Learning , on the other hand , always needs to be done again and again because it is specific to one thing .

I agree that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
However , a good student who does not have any factual knowledge is not a student .
A student of Swiss history has to know that Switzerland was founded in 1291 .
Usually , a thourough , complete understanding cannot be separated from learning .
