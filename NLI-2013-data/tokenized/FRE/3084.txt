Are young people happier than older ones ?
I think that this statement is the sad reality .
We 'll quickly see the arguments on the paper

Firstly , young people have much more occasions to make new friends than old people .
If you go out every week , if you 're invited at your friends ' places twice a week , your chances to meet new people are amazingly high .
The truth is that you only can and want to have this kind of life when you 're relatively young

Besides as a young personn you are not as involved in your family life as your parents might be .
You can spend the time you want with the people you really care about without thinking about the duties you need to do back home .

Studying abroad is an opportunity you ca n't miss .
With the increase of links between the earth nations it has became easier to study abroad than before .
As a result , today students have much more chances to go in a foreign country than their parents had .
Proof of this point the increasing students demand for the erasmus program and the strong relationships that universities maintain together .

Last but not least , old people have to work and secure an income to make sure that their family could live safely .
It 's not the case when dealing with young people that can do whatever they want as long as they are good at school at the end .
A young guy can relax as much as he want .
He even can leave school if he does n't like it .
An adult can not afford it .
He can not chill out because someone is counting on him : The young personn .

To conclude , I would like to say that we mus n't be blind , There are too many arguments in favour of the point supported in the paper and so few for the opposite point that the answer should be obvious .
Life is better when you are young .
