On the one hand , young people are typically physically stronger than older people , which allows them to live more things .
The discovery of sexuality is also a wonderful source of energy that makes you follow any kind of impulsion life gives you .
But when you get old , as your health starts to decline you worry about it and you might lose some appetite in life .
The risk is then to resign , to get the sensation that you have lived everything , and slowly start to lose praise on the world , the course of the events , which will make you appear to yourself as a stranger to the rest of the world , an old man thus thinking that , logically , `` it was better before '' .

But you might also have overcome the problems due to your inadaptation to life when you are young .
Discovering sexuality confronts you to the rest of the world at once , you feel it is a breath of toxic air coming into you , making you fear of losing everything you have just started to discover , at every moment .
You see that you are in a hostile environment , and that does not precisely attract you .
You realize that enjoying life is a big problem that can unfortunately not be solved by clapping your hands , and that happiness is a dream that is flying away .
As you grow up you get to know some traps ( those which prevent you from living your life as you desire , as you want to enjoy it ) , for having fallen sometimes , and you are able to avoid most of them .

I think that young people enjoy life differently than old people : for the first ones it is the run for what is escaping that keeps them alive .
Finally when you catch it , or realize it has come too far for you , you enjoy the peace around the world you created for yourself when growing up
