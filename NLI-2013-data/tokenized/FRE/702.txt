I think , we are a human society and the human knowlegde is limited .
But there are a lot of exceptions .
For me , knowledge in a yield is essential because it is the only possibility to prove we exist in our individualist society .
In short Men are complementary and they have to specialize in a yiel .

If we compare a situation with an economic situation , we can notice it is the base of the capitalism principle .
We can find an illustration with the theory of Comparative advantage of David Ricardo .
It is a theroy which explain that a man has to specialise in a yied where he is the best in view to impove his capabilities .

However , it is not the same for alll the yields .
During Antiquity period , philosopher was doctors , mathematician , scientific in the same time .
It was a point of view different of nowadays .

If I explain my situation , I prefer control one think in a ONE yield better than know much imformations , on several yield but no control one think .
We are more six billion of people in all over the world , it is impossible to know all .

Nevertheless , broad knowledge in many academic subjects for example poilitics , histories , economics , science is an avantage because in the gathering with our colleague , friend , boss we can hold a discussion and say our opinion .
The person who said anything is not respect generally. `` who say anything , consent '' Finally I think we have to control capabilities and improve our knowledge all the days .
The education is a process even when we will a responsable parent .
To conclude , with the evolution of society and the metality , we have to strengthen our knowledge to have to compete with the other .
Competitivness is essential !
