My first response to this question would be '' Yes , I do agree with this statement . ''
And the first explanation that come to my mind is that youngs are less involved in the common problems than before .

The youngs of today are more selfish , they try to resolve their problems before resolves the others ' problems .
Maybe we can blame education : parents do not show them the right example and they do not know what a real charity is .
More and more , youngs are only interest in their pleasure like seeing their friends , playing video games ...

The notion of altruism has been lost trought generations and the charity 's actions are less and less done .
For example , they are only old people who are going to the neighboors ' meeting to discuss about the problems in the community .
Young people are not interest in that , and if you ask them why , they said that they always have something better to do .

But we cannot generize this fact , because some youngs are still devoted to help their communities .
Some of them spend their free time to help others , by distribuing food for example , or by cleaning the beaches ...

And some of these youngs do that because they want to feel better , to feel like they are nice and helpfull .

But I think that the majority of the young people have too many things to do to think of helping the community .
Nowdays , studies are long and complicated , and do ask a lot of homeworks .
This may be why youngs do not spend the little free time they have thinking of their community , but thinking of them and take a break .

Defenders of the community will say that it is not a reason , and maybe there are right , but I really think that the preoccupation for the communities comes when you are older , because you must enjoy your yough to feel ready to help others after .
