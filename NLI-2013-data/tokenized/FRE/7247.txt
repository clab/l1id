Although some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , I strongly prefer to travel individually .
In my opinion , travelling in a group offers several drawbacks .

First of all , travelling in a group prevents you to discover things by yourself because you always stay with the group .
In addition , you always rely on the guide .
In contrast , travelling individually allows you to discover places alone .
For example , when I was in Egypt , I noticed that the local population was nicer when you were travelling alone than when you were part of a group .

Second , group travels have the same schedule .
They usually eat at the same time .
In addition , they always have the same food .
Besides , group members should stay together .
That means that you can not really be independant .
Whereas , travelling individually can let you more opportunitues to discover the local food , local monuments which are not described by a guide .
Furthermore , you can choose to visit the monuments when there are less people .
Therefore , I think that you are in a better position to appreciate the sight seeing .

Third , I think that group travels are too noisy and are sometimes very disrespecful towards a culture .
As a matter of fact , I notice that the group tends too be very annoying .
On the contrary , the individual tourist will try to fit into the environment .
He generally shows more respect toward the local population and shows more curiosity .

Besides , travelling individually can offer the possibility to be in contact with the people of the country .
In contrast , when you are in a group , you are less curious to go talking with the local population .

Finally , I would say that travelling in a group led by a tour guide can be the worse way to discover a different country and another culture .
