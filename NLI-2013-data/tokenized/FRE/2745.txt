I think it is difficult to have a categoric response to this statement because I think it depens on the people .
But , I have to agree or disagree with this statement , so I think young people enjoy life more than older people do .

First , young people are `` young '' !
It implies a kind of unknowledge of life .
They do not have experiences and do not know the end of the situations they live ( in general ) .
So , as they do know anything , they enjoy more for each situation .
Moreover , they sometimes think that this situation could maybe never more happens , so they enjoy the present moment .
Although when you are older , you have a certain experience of life .
As you have been young , you had a lot of experiences in the past , and you know the end of each one .
So , I think older people do not take time to enjoy life when it is possible because they already live it .

Futhermore , I think young people have generaly a good health ( better than older people ) .
So , they have the possibility to do more things than older people .
This good health help young people to take risk without doubts or questions .
If a young people want to jump , he jumps !
And he does not have the worry of the others .

Moreover , young people enjoy life because they feel free .
They do not have problems at work , or family 's affairs ...
Only one thing counts : themselves .
This feeling of freedom helps them to be more spontanous or happy .
The innoncence of the child stay in each person but is less present in the older people mentality as the young one .
Young people have this child 's spirit that the older people lose with the years .

But finally , I think that older people in appearence can be young people inside .
Sometimes , older people enjoy life more than young people because of the death which can be near for them .
So , they enjoy day as if it was the last .
Life is too short , and had to be enjoy every day !!!
