I agree with this statement or at leat I hope it will become true since there is a real environmental need for re-organization of our communication means .
Climate overheating calls for it .

That said , this wo n't be possible without in-depth modifications of how people consider their way of living .
Cars are now very successful consumer products for several reasons ranging from comfort to social standing .

First of all they are very comfortable for they can transport individuals easily from one point to the other , avoiding the inconvenients of public transportation ( like suffering the weather while waiting , the noisy and narrow environment that is to be found in buses or trains , etc. ) , bringing you exactly where you have to be ( contrary to public transportation that is only present on main roads ) and being immediately available .

The second reason is that they participate to one 's appearance .
In a period where appearances are - sadly enough - worth more than money or gold for a lot of people , they are a very ostensible element of one 's ( self - ) identification to a social category .
Lots of people put a great pride into their car and worship them more than what would be expected of them .

I think there is a need for change .
And being a frequent car user does n't inhibit all logical reasonings in me .
The streets become overcrowded with car , getting from one point to the other takes more time than ever , pollution is becoming so heavy that it endangers our eco-system and our healths .

The solution will be found in public transportation .
More precisely , in a densification of public transportation routes , in an increased quality of public transportation means to offer more stability , more silence and to offer other services , some of which can be of great use to professionals ( think of the Internet , for example ) and in a reduction of their costs .

I think the train is a very interesting solution for long-distance transportation ( think of the success of the TGV and Eurostar ) while subways and tramways are better for short-distance .
Buses should be reserved for spots where there is no possibility to set up tramway routes .
Let 's not be too lazy and forget the bicycle .
A quick look at Amsterdam and Belgian cities like Ghent could be a good example of their utility and of the fact that habits can be changed in favour of a healthier world .
