I do n't believe this question can be answered by yes or no .
It all depends on the people , on the activities of these people and in the period they live in .

In the industrial revolution for example , you had to try something new to be successful because the activities were changing .
An activity in which one might have performed well suddenly got surpassed and that person was forced to change his activity .
The people who made the right changes became rich , others who had put their bets on the wrong horses became poor .

In the actual time both ways are possible to become successful .
The first way would be to stick to something you know you can do well , but you have to do it better than everybody else .
That usually is n't possible without investments and the risks that go with it .
So I think that , in most cases , there is no success without taking risks .

Another path to success would be to try something new .
In that case the risks are usually higher , but if it was the right thing to do , the rewards are higher too .
The difficulty here is that you have to get into the right thing at the right time .
The advantage by trying something new is that if the new thing does n't launch off , you can still go back to what you can do well .
If that happens you probably wo n't get really successful , but you have tried .
But to try something new is n't possible to everybody .
To get into a new thing requests the right ideas and much bravery .
Most people stay in what they 're doing , even if they 're unhappy , because they do n't have the guts to make a change .

In conclusion I would say that the most important factors for success are bravery , to take risks ; luck , to be in the right activity at the right time , the character to want to be better then the others and fantasy , to have the ideas .
Of course , you also need the skills to then lead your activity to success .
