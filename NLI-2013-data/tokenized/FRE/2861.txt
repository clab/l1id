It might be confusing at first , or might be obvious that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , but i disagree on this matter .
It cannot be contradicted that youth is full of exitment , experiencing new things and having a somewhat careless approach towards life because of the lack of responsibilities , but in my view , it is once someone has gone through all of this that they can finally enjoy life .

One of the most important matters proving this point is all of the disapointments experienced during youth .
At a young age , we all are convinced that everything is for the best .
We have unrealistic dreams , and exceedingly high expectations from everyone who surrounds us .
We live in this euphoria , in a perfect world very much like the peaceful garden of Eden .
Then , everyone goes through the unevitable course of life where we are disapointed , fooled and put back on earth .
It does sound terrible but it is only a natural stage in life .
We realize that our parents and siblings are not perfect , that our friends are not perfect .
We experience our first harsh heartbreak .
During adolescences we often live through an akward phase of discomfort with our own selves and do not seem to accept the person we are .
All of these stages are building blocks to make us into the person we end up being and accepting to be as an adult .
The path we need to go through to find who we are is one of the reasons why I do n't believe that young poeple enjoy life more than older people do .

Once we do arrive to the point of adulthood , which I have not personally reached but have observed through my parents and other adults around me , we finally accept who we are .
We look back on events or poeple that suprised us , that disapointed us or that satisfied us in the past and realise that often those helped us become who we are or in some cases are so insignificant .
Being an adult , once a person defines who they are and know who they are in their society , it is only then that they can really enjoy life .
When we have been disapointed and have discovered everyone 's true colors is when we are finally comfortable , and unless we feel comfortable we cannot enjoy life and do everything we really want to do .

Every stage in life is a beautiful one , although it is sometimes hard , but to me adulthood is really the stage we enjoy .
