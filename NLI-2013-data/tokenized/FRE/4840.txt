Our modern societies seem to be ruled by medias , communication , and advertisement , and we get the impression of being manipulated by these technologies .
Each day , while taking the subway , going to the moovies , listening to the radio or watching TV , we are constantly sinking in the flood of advertisements which , in my opinion , make products seem much better than they really are .

To start with , the products that are promoted by advertisements are always ideal , although nothning can be so .
Indeed , in adverstiements , products are said to be always reliable and to provide people with the exact thing they were expecting from it .
For instance , in advertisements for shampoo , we see perfect shining hair , but we never get to see such hair just by walking in the street .

Advert not only show that products are perfect , but also that people are suddenly happy in their whole life , on ly by using the product .
For instance , men who buy cars in car advertisements are always more beautiful after having bought it , they have magnificent girl friends , they are very popular and succeed at work .

The reason why they do so , is that they have to convince customers to buy one particular product more than another .
This means we know that they must manipulate customers in order to make profit , so it is an evidence that they make products seem much better then they really are .

To conclude , I would say that advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are , and customers always have to criticiz
