Event though it is really important to understand ideas and concepts because they represent the basis of knowledge , I disagree with the statement because I think that learning the facts is as much important , as well .
I have several reasons for my statement .

First , I think that the facts enables students to understand a concept , because it is more concrete , it is a kind of illustration in a lesson .
For instance for concepts in science , such as chemistry , it is not possible to understand a concept without experimenting a fact that illustrates the concept .
The concept of status modification for solids , liquids or gaz can only be assimilated when we have learnt that water evaporates at 100 degrees and is frozen at 0 degree .

Secondly , students remember easier the facts than the concepts , because it is more interesting and less academic for him .
For example , during field trips , students have good memories of their trip because they considered it as an entertainment even if the purpose of the trip was to teach an academic lesson .
Afterwards , students would remain the concepts because they would remain the trip and what they have seen during it .

Finally , it is more practical and efficient to learn facts than learn ideas .
Ideas and concepts are abstract notions that are difficult to learn and to represent in the mind .
Because they are very exhaustive in books , it is difficult to learn and to understand it without facts .
If we take the example of children that learn ideas and concepts all the time at school , we notice that they know their lesson appropriately but finally they do not really understand what they have been learnt in class .

So in my opinion , the best way to study is to learn facts as much as understand the ideas because they depend on each other .
