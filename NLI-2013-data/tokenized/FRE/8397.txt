The statement refers to the difference between understanding and illustrating .
I partly agree with this statement .
Being able to analyse as well as understand ideas and concepts is a crucial part of academic achievements .
Understanding concepts do not only confers students the ability to analize a situation but also to adapt this concept to other contexts .
Indeed , the role of a concept is to provide a broad base of understanding .
This intellectual exercise is part of the process that enable the student to switch from theoretical considerations to practical considerations .
This process is possible only through the concepts .
Consequently I think that we should consider concepts as more important regarding the fact that they are part of a constructive process .

We have seen above than the concept is a precious tool for the understanding process .
However , this tool must first be understood in itself .
And at this stage , factual elements remain crucial .
A concept is reliable only if it is illustrated by facts .
Therefore , I consider as also important that students learn facts because it represents the only way to understand concepts .
For example , a concept has no value without a broad factual basis .
Therefore , facts are important too for students .

As a conclusion , I would say that understanding concept is more important for students as a way to be able to analyse a situation .
However , factual elements seem crutial as a way to understand concepts .
My consideration on the comparative importance of the two elements would be to consider them as part of a unique process .
Thus , considering concepts without any references to factual elements seems useless .
Also , considering facts without joining it with concepts make any global operative approach imposssible .
