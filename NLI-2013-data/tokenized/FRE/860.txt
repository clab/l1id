To awser you will describe what are the different way of learn at school ( specific subjet or not ) afterward you will try to compare the two ` system ' and at last conclude .

A way to be clear is to take opposed two systems .
On the one hand the american system and in the other hand the french system .
There are son different .
In france during seven or more you have to study at less 6 subjects with two bigger than the other mathematic and French .
Student in FRance are get under stress with a lot of work because of the abondance of the subject .
There are under stress too because they kwon that this ' generalist ' way of studing will certainly not give them at the beginning of threre life a job .

The american system is much more pragmatic .
You choose during the start of your study one subject and try to becom the best in it .
You will become and expert and sell your ability to do your special subject to a compagny .
If your are goog you will find easily a job .

But the differencies could be explain ; in fact the two system have not the same idea of the education ( you want avoid to give my point of you it is as objective as possible )
The first , in france , have keed the idea of the XVIII centuary with the famous project of diderot and all of the higher autors of thye period .
There dreams were that education sould be the way for a citizen to get his freedom .
He know so he is free .
So french university is a big part of there dream .

Contrary to frenchm USA want good worker for a good economie .

Defenitevement i prefer Franche system and the French way of life .
