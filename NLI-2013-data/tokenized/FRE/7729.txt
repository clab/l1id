Nowadays , there are several different ways to travel .
In my opinion , the easiest way to travel is for sure to travel with a group led by a tour guide .
But the easiest is generally not the more interesting !

In this way of travelling , everything is planned for you in each level of the travel .
The tour guide is here to bring you to the most famous places , finest restaurants , museums ..
As vacation rimes with having rest , it 's a lazy way to discover a country , without doing any preparation .
It is also a way to meet new people and maybe new friends in the group .

Unfortunately , the bad side of this kind of travel is a lake of freedom .
You have to respect the planning of visit , be with a group all the time .

Actually , it is a way to travel that I am not used to .
I like to prepare my travel , to do some research about the place that I will go visit .
In this way , I feel free to do exactly the things that I really want to .
I buy books and maps , after a little bit of lecture , the place becomes mine .
I feel more at ease doing exactly what I was looking for .
I like adventure a lot , I walk in places that tourists do n't usually go with a tour guide .
I like to speak with people from the place to have advice on what I should do or see .
I am not the kind of person who leaves the controle to someone else .

As a conclusion , I would say , that travelling with a group led by a guide is certainely a good way to travel .
But I desagree in the fact that it is the best way .
I personnaly think , that a travel is personal , and I prefer to be guided by my own feelings , and my sens of adventure .
I 'd rather be my own guide .
