Will there be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there is today ?
This is an important question to which many people would like to answer .
We will see that some arguments supports this idea and other does not .

The price of gas has increadibly raised during the last few years .
This made the fact of having a car not affordable to many people .
If the price continues to increase gas will become a very luxuous product and it is not the car that will be expensive , but the gas you use to make it work !
Then there will be fewer cars in use .
This tendancy is already there , because some people have a car but do not use them as often as they did because they cannot buy the gas .

A big problem that we have nowadays is pollution .
Because of that many decisions have to be taken in order to prevent the planet from dying .
One source of pollution is the gas that get out of the cars .
Some cities already took mesures in order to protect their areas and their environment , such as London .
Now you have to pay to get into the city .
Then many people let their car outside of the city and take the bus , which pollutes less because more people use it at once .
Another example is what you can find in the United States .
On the motorways some lines are only for cars with at least two people inside .
And most of the time these lines are the fastest !
It then encourage people to share their cars .
Then we can see that having less cars in use will probably become necessary if we want our planet to survive .

On the other hand people need to use their car more and more .
The main explanation is that nowadays you change job very often and people travel more .
If someone has a job , buy a house and a car , what should he do if he changes job ?
should he buy a new house each time ?
It is not a realistic solution .
He will have to use his car to go to work .
There is not only for the job that you need your car .
People like to do many cultural activities or they like to travel .
For all of that most of the time you need a car .
For all this reasons of freedom and independance , it is not sure that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years .

I think that it is possible that there will be fewer cars in twenty years because of the price of the gas and the pollution problems .
It will become a necessity for the planet .
On the other hand as people really need their car , nothing will change unless some measures are taken such as better public transportation , but not only in one city but within them , without forgetting lands and very small towns .
