According to my point of view , sucessful people try new things and are likely to take more risk .

The main reason would be the fact that when a person manages to achieve a goal , he wants to have something new and more difficult to do .
Human beings are hardly satisfied and I ca n't help thinking that when somebody has succed in something , he will always want more .

Alpinists , for exemple , do n't usally stop climbing after they managed to reach their first summit .
They always want to climb an other montain , harder and higher .
Napoleon 's Bonaparte , the french emperor and conquerant did n't stop going on war and facing battle until he was finaly defeated .
And I think because he was sucessful in a first time , he could n't get rid of his will of power .

An other reason would be the fact that sucessful people can start being bored by what they do , even if their activity matches success .
So to avoid this phenomenon , they just start a new thing .
We can find this kind of behaviour in sports .
We can take the exemple of a great champion such as Valentino Rossi , who had won dozen of world championships .
Well , he is now looking forward to become a forula one driver .
Because he wants something new .
Something that gives him the opportunity to achive a other great goal .

A last important factor is , according to me , the fact that when somebody managed to win something , or to earn something , he would probably want to get more of it .
No matter if it is money , glory or power .
The joy of winning might even be more important than the profit whitch came with this success .
A good exemple would be a poker player or a gambler .
After winning some money , they would probably bet more of it .
And it is actualy dificult to get rid of this circle .
