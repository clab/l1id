Succesful poeple are poeple who do things well .
What is difficult is to know in advance if it is a good or a bad thing .
But how can we manage to be a succesful person .

You have to take risk .
Of course you have to be quiet sure of your action .
But what is fare more inportant is to believe in yourself .
For exemple if you are a good singer but that you do n't believe in yourself you can be sure that you will never become a famous star .

Of course taking always risk can be dangerous specially when you like it .
For exemple somebody who likes going to the casino may loose a lot of money , so in this case taking risk is n't a good thing .

In fact you must find balance .

To be successful means also trying new things .
But new things are not always good , you have to try before beeing sure it is a good idea .
But in fact what is really inportant is to learn of your mistakes .

For exemple if you try to passe an exam but that you failled what is important is to learn of your mistake so it will not happend again .

By using this way of thinking you will learn a lot of things and than will be able to do them well .
But to become somebody successful you have to take risk and try new things because otherwise you will never learn how to do things well
