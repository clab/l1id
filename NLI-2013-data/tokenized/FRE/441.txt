I think I would agree with the statement that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Having vast knowledge in several kind of subjects allows you to have an opinion on such or such topic whereas if you specialize in only one area of study , you cannot form a rich opinion on any other area of study but your own .

If you take the French academic system versus the American one .
It clearly shows this difference .
In France , when you enter university you have to choose a section , for example If I want to major in English , I wo n't be able to add psychology as a minor .
So you have to specialize yourself quite early .
Although this system tends to change , little by little , now with the ECTS system , which basically premits French students to go and study through Europe with the transfer of their credits and vice versa ..

Whereas in the United States , each class is assigned to a specific number of credits , during your first two years of college you are able to choose within the large catalog of classes as long as you get a enough credits to validate your academic year .
This means that you can take an anthropology as well as an algebra class .
Thanks to this system , it enables you to get to know various subjects and to be able , later on , to choose in what realm of study you want to pursue your studies .
In my opinion , this system is part of the reason why so many international students want to come and study in America .
They want to see what each subject has to offer before specializing in one in particular .
