It 's a well spread idea that in order to achieve success in life , one has to be inventive and try to develop new things that have not been tried before .
We may call it positive thinking or proactive action as many self aid books and success stories like to put it .

Besides , the succes is usually linked to quantity and quality capacity to accumulate material stuff , and success people are frequently shown to be driving expensive cars , living in gorgeous mansions or consuming expensive products .

Much of it is actually a pure illusion .
If only somebody would count how many projects fell through in the past for one that could achieve success we would come quickly to the conclusion that taking risk is not always synonim of success .
The proof is that even when someone tries to apply a well succeded formula tested elsewhere , the result is not always the same .

Why on earth then this idea is so popular among people ?
Naturally there is a kind of uneasiness that makes human being to look for new pleasures and to avoid pain .
The problem is how to drive this want of change in the society , when millions of people try to evolve to a better situation .
The response is that creating the myth of success , more and more people will take risks in order to draw up new possibilities , which is generally good to the person who does that but also to the group in general , as this idea is put in practice to the benefit of other persons or societies .
Eventually that attitude will be positive because it will generate evolution of the group with respect to other competing groups , even if in the process a large number of entrepeneurs has heavy losses in failed projects .

Nevertheless , in order to make it work and spread into society , the estabilishment has to divert attention of the bad cases and try to get across only the successful stories .
