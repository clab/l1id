In physics , teachers nowadays try to teach their students the so called physical sense .
It means to understand , to predict a phenomenon without filling blackboards of equations .
If we zoom out of the scientific fields , we can compare , on one hand , the understanding of ideas and concepts to the physical sense , and on the other hand , the facts to the equations which describe the phenomenon .
Both are intrisiquently linked .
A good scientific can explain the most difficult phenomenon to anybody , as well as he can demonstrate a theory .

In History , facts have their own importance and significance .
They keep ideas and concepts in the real world , avoiding people to get far from reality .
Facts are pillars , whereas ideas can change .
What makes Nazis different from any racist and populist groups ?
The extermination camps .
On one edge , we have ideals that have to be condamned , on the other side , we have pieces of evidence , that once , democratic countries let Nazi Germany killing millions of people just because they were Jew .
If a history teacher wants to present the horror of the extermination of Jewish people , he cannot talk only about Nazi ideals .
He must mentionning Auschwitz .
And Auschwitz is a fact .

Ideas and concepts can be defined as frames , whereas facts are details .
Details make the difference .

On a teaching point of view , is it easier to learn facts or to learn concepts ?
Facts give the concept a practical substance , making it easier to reach .

I think it is as important to learn concepts as to learnf facts
