I really agree with this statement .
I am sure that one day there will have fewer cars than today or that these cars will be different than today .
Cars produce so much pollution and cause dammages to our environment .
the problem is that everyone use his own car to go working , go to school , or other activities .
it could be so much better if people use one car for four persons .
At firts the pollution will be reduce and also that is cheaper to share the costs of transport between four persons .

An other way to reduce the number of cars is to not use it too often and use it only for long travel , if it is possible use a little moto or bycicle for short travel .

Take the bus or the train can be an other good alternative to the cars , but in this case the govrnment must give more money to these public transports for allow them to reduce the price of a ticket .

Futhermore , having more taxes on the oil , tax of circulation , and give a reduction to workers who use public transports can influence behaviours .
There will be fewer cars , but I think also that they will be differents than today .
We must look for others oil , more respectfull of nature .
As an exemple we can not the sun ( but the problem is that in every country the sun is not shining all the day and more , not every days ) , the wind but it is the same problem , it 's depend too much of the climatics conditions .
Today there are some hybride cars , that 's show the a beginning of a changement but not the end .

If we want to save our world , everyone must do something , it is a socitie problem .
More cars , will reduce the problem of pollution and heathl .
