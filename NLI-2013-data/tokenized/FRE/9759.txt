Everybody dreams secretly to be succesful at least one day in their life .
To reach it , I am completly agreed to say that a good receipe for sucess is to take risks and try new things rather than following the normal pattern of life .
In fact , you need to show some caracteristics and to have the good personnality to accomplish this dream .

First , I think that if you want to have sucess in your life , you need to risk a lot .
You need to be strong and positive .
There is a saying in French which is `` Qui risque rien na rien '' .
This means that if you do not try , you are going to have nothing .
For exemple , if somebody wants to start his own business and he needs to put everythings he has for it , this person is taking a enormous risk .
Maybe he needs to take all his money to invest in his compagnie .
Doing that , this person can lose everything but can also succeed , and becaome rich .
And all this is because of all his efforts and risks he took .

Futhermore , a second thing is necessary to reach success .
This important thing is to be able also to try new things .
Sometime , you can not be sure about doing something but I think people who really succeed are them who try everything even if they are not sure at 100 % .
These persons just feel it and they go for it For exemple , any artist need to try new things to keep their success .
People around them are there to giving them tip and the artist need to chose which new thing they are going to try .
It is not all the time really easy but it is part of the receipe to success .

If you think about all the sucessful people , you will realise how much they had taken risk in their life
