Nowadays we can find lots of products in the market .
In order to sell these products , there are also many advertisements .
I do agree this this statement which says that most of advertisements make products seem much beter than they really are .

First , for example when you see in television some products , it attracts you .
Then when you go shopping and you bring this product at home .
But , when you taste it you are very disapointed because you do not feel like the person on the advertisment .
You feel unhappy .
It is true that sometimes I buy products that I have seen in advertisement .
For example , last time I bought some yoghurts I saw in advertisement , and it was said that it is not too sweet .
I do not tell you my dissatisfaction when I put one spoon fo this in my mouth .
But It was too sweet !
Thus , the advertisment lies .

Secondly , some advertisements draw you attention because the picture you see is very pretty and attractive .
So you decide to find this good you see and o the market where you can bring it .
Sometimes what you see do not correspond to what you have seen in the advertisement .
I would like to state you one of my experience .
I am not one of those who like to watch television but when I put it on and decide to see some program I look even advertisement .
Anyway , I saw a vaccum in advertisement and decided to go and see it .
Of course I intended to buy it .
But I do not because it does not look like what I saw , however it was exactly the same product .

To conclude , I would just want to you aware of the fact that often advertisements are not true .
Their aim is to make you buy thier products and to show attractive things .
Consequently , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
