Can we say that success and creation are linked ?
The main point is to make a difference between financial success and personal success .

Through a finanacial point of view .
New things are not always successful .
Indeed , success as well as failure are parts of the risk .
For instance , when you gamble in a casino , you can win but you also can win .
Maybe the first thing is to analyze what is to be successful .

A successful person can also be the one who tries what he really wanted to try , the one who is not afraid of realizing his dreams .
The issue of the try does n't influence the value of the act .
Which is taken into account is the will to realize his projects and achieve his deams .
Therefore , we can say that people who acts and reacts are successful poeple .

They attract admiration and respect from the others .
Indeed , taking risks and trying new things are a proof of courage .
Trying new things can turn a person into a leader .
Even if the try ends up to be a failure , because it is new , it is always a start for something else new .

In Arts , Surrealism , after the Second Wold War was rejected in favor of Existentialism .
The Surrealists did n't change the world as they wanted to do it .
Nevertheless , they opened new possibilities of creation and they appeared as a new source of inspiration .
They forced admiration because they were not afraid of chocking people and making fun of sensitive values like death and war .
Andre Breton remains in France the representative of a successful movement .
