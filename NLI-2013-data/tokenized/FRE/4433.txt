Advertisement is meant to attract people attention in order to sell a product .
In this case , I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .

Advertising companies use people 's psychology in the way they present a product .
They can make fusture customers relate to the products , and ultimately buy it .
Advertising companies rely on how people relate to their products : for example , a brand of shampoo may want to reach out to stay at home mothers and tell them that they will be `` sexy '' and attractive by using it ; a company that sells baseball bats may want to reach to fathers and tell them that by buying thair bats and playing with their sons , they will be heros .
It is not necessarily the product in itself that attract people , but how the advertisement is presented and the idea behind it .

Not every advertised product is good .
For example , I saw an ad on TV about a vaccum .
The ad said that the vacuum could even clean bacteries from the air and that it deep cleans the carpet .
It looked good to me , so I bought it : the vaccum broke the next day .

There is no real way from knowing if a product is good or bad because there are so many advertisements nowadays .
The only way of knowing is by trying out the product ; and by that time , the advertisement company achieved one thing : selling their product .

Advertisement is a part of our society to the point where we cannot tell what is true and what is not in the matters of products : what brand is really better ?
Do we take price into account ?
As a customer , there is so much to take into account that we end up being confused and choosing what `` looks '' good .

Advertisers know how to make use of this fast-paced society , where people do not have time to look closely at a product before buying it .
It is ultimately the way the product is presented that makes them profit ; not the quality of the product .
