In our society , being successful has become a necessity , due to the very strong pressure faced by the individual ever since he is a child in terms of financial , intellectual , cultural and personal achievement .

What is it exactly that we refer to when we talk about successful people ?
What is it about them that we envy so much ?
Are successful people those who take risks and do new things , or those that stick to their domaine of expertise ?

It seems to me that we ca n't figure out what makes somebody successful if we do n't ask ourselves in the first place how we define success .
The images of success that prevail in our society , through advertising , television or stars , mostly deal with material goods that have little to do with personal achievement and basicly reflect financial success .
And even though everybody criticizes it , we have to admit that financial and material comfort are the most common and envied form of success .
Consequently , we might conclude that to achieve this goal , it is smarter to find a domaine of expertise and stick to it , in order to become a well-known doctor , lawyer or scientist and benefit from it in terms od social status and financial advantages .

Nevertheless , being a successful person might mean something very diferent , if we put in perspective the inherent social pressure and focuse more of the individual 's happiness and self-achievement .
Beinf successful in the eyes of the others is one thing , feeling successful and happy is a totally diferent matter , that might imply to satisfy one 's curiosity and follow one 's dreams .
In that case , successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks , in the sense that they followed their instincts and sometimes jeopardized their financial comfort to achieve something more personal they believed in .
Of course , when these people are famous rock stars or movie icons , everybody will recognize their success because they also made a lot a money , but what about all the totally anonymous people ?
To me , a lawyer that turns in a restaurant owner , a businessman who decides to write poetry are successful if they feel good about what they do , no matter how they are perceived by society .

To conclude , I would say that doing new things and taking risks is totally necessary for the individual to face the diferent sides of his personality , but they do not always match with being successful in the social meaninf of the word .
