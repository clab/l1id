Many people can think that the more you go to school the more you will be able to understand the world .
They think that going to university make you become an open-minded person .

At the university you learn theory - ideas and concepts - but what will theory be useful for you if you have n't any practice - facts ?

For example , I am a civil engineering student and at school I 'm learning science of structures or how calculate the rate of steel you have to put in concrete to make a good prestressed concrete ?

The theory looks pretty good .
However in fact when you are on a site work all that theory is not helpful .
It 's only the experience that will give you the good rate of steel .

Even if I think that understand the concept of prestressed concrete is very important , only the facts will show you how to be a good civil engineer .

To illustrate , I will give my example .
Last summer I made a training course in a house building company .
Even if I had studied civil engineering for one year , I was unable to give order to plumbers or electricians or other handworkers because I did n't know in fact , in reality , on the site , how they can execute the plans .

I think that concepts and facts must be taught together .
You have to understand the concepts and to know to what they are related to in the real world .
It 's important to always be connected to the reality .
An idea without its application can be misunderstanding .
Speaking of AIDS without speaking of the real dangers in all countries , without speaking of Africa 's problems could make a student think that it ca n't happen to him , that it is a rare disease , that he 's not conerned .
That is not acceptable .
