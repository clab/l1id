How general or specializied studies should be is an issue that still trigers the education community wordwide .
To a certain extent , I tend to agree with people who think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help students reacting better when facing new environments and challenges .

First of all , today 's challenges increase in complexity and involve various skills and knowledge to resolve them .
For instance , terrorist threats create challenges for free movment of persons .
As a lawyer , I cannot advise the without an ethical dimension .
Having general knowledge on topics such as Law , Security policy and even Philosophy , will help me dealing with the problem as a whole .

Second , I personaly think that having general knowledge will allow me to be quicker and flexible when dealing with new issues .
It is a common place to say that general knowledge will help someone acquire specialized knowledge through experience .
It will help him t turn to new subjects with ease , while a spealized student must encounter difficulties in learning to work on other topics .

These considerations should however be balanced .
Since today 's challenges are getting more complex , professionals are asked to have strong knowledge in their specific field of expertise .
All in all , the best education is probably the one complementing general knowledge learned in school with specialized knowledge learned during professional life .
