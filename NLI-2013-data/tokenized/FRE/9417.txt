Certain persons think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts then it is for them to learn facts .
Indeed , the understanding of ideas and concepts could seem to be more valuable , ideas and concepts implying abstract thinking and ability to have a reflexion disconnected from the concrete world .
However , I think that learning facts is essential and more important for students than the understanding of ideas and concepts , for the following reasons :

At first , for young students it is difficult to understand ideas and concepts .
Most of their work consists in learning facts , for example by naming objects and defining them ( a child will be shown for example a yellow fruit and he will learn that it is a lemon ) .
Therefore stating that ideas and concepts are more important would result in considering that most of the things you learn as a child would not be worth learning .
Such a position is not defendable .

Moreover , you cannot be able to understand ideas and concepts if at some point you have not been able to learn facts .
Most of the time ideas and concepts derive from observations made with respect to facts .
For example the theory of Galileo about the rotation of the earth comes from observations he has made in the real world not only from abstract thinkings .
As a result we may consider that learning facts is essential to the discovery of ideas and concepts .

Furthermore , facts may help people to understand ideas and concepts by illustrating abstract thoughts .
As a result , If you are unable to learn facts you will not be able to understand ideas and concepts .

At last , in certain fields , such as history , facts are essential to the comprehension of the subject matter .
As history is a succesion of facts , considering that facts are irrelevant or less important than ideas and concepts , would imply that history is not an important field .
Such a position could not be agreed with .

By way of conclusion , I think that learning facts constitutes an essential step towards the understanding of ideas and concepts .
