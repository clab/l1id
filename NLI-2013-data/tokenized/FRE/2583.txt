Although some people consider that young people enjoy life more than older people do , I disagree with this statement .
There are mainly two reasons that makes me think it is false .

Fisrst of all : what does ` enjoying ' mean ?
I think that this term is too often associated with parties , and all these kinds of things that young people do .
Usually , young people enjoy going on holidays with friends , to the sea , to the mountain and so on .
Or they can have fun by organizing some big parties , or by going to music shows .
That is the way the most of young people ` large it up ' .
But I think ` enjoying ' life is more than that .

Maybe that older people have not the same expectations concerning their evenings and their life .
For example , they meet friends to discuss or to play cards instead of dancing all night long .
They may also be happy because they have children and they see them growing , and because they form a family .

To conclude I think that enjoying life depends on what you mean by ` enjoying ' , and that the criteria of enjoyment vary with the age of people .
That is why I wrote that it is possible to enjoy life at an equal level , if you are a young person or an older person .
