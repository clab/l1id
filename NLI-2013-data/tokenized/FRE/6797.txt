Car industry is one of the biggest industry of the world today .
Car are part of the daily life of people all over the world .
I do n't know how many people takes their car every morning to reach their job location ?
So , for sure I can not imagine our society without cars today ...
but in twenty years ?

To try to answer to this problematic I will first hightlight the reasons why I think it 's possible to have fewer cars in use in twenty years .
Then I will focus on the opposite argument .

First we can consider that with the development of other transportation industries like planes , trains , buses etc ...
people will more and more use these transports instead of their car .
This will be probably more true for people who lives in big cities .
For example , in Mexico city , you may take 4 hours to cross the city from the North to the South .
But if you use the buses or subways network , one hour could be enough ...
So what I would like to demonstrate is that the use of the car could be a drawback in such situation and I think that people will be more and more aware about that .
The other factor that can influence people to use less their car is the competitive prices of other transportations .
For example , with the low cost companies you can go and go back from Paris to Milano by plane for around 50 US dollars .

Secondly , I have to admit that even if new opportunities to move from a point to another one are increasing and will continue to , people like and need to have their own car .
I will take two examples to show how I imagine the way the cars in use will increase .

For instance , In France ( but I guess it 's the same in most countries ) , people are more and more living in the suburbs or big citties .
They think the quality of the life there is better .
But with this new way of life , they will for sure need to use their car to go to the center of the city where their job is , but also the supermarket etc ...

The second example I would like to give you is a Mexican example .
In Mexico , you use cars to show your social level .
So most of the rich Mexican people owns more than one car .
They have a car to go at work , a car to go out , a car to do shopping etc ...
But Mexico will be probably more developed in twenty years , that means more wealthy people and so more cars in use ...

So , from my point of view , in twenty years we will propably be able to decrease the number of cars in use , but due to the social life amd the habits of people it will be impossible .

To conclude I will say that even if I do n't believe it will be possible in twenty years , I really hope that it would be in the future ...
we need to preserve our environment ..
