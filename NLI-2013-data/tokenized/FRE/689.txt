This question has two answers for me , because I agree and disagree at the same time .
I will first tell you why I think it is better to be specialized on one subject , and then I will explain to you why for me you gain more by having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

First of all I have to say that if you know a lot about a great deal of subject you can not be a specialist in one subject .
You can talk about a lot of thinks , but you will keep on talking about the basics of those thinks .
You would not be able to go deep into a conversation .

However on the other hand I think it is more interesting to learn about different topics .
I do not think your brain is limited to a number of knowledge , so for me it is always good to learn new things .
The more you know about things , the more you are open minded .
I personaly think it is very important to be open minded , because then you become more tolerant , and you accept more , and learn more again .
If you know a large range of things , you are also able to talk about more things , so you are not left over on certain conversations .

In my opinion it is very important to be curious , to discover and to experiment a lot of things .
The more you do , the more you learn , and life become more interesting .
However it is also necessary to be specialised in one subject .
When you are specialised you become more precise , and you can go deeper into the subject , it become more interesting than to stay on the basics of one subject .
Like everything in life it is a question of balance .
