In my opinion , apart from some specfic cases of people who are ` self taughed ' , we always need to use the experience of our ancestors .
It is completly insane to set a frontier between past and present .

Success in whatever field is built on past experiences .
For instance , in biology , current scientists are leading research programs using the conclusions of former scientists .
Alexander Fleming discovered pennicilline in the 1920s and medical progress could not be as advanced as it is today if he had not .

Nevertheless , admittedly , if you do not take risks , you are not likely to make progress .
Indeed , if investors had not trusted scientists to fund their researches , there would not have been such an advanced science .
Investors can be States , private companies , etc .
They take risks because when they invest their money in medical reserach for intance , they are not sure that this research program will be successful tomorrow .
If the program fails , they can lose all the money they invest in such a program to the detriment to other potential successful programs .

The solution would be to match both the opinions .
Most of successful people try new things and use what they know from former experiences at the same time .
Indeed , people must call themselves into question before taking risks and they must try new things to survive .
Tht is why human being are so different from animals .
This is what we call human intelligence .
Not to take danger

Basically , I think both parts of the statement are true but we must bind rhem together not oppose them .
Indeed , in order to go further in the analysis , it is impossible to take risks whithout using what we know and , on the contrary , you cannot make progress without taking risks .
