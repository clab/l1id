I agree with the `` statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' In the fist place , companies take in considaration all of the matters that make a product a good one before they advitise it .
They use diferent types of madiations too to atract the people like colors , big shapes and polish .
Mamy times customers order item via phones or internet and find them rather urgly , small or even not what they expenting to be when they are delivred .
In the hand , not all products are as good as they were advitized by the media .
An example of a product that wa n't good was a lady 's purse which loocked moore actactive in the newspaper that is was as shuch .

Furthermore , many of automobile companies have adaptation to the local or rural areas but that does never appears in the advertisement .
A typical example of an automobile which has adatation proble is .
Most of the food product industries had to test the taste of local consumers in order in adapte the taste and local expetaions to be able to sell their products in foreing countries .
An examples of company which did the mos amaging test to adapt the taste to local cusumers is NESTLET which has more 200 slitly diferent brand of nescafe .

In order wards , advertisement in general is a way of making a product seem the best than the other products or a tendency to atract more customers .
