Environmental issues and sustainable development are and become more and more fashion everyday .
Some politicians try to make those questions unavoidable .
For instance , Al Gore in the United States , ( ex-vice president under Clinton 's administration ) who 's releasing a movie on global warming ; or to a lesser extent , in France where some intellectuals would like to talk about the subject in the scope of the next elections .
In this oultook , in twenty years , will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
Will they even disappear ?

I do n't think so .
Our current world lives under the influence of globalization .
Means of communication , physical or virtual , are playing more and more a sizeable role in our daily lives .
We build everyday bridges , motorways , we create networks through internet optic wires all over the world .
We live in a logistical world if I can put it this way .
In this context , I hardly imagine the end of cars , or the decrease in car numbers , which is surely the best mean of transport for all the citizens .
Futhermore , the emerging markets consume more and more cars and all cars manufacturers already produce millions of cars for chinese people or indian people .
In twenty years , we will not ` bury ' the car but , this latter will certainly take other forms , a form that will less jeopardize the planet .
I think about brazilian cars that are already hybrid cars .

Nevertheless , let 's not forget that more than 80 per cent of the population is urban .
And , this major trend will go on .
All the cities are already totally overcrowded by cars , full of congestions .
All the cities try to limit the number of cars .
London has even implemented a tax to prevent people from driving in the city .
In this context , we can think that in twenty years the numbers of cars will decrease .
Thus , clean public transport or even bikes or motorcycles will know a revival , will be born again .
It 's conceivable .

Therefore , which of these two trends will prevail ?
I hope the second one ...
