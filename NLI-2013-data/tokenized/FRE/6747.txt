I disagree with the statement according to which there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .
As this statement is however supported by strong arguments , I will firstly name them before indicating why I disagree .

It is nowadays wellknown that cars cause heavy pollution which damage the environment as well as the human health .
In particular the CO2 rejected by cars destroy the ozon .
In some cities of the world the air is nearly not breathable any more and the citizens of such cities face , for instance , heavy asthma problems .
Therefore cities all around the world try to set up car free zones and to improve the quality of the public transportation .
In addition , petrolium ressources are becoming rarer every day which leads to increasing petrolium prices for consummers .
All these reasons may lead people not to buy cars in the comming years and eventually lead to a decrease of the number of cars in use .

One should however consider that as technology develops every day , petrolium may soon not be needed anymore to move cars .
Electricity is more and more commonly used to make cars move .
Main car constructors like Mercedes are nowadays building such electric cars with a large autonomy .
This new generation of cars is quite cheap which will even permit people who did not own a car before to buy one .
Electricity also solves the pollution related problems and may therefore encourage people to buy cars .

Another reason why the number of cars will not decrease in the twenty next years is that cars allow people to be much more flexible and autonomious than planes or trains do .
Some places in the world can simply not be reached without cars .

In addition , driving is a passion for many people .
This leads to the final argument against the statement : it is difficult to change people 's minds and habits and it will definetely take more then twenty years to stop people considering cars as part of our culture .
