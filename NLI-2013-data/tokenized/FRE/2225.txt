The poet Rimbaud said in one of his masterpiece `` We are not serious when we are 17 years old '' .
This quote corresponds to a very common belief that young people enjoy life more than older people do , and the reality seems to match with this statement .

Indeed , when you are yound , the mistakes you can possibly do are excused for they are called `` experience '' whereas when you are an adult , you have no longer the right to fail Life is more enjoyable for young people rathen than old ones , for they do not have to worry about future the way grown up do .
They do not have the responsability of raising children , being good parents and earning enought money in order to provide a good hoousehold .

When you are young , you have your entire life ahead of you so you get the opportunity to fully enjoy it without worrying about the next morning .
This is not the case for old people who are aware of their advanced age in life and have just to wait for death to come get them .
Young people do not have this kind of preoccupation in mind .
They are only willing to learn and to discover what life offers them .
They have this constant curiosity , which is the main key that make them being so different from older people .
Yet , this curiosity is the reason why because younger people enjoys life more than older people do .
On one hand , the latter are too demanding and expected too much from life .
Young people , on the other hand , are not as picky as old people and they enjoy everything , even te slightest thing such as their first holidays without parents or their first nigt out .
It is part of their developement
