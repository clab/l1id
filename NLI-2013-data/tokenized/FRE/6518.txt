The issue at hand is to know how the evolution of the population will contribuate to the development of the utilisation of cars .
I 'm agree with the prompt , thet states that in `` twenty years there will be fewer cars in use ''

First , the development of technology makes that it easier to use other way that cars for traveling .
in fact , nowaday , the underground are very developed , and faster than before , and also really good accomodate to the people 's needs .
moreover , people have been used to use cars to travel far away or to go to vacation sites , but today habits have changed .
people want to spend more time to enjoy than to travel so they choose to go with planes or train , and so do n't need car .

Those new habits made me believe that it will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Secondly , i believe that it will be fewer cars in use , because there is to much trafic in the city .
the fact tht in the last few years the number of cars increase makes a lot of diffuculties to drive into the city .
to do just one kilometer you spend more time to wait in your car that to drive .
i know from my own experience of driver , that if i want to be on time for a meeting i 'd rather choice to wolk or to use the subway , so we do n't need a car anymore .
Therefor i believe that it will be fewer cars .

Futhermore , i believe that it will be fewer cars because people are more and more understand the inpact of cars on the envirement .
in fact , the increase of cars those few decades made the level of pollution very high .
with the help of scientists who explain affect of gases on the envirement , people will choose another way to travel without having an impact on the envirement .

For this reason i think that it will be fewer cars in the future .

Finally , in my view it will be less cars because it become very expensive to have one .
in fact , i 'm living in Paris and with all the new investigations there no place to park the car without paying , and with all that the price of the fuel does n't stop to increase , so you understand that people thimk twice before they decide to by a car .

This points also makes me believe that the number of cars in use will be fewer than today .

To conclude , I think that it will be les cars in twenty years thant today because car does n't still have all the advantage of those days , and now much more desadvantage makes the drivers use other wat to travel .
