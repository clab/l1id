All along the day , we are surrounded by cars .
They are integrated in our environment and they are part of our life .
Nowadays , cars have become the main way to transport humans .
There are different ways to use it for the daylife or occasionally .
You can use it when you go to your workplace , at school , to do shopping , or to go to holidays .
However , the abusive use of the cars has led to many problems such as costs , price of oil , the depedency of arabian countries , pollution , the traffic .
So , there is a dilema because we both need cars and in the same time they are destroying our planet .

In the first part , we will discuss about the positive aspects of the cars , in the second part we will discuss about the drawbacks of using a car and finally we will discuss about the alternatives of the car .

First of all , cars have a social and economic impact .
When you have a great car , it means that you have a high salary and a high social position .
Cars ' constructors have understood this and they want to offer to their customers the most technollogical advanced car with a high power motor and they also add some gadgets such as GPS , television and other many options .
The constructors made a lot of benefits on it and they have high return on investment .
So , cars have a positive impact on the economy and I do n't think that the government will try to put restrictions on this .

However , the government , tries to limit pollution .
In France , you have not the right to use you car when there is a high level of pollution in the air .
He tries to regulate the traffic and push people to use common transports such as the bus or the subway .
In my opinion more and more people do n't use their car any more to avoid the traffic .

There are some alternatives such as hybrid car which don ' t use oil .
I think this is the best solution because it is a compromise .
