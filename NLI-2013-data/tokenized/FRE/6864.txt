I think that it will effectively have fewer cars in use in the future than we can meet today .
I feel this way because i believe that many factors will make us to let our cars at home .
From ourselves , from the nature , but also from the states .

First , i consider that an auto pollutes a lot and if we continue to pollute our world , like we have already done through the ozone hole for exemple , we wo n't be able tu live on earth without bad changements .
That 's why i think that people will do something from themselves in order to help the nature staying good for us .
They will for exemple prefer to walk because they will understand that if everyone make something , it wo n't have little signals .

Another reason i believe that thre will be fewer cars in twenty years it that the states of al countries will do something against cars like they begin to do nowadays .
for exemple the days without cars .
Furthermore , we are seeing that more and more ways to drive bike or to take buses ans undergrounds are built in order to make people let their cars at home .
And i think that if the states do something , the population will have to use teses ways .

And then , the reason i would like to emphasize is the fact that it will have a lack of petrol on the earth and the humankind will have to find another type of things to move such as we have already showed ( underground for exemple ) .
So , if even the nature does n't give much power for the cars anymore we will have to reduce our use of cars .

As i have stated , i believe that many ways from ourselves , from the state and most important from the nature make us to use not so often .
It will continue in the future that 's why i tink there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years
