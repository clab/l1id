My point of view about this topic is clear and precise : I totally disagree with this statement .
I am going to explain the reasons why I think young people generally give enough time to helping their communities .

The best example I could explain is about myself .
In fact , I am engaged in an association as a volunteer , the name of the association is worldwide known as `` EMAEUS '' .
The goal of this association is to provide help to poor people by providing to them the food they need , or in winter by collecting used clothes from generous families and give it to the poorest .

Here are two of the possibilities by witch you can work as a volunteer , but there are several others issues .
My best friend for example graduated his business school on last year , so he has a diploma in finance and accounting major .
Thanks to those knowledges he has about accounting , he engaged himself for working 5 hours per week as account manager for the association EMAEUS , and as a volunteer of course .
My friend and I do that because we want to fell usefull , and this provides a good personal satisfaction to help the ones who are in need .

The second reason why I disagree whith that statement is because in the country I live in ( France ) , this enjoyement for helping communities is becoming more and more common .
In schools or universities for example , we could find lots of advertizings for becoming engaged in associations , and this have more responses that attepted .
People in France are very quiet about helping their commuunities .
