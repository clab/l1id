I definitely agree with this statement !
Everyday government uses different measures and tries to involve people in the pollution problem that our planet faces at the moment .
There are two types of measures that the government uses to discourage people to use their cars so as to fight with the pollution .

On the one hand , ` green ' or social values get more and more important to the society and are stressed in newspapers and advertising .
For instance in my city we can often see advertisings for using public transport instead of your own car .
In addition to this type of communication , the city of Lyon introduced a new concept of moving from one point to another by using bicycles .
This company is called VELO'V and allows people to borrow a bicycle for a certain amount of time practically for free !
The subsciption fee is about 5 euros per year which is very tempting !

On the other hand , government puts barriers to the use of the car in the city center by fixing entry fees or by making parking fees very high .
For example in London you have to paye 8 pounds to get to the City of London !
And also you have to paye again when you want to drive back home .
This measure has encouraged many English people to use trains or Underground , but also helped to decrease the traffic problems and the air pollution in the City .

From all these statements and examples we can draw a conclusion .
I think the government is really concerned about ecological problems of our planet and use all kind of measures to encourage people to use their cars less .
As for me , I definitely agree with these policy and hope that in twenty years we could slow down the air pollution problem .
