To my mind , it is more important to understand concepts and ideas than to learn facts .
I think it make students more intelligent by giving them the opportunity to developp their way of thinking .

Learning facts is useful for individual memory .
It helps to develop one 's memory by learning by heart facts , that is why kids learn a lot of songs and poems by heart .
Learning facts is also useful for collective memory .
For instance , students learn history to try not to repeat the same mistakes as in the past such as the World Wars .

Understand ideas and concepts makes the student understand a way of thinking and a way to see the world .
It can also help him to understand why the world is as it is .
For example , understanding what American lived on the 9/11 and thought after can help to understand the present policy of the United States .
Furthermore , understanding ideas and concepts makes the student able to develop his own thinking in order to undertstand other ideas and concepts .
For example , if a student understand mechanics of fluids , he will be able to understand modelisation of traffic because both subjects are based on the same theory .
Some universities seems to think like me , giving right to all books and papers during their tests but asking for a lot of explanation about concepts and ideas and relationships betw

For all these reasons , understanding concepts and ideas is the most important for students .
