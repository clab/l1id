Times change quickly ...
very quickly indeed .
A few years ago , the computers were reserved for the army , Internet was unknown .
One may ask , ` what is the point of having a broad knowledge if it will soon become outdated and useless ?
Is n't it better to specialize in one subject and try to keep in touch with its evolution ? '
I will try to answer this question to the light of my own education and beliefs .

I believe that acquiring a broad knowledge is very important for people .
Subjects are all linked together and the understanding of one can lead to the discovery of another .
Have you ever tried to learn how to play music without knowing about the notes ?
Learning about geopolitics without knowing about history is the same .
There is no clear division between subjects .
Some are necessary to learn about others .

Another reason is the importance of learning .
What we learn is not that much important .
The way we learn it , however , is important .
We learn how to learn .
And that is achieved through learning about a lot of subjects .
This way , people will know how to learn all their life long , even when they will be out of school .
Knowing a lot helps learning better .

The main argument against this theory is that people , who know a lot about many facts , know indeed little .
It is difficult to counterpart this argument .
One who is interested in many subjects , will never reach the same level of awareness and mastering than the one who has only studied this very subject .

However , I would like to point out that this person will have troubles putting what he has learned into perspective , while the one who has a broad knowledge of things will be able to connect facts .

Learning a lot about many academics subjects may prepare people to understand the convergence of the world .
Global has become a masterword today ...
one that noone can escape .
One can only prepare himself for it ...
by learning as much as possible for instance .
