In our society , one of the most important activity is consumtion .
this activity is a war between different brands in order to attract the consumer .
to attract consumers , brands use advertisement , and most of the time the products appear better than they really are for different reasons .

Certain brands more specially in sport buisnes , use celebrity to sale their product s. when we watch these commercials we think that these shoes or tennis racket are going to improve our running or tennis abilities , but most of the time they are the same that the ones we have with a better design .

Other brands use visual effects to show how incredibles their products are specially in the car industry .
cars are filmed in special environements wich impress you and keep your focus out of the automobile .
the perfumme industry also makes you beleive that if a man wears a special perfumme he is going to be popular with girls wich is also false .

In the cleaning industry a lot of brands say that their products are the best , and that they will clean everything from mud to ketchup ; altough in practise most of the time the products do not clean like in the commercials .

Companies do n't have the choice wether or not to make realitic advertisement becausw there is so much competition between the brands that otherwise their sales will suffer .
the governement should be the one regulating this problem .
