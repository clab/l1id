Since the end of the nineteen century , the expansion of cars is increased all over the years .
The need to move from a town to another or the pleasure of driving had produced a big market and economic system .
Could you imagine the evolution in a few years ?
What could be the number of cars in twenty years ?
In fact , the real question is if the cars will be fewer or not in the next years .

Firstly , we live in an economic system based a lot on the petroleum industry .
The main energy of cars , today , is the petrol .
Have fewer cars in a few years would say we need to be more independant about this energy and develop other sorts of energy .
The decrease of the number of cars will be possible only with economical changes and also policy reglementation .

Secondly , our road network is sometimes saturated .
I ca n't imagine where we could put the others cars into the traffic jams .
We can imply to build other roads .
But this ca n't be indefinitly .
Now we could in this term have some cars additionaly but in a way , it has to stop a day .

End thirdly , people are more and more sensitive to the environment .
Lot of them go to work in common transports or in bicycle .
People had some cars but do n't use it in the same way than few years ago .
The cost of cars are also a barrer , not only the aquisition but also the training on it .
People do n't want cars or ca n't buy them .

To conclude , I hope that in twenty years , we can breath without carbon and pollution , that 's why I hope that policy and economic system will change and encourage the development of common transports like bus , tramway , metro and so on .
I think also that people are ready to change their cars culture .
In fact it is now the decision of a pollution way or an oxygen way for our planet .
