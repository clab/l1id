In twenty years , the world will have evoluated .
The transports will be more developed and high tech .
Nevertheless , we can ask us if the car will be also important than today or more .

Nowadays , the car enables to see the social level of someone even if some people spend more money than they have .
But , the car is more and more crticized for many reasons : there are too many cars in the towns , that polluates the environment and it kills a lot of people .
Indeed , this year , observators have seen than people were n't ready to spend a lot of money in the car .
It shows that mentalities move .

On the other part , the common transports are more and more efficiency .
Lot of efforts are done for citizens circulate more easily and more quickly , in the best conditions .
A town like Bordeaux , for example , has discreased the number of the streets for the cars to enable the construction of the tramway .
All is done to reduce the circulation in the towns .

There is also the fact that families prefer spend their money to buy something for their house .
The confort at home is more important than before .
People are more ofte in their house and want to have what is the best for their confort .

It 's for these reasons I think in twenty years there will be less cars than there are today .
People will use common transports and will have alone one car , and not two cars as we can see it in few families .
