In every field , school , work , social etc. there are some people more successful than other .
The following statement says that these people like to take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well .
I agree with this statement .

The successful people are always looking for improvement , they are always trying to do better because they do not always realize how good they are , they want to get challenges and to overcome difficulties .
In the scientific fields there are a lot of examples of that particularity these people have .
I will take the example of the radioactivity , Marie Curie and Pierre Curie were always trying to improve their discovery and they died because of searching continiously improvement .
Their bodies were full of radioactive elements and they died because of that .
Science is a great exemple of how successful people want to improve everyday their knowledge .
Scientifics are always looking for better inventions because they like to compete .

Sometimes , these people , are marginalized , and they do not have a lot of family or friends , so they focus on their work , that is why they are looking for improvement everytime .
It is their way to make their life interesting .
In work , successful people have to always de better because they have to prove their value in order to be promoted or not to be replaced by somebody more competent .

Everything is moving in life , there are always changes , the human beeing is never satisfied by himself , wether he is successful or not .
We are always trying to do , to create or to give something new in order to keep us from beeing bored by life .
That is just the way things are .
The most dangerous thing is to get obssessed by discoveries like scientifics who died in the past to test their own inventions .
