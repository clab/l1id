It depend , i think that some old people enjoy life more than young people because they are mature to know what they really have in their life , they have lived many thing , they have managed many things .

Some old people want to enjoy their life more than when they were young because they have all the time for , children have left and they do not work again so they have the possibility to travel where they want they can go all around the world whithout thinking about the others , they can live for themselves .

I know a woman who is 70 years old and who like every sport with sensation like she said to me , she like go in contries to fly in a small plane and she like take her moto in the forest , she would like participate at a moto competition in the desert but her doctor forbide her to do that but i think that she will do that when she could .
this woman is a real phenomenon , i love her very much as my grand mother .
she is very amasing .

So old people can be very unpredictable , they have many resources in them when they really want .
I think that if she was young again , and whith a aware , she will be a great volcan and we can not stop her .

And on the other hand , some young people can think that they enjoy life more than old people because they have enough time for life because they are also young , they have strength to practice every sports , they can go every where because they do not have responsibility yet , they have the beauty of skin like old people are too old they can not practice every sports So i think that young people are too young to pretend enjoyed their life more than old people but it can be possible for some old people who have never having fun in their life like people who have never mooved out of their city and who do not like young people who have fun .
