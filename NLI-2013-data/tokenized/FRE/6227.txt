Nowadays , the business of automobile is in great expansion .
Everyone use it in his everyday life because we often do activities , work or studies very far away from home .
Having a car has become the objectif of everyone who has his driver license .
I 'm in this case .

But it becomes more and more a problem of society .
As far as I 'm concerned , I think that a lot of reasons will show us that driving a car is dangerous for the environement and that it 's useless .

I think that the development transports will replace the need of having a car .
We can go almost everywhere in France for example with the train and in time record !
We do n't need car to make a trip !
Moreover , the public transports in cities are the best way to move .
It becomes really difficult to find parks and we are everyday stuck in traffic jams .
In Paris for exemple , we earn time to use the metro because the authorities do everything for driving a car to be a nightmare and a lost of time .
People become stressed and it has an impact on the relations between them .

But in fact , the actions of the authorities has a link with envirement .
There is so much pollution everywhere and especially where cars are very present that everything is done to dissuade people to take the car .
Associations and lobbies who are imvolved in envirement questions try to show us how dangerous for our future it is to drive cars .
I think that my generation understand the danger and will be ready in twenty years to use the other ways of locomotion if they are enough and concsiensously developped .

The only thing which will change this prediction is the business of electric cars which are less dangerous for the future !
