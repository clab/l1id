Even if it always usefull to know some major facts , I advocate the fact that it is more important , and fundamental , to understand ideas and concepts beyond the facts .
There are three reasons why I perfer to understand concepts than to learn facts .

First , to understand the concept may allow you to find or discover the fact .
For instance , during a biology experiment you can get the right conclusions by reasoning .
Another way to get the result could be to know by heart the answer ' , but next time the result may be totally different and you 'll not be able to explain why .
So learning without understanding may drive you to some dead ends .
That also the case in a lot of areas linked to mathematics .
You can find the most of the answers by manipulating a few concepts you understood .
In addition , the understanding is the basic of any scientific domain which are , nowadays , so highly valued .

Second , I think that this training of the mind will help you to adapt easily in new situations .
I learned Japanese characters a few years ago .
I was in China a few months ago and I had no big troubles to deduce the meaning of the characters and find my way in the city of Shanghai .
Even if the Chinese characters are more complex than the Japenese ones , you can still deduce the meaning thanks to the asociation of the unitary characters composing the bigger ones ( called kanjis )

Last , I 'm sure it is the best way to remind things easily .
For instance If I ask you : Do you know what are the main colors used by Miro in his paintings .
You may know it because you saw many paintings from this artists but a very easy way to remind it is the following one .
Once you know that Miro used to live in a small city called ` Mont Roich ' , which is a small city close to the sea .
You begin to understand the first colors is the red .
It comes from Roich , which is close to Red .
The second color is the blue which represents the sea .
The third color is the green of a certain plant ` The carroubier ' .
And the least one is the color of flower : yellow .
