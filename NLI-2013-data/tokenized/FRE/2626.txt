There si always the same question between young and older poeple .
Who enjoy life ?
I am a young people and I can say that I enjoy the life more than my parents .
But it is always true ?

Young people just begening her life and want to profit from it .
they do n't know about dead , about real succes or failure .
They only see all the years coming .
Usually they have a lot of projects and dreams and how to develop them .
For example , I take me .
I want to go to Australia in order to develop my english and I wish to find a good job and perhaps to stay overthere .
I really do it and I will really do everything in order to succed .
A lot of people say me that I am little crazy to do this with all danger .
This argue come especially from adult over forty years old .

While old people have a long life behin them , they have enjoyed life before and today they are in their habits .
They have already enjoyed life , or perhaps not .
I see it with my grandparents , they have had a other life , with the war and other truma .
Today they do n't want to move .

And sometime it is in the other sense , in other words , young people do n't enjoy the life and older poeple do it .
For example , young people find a job , take a flat , have their friends and do n't want something else ( this is my brother ) .
Whereas older people always try to profit and take everything from life .
I have a friend , who is over seventy years old , who travel all arround the world and try to enjoy all that she can .

In conclusion , to my mind , I do n't know if we can speak about young or old people .
Each person enjoy the life in her way and with her past .
One enjoy life with their habits and other with their dreams and realisation .
