Some students think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
I belong to this category of student because ideas and concepts are more general and easier to understand .

The first reason why I think it 's more important to understand ideas and concepts is the variety of situation I can apply the same concepts .
Sometimes , during their studies , people learn of lot of different ideas from their many courses .
At the begining , students might think that all the concepts they learn are only related to the classe they are taking .
However , students may be surprised that a specific topic can also be apply to other disciplines .
For instance , when I went to the University , I enrolled in a seminar of ethical issues regarding medical interventions .
At first , I was n't very interested learning this subject just because my major was in business .
However , the week after the seminar , a dramatic event happend .
In fact , my father lost his job without logical reason and after 25 years in the same company .
At this point , I changed my mind and I saw that ethic can also be apply in business management because obviously the company in which my father worked had no ethic .

Moreover , I think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts because it 's easier .
When people learn facts , it could be very hard to understand the main idea or the conclusion of an event .
Indeed , facts often involve different points of view and conclusion might differ from a person to another .
Unlike fact , ideas and concept are the most of the time very clear .
For example , if a student in an economic class learn the concept of supply and demand , it must be very clear because everybody agree with this concept .
However , the fact that the price of tomatoes has increased after a twister because all plantations were destoyed is not always obvious .
In fact , many other factos might be involved in this phenomenon .

In conclusion , I deem that it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts more than learning facts .
Nevertheless , after having understand concepts , students may have the opportunity to apply these ideas to some specifics facts .
