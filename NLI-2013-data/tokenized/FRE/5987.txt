`In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
` I do n't agree with this statement for many reasons .
The first one is that there is an important car culture in most of our societies today .
The second one is the development of new technologies which will have a big impact on the use of cars .

First , the car culture is something very developed today .
In many societies , the car is the symbol of many things .
For example , on the social aspect , it 's really important to own a car .
The more it 's big and expensive , the more you show your high social status .
Moreover , for teenagers , the first car is very important : you want to show everybody that you know how to drive , that you have a car , ...
In fact , you just want to show that you are becoming an adult .
Another reason of this car culture is that taking your car is really easier than taking any other means of transport .
You can take it when you want and you do n't fear to be late .
Moreover , many cities do n't have enough effective means of transport such as buses or subways and you are obligated to take your car .

The second reason why I would never agree with this statement is the development of new technologies .
First , new health technologies allow people to live better and later than before .
That 's a reason why the population is going to grow rapidly and own more cars .
Moreover , some countries are also growing economically so that their population will bewcome wealthier and will be able to afford a car .
Another fact is that there is beginning to have a lack in the petroleum resources of the earth .
However , with the development of new renewable sources of energies to make the cars functionning , it will not lead to a decreasing of the number of cars .

These are the reasons why I do n't think that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than today .
However , I hope this statement will become true because the problem of the pollution has to be taken seriously .
In the bottom line , I would say that , if we do n't find solutions quickly to this problem , this statement will never be true and this will very harmful for our planet .
