Cars belong to the big progress in our industrilized period .
Nowadays , in industrialized countries , cars are really common and sometimes really hepful and useful during our daily life .
But for many reasons people will have to use less cars , first because of the lack of petroleum in a coming soon future , then the effect on the environment caused by the pollution of cars and the growing of the population .

The petroleum is becoming more and more rare and therefore really expensive .
It will become so much expensive that more and more people will have no choice that taking common transportation instead of individual cars .
We are also spoken about new fuels that can be used instead of petrol but I think it will be also expensive for the people .
For exmple a hydrogen car is a highly technological solution but as we are talking we are just in the prototype level .
Organical oil can be also an alternative solution but it will mean that we will need to have uncredible huge crop yields to feed all the cars which is impossible .

Another aspect which can decrease the number of car is the pollution .
All people know the bad effect created by a car for our atmosphere .
People are all the more aware of the problem that we can see in our period time the consequences of the pollution in the climate .
The climate is becoming warmer and we are more face to natural catastrophs caused by a strange behaviour of the weather .
People are sensibilized to the subject of the bad effect of some gaz emission in our atmosphere .
We will reach a time where people will had no choice that to leave their car if they want to prevent the earth from an ecological drama .

Finally the population on the earth is increasingly growing up .
We are know almost 6.5 billions .
Some crowded countries are becoming more and more industrilized , for instance India and China .
There will be probably a problem of logistic if everybody has a car .
It will be impossible to drive , there will be too much traffic .
People in this case should find another solution to move , to commute .

We can conclude that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today when we observe the problems we are faced todays with the numbers of car .
It will be obviously a cost for our confort but it will be totally beneficial for the future of our planet .
