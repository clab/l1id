For some people , you will suceed in your life just by taking risks .
And it is right , in a certain way .
In fact , our society shows admiration for these kinf of people .
But we have to go deeply in this field to demostrate another side of this way if living .

First of all , let us consider in which way taking risk could be a good strategy .
If you are used to take risks by trying new things , you will become more and more famous .
In that respect , our society are prouded of these behaviours of sorts .
For example , you do n't have passed your exams when you were young .
But you succeed in building your own business .
Then , journalists put forward your activities and all the risks you are able to take .
Thanks to these articles , you will become famous .
Due to these sides , this strategy seems very attractive .
But , some people , in order to become more and more famous , will take too much risks .
people who adopt this strategy have to be very carreful .

On the other and , we trend to forget negative sides of this strategy .
Actually , if you take risk to succeed in your life , it would induce issues such as financial issues .
For instance , you own a shop .
You have to finance this shop , by getting a lot of money on it .
If this shop does n't work in the long run , you would have debts .
It may lead to financial issues with your bank .
According to me , it is a lack of consciousness , especially when you are in charge of a family .
This argument is far from being useless .
When you make the choice of taking risks to succeed in your life , you must be awared of this .

To sum up , I ca n't help thinking that taking risks is a very good strategy .
As far as I am concerned , I am convinced that some people should try this strategy because of their nature .
The others sould carry on their habits of living .
