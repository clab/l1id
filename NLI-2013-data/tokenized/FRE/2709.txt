It is often said that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
When you are young , you are less aware of the difficulties you can meet in a life .
I think this sentence is in some ways true .
But I also believe that when you are older , you can enjoy life more than young people .

First , when you are young , your life is ahead .
We can say that anything is still possible .
You are not conscious of all the realities of the world and your mind is still full of dreams .
When you do n't have a family to feed , Life seems so much simpler .
Moreover , you are still healthy , health matters are not there to stop you .
What can deprive you from going in club all night then ?
If you do n't do this now , when will you do it ?
When you are young , you still have illusions that you drive into doing things without much concerning about the implications of your decisions .
However , it seems important to me to notice that nowadays , the reality of the world has changed and young people are probably more worried toward their future than the past generations were .

Second , I guess that when people get older , they find other ways to enjoy .
I think it is difficult to compare the joy of going to a club every night and the joy of taking care of his/her young grandchildren .
I believe when you are more experienced about Life , you do n't see the things from the same point of view and you can enjoy some little things in your life that you would n't have noticed when you were younger .

If enjoying life means doing crazy things , then you have to be young to enjoy it .
If you understand it as feeling happy to live , then I think you could be as happy at any time of your life .
