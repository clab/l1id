I do agrre with the fact that successful people are those who try new things and take risks rather that those who only do what they already know how to do well .

First of all , the ability to try new things is a quality that allows you to learn new things all the time .
By doing this , a person will certainly know many diverse things and develop open-mindness .
Compared to people who only use what they know and do well , a curious person will master many different things and be able to be really successful .
For instance , Steve Jobbs , Apple 's CEO , mastered computers since he was very young .
However , by trying new things , in his case selling his products he became one of the most successful man in today 's world .
I thus , strongly believe that this open-mindness was , appart of his genious , what made him successful .

Secondly , I think that taking risks is something harder than just trying new things .
Taking a risk has , by definition , good sides and bad sides .
The bad sides are that you can take a risk beeing as enthousiastic as you want , you can fail .
Nevertheless , I think that risk-taking is a key to the success .
Indeed , taking a risk is the equivalent of betting on the future and I believe that someone who cannot take this risk and think about the future wo n't be successful .

Of course , all of this is general speaking and each person have a different vision of what success is .
However , at last but not least , I believe that knowing how to use what we already know and learn ing new things will make someone successful .
