In my point of view , there will be more cars in use in twenty years than today .
There are two major reasons that can explain this : first is an economic view and second is an ecologic and scientific point of view .

More and more countries are growing up and becoming powerful economically , such as China , India ...
Their demography is very impressive and their grow up will permit more people to obtain a car than today .
The fact that the economic situation is positive contribue to the grow up of the cars market .
And more we need cars , cheaper they will be .

Nowadays , many people have a car .
I have recently read that California , where there are nearly thirty two millions peoples , counts an estimated number of twenty eight millions of cars , whcich is such important !
This asks us the problem of pollution , that could be a factor to brake the expansion .
But more and more , researchers are working on developping another alternative carburants or energy sources that will soon replace the petroil .
Indeed , other carburants issued from the agriculture and fewer polluant may be used , but they they are muite marginal and it will expand when the petroil will decline .
Furthermore , Electric cars have recently appeared , and make a very good substitute .
They are more expensive than other cars , but with the technological progress they will become cheaper and more currently than they actually are .

In conclusion I think that we will find more cars in twenty years than today , but these cars will be different because of their adaptation to the pollution and new technologies .
