Technology progress has changed the world physically but also , and above all , mentally .
Whereas in the past helping their community was a priority for young people , I think that this trend is progressively disappearing and that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Because the progress has made that people are not `` forced '' to live together anymore , because the world they now live in is more individual , and eventually because the new world they live in does not fit with trhe conception of a community .

In a non so distant past , people used to spend most of their lives where they were born .
Indeed , good transportation systems were not yet developped and it was a lot more difficult than today for young people to move from their home .
Then people really lived together a good part of their lives and I think they were by consequence closer to the others than today .
Emotional and physical links between people were stronger and this led naturally young people to give time to the community .
Nowadays nothing ` forces ' young people to really belong to a community , they can move easily thanks to technological progress and do not need the others to simply live .
I think that is why they do not develop and feel this notion of community and then do not dedicate enough time to it .

Moreover , this development of technologies contributes to create a more individual world in which all that could bring a community is available : knowledge , entertainment , etc ...
Everything is possible alone and then young people do not need anymore the help of a community .
For instance , they can play games on the computer alone , whereas before the only way to distract was to play with the other children of the community .
This makes that they will less focus on the community .

And finally , the world young people live in today , is a world tending to make confused the notion of community .
Now young people have contact with any part of the world they want , people are not separated anymore , are not `` stuck '' anymore into communities , they can discover other communities and this opening of the mind maybe leads to make looser the attachment to a community .

The world in which young people live in today is more complex , individual , and open on the rest of the world .
those three factors contribute to the `` loss of interest '' fro ; younf
