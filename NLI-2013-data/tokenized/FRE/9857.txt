I totally agree with this statement because I think that , since that kind of people already are successful , they will be less hesitating to try something new because they have their first success has a backup .
Even their new project does not work out , they will not be hopeless because they already had their time and they think , in my opinion , that it will come back if they try harder contrary to someone who has never succeeded in something who will take less risks because , if he fails , he will loose everything .

I also think that successful poeple have some kind of confidence resulting of their first success because they have in mind how they managed to succeed and they know how to do it again .
According to me , when you believe in something and you have faith in it , you can reach it in an easier way than if you do n't .

We could take the example of the chairman of a big company who starts a new activity different than his first one or a famous singer who starts an actor career .

Indeed , lots of already famous singers have tried to succeed in the movie entertainement and in the most part of them , they have .
An actor has n't become one of the most recorded president of the United States of America ?

In order to conclude , I think that , even if we can predict a success ,
