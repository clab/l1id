actually i 'm agree with the statment beaucause when everybody travel with nothing so much people gonna say do this or do that , it 's gonna make you a litltle confuse , they can even make you go to the wrong way .
when you travel along with nobody i ca n't even tell how bored it 's gonna be .
If the travel is five hours it 's gonna be worst then everything .
That 's why when you go in group led i'ts much better by your self and it 's more secure too .
You could also find a lot a fun by chatting each other , you gonna have a lot of occupation to do and that 's for sure it't a lot of fun , no need to think where you goind , which way to go .
If you and your group travel at the same time you making some joke , you not even see when you arrive in the destination place .
Me i love traveling specially with my family far away .
One day my decide to make a trip all away to canada and the whole family was included in this trip , i think it was like five seven hours driving , that 's was very fun .
every two hours my dad stop the car , so we could get something to eat and it 's was a very nice journey .
Every body in the car was happy about this trip .
one day i whish i coold do that again and i hope i gonna be the same fun .
tha't why i agree with the following statement .
