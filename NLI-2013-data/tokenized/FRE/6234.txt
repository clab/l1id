As the whole world is confronted to pollution , some decisions and reglementations have to be made to avoid the environmemtal destruction .
Cars are very concerned by these new measures and they are bound to be fewer in twenty years .

First , the trend , in most cities is to develop buses and subways to encourage people to use it instead of using their own car .
It has two advantages : the reduction of pollution and traffic .

Moreover , sometimes , when the pollution reach a certain level , the circulation of cars is forbiden .
If the pollution continue to increase , in twenty years , cars will not be allowed to enter cities .
Cars will disapear .

Some cities have begun to take big measures .
London for example rules the circulation in the center of the town .
People have to let their cars in the suburbs aroud the city and to take the bus .

It can be surprising but it could be the case of many cities in about twenty years .
However , it still remaims a problem with trucks , we can not ask the buses to deliver the goods .
Maybe , we can find a solution with new energies .
Experts say they can produce oil with vegetables but not for the entire planet .
What about focusing on trucks ?

Besides , most of the car 's companies try to adapt their cars to environmemtal reglementations because they know they are threatened .
Some try to reduce the pollution produced by cars , other to make them function with electricity .

I think people have to get used to a new way to travel .
By buses in the cities , by train to go from one city to another , by plane to travel abroad , by boat to cross the oceans , etc .
Everything follow this trend : Transports are more and more developped and less expensive .
Look at the buses : they can bring you everywhere

To conclude I do not expect a great futur for cars .
Behaviours are starting to change : people travel a lot more by train than they used to .
