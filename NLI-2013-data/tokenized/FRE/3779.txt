The time dedicated by young people to their communities is of a great importance .
It shows the interest of the younger generation for their families and culture background .
I believe the young people do not spend enough time to helping their communties .
They certainly have good reasons but the reward of helping is priceless .

Why do young people do not spend enough time to helping their communities ?
I see two main reaons : professional life and new communication technics .
Our parents used to spend most of their careeer in one or maximum two companies , in only one country .
Nowadays , professional life is more suprising .
One can change position very quickly , depending on opportunities .
Positions are not fixed and young generation has less links with the employeer than older generation had .
The firm root is not a major concern for young generation .

Communication and travel improvements allow people to move from one country to another one quicker than ever .
Life is not be lived only in your home country .
Internet gives you the opportunity to instantly travel via your computer .
Your community is the world , your friends are all over the world .
Young people will have more difficulty to follow and support their community as the community root is more difficult to identify .

But young people will have to settle themselves down one day .
where will be their community at that time ?
Where will be their home land ?
This question will be very hard to answer unless you took a great care of your roots and specifically of your community .
That is the reason why I believe that giving some time to helping our community is priceless in regards of the rewards it will then bring us .
Community will be what stays from an active professional life .
Community will be your home .
You have to take good care of your home for the time you will either need it or be back in it .
