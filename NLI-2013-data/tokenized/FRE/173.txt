Although some very populated countries such as China or India are going to become modern industrial countries in the next few years , and then increase their demand of cars , I do n't think that the supply will stay as high as today .
Several reasons support my opinion .

First , the pollution issu is an obstacle to an increasing of the car number .
Even though these countries can produce and build by themselves their own cars , there are more and more laws in order to reduce pollution , including car pollution .

Second , gaz oil ressources are becoming rare , and some reaserches state that in less than fifty years all of them will be end .
Besides , the Organisation of Arabian countries that produce oil ( OPEP ) stilll put up the price of the baril .
Then it becomes very expensive to provide oil .

So , on the one hand there is the will of many countries in the world of leading a western way of life , which the feeling of liberty that implies car drivng is an important part .
But on the other hand it is an order for humanity to reduce global pollution .

Nevertheless maybe scientists will find new places where oil is avalaible .
However the global warmer climate is still a big issu due to car pollution in a part .
Maybe that is why policies concerning driving license are becoming so strict in western countries ...

Anyway , I would conclude by writing that I believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today
