To choose between having knowledge of many academic sujects or to specialize in one specific subject is difficult due to the fact that it opposes two different way to deal with its academic background .

On the one hand , many people think that it is smarter to focus only on one sole field of study since one will soon become a specialist who can have more job opportunities .

On the other hand , it is also true that having a broader knowledge of many academics can provide a broader job spectrum as well .
Personally speaking , the fact remains that it is far better to study several academic subjects in oder to be able to choose in which one really wants to be specialized in .

The first reason I believe that is that people entering college are mostly too young to know precisely what they will wish to do when they will be adults .
Having the possibility to have a glance on several academic fieds can help help them to sharpened their conviction and personallity in order they can choose what area they prefer the most .

Onother way to justify my point of view is that for personal matters it is better to have the larger possible view on the world .
As a matter of fact , if one wants to try to understand its own life and the world around , the best way is to know a piece of everything rather than to know precisely one thing , which would be to much narrow minded .

In conclusion , my strong conviction is that it is better to keep a broad knowledge as long as it remains possible before specializing in one specific field .
In my opinion , the US school system that provides the choice of one major but also the possibily to discover many other fields of knowledge that can be very different is a very interesting and accurate way to deal with this topic .
If I may , I would call it a win-win situation .
