My parents often tell me to enjoy life .
I understood that they have some regrets about things they wanted to do but they did n't .
That 's why I am sure that older people enjoy life more than young people .

I consider that young people are people from 15 to 30 years old .
I think young people do n't have time to enjoy life .
Except the young people who do n't care about his future , the others have always to work hard in order to have a good job , a good life ...
They are constantly worried by something .
Older people , who know that there are things more important than money because of their experience , try to enjoy life as long as they can .
That 's why my parents , and more generaly most of the parents , try to have good times with their children , even when children do n't want .

The fact that older people know the death , and realize how life is short , is a reason of my conviction .
They try to do everything they could n't do when they were younger , and that 's why we can observe more and more parents practicing activity `` reserved '' to young people .
I remember the day I met a group of older people in a party organized for young people .
It was really amazing because they seemed to have more fun than us .

I do n't say that young people never have fun .
We see more young people in concert or bowling than older people .
But the way to appreciate the moment is not the same .
Because of their experience , older people tend to appreciate more than us .
Younger people often do n't realize that life will not be always like a student life .
They think that it will go on so they do n't appreciate .

To conclude , older people enjoy life more than younger people , as far as their body allows them .
