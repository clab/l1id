In my opinion , young people have the chance to enjoy life more than older people do .
First of all , I am convinced that young people have more opportunities than older people do .
Indeed , they have all the possibilities in front of them .
As they have no real responsabilities , young people can do what they want without thinking about their children or their job .
Moreover , we can denied that young people have a good health .
So , they can travel a lot , discovering new country , doing lots of sport .
Hence some old people can travel but they have to face to their physical limits .

The social life of most of students is particularly developed and active .
I have the feeling that young people meet friends everywhere and everytime .
The lectures offer the opportunity to see friends everyday .
Even if their family matters , they have the opportunity to live their roots to enjoy new experiences .
They have no fundamental obligations .
I am myself o good example of a free joung woman .
In fact , I have recently decided to live my parents in order to do an internship in a big company in Paris .
I have two roomates with which I share lots of things and we have the project to go to Australia next summer to find a job as a waitress and improve our English .

Finally , I think that young people have less doubts and are less disappointed by the life .
In fact , I believe that some experiences could affect you and change your frame of mind .
I have often remark this phenomenon for the old people .
Sometimes the lost of their friends or a member of their family could make them sad .

Given all of these points , I am really convinced that beeing young is a chance and offers a large range of opportunities .
