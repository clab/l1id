I do agree with successful people by trying new things take the risk to discovert new things that help the society and being more successful by doing things other people are able to do it unfortunely have an experiences and share it with others examples being founder of medecine that cure sickness is to make yourself useful in society hard worker by using your brain and encourage someone else to do like you make peoples look up to you trying some new experiences
