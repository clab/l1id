The argument constrats the taste for life of young and older people and states that young people like it the most .
I do not agree with this .
I think that seniority is not a limiting factor to enjoy life .

Older people are retired and thus have more time than young people .
This is a great oportunity to enjoy life .
Old people have many hobbies , take care of their grand children , get involved with charities and go traveling all over the world .
Old people can accomplish high feeling of satisfaction through generous involvment in their family and in society .

Moreover old people do not have a stressful or tiring job monopolising all their energy .
Old people are independant and can do what they want to do .
Old people can experience a highly priviledged feeling of freedom .

Yet not everything is good for old people .
Nice old times require a good health and a good financial situation .

More and more society is youth oriented .
Entertainments are more and more designed for yound people .
Family ties are not as strong as they used to be .
Divorses make family structure weaker .
Life span increases and old people are more numerous .
The overall change in society is not in favor of old people .
Whereas in the past their social status was granted and supported by a higher percentage of young , old people now have to build their place in society on their own .

In spite of the recent society evolution , I think that in principle there is no reason why an old people should like life less than a young people .
I beleive that age is not a factor for this while the family and environment are .
