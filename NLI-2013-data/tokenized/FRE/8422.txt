Teaching has arisen debates that are still today difficult to avoid when one has to deal with education , learning or training .
One of these debates could be summarize by the following statement :

` It is more important for students to undertand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ' .

Somehow , this debate recalls the fight which opposed Montesquieu and Montaigne during the French Renaissance on education : the first one willing a ` full brain ' for students while for the latter prevailed a ` well made and shaped brain ' for them .

It is , I think , of a high importance for students to understand and to have a very clear and precised conception of ideas or concepts they deal with at school .
The more you understand , the more you will be likely to explain to other people the subject you are currently working on .
Consequently , the basis of any learning should lean on a good and clear understanding of ideas and concepts .

Indeed , facts are just a matter of memorizing , which is not a proof of a good understanding , Hence , it is possible to know by heart the important dates of the WWII without being able to seize the meaning of this particular strategy nor the consequences of that battle .
Facts must then be secondary for students .
Fact , which does not mean that they are unnecessary or useless .

As I said above , facts are secondary which means that they have their importance in the learning process .
Students must rely on facts to better understand ideas or concepts they are dealing with .
For instance , it is impossible to have a good comprehension of Marxism or African decolonisations in only bearing on ideas or concepts .
Facts are here to confirm or infirm theories .
Facts are helpful in the sense that they provide a pragmatic approach to something which has so far only being taken into a theoretical way .

A good combination between concepts and facts must thus help students to have a global understanding in what they deal with .
