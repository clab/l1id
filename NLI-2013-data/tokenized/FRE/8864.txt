At the school or at the university , we often have to learn things , and we are judged upon this capacity .
However I think that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .

First of all , an automatic learning of events , dates , or facts , is only the proof of a good capacity to memorise ...
but to my mind it does not reveal an aptitude to solve a problem or to understand a situation .
Even if having a good memory is a quality , it ca n't be sufficient .

Then , it is clear that understanding concepts is a good way to help the students structuring their ideas .
Unless understanding an event , it will be very difficult to memorise it !
How to understand a situation or a problem without knowing how it functions ?
Learning facts without understanding them would be the revelation of a lack of intelligence .

Moreover , the aim of the university is to prepare the students to have a job in their future life , in which they will probably need capacities of understanding and reacting in front of a situation more than pure memory .
It is clear that in all works you need capacities of memory , but to understand the situation and to act in consequences is much more useful .

Finally , we can say that if learning facts is really the basis of the education , in my opinion it is not sufficient , and to understand what we learn is the more important .
We need to know concepts and reasonments to structure our thinking .
I think that the university and the school should make an effort to teach us how to think by ourselves , more than to teach us events , dates , that we will forget .
