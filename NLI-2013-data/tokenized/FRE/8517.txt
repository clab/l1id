The practical experience of learning by facts is most of the time opposed to the theorical experince of learning by concepts .
Whle the learning process is a very complex issue , I think that to understand concepts is more important for students .

By learning concepts , students build everlasting foundations which will help them not only for their studies but also for life .
For example , to understand the mecanism of rethoric in a philosophy class will certainly benefits to the student to produce outstanding philosophy assignments during their studies , but also will help them to develop constructive reflexion for life .
This will not be the case if they were simply learning to reproduct a work made by one of the ancient Greek rethoric philosopher .

In addition , to understand concepts fosters creativity of students .
By learning how things are made , students nurture an ability to reflect on innovative ideas to resolve an issue .
This creative thinking will have been limited if the students was concentrated to understand a fact and duolicate it .
only how
