In our western society , where the individual plays a center role , the community appears to be less and less important , although it is

There is a very common image that comes to mind when thinking of youth and its place and role in society nowadays .
That of a group of idle and lazy people , who play video games and watch talk shows on television .
This sounds like a cliche , but in fact is what a great majority of people tend to believe .
This common idea is reinforced by the images conveyed by the medias which are supposed to reflect young people ' s expectations and values .
For instance , if we try to analyze the programs offered by a very famous tv channel which is MTV we see a disabused youth , who does n't have any ideals and does n't give enough time to helping their communities .

This widespread view needs to be confronted to reality and facts .
I believe that we shouldn ' t as a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenagers play an active part in their communities .
Some help younger children with their homework , while others help older people with everyday tasks that they can not accomplished anymore .
Indeed a lot of associations exist .
Young people have got a real potential and i totally disagree with the idea that they do not give enough time to helping their community .
External factors explain that .

One of them is education .
when raising their children , a lot of parents forget to teach them compassion .
In this case children lack the very essential tools that are necessary to help others .
They are self absorb and selfish , thinking about their own confort .
It is also the government ' s role to educate young people .
it would be interesting to set up special programs in high schools so as to create an interest .
Stressing out the importance of the community and our belonging to it is crucial .
