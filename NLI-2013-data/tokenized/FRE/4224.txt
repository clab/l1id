In our capitalistic world , priority is given to personal achievment and very little recognition is given to helping others .
Even though most young people do not give any time to helping their communities some other do .

It is clear to me that most young people do not give any time to helping other .
How many of them have ever spend five minutes really listening to a homeless explaining why he reached that situation and what is the money he is asking for ?
In everyday life , we all are very busy and we do not pay any attention to people around us but if we did , we sould see people in need at every street corner .
Last year on the way to my college there was a homeless sitting always in front of the same cigarett shop .
I used to just walk sometimes stop at the shop but i never had noticed him .
One day that I missed the bus , I was looking for a light and I just realized this man was there smoking a cigarett and thats how I started to talk to him .
He explained me what has happened to him and I then felt so concerned that I gave him some money and a few cigaretts .

All tough some young people do not give any time to helping others , Some young people do .
Some of them find ways of helping even if they do n't have money , for example by talking to old people feeling lonely .
Some of them even create association and try to collect funds from wealthy adults and give it to communities such as homeless people .
For instance , there is one association that visist people in my building twice a year .
They usually are students who knocks the doors and ask if they can come in to explain the problem of the community they are helping .
Unfortunately , They knocked twice at my door at the wrong time because I did not have money .

Therefore , even in our selfish world most of the young people do not give enough time to helping out their community but still some coura
