In some countries , there is a tough controversy about the final objective of education .
Should it deal with a maximum academic subjects , so as to provide a vast general knowledge to the students , or should it rather focus on a specific matter , in order to prepare the youngsters to their confrontation with the professional world ?

First , I am convinced that it is a nonsense to force the students to specialize too early .
They have to try a great variety of subjects before genuinely being aware of what truely interests them .
By granting them some time to think , a varied schedule will allow them to make a valid choice and to change their mind , if necessary .

Then academic subjects are often complementary .
When you have the possibility to study a lot of different subjetcs , you can observe how they interact and get a more critical view on a particular topic .
For instance , every human science tries to explain how human beings behave in a society : economy , philosophy , psychology , anthropology , they all give us a different theory about the way we choose , decide , react in our environment .
By acquiring the basics in several of those subjects , a student will be able to shape his own opinion .

In addition , every subject has in his fundamental course some elements that belong to our society 's common knowledge .
Our culture is defined by our history , as well as our litterature , but also what we know in biology , physics , art or even sport .
Having a few hints about what is important to know in each field is a major requirement to understand current events , or more generally to gain tolerance to different opinions and beliefs .

However , I also want to advocate for the necessity of an eventual specialization .
Indeed , before entering the professional world , being particularly skilled in a given field is a moajor competitve advantage .
In the prospect of getting a job , a graduating student must think about what counts for the recruiters he will face .
If you want to be a botanist , it may not be useful to pursue advanced macroeconomics .
