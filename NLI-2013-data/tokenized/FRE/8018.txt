I generaly try to hire a good guide tour during my vacation if my budget agrees with it .
On one hand you could save this money to be in a better hotel , but on the other hand you can make your trip a lot more worthy .

Usually the major purpose of a trip is to visit a new different country from our own and to learn from an other culture .
It 's a lot of investment to get to a foreign country , and with a tour guide you can improve the benefit of your trip .

Let me explain now how : A local tour guide will be able to make you feel the culture , and to bring you to none touristical places , which will make you feel really in the country .
He will also explain you a lot of historical events that you would have never heard about it and it will maybe create a new interest in this particular country or culture .

I went to Japon a few month ago with my Japanese piano teacher and a good friend of mine .
If I had been alone , it would have been a complitly different and less meaningful trip for me .
We first lived in a local family , and the guide helped us to be more and more curious about everything we could and of course communicates with local people .
It has really been a great life changing experience to learn a hole different culture , habits and way of thinking .
I can assure you that I would just remember the nice beach next to our hotel if my piano teacher would n't have come .

I 'm now proud to know a little more about asian culture , and when people asked me `` what did you gain from this trip '' , I was happy not to answer `` the sun burnt me , it looks good no ? ''
