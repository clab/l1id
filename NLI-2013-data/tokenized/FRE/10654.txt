It is commonly assumed that risk and novelty are the keys to success .
While most extraordinary sucess-stories are based on breakthrough ideas or products , expertise on particular existing subjects can also yield excellent results .

Success of a product or idea is determined by three main factors : the novelty , the marketability ( or perceived usefulness ) , and the risk taken .
Novelty is in itself a factor , as new things tend to impress people .
Light bulbs and electricity have thus opened never-before-seen vistas to civilisation .
However , something being new does n't imply its actual usefulness .
A new technological device could realise the exact same thing as an older device without any added value and encounter moderate success or even failure .
Usefulness , or good public reaction to the product , is therefore necessary for success .

Finally , the risk taken should be as low as possible for a product to be successful .
The higher the risk , the more likely the failure !
People who try new things and take huge risks are thus less likely to succeed than people who try new things ...
with few risks .

However , based on the three previous assumptions , are people more successful when trying risky new things or when doing things they already master ?
Novelty , while conditioning both other factors , is in no way a requirement for success .
People becoming experts in a particular domain have an added credibility and get the public 's trust .
Quality is an added value to the `` perceived usefulness '' of an idea or product .
Moreover , with extensive knowledge of a domain , the risks of failure become ever lower , thus answering to two key conditions for success .
The car maker Ferrari , for example , is a shiny example of success for a company that always does what it knows how to do best : automobiles .

Therefore , people doing what they know how to do well have a very good chance of success .

To conclude , while immense successes often stem from novelty and risk , many people trying new things take risks that will lead them to failure , whereas people capitalising on their expertise are probably more likely to be successful , though in a more modest way .
