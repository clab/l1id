When you think about the advantages or disavantages of being young compare to be older , you can look around you and observe how many peoples try to stay young and in good health .
Indeed , so many peoples take care of their body in order to stay young that they must be sad because they are becoming older .
In this paper , we will present all the problems you avoid when you are young before listing some reasons why young people enjoy life more .

First of all , a lot of mature adult stop enjoying their life because they are always thinking that it was better when they were young because they had less problems , they think that they were more beautiful and day after day the situation worsens .
This kind of people waste a part of their life just because they are complaining about a time that they will never know again .

Indeed , now they have more responsabilities , more pression because of their job and most ot them have a family which is a big responsability .
All those reasons make them nostalgic about their former life when everything was so easy since they had just to think about themselves .

The previous argument is true , young people can enjoy more their life because they have the freedom to do nearly everything , to take their own decision without involving the agreement of someone else .
If you decide to leave in an other in one month , it will be so easier to do for a single or a couple compare to a family with three children .

Moreover , i believe that young people are generally happier because they can still dream about a lot of thing , they can dream about a great family , a great house , a great job ...
whereas mature adult have the experience and they have already noticed that sometimes , everything is not going according to plan .

Finally , young people have a lot of spare time , they can do everything when they are still at university : sport , arts , shows , parties ...
A lot of stuffs that people who have already a job can not carry on doing .

To conclude , the main reason why young people enjoys their life more than older people is due to their personal situation .
Indeed , an older people has a job , a family , less spare time ...
even if you can have a lot of fun in your job and with your family , in my opinion , nothing can be as nice as the freedom you have when you are young and all the opportunities you still have to manage your life on the way you have decided .
