I do agree to the statement that says `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. '' because it is a safer way to travel , it is well organized , you make new connections and learn very intresting insights on the country .

I do believe travelling in a group led by a tour guide is better than travelling alone because it ensures your security in a country unknown to you .
This is especially true if you visit a third world country that speaks a different language than yours .
For example , last summer I went to Ecuador .
While this country is knowned for having many pickpockets , I never got robbed or felt I was watched or followed because I was with a group .
I also felt safe because the tguide was from the country and knew where to go .
I am sure that if i had gone by myself to Ecuador , i wouldm < t have felt safe .
Hence , groups are a good way to feel safe when you travel .

Another reason why travelling wiht a group led by a leader is a the best way to visit another country is all the insights given by the tour guide .
The tour guide knows a lot about the countrie < s history , and his knowledge certainly helps you better understand the culture , the people and the language of the country you are visiting .
Even though you might have read about the country in books , the guide always has more interesting approach and interesting facts and anecdotes that you would not find in books .
thus , a guide will make your trip more interesting .

Thirdly , travelling with a group and a guide is less stressful than travelling alone .
In fact , a guide takes care of hotel reservations and activities ; you don < t have to worry about anything .
Isn < t the main purpose of travelling to escape from the stress of work ?

Also , the guide generally organizes a lot of activities that you wouldn < t ha ve done if you had visited the country alone .
Therefore , travelling with a guide lets you experience the culture through many activities and makes your stay more enjoyable .
For example , I would't have gone rafting , canyonering , snorkeling , etc. if all these activities had n't been organized by a guide .
hence , travelling with a group gives you the opportunity to make more activiies .

Finally , when you travel with a group , you make new friends .
the group is your temporary family and people you can relate to because you come form the same background .
i personnally think Sharing a trip with a group is a lot better because you sahre your new experiences with them and you
