In my point of view , young people enjoy more life than old because they have less experience in the life .
I agree that young people have more fun because they have no or less problems than this older .
Besides they have less responsabilities .
For example someome who has a child have a lot of responsibilities , he does not give a bad image of him to his child .
Sometimes , they have maybe sometimes problem of money in to pay tax or something like that and this braek the envoy life .
Moreover , i think old people have alerady live a good time when they were young .
For them , i think it ' more difficult to find another way in order to have fun because they have already do this .

Young people have more fun because they need it and in the most part of time they are lonely , they can make what they want to do without to be judge by anyone .
For example in the street you can ware what you like and got the color of hair like you want .

Howerver , older people have more time in order to envoy life , in the most of cases they have finish to work and have enough money to do theirs hobbies .
In the other side , i think when we have a passion in your life you can enjoy your life like no other as if you are more older .
For example , a older who like sport can enjoy his life because they do what he likes .

As a result , i think enjoy your life no depend of your age but only of the situation and the problem or responsabilitie and then i think it is so a question of passion .
