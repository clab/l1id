In my country that is to say in France , at school we are studing various classes .
But is n't it better to be specialize in one specific subject than having broad of knowledgeof many academic subjects ?

If broad knowledges let you discover new things and follow one programe without doing any choice .
On the contrary be specialize on a specific subject make you be better on this subject like a professional and not losing your time .

Broad knowlwdge make you dicover new things in some case , and maybe , things that you never imagine you could be interested in , maybe one can find its vocation .
Moreover , it can be usefull for your own culture to know about the story of your country or about what is happening in your body , even if you will not be an historian or a biologist .
In addition , the fact that you do n't have any choice of classes subjects to make like in High school , helps people who do n't know what to do .
That it 's what happened with some of my friend .

On the other side , be specialize on a specific subject can prepare you for your professional life , and with this solution you are only doing things you like or things that you want to know about .
Therefore people do n't have the feeling to lose there time because they are doing this in order to be an expert and to find a job which deals about the subject .

To my mind it is better to have a broad of knowledge of many subject because I am really curious .
I will borrow me being only specialize in one topic .
I like to learn about many things it makes me feel more inteligent .
