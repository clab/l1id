Nowadays , in our modern society , the way of living of young people is ruled by fears and difficulties .
For young people , it is more and more difficult to enjoy life because they do n't succeed in accomplishing what they want .
Moreover , given the global economy into which we are moving and the increasing fears that exist everywhere in the world , it is undeniable that young people enjoy life less than older people do .

First , no body can be denied that young people in our century have more problems than their parents .
Indeed , today , young people are confronted to several difficulties , such as money , war and health .
Concerning money , it is more difficult for young people to find a job than older people .
Unemployment is a serious hurdle to happiness for young people .
Moreover , concerning health , young people are confronted to AIDS .
They can not enjoy their sexual life as they parents do because they have fears .
Concerning war , many young people in the world are suffering from war and its consequences .
Indeed , there are only young people in an army .

In addition to that , we can see that , older people have an established life .
They have a job , earn money and hence they are able to feed their family .
It is a way for them to have a quiet life .
For young people , this is not the case .
As a matter of fact , they do n't have the same perception of their future .
Our socity ruled by media and communication is suffering from an atmosphere of fears .
Because of that , young people do n't feel confortable in their life .
They think that they will not succeed in life because it is day by day more and more difficult .

To conclude , I think that , it is difficult for young people to enjoy life because they have more problems than older people have .
However , young people have to be aware of the advantages of being youth .
Indeed , they have a better heath , and they are able to study and to be helped by their parents .
