Nowadays , most of young people do n't know what misery is .
I 'm talking about country like France , USA or Germany , and so on .
Country that are rich .
When you have evrything you need , you can not imagine that you could help people who will love to have your help .
I agree that nowadays , young people do not give enough time to helping their comminuties .
But this is not true only for young people .
Nowadays , in our society , everyone think about him before someone else .
It 's called ` selfish ' .
And i definitivelly can not agree with this because even if we have the chance to leave in a ritch country , poorety exist .
Young people and also adults have to pay attention to their community .
But if we want young people to help , adults have to show the example .
We must have bunch of people who help each other because this is so much easier to live this way .

First , when you help someone , you bring him so much happiness that he will feel much better quicly , and you give yourself a good satisfaction by doing it .
But the man , or woman you did help will do it for someone else .
And this other person for another , and so on .
By the way , if you think about this , by helping each other , this is all the society who will feel better , and if there are more people doing this , after a while , less people will need help .

I know it 's not possible to solve enyone problem , but it 's a dream who can become true .
There are 6 billon people on Earth , so is it better to have 6 billion people who do n't care except thereself , ot is it better to have 6 billions people who are a crew .

I will finish like this .
Even if it 's look like enoying to help someone , what you feel inside by doing that is the best reward you can ever have .
Young people need to mouve and care for their community , because without a community , human is nothing .
