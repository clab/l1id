It is common to think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
For instance , it is obvious that young people party a lot more than older people , that 's why they seem to enjoy life a lot more .
But , if we take a closer look , is it really true ?
I 'd tend to disagree with this well broad idea , and as far as I am concerned , I 'd say first that older people ceize the day a lot more than young people do , and then I 'd like to underline the fact that the age does n't matter , that it is the person 's personality which lead him to enjoy life more or less .

First , it seems obvious to me that older people enjoy life a lot more than younger people do , precisely because they have nothing to loose .
They are conscious that they are going to die one day , therefore they are living in the present , they are enjoying every moment of their life .
Young people , on the opposite , are always making plans , thinking about what they want for their future and how they are going to obtain it .
They consider themselves as immortal , thus they are not really enjoying the present time .
Older people experienced a lot of good and bad things and are now aware of what makes life worth living to them , consequently they are able to really enjoy their life .

But above all , my opinion is that enjoying life is n't a matter of age .
Some people , no matter if they 're young or old , will always live in the past , mourning about what happened to them , or spending time thinking about their good memories , and as a result , they will never enjoy life , the real life that 's going on before their eyes .
That 's why I consider being able to enjoy life as a trait of personnality , which does n't depend on the age of the person but on its ability to be satisfied with what he has got .
