Can we state that success is directly connected to innovation , that the more you are taking risks , the better your chances of success will be ?
This may seem a pretty obvious statement at first .
I am going to invent a new product and I will become rich !
But this statement may be more complicated than it appears .

Let start with the `` obvious '' part .
Of course , by introducing a new product on a market , I increase my chances to attract customers and develop a successful business .
Our world is constantly evolving and new products , new technology for example , are very much on demand .
I can also , by trying differents ideas or methods , improve the way I am doing my business and become more efficient .
New ideas can improve the quality of my products , their cost efficiency , their image .
Companies all around the world know that very well and urge their employees to think `` outside the box '' .
Universities will also motivate their students to become more creative and find new ways of thinking .
It seems that everyone agrees that creativity and innovation are very important to become successful .

But I ca n't help remembering that Van Gogh never sold one painting during his entire life .
He was one of the most creative and innovative painters of his time .
He dedicated his life to his art and painted the way he wanted even if he was heavily criticized .
Why was n't he successful ?
I ca n't also help noticing that every time I go to the cinema to see one of the `` big success of the year '' , I am disappointed .
It seems that to be successful , a film has to follow a set of standard rules : a charismatic hero , a sexy counterpart , lots of action and simplistic dialogs .
Obviously , creativity does n't pay in the movie business and you have to stick to what you do well , hence Rocky V and all the sequels of successful films that are shot every year .

I certainly do think that creativity is a major asset and I encourage everybody around me to take risks in their life but I am not convinced that it leads to success .
At least , not to success as we understand it , that is commercial success .
But , it certainly leads to personal improvement , to a sense of satisfaction and achievement that the repetition of an activity can , at one point , no longer bring .
