Some people prefers to have knowledge in many differents subjects , which will stay broad .
Other people prefers to specialize themselve in one specific subject .
From my point of view , it is better to start with having a general knowledge in many academic subjects , and later on to spezialize in one specific subject .
The arguments I have for this opinion are stated below .

First of all , I definitely believe that , until you are a student , you should follow different classes during the whole time you are at school .
The reason is that it is extremely important to have a lot of knowledge in general culture and an overview of the many topics you will have the possibility to study in a more detailed way .
For example , it is important to have a broad knowledge in biology to first know more about life on earth and second to be able to decide if you want to specify yourself in that domain .
Otherwise , you might want to specify yourself in biology without even knowing if you like that subject .

Later on , when you begin to study at the University , I have the opinion that it is a better solution to specialize yourself in one specific subject rather than following many courses on different subjects .
The reason I have this opinion is that regularly , students know which subject they like .
Therefore , they should specialize in this specific subject .
They will get interested while going deep into the details of this subject .

This specialization will have a positive effect after finishing the University .
The students who have specialized themselve in a specific subject will surely have good opportunities to find a high-paid job they will enjoy .

To conclude , I think that the best solution is to first have a broad and general knowledge in many academic subjects to create a good overview in the mind .
Then it makes a lot of sense to specialize yourself in one specific subject you find interesting , to expand your knowledge in that subject while having fun to study it in the same time , and then be able to find a good job in the future .
