On the one hand , it 's of course important to have a broad knowledge on many subjects because with a broad general culture it 's possible to feel more concerned about more subjects , to exchange different points of view with many people because the morre the culture is high , the more you can share conversations with different people .
A high general culture allow pople to develop theirself , to feel more secure when they are talking about something ...

But on the other hand , having a wide culture about only one subject has the advantage that people know on what they are talking about .
In some professions like archeologists , historians , physicians ...
the people have a huge knowledge on their subject which can be very impressive .
Furthermore , in some professions like doctors , plane driver ...
it 's important that these people know what they are doing and they know their job by heart ...
Also , we can remember famous people such as Einstein , Freud , Mozart ...
because they almost specialized their life on something , and they allow us to improve with their knowledge , teaching us new things that they could'nt have done if they did n't spend a lot of time on it .

My opinion is that I prefer specialize on a specific subject because I think knowing a few things on a lot of subjects could be superficial knowledge .
But of course if I specialize on something it does n't mean that I 'll have no interest in other subjects .
For example for me it 's very important to know what happens in the world , to have interest in history but I specialized myslef since a long time on guitar .

But I think it 's a pleasure to know a lot about something , to be able to argue on a subject because you know it well .
But of course , to specialize on a subject , it has to be a passion .
