According to a friend of mine , the main difference between the french academic system and American one 's is about the knowledge .
Indeed , the french prefers to study a lot of subjects until university whereas Americans have the possibility to choose the specialisation quite quickly .
In my opinion , to be specialized in one specific subject can be really interesting .
Actually , the person is really performant and it can be benefits for the firm .
And sometimes , this specific subjct is really difficult and searched .
This job can worth a lot of money !

however , I definitly prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic .
First of all , we know many more informations about the world and it could be helpful to have an overview .

Then , for a future job , it could be better to know several things and choose the one where I am the best .
Moreover , if , I quit my job for differents reasons ( employmemts , personal problem ... )
I will be happy to have others qualifications in my resume .
For instance , actually , I am in a business school and we learn manys things .
When I chose my subjects I chose a third language , Italien .
I really think that , in the future , it will be better to understand 3 languages instead of only one !

i will give you another exemple .
If you have an ability , that is good !
But do n't lay on it !
in this world , there qre so many things intersting , if we had the chance to study let 's do it !
that is the best opportunity in life !

To sum up , the specialization is great but having a broading knowledge give us the best chance in life for our future carriers !
