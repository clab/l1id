The main goal of every university is to form high performance students , and hence the question is to know how making these students performant and effcient in their future jobs ?
Thanks to a lot of theoritical courses ?
Or thanks to practical courses based on the observation of the facts and some experiments ?

In fact at the beginning , the role of the school has been tougth in order to share theoritical knewledge , and not to prepare students to their future jobs .
Why ?
because some stuffs can not be taught and should be learnt outside from the university , in an other context , which enbable to learn fact .
Therefore I am convinced that the first role of the shool or university is to provide the theoritical basis , which are necessary to the understanding of the facts , and the problems of the real life .
Consequently , I believe that it more important that students understand concepts and abstract ideas , because these are the roots of the understanding of the facts .

Moreover , can the reality of the facts be learnt at school ?
For instance , a job can not be taught really at school , because the school does not correspond to the real conditions of a job .
The universities can only provide tools , abstract concepts to make the students more efficent in their future jobs .
But they can not prepare them to manage the every day life of the job , in terms of time managing , stress or communication problems between different partners .
These topics are learned directly in the companies , and the abilities of a person to deal with these every day life problems is based on the experience of these person .
A classroom on theses apects would be completely irrelevant .
That is why , the universities encourage students to make internships .
This shows that school acknowledge that it more important that students understand concepts at school and then confront these abstract ideas to the reality of a job .

In other words , I believe that a student should learn theoritical concept at school , because this is the right way to become an efficient worker : understanding ideas and concepts in order to understand one 's own world .
