Trying to guess what is waiting for us in twenty years is not an easy task and making an accurate forecast is almost impossible .
Nevertheless , we can try to analyse the current situation to guess what is to come in twenty years as far as cars are concerned .

During the last fifty years , there has been a constant increase in the number of cars , and when we consider the new markets like the chinese one , with more than one billion people , we may think that yes , there will be more cars in use in twenty years than there are today .

Nevertheless , other points are to be taken into consideration .
The demand is increasing , but can we really supply that demand ?
And more precisly , can we fuel all these cars ?
Our fuel supply are slowly but inevitably decreasing , and prices are getting higher and higher .
This is why we will have to find new solutions to be able to reach the demand .

Solutions are being developped , and with the fuel prices rising , there are getting more competitive .
Some cars are already powered by ` eco-fuel ' , made from plants like beet for instance .
These new fuels are told to be less dangereous to the environment and are pretty efficient .
Obviously , they are only part of the solution and not the solution , but with this example , we see that alternatives already exist .

This is why I think that in twenty years , there will be more cars than today .
People want cars and the technology is there to make sure will be able to get these .
I actually believe that this is just an economical problem : when the fuel price will rise enough and corporation will see that they can make money with new technologies , they will .

As a conclusion , I would say that yes , there will be more cars in use in the future thant there are today , nevertheless , these cars might be really different than those we are using nowadays .
