I desagree the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer car in use than there is today .
The car is one of the evolution that is the most use by the population .
Have a car is very comon ; you can find cars all around the world even in poor countries .
We will see why car are not ready to deseapper , Firstly , because they is no solution to replace cars , then that have a car become very ship , and finaly because now people things car .

Firstly , there is no invention that can replace cars .
It is true that there is the bus , the tramway , the metro , but that is different you do not feel the same when you take your car alone and when you share a bus .
Cars is a need for many people to have their privacy , their confort .
Car permit you to be free ; go where and when ever you want .
That the most important thing , and for the moment nothing can replace it .

Secondly , having a car is no more a luxury but a need .
The cost of a car become less and less expensive .
we can take the example of the new 4X4 build in China that it the less expensive 4X4 never built .
The only things expensive is the gas , but solution like '' biological gas '' from colsa for example .
Or more common , car which work with electricity .
So there is solution of the high cost of the gas .

Finaly , nowadays people get a car as soon as they have their driver licence ; so they make their life with cars advantages .
Nobody will wanted stoping using his car before we find others ways to move .

Our car have a long life , sorry for the earth environemt
