Concerning the fact to imply oneself in community life , young people probably feel a lack of trust in the authorities and do n't want to participate any ; ore to the social life .

The first thing to notice is that we nowadays live in an individual society .
It means young people have to do their best to succeed in their own life and do n't have to care about others .
Of course , it would be quite disappointing to state that everybody behaves this way .
I think there is a feeling of solidarity which is growing more and more .

However , we should face the reality .
Helping others is a form of generosity , and generosity is generally totally free .
The problem is that it is the only free thing in our way of life .
Young people have to work hard , either at school to get a good employment later , or just already as an employee .
And you guess that working takes time .
So should young people prefer helping others for free or working to make a livind and assure themselves a better life , to live in our current consumtion society .

Helping others was apparently a kind of tradition before , and as said above , the way of life has changed .
That creates a major mentality gap between young and elderly people .
We now assist to a serious misunderstanding between generations , because our priorities have been remade .
Helping for older people is , I guess , accomplish small actions , as for example , supporting someone who has got some physical problems , in daily life .

Young people obviously can do it , but if a survey would compare behaviours of different generations , there is no doubt that kind of behaviour has decreased .

However , I think through work and study , young generation is planning the best solution for its future .
By producting , selling , buying , I should say working , that is to our national economy that we provide an advantage .
And I am sure the country survival will enable to create appropriated services .
Or even , if young people are glad to be this country , they will be granted of a new quality : generosity !
