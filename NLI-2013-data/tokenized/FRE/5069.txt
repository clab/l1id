Advertising is nowadays everywhere , and tries to make us buy every sorts of products with always new ways .
Lot of people think that they are manipulated by advertising companies and that in advertisement the most important thing is to make the product seem much better that they really are .

We can firstly think that as they use ways of persuasion that we understand we can always have our opinion .
It 's a problem with chidren and advertising , but adults may be able to have their own opinions .
Even if the advertiser tell us that is the best product of the world , we must be able to think about it and try to have our own opinion .
Advertisers are not obliging us , they give us the choice but try to convince us .

In a very different way , we can think that their advertising is not just arguments .
They often use what we like , our dreams and problems to make us think that we have a real need of this product .
For exemple they often use our problem to sell us products , they give to a fat woman a solution that she can refuse , as she does n't like herself , so as to become thin like models in advertisement .
In front of children , if an advertisement say that his super heros eat this sort of ice-cream , he will tell to his mother that eating this sort of ice-cream can make him be happy .
We have to think about what it can be and if we really need this but it may be difficult in some situations where advertisement represents all we want to have or be .

In my opinion advertisement is a very complex marketing strategy , but it cannot make the product seem much better than it really is .
It just makes the product be as we want it to be .
Products are created according to our needs but we have to choose and be critics about advertising .
I think that parents have to understand that children do n't understand advertisement like an adult , and adult have to always think about what he really need , what he really can buy and what is really new in the product .
If they do n't lie in advertising it is possible to buy just what we really want .
