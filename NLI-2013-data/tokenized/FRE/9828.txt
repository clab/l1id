In my view , this statement is half-true .
Success does n't releave from only one factor .
It often depends on external conditions which one ca n't control .
Anyway , innovation is a good way to approach it , but it regularly must be based on things we know to do well .

Being enterprising and trying new things can be a real advantage for developing a project .
In the economic field , the most successful people are the ones who took risks presenting new idea .
For example , the big boss of apple became a millionnaire developing a small new computer .
Moreover , trying new things makes the technology progress .
The problem is that not anyone is capable of brilliants ideas .
We always think of successful entreprising people , but we should ask ourselves how many people who took risks really got glory .
What about the persons who invest thousands of dollars in projects who turned to be desasters ?
The ideas that collapsed were n't all bad or stupid .
Sometimes a great innovation just do n't come at the good time .
Bright ideas in 1928 were made to failled because of the crisis coming the year after .

I would like to stress another point .
It is not enough to try new things and take risks to find success .
The best way of being able to build a new thing is to be an expert in his discipline .
Continuing doing what we know to do well can lead us to imagine what could be done better , what is missing .

To conclude , success happens when one act whitjkl
