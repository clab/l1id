Go to school is the perfect way to have a broad knowledge but is it better than decide to be specialized in one subject ?
It is not so simple .
A good way to build his own personnality and to learn the more we can is to associate a broad knowledge and a specific interest in something .

On the one hand , a broad knowledge is very important and even vital .
A large knowledge is essential to have a critical spirit and to build his own way of thinking .
That is why school is very important to understand the world in which we are living in terms of mathematics , history , biology , litteratury or foreign language .
But it is not enough , every body have to develop his own curiosity to discover other thing such as music , painting , sport .
All that things are essential to have a good social life and to make interesting relationship .

But on the other hand , it is not so easy .
Being specialized is usually very important for a job for instance or even just because we are interested in some specific things .

To put just an example .
It is very normal to know some things better than another .
That is why there is different job inside a same compagny .
Someone who is working in the marketing knows more things on the consumer than the countable but none of them is better nor more intelligent than the other .
But one thing is sure they are both essential to the compagny .

Finally , a specific knowdelge is essential to build his own personnality , because everybody has his own hobbies and his own capacities .
But nobody should forget that before being specialized a broad knowledge is necessary .
