Is understanding ideas and concepts more important for students than learning fact ?
This question is quite hard to answer .
To give an opinion on this topic , we will discuss these points with the use of examples .

First of all , understanding ideas and concepts is crucial .
How can you understand an issue when you do n't know anything about the subject ?
You must know the basic ideas and concepts .
Let 's take an example : the war in the Middle East , to get your own opinion on this issue you must know what has been going on there , you have to understand the concepts and ideas of the area .
Another example could be found in economics , you have to understand how a company works in order to manage it well .

Thus , ideas and concepts are essential in education , they are the base of your knowledge like the first bricks of a wall .

On the other hand , facts are important too .
They help you to understand the concepts and ideas , they provide you further information .
They are the painting on the wall , sometimes useful but not essential .

Moreover , I do n't think learning facts is an interesting way of learning .
How can you analyze the facts that you just have learnt when you do n't know the concepts and ideas underneath ?
That 's why I think learning facts is n't as crucial as understanding ideas and concepts for a student .

To sum up , I agree with the statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
.
Time should be increased on understanding concepts and ideas more than learning facts , nonetheless we sould n't neglect facts , even if they are not vital to build our knowledge , they still add something more .
