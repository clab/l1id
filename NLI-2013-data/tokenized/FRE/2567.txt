The gap between young and old people is a kind of discrimination , which effects are increasing in our modern societies .
Recently , the drought in France revealed a critical issue , by causing the death of old and lonely people .
Although explanations can be found to justify this statement , I believe that only the physical body is getting older while the soul could last ever .

If we tend to define what is enjoying life , people would try to record happy memories .
Young people carry projects and dream about conquests .
The old people have the nostalgy of their youth and will help justify such a statement .
Being young is the time for first times and it happens once ...

Categorizations are dangerous .
What happens after the limit is crossed ?
When does a person begin to be unhappy ?
After a certain time they are put outside of society : loss of a professionnal status , difficulty created due to medical care needs .
Other cultures , puts the old people on the top of a pyramidal hierarchy in a society , ours could soon bring as a conclusion , that if being old is being unhappy , we could shorten lives by euthanasy .

Unhappy old people is the easy answer to the fear of getting old and to death .
