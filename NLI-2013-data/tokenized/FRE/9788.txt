This statement might be true to some exceptional people but the common successful people do not take risks .

First it is difficult to define success .
It may apply for money , celebrity or just happiness ( even if hopefully this three things can work together ... )

Some successful people do take risks and try new things because their succes comforts them and they know that somehow they have a sort of safety net .
People who put their life or money at stake is really rare .
For example , a person who owns a prolific business might take a risk by launching a new product but he never puts his whole money in it .
Or at least not unless he knows he can always get back on his feet with a stable product or a plan B. And this argument should explain why `` unsuccessful '' person will not take to much risk .
Surprisingly these persons dare taking more risks since they do not have too much , or less , to lose .

Unfortunately , most of the successful people is coward and prefers to keep doing things they know .
They sort of `` stew '' in their own success .
One of the main reason is that `` normally '' , someone has to work hard to reach the top with a planified goal .
Except celebrities nowadays , you are not bumped to the successfull category .
It takes time , efforts and sacrificies ( just trying to be happy ) .
So why would someone take risks ?
The only reason would be that success is boring and in order to dynamized it you have to make some changes that can be radical or not .
But you may also fall into something even duller ...

To conclude , I do not agree with this statement , probably because I am a part of the cowards .
One of the main reason is that success is hard to maintain , so once you have it why take the risk to loose it for something worse ?
