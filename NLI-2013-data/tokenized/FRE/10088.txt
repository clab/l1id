I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only dong what they already know how to do well .
I think it is because successful people are generally curious and always want to learn more about things .
Moreover they quickly get borried if they always stay in the same area of expertise .
and they are people who like the perfection .

I think people have to be curious to succeed , that 's why they want to try knew things .
They always want to know more .
For example , a successful doctor will be the one who will have the curiosity to perfectly understand a disease and who will have the curiosity to developp research on the disease .

Moreover , successful people rapidly get borried with the things that they know how to do well .
They want to change and try new things and take risks because it gives them some adrenaline !
They are looking for some originality instead of always doing the same thing .
For example , a successful actor will look for a role very different than the one people are expexted in him , it will gives him some excitement and show some qualities that people do n't know of him .

Successful people try new things and take new risks because they want to have the feeling to improve themselves .
If they always do the same things , they can have the feeling of stagnation .
taking some risks is a way to improve himself .
Moreover , they often are people who like the perfection and they are always looking for projects that could help them becoming better in their area .

In conlusion , I agree with the statement that successfull peole want to try new things and take some risks to
