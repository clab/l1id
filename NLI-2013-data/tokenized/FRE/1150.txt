Wheter it is more appropriate to receive a broad education or a specialized one is a common yet difficult question to answer .
I would like to adress it quoting my personal experience .

Being naturally curious , during my childhood at college and high school , I tried to discover as many topics as possible .
Hence , I did all my best in every course , not neglecting my weakest points ( biology for instance ) in favor of my centers of interest ( languages , mathematics , sports ) .
This led me into mastering most of the subjects and therefore I was frequently in top-five rankings .
My first moto was a thirst for knowledge , but it rapidly turned to be an advantage .

Indeed , thanks to my efforts in all topics to get a broad knowldege , I was considered as a good over-all student and was offered a lot of opportunities as regards my superior studies .
This was the first benefit of my wide stock of knowledge : being acknowledge as a capable - if not talented - student .
I continued my studies in the scientific area , in order to get an engineer degree , as I was interested in the automotive industry .
Of course , the education I received was much more specialised than the previous I got .

Anyway , I did not focus only on majors , like mathematics and science .
My eclectic tastes pushed me to keep on studying thoroughly what were considered secondary topics , such as litterature or even exotic languages ( italian for example ) .
Hence , even if it compelled me to provide more efforts in order to perform well at all exams , I have been able to add more strings to my bows than what an average engineer has .

The effect of such a personal commitment is clearly benfecial today in my job .
As an engineer , I am considered by my fellows as a man of letter .
My skills at languages and my interest for history and cultures enable me to tackle more easily several situations like dealing with foreign customers or partners .
This is an asset over my teammates and it has contributed in promoting me to positions that would be hardly accessible to a mere engineer of my age .
Besides , today I am proposed several opprtunities abroad that would be unthinkable without the `` extra-skills '' I have always tried to get .

Of course , I can not deny that the specialization I needed to become an engineer is useful , as it was a pre-requisite to my career .
Anyway , I think that without my widest background , I would have been limited in my career evolution , as it is the case for some of my friends .
Besides , on a more personal point of view , having a wide rang of knowedge , even basic one , provides you with a lot more confidence when tackling problems and especially unexpected events .
Indeed , it can broaden your thiiking , thanks to word meanings ( languages ) or analogies ( sciences ) , and therefore help you to figure out different solutions or approaches .

Last but not least , a borad knowledge keeps you open to the world , as it does not make you think too narrowly .
To conclude , I would say that specialization ; ight help
