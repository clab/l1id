Today , we can clearly notice that practical learnings is being more and more important when theorical learnings are seen to be more and more unefficient .
In fact , there is fewer and fewer borders between people , all goes faster than in the futur .
in a word : our society lives in the instant .
That is why today , many students prefer learning facts than understanding ideas and concepts .

Something is true : students are not able to get rid off learning facts .
A million of diplomas represents nothing without experiences in companies .
it is very important to acquire practical knowledge and skills in order to be directly efficient when setting up in business .
further , factual learnings are more attractiv than theories and students pay more attention to this way of teaching .

Nevertheless , it is impossible to learn pratical courses without a solid theorical background .
why not ?
it is so because markets , laws , and ratings change very fast .
Theories change slowlier .
Today many 50-aged people have problem in order to find a job after being made redundant because they do n't have any theorical background .
They are obliged to go back to university .

a pratical learning needs a theorical background .
On the one hand , theories allow us to always have a guide in our work .
if we must face a problem , we are armed for managing the situation .
but a good knowledge of concepts and ideas without operational skills is absolutely unefficient .

In conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts is not more important than learning facts .
Both walk together .
we need both in order to be able to face with any situation .
Student must learn facts , it 's true but without a basis , a background , they won.t be able to manage with the fast changes of the economical world .
