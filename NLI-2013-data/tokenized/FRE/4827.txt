Publicity is everywhere in our lives ; it spreads from the billboard across the street to the 5 minutes coming right at peak suspense of our favorite TV show .
The idea of publicity is to make customers want to buy one product .
There are several ways to achieve this goal , whether you make your audience laugh , or you get them excited or thrilled .
The point is to make them feel good about themselves .
For that , as no product itself can do that rightaway , it seems obvious to me that most advertisers to make their products look better than they really are .

First , we can see that there is an issue of subjectiveness as it comes to deciding wether or not a product is shown `` better '' than he really is .
There can be different point of views about the `` goodness '' of a product .
But generally , no product reaches in real life the level of greatness that advertisements show .

What is interesting to notice is that people are wholly aware of the exagerations that advertisements provide , but they agree to think that it is part of the game .
No one actually believes everything that is shown on television .
They know they wo n't yum everytime they eat a yoghurt , and they wo n't have an orgasm everytime they drink their coffee .

This system preserve itself .
If an advertisement has hard time sticking strictly to its product real qualities , the product will look flat compared to the other products displayed .
It shows that an advertisement does have to emphasize and improve the qualities of the product it is advertising for .
Of course there are legal limitations to the extense advertisers can get in making their product look good : This is important not to get into lies as far as quality is concerned .

To conclude , I think that it is in the essence of advertisement to show people an idealistic world
