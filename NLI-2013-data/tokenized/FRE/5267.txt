Nowadays , advertisement is a world-wide phenomenon that tends to pry even in our privacy .
In my opinion , it seems obvious that most advertisements try to make products appear better than they really are .

To begin with , we must not forget that business is business .
Then , no matter how despicable the means are , the sole purpose is to make money .
That is why ads always bludgeon the would-be customer into buying something .
To do so , ads are expected to attract people 's attention at all costs .

Moreover , advertisements often convey the picture of an ideal and perfect world .
For instance , as far as the clothing industry is concerned , we all have seen ads showing sculptural bodies wearing marvellous garments !
Unfortunately , the average citizen does not look like the models so he or she feels quite frustrated .
Giving a product a better appearance than its real one turns out to be an unwholesome way to convince the customer to buy something .

To a certain extent , this phenomenon is linked to the kind of brainwashing people experience under totalitarian regimes , namely it tries to put everyone ine the same single mold without taking care of individuals .
You have to be careful if you do not want to be influenced and this requires a great amount of self-control .
One solution could lie in education : we should teach children how to have their own opinions in spite of what is shown to them .
This could probably prevent such dangerous drifts ( if this kind of advertising was not so efficient it would have certainly been abandoned ! ) .

Thus , we may affirm that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
By no means must we forget that the main purpose is to make profit so we would rather try not to be influenced .
I think that it could be much better if enough safety nets were established but you know : every law has a loophole !
