What should one focus on , facts or ideas ?
That question remains one of the trickyest issues of pedagogy .
Some tend to put forwards facts , others ideas and one 's ability to understand and explain ideas .
The problem is not only pedagogical , it is also philosophical .
Both of them facts and ideas are pretty useful to one 's education , yet should one deserve more graces than the other ?

Facts are necessary to the comprehension of any matter .
How could one get the idea of the Roman Empire was without any facts ?
Accordingly , knowledge transmission should not leave facts aside for its appreciation a reality .
An assertion few historians could contradict .

However too many facts tend to be disturbing .
The expert who always focuses on the same facts allows himself one single reality .
His comprehension of the situation cannot be innovative and his behaviour will remain static .
Facts lead to exception .

On the other hand , understanding ideas , can help one understand issues he might not be familiar with .
Understanding the dynamics of the fall of the Roman Empire can help one explaining another situation .
Ideas have a got a plasticity that facts do n't have .

But the notion of idea itself remains quite blur .
For a philosopher , ideas and concepts are facts .
In that letter Heidegger uses this concept whereas in this lectures he did n't .
Why ?
He asks .
That same professor while having spent too much time in the pool of ideas has made it a tank full of facts .
One has to be cautious with ideas as well .

Moreover , ideas tend to lead us to abstraction .
Even though abstraction is attractive , it can end up on dramatic mistakes .
The commitment of several French intellectuals along with communism testifies of it .

Students should therefore be as keen on facts as they should be on ideas .
One does not prevail on the other .
They should be intertwined .
