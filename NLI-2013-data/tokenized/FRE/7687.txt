The purpose of traveling is to discover and explore more of what the world has to offer .
It is a chance for someone to fulfil their curiosity and their imagination .
There are many ways to travel and explore .
Someone may choose to travel alone or accompanied by a group .
Most of the time , the group is led by a tour guide who is an expert on the history , past , and sites of that specific area .
other peole travel alone because they do not have a specific destination , and would rather explore at their own pace .

I beleive that everyone has different interests , and that the standard tour will not necessarly satisfy everyone .
I think that there are more benefits to traveling alone than traveling in a group , and being led by a tour guide .
One of the major advantage is the fact that the person is able to solely visit the sites that he/she is interested in , and therefore is able to spend more time at that location as oppose to having to report at an other location that may be less interesting to him/her .
I also think that everyone travels for a different reason .
some travel to make research about an area or a subject that is fascinating to them , while others do not have a specific goal .
Traveling in group will not allow someone whose intention is to research to fulfill his needs .
That person would need time to focus on his/her area of study without interruption or limitations .

There may also be some difficulties when traveling alone .
one of the most common one is that the tourist who is not familiar with the location may not be able to locate him/herself and find the historical sites .
The history and information about each site that a tour guide provides may not be available .

I personally disagree with the statement because i do not think that someone should limited when traveling .
i think that before traveling , a person should make some research and familiarize him/herself with the area he / she will be visiting , and define his/her priority .
No one knows what the world has to offer until all the possibilities have been explored .
i also beleive that the true and best way to explore the world is alone .
