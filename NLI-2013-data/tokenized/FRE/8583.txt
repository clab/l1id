I globally agree with the quotation above even if I think that some precisions should be add up to complete it and make it more realistic .

First , the purpose of studying is to gain a rational mind so that you can apply it to resolve and analyse various issues .
Therefore , it is compulsory to be able to quickly understand concepts and ideas so that you can discuss them and give an opinion without necessary having any related knowledge .

In addition , facts are often the aftermath or the physical consequences of ideas or concepts .
In other words , facts convey ideas and concepts , that is why they are inevitably of a superior value .
For example , the Castro revolution in Cuba is a fact while the marxism ideology is the logic behind it .

Second , a reason that can explained why facts are sometimes seen as important or even more important than ideas is that facts are extremely efficient to convey an idea .
People are generally more receptive twhe they can link an idea to relevant fact and great speakers often uses facts and examples to support their saying .

Therefore , one could wrongly think that the message is more interesting when conveyed through facts whereas it is the combination of ideas and facts that makes it so appealing .

To conclude , there is no doubt about the superiority of ideas and concepts over facts .
However for a student to be successful in life , he or she needs to be able to link ideas to facts and point out the existing interactions between them .
I therefore think that the sentence should have been written like this : '' It is important for students to understand ideas an concepts first and then look for example of the aftermath of these ideas throughout the history '' .
