The answer to this question greatly depends on the way one rates succes .
If succes is mesured in financial terms by the accumulation of money for instance , then it does seem that innovative and risk taking people have the high hand to being succesful .
Howerver , if been succesful means living a happy and joyful life , then doing what one does best may be the answer .

Entrepreneurs who have proven themselves by building florishing businesses , are in most cases daring people that had the courage to try new things and take risks .
Bill Gates , the founder of Microsoft , develpped at a young age a passion for computers .
With a group of friends , he latter decided to develop an inovative computer software .
His company has been the most succeful of the last two decades because its founder had the guts to take a risk , and the will to try something new , a business that did not exist yet .

On the other hand , success can come from doing what one knows to do best .
People who concentrate on doing their best on what they already know how to do well are often very successful ones .
Passion for a precise subject can be highly stimulating .
By concentrating on what they know to do , people can evolve in an environment much faster than others .
Moreover , they might reach a more satisfactory way of life by a better balance between their personal and professional lives .
Therefore , if success is mesured in less material ways , a person with more harmony in his life is more successful .

Competitiveness and risk taking are probably more rewarding .
People who never take risks or decide to discover new things have certainly lesser chances in life .
They also risk becoming quite boring people , lost in their routinious lives .
Personnality is a decisive factor .
Some people are less adventurous than others , and we are probably for that reason not all equal in front of success .
