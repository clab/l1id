Some people might say that it is great to have a mastery of a topic .
I agree with them but I do n't think that being specialized in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects for several reason .

First , in my opinion , having broad knowledge of a lot of different subjects is very important .
Somebody can be very proud to have excellent an knowlege of biology , but is it really useful for today 's life ?
Does he live better than his relatives ?
I really do n't think so .
I think that having a broad knowledge is important to live in a society .
Indeed , it 's more than recomended to know about maths to look after the spendings , to know about politics when time is comed to elected a new president or to give an opinion concerning a new law ...
Knowing about all these academic topics that pepole use to learn at school is then definitely more useful everydays than having a mastery of one particular topic .
Another important point is that some academic subjects are a guideline for people .
For instance , history states the errors done in the past , and the persons who are aware of them are lickely to avoid them in the future ; Generaly speaking , I would say that all the academic subjects help to live in a society .

Moreover , I wonder how can somebody evoluate , grow up with only studying one specific subject .
All the topics we study in class enable us to create our personality .
Without them , it 's impossible to decide what we like , what we dislike ...
For example , learning diferent topics definitely help teenagers to know what they want to do in the future .

To sum up , to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects is better than specialized in one specific subjects for several reasons : General knowledge is usefull to live in the world and it helps to create the personality .
