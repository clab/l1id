In the 1960 , taylorism made its apparition .
Taylorism like Fordism were new organizational stuctures for enterprises , where each employee was specialized in one task .
The consequenses of this new type of organization led to the increase of the turnover of companies .
But can we state that specialization in knowledge is better than broad knowledge of many subjects ?

Specialization in one specific subject can be really an advantage , in my opinion , when the subject is a rare one .
Moreover , I believe that for a very specific and detailed subject , someone who is interested to make it his profession , should specialize his self as much as he can .
I explain this position by the fact that for rare subject where few people have the knowledge and only few people can work on it , specialization will be the main advantage in front of competitors in the same domain .

The specialization can present , in contradictory with the previous paragraph , some disadvantages .
Indeed , by specializing ourselves , we can adapt to a new job with more difficulties .
Flexibility and the ability to adapt is one the main criterias for management .
Furthermore , in management , being specialized in an industry , a type of job , a department or a task makes us too difficult to change job and can be a constraint for our evolution in the company .
We need to specialize ourselves , but not too much otherwise we become rigid .

In conclusion , I believe that we need to have a balance between specialization and broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
We have to find the correct balance between the two in order to be flexible and adaptable , in order to be able to response to any problems that appears but also specialiazed in one topic to have the best knowledge in front of competitors .
