Youth is often considered as the best part of life .
Youth means energy , projects , entertainment and happiness .
Is it a reality ?
I think that , in order to answer this question , young people 's problems must be showed .

Youth is a period of tremendous stress and fears .

Stress can be infered by responsabilities , in front of studies , social life , or studies .
For example some cursus are extremely hard and stressfull .
It is the case of medicine studies in France , or some businesses studies in Japan for example .

Social life infered fears , because of competition for example .
Young people want to do their best , but are often disppointed by life .

For example , student social movement that France knew in the beginning of the year two thousands six show that young people , even when they have projects and are highly graduated , can feel fear about their future .
My opinion is that young people often are more interessed in politics that their parents , because it is about their future .
They understand their own situation , and their country 's situation .

On the contrary , old people can enjoy life .

More and more , old people can enjoy life , because they do not work anymore .
They can do what they always dreamed to do .
As a matter of fact , old people more and more travel , have good standart of living and entertain themselves .

It is proved by sociologists that , in some regions , old people are happier than young people of the same region .
Besides , it is now proved that old people help young people , by giving them money or allowing them to stay in their parent 's house whereas they already were living alone when they were young .

it is an important evolution of society .
Young people do not longer help their grandparents , it is the contrary .

All those elements tend to show that young people do not enjoy life morethan old people do .
