This quotation about successful people is not an easy question and I do not have a ready-made answer .
On the one hand , I think that it is true that successful people try news things and take risks .
Indeed a manager who decides to set up his own businness takes risks .
He is not sure that his shop or company will be a success .
Consequently he takes a risk that he will not make money , whereas in the company he worked as an employee he was sure to obtain each month his wage .
Nevertheless , if his business performs he will make money easily .
Thus , the remunertation he will have is the conterparty of the risks the manager took .
In my opinion , I consider that ambitious people are often the same who are successful .

On the other hand , this affirmation might be refuted .
Indeed , sometimes people became popular and successful not because they took risks but rather because there were at the good place at the good time .
It is rather a question of opportunity .
Why do not take into account the case of a son who becomes successful just because of he is the son of his father / he has done nothing but he is well-born .
Moreover , there are people who take risk but do not automaticaly become successful .
Then , if we analyse the case of a singer we can also criticize the quotation .
The singer is famous and rich and everybody speak about him .
however can we say that he is successful because of the risks he took / what are the risks in this case / As far as I am comcerned , I do not agree to recognise the risks he may have taken .

Then , there are also people who take risks in doing what they already know .
for instance , the pilot or the driver of a bus take each day some risks because they may create a danger for the passagers .
In a certain way , they are successful person .
