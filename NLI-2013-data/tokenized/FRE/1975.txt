We might think that young people enjoy life more than older peole do because they want to experience things , to discover things and also because they have the energy and the strength to do it .
But is this statement really true ?
First of all , we will see that young people enjoy the life more than older people and why .
Then , in a second part , we will explain why , to some extend , older people know how to enjoy life maybe more than the young .

First of all , it is a common idea that young people want to enjoy life as much as they can .
Why ?
Because they do not know yet the problems they will have to face during the following years .
Generally , they follow the famous Carpe Diem which advises people to live each moment with intensity , as if it was the last day of one 's life .
Young people have the strong need to experience things , to discover , to destroy the boundaries of the parents , of the society ...
For example , they will go to parties when the parents do not agree , or will take risks by travelling to countries where they do not have any acquaintance , just to do it , because it is cool , as they say ...

But , even if they do not have the same physical fitness and strenght , older people also enjoy life , maybe more than the young .
Indeed , older people have lived , they saw what they needed to see , they lived what they had to live .
Thanks to their experience of life , they know the good things that provide the real pleasure , the real happiness .
They are able to compare and so , to know what really matters in life , the way they can enjoy life as much as possible .
For instance , they will appreciate each little moment with their little chidren , with their friends ...
Thus , they will enjoy life certainly more than young people .

To conclude , I think that the statement which claims that young people enjoy life more than older people do is wrong .
I totally disagree with it because I cannot accept to think that I have already lived the best things in my life .
On the contrary , I think that the best moments in my life will come .
To enjoy life , you do not have to do incredible things .
I think that to enjoy life , you just have to appreciate all the little good moments with the people you love ...
