The question is about a current topic on the academic system of many countries .
As the matter of fact , the question of the specialization of students is controversial .
Should we provide a broad knowledge or should we prefer the specialization ?
To answer that question , i think broad knowlegde presents ; ore benefits than the other solution .
We have to focus on the advantages of this solution , wondering why it is the choice og numerous academic systems .

On the one hand , we have to docus on the professional aspect of the issue .
We know that the labour market is very fluctuent .
We all have to pass through some different waves of changes .
Both political , economical and social context bring us to be careful about the labour market changes` .
Having a broad knowlegde in several topic can be a weapon against these changes .
A technological new wave can force you to change jobs .
At this time , you will have to be able to change your way of working .
An abroad knowledge can make you feel this change easier .

On the other hand , we have to speak about the individual aspect of the issue .
As the matter of fact , having broad knowlegde is a personal advantage .
It is important for any people , to have a broad knowledge .
To sum up the idea , it is an important thing that people can understand the world he is living on .
For instance , even if you are a brillant scientist , it is obvious that you have to be aware of the legal system of your countries .
Having history knowledge is fondamental too for a country , to developp a patriotic feeling .
Whith these examples , we see that some subjects have to be learnt by every people , to create a commun base between us .

To conclude we have to be aware that broad knowledge present a professional and an individual advantage .
