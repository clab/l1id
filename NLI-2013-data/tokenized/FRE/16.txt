For me , it s important to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because I want become a manager so I must be able to have a good how know in different subject to be efficace whit a group and understand fastly what I must do or not .
I must have experience and how know .

But I thing also that is important that have one specific subject , One thing that we like , we love more than the other activities .
For my part it s not better to have broad knoweldge of many academic subject , it s only very important if you want become a manager for exemple , but it s more important to have a specific subject that we can enjoy about it .

For my part , I will work on a factory who create travel And manifestation ...
my specific subject are the sens of organisation and my creative spirit .
But I need to work with different service , finance , the rules ...
and I will be apple to check the work of the other service so I will have knowledge of many academic subject .

In fact , I can organise nothing if I don t know what I can do or not or how I can do it .
I think , first you must have broad knowelgde of many academic subject and after you can specialize on what you want .
Morever , I think that the most important thing to do is doing what you really want .
So , I prefer
