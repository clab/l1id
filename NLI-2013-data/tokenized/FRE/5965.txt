How will our planet look like in twenty years ?
This question is on all the conversations about the consequences of what we are doing today .
Will it look better or worse ?
It 's not the debate today but one of the interrogations concern the use of cars , which become more and more accurate all over the world .

On the one hand , we can think that the number of cars will progress significantly in the years to come , thanks to economic progress and innovations in technology .
More and more countries nowadays use cars : in China , for example , the car industry is in great development , and as there are really many inhabitants , we must consider that it will be one of the most attractive market in a few years .

But in the other hand , we may add that considerations about environment protection are taking more and more importance , the sustainable development is a recurrent term in speeches and official documents , more especially , of course , in developed countries , which had already known the excitment of car technology and had also already benefit from its advantages .

So the point now is to find solutions to limitate the damages of cars on the environment , such as the recent alternatives that are developing in France today .
In big cities , the public power is making big ad campaigns in order to attract people to use common transports [ bus , metro ... ]
or to use a bike .

So in my view , it 's obvious that we would never be able to make the number of cars decrease because of its general use ; it 's really part of our lives and I think that we would n't be able to live without cars , it 's now impossible , cars have too much incidences .

As a result , there wo n't be fewer cars in use thant there are today ...
Maybe it would be the case in France , and I hope so to preserve our environment ; but if we consider the whole world , cars have great days ahead of them .
Their sales prove it significantly ...
