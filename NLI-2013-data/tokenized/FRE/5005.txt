I do agree with the following statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In our society , the use of advertisements is completely insane .
The company tries to sell anything to the people and even if it not good for our health .
The big companies uses differents ways to make the people buy their products and sometimes there are not very proper way .

The goal of the companies it is to have a important benefit and they try to sell some products which can bring them a lot of money .
An advertisements on TV is a fabulous possibilty to influence people to buy the products .
A lot of color , a famous music , a famous people like Kate Moss can make the people change their mind about a product and make them buy it once they are in the supermaket .

For example , a shampoo with the brand l'Oreal have a better chance to be buy than another shampoo which is not on tv .
We are indue the influence of marketing and it is very hard to resist too such nice and new products because our favorite football player or actress wears or eats the products .
In our minds , we think '' if she or he have it '' it is certain that is a good product and that 's why I should buy it '' .

However according to many studies and statistics , the products on the advertisements are not so good than they try to say .
A lot of chemical ingredients can be hide inside a products .
For instance , a sample chocolate bar like '' Lion '' bar contains a lot of bad things which can really affect our bodies in the futur .
For the moment , we cannot realize how bad it can be but one day it will occurs .

Moreover , it is a fact that most of these products contains a lot of fat and are terrible for our health .
As a result of the products , older people have heart attack , diabete , problem of obesity ...

To conclude , I reallu believe that the people have to be aware of the impact of the ad
