To answer at this question we have to analyse two phenomenums .
These two phenomenums are opposited efects and have to be confronted .
The first one is the fact that the car is les and less a luxery , anymore .
Today almost everyone have a car .
The second one is the environnemental problems , which increase .
We wo n't talk about the present petrolium problem , because i think that in twenty years we will find an other way to make car work .
After talk about these two phenomenums we will try to know which one will '' win '' on the other .

In fact , noweday in developped country , more and more people use a car .
They use for anyone reason to go to work , to do shopping to travel .
Few years ago car was luxery , it become an necessity .

The constation is due by the lower prices than before .
All people in the middle class can buy it .
Today , lot of family have more than one car .
Also , people learn to drive earlier .
The Drivers listen can be obtain at sixteen years old in France .
I think that this phenomenum will continuous in this way .
I think will be costs cheaper and cheaper .
And it will insit people on buy more and more people .

This would be the futur if the environnement was n't affected .
But it is n't the case .
Today there are lot of environnemental problems , like pollution , or some nature which die because of it .

But these problems are studying , so maybe there will be resolve in twenty year .
Maybe new cars without petrolium will be create .
So i Do n't maybe there wo n't t
