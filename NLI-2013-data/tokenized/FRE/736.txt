Using a formula such as ` It is better to ' is always a dangerous thing when we are not provided with more precise context .
In this case , whether one should favor a broad knowledge of varied subjects or focus on one specific topic is all a matter of what one is trying to achieve and in what field .

Take the example of medicine : some doctors opt for the broadest instruction possible so as to be able to deal with most common diseases affecting all parts of the body while others decide to become specialized in a particular organ , or type of ailment .
Which one is ` better ' ?
The only possible answer to this question is that one needs both at different times and that both are important .

As a German and English undergraduate , I will deal with the issue in the domain I know best : the academic field of literature as it is taught in Belgian universities .
It is striking to watch the evolution in the academic programs from the 1st year to the final one : quite clearly we start by learning the overall framework .
Let 's take an example from my second college year : one of my favorite classes ever was called Survey of English Poetry which very much covered everything from the prehistory to the 1950s .
Now let 's take an example from my final year : ` Shakespeare and the crossing of generic boundaries ' .
Not only did this class focus on one particular author , it focussed on one particular aspect of this particular author 's works .
The move from broad topic to specific subject is self-explanatory .

So much for facts .
I would argue that the best way of approaching the issue at hand here is to think chronologically .
In a first phase , I would definitely promote the acquisition of a fairly broad knowledge of a high number of subjects .
Having access to the widest possible variety of topics is one of the best ways to learn what curiosity is all about - and I mean curiosity in the good sense of the word ( not nosiness ) .
I strongly believe that curiosity is one of the qualities required if one is to live life to the full .
Also , getting a sense of the big picture first is a good way to discern in a second phase what specific subject appeals to us most .
I believe you need to learn the bases of art history before you can realize at all that you like impressionism and Pre-Raphaelitism best .

After this first phase , then , I do n't see what is wrong with concentrating on and digging deeper into a patricular topic .
At college , we are asked on several occasions to make such narrowing choices : I wrote research papers on George Gissing 's novel ` New Grub Street ' , Uwe Timm 's latest novel , a poem by John Updike ( A poem by ONE particular author ) .
And I think this is a very good thing too .
My undergraduate thesis , in particular , helped me identify a pretty specific topic which I would like to research further and possibly turn into a Ph.D. : the impact of indutrialization on artistic production in the second half of the 19th century in England .
I do not regard this process as restrictive .
This kind of specific research is extremely rewarding .

In conclusion , I would say that both approaches can be supported and that they should not be mutually exclusive .
A broad approach is a necessary gfirst step before one can narrow down one 's interests further .
And since we got eh bigger picture too , notyhing stops us from developing many different specific interests overtime ...
