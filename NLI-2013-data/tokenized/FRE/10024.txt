I believed that successful people are those who try new things and take risks rather than involving in things that they have alrealy know .
First , a person who is very enthustiac to learn new things has certain advantages .
because of his willingness to take risk this individuals will learn enough in his or her experience regardless of the outcome .
for example , a good businessman is an individual who is available to try a new business or a sell of a product in different geographical areas , if he succeed then he has the chance to prolifere his business and attract more customers , however , even if he does not succeed he can still learn from his mistakes and adopt new strategies and start all over again and be more prepared .

second of all , i believed that if a person never try new to experience new things , you will never be able to measure your capacity .
for example , when i was very young i was really reserved in many activities such as sports , activities that involved speaking in public .
for instance after a lot of pratice in a soccer team i coud not believe the level that i was able to achieve and how proud my family and my friend were .
futhermore , i always admired people who had the potential of speaking in public .
after my experience in class presentation i was overwhelmed to see that i could convey a message that my listerners understood find a good motivation behind my story .

third , in a more scientic prospective , i believe that science has evolved because certain researchers and individuals have engaged in trying new things .
for instance , today people are able to hold long distance conferences thanks to techology , this technology spare business a considerable amount of expenes .
Also , other sugery can also be performed in two different locations , a person suffering some disease where treatment is not avaible can take advantage of the knowledge of another physicians in different locations .

In conclusion , trying new things is beneficial because it can help us discover our capacity and make us more productive for our society .
those who have taken certain risk in sciences have allowed to solve problems in our world either medical , economical or social .
