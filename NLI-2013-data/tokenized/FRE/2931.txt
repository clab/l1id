Youmg people are said to enjoy life more than old people do .

I personaly understand this statement .
The fact is that young people start in life with a lot of energy to spend .
For most of them , they do not have any family duties yet , and can plan a lot of life projects .
At twenty , you imagine you just have the limit you want to give you .
You feel you are free .

But I personaly prefer another quote : twenty is the age of energy , thirty is the age of serenity , and fourty the age of fulfilment .

The fact is that presently , and maybe especially in France , it is not easy to be a twenty year-person .
Unemployment is a largely shared fear .
The first steps in an independent life are not the easiest ones .
For most people , twenty can be considered as the age of doubt .
In a famous quote , the french philosopher Cioran said that he would never let someone say that twenty is the best age in life .

At 30 , generally speaking , you have started in life : you have a job , and some money to achieve the projects you planned at 20 .
As for me , 30 is the age of achievement .
Travels are one example .
For many years , I wanted to travel abroad , and especially in the US , which is a country I am deeply attracted to .
I never could do such a travel before last year .
And I have other holidays projects planned in this country for last summer .
This kind of things makes me enjoy my life more now than ever .
I am 30 .

I think that I will have a lot of other projects at 40 and 50 .
And I hope I will have the means to achieve them all !

To conclude , I think that at every stage of life , the key success factor is to make plans achievable , and to make everything possible to make it happen .
And I do not think that young people , presently , have a lot of opportunities .
