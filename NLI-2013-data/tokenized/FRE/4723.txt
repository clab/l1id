Nowadays , our society is surround by advertisements .
Everyone who wants to sell his product need to advertise .
The purpose of the advertisement is to show this product helping people to know about it .
Differents ways are used to this purpose , television , newspapers are the most famous one .

As a common sens , when you want to sell your product you will show it in a beautiful way ...
the most beautiful wway , of course .
So do the advertisments reflect the reality of the product ?
Do what we see or listen is thruly representative of it ?
Some people say that advertisements show the product only in his most beautifull way and effectiveness .
It is not question of showing it more better but only as it is .
Others disagree and argue that advertisements are misleading .
Emphazises of the products lead people to understand the product in a wrong way and , most of the time , must better than it is .
I completly agree with this latter point of view .
We can see it in differents medias .

A lot of people experience deception when buying a product that does not fulfill their expectation .
But the advertisements pledged the reverse !
As an example , a lot of commercials on television boast the veru of candles having a nice sents .
Thoses sents will stay in your house for a long while .
People who made the advertisement conviced you that this candle is the best one .
And , how disapointed are you when you realise that , after few minutes , your candle and beatiful scent are gone for ever ...

The fashion newspapers are one of the specialists in this matter .
TA big part of their pages is dedicated to advertisement .
Why ?
one of the reasons is that fashion magasines make people dream about luxury items , lavish lifes of actors , etc ...
People are more able to fall in the trap .
For example , an advertisement of a yacht next to a picture of star laying on a overseas beach will help you to sell your product .
It make you feel taht you are buying a part of a dream ...
your dream .

As result of the misleading of many advertisements , we can read in the same newspapers , an increase of the number of law suits .
Poeple are sometimes so disapointed even loose money that they call an attorney
