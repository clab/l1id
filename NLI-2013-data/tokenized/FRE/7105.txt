Nowadays cars belong to our everyday life .
Seventy years ago it was an object of social distinction insofar onlly Upper Class had a car .
Progressively the situation has changed and cars are become something common for a lot of people even if it is not the case everywhere in the world .
In North Countries it is not surprising to see three cars in a family .
However the situation seems to change once again for different reasons like the lack of petroleum , the pollution or the town 's architecture .
So , it is very possible that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

The lack of petroleum in the world is one of the reasons that could explained the fact that it is possible to see fewer cars in twenty years .
Indeed petroleum becomes a really expensive product .
If the rise of the prices do n't stop it wo n't be possible for a lot of families to use their cars .

A second reason might be highlight .
Indeed governements are conscious that pollution is a fundamental stake for out planet .
So , different policies fight againt greenhouse effect as the treaty og Kyoto .
Furthermore it is obvious that cars are partly responsible of pollution .
That 's why their use will be more and more restricted .

Last but not leat the organisation of the towns , like Paris , do n't allow to drive

In conclusion , in twenty years cars wo n't be used by most of the people .
Taking the tube ot the bus or a bycicle will be easier and cheaper than taking a car , and better fot the environment .
Consequently , cars are annouced a difficult future .
