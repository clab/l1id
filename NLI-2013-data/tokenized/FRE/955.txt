On the one hand , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can be a tremendous asset because we can say when we apply for a job that we are polyvalent .
This is well valued by employers because we will be able to evoluate in many different fields , services in the firm .
Many business schools deliver marketing , financial , linguistic skills which can be used in different posts in a firm .
And this is a security for students who do not have a specific project for the future .
But after all those advantages , there is one major drawback which is that the student only know few things about many subjects .
Indeed , only basics skills can be treated when this is not a specialized subject .
So the student will be penalize against a specialized student .

On the other hand , to be specialized in one specific subject is the best choice for students who have a clear idea of what job they want to exerced in the future .
They can say to the employers that they are the best in one particular subject .
This is very good way to apply for a job .
Firms need the best .
Multinational firms put in competition students over the world , so being specialized in finance when you want to apply for a job at Price Water and House is required .
Its is impossible for someone who have only basic skills in Audit .
The disadvantage is that if the company wants to put us in an other service , which is not our specialisation , we will have to do trainings , formation , or at least to learn alone with our own experience .
This is more stressful and very risked .

So this a thorny problem for a student .
To tackle this issue , we have to compare the strenghts and weaknesses of each education like I have done .
There is one solution adapted to each cases .
Then , we have to know if a job in specific interest us .
If this is the case , we have to specialized in the subject appropriated to apply for this job .
Anyway , in our studies , we are never totally specialized in something .
There is always a few basic skilled mastered .
And this is a good thing because polyvalence if very appreciated by employers .
