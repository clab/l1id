To my mind older people enjoy life more than young people and I will explain why .
Despite the fact that young people begin their life , they will have a lot of things to do , a lot of place to visit and a lot of person to meet , they aslo face up to several troubles .
First of them , due to the ageering population and the increase in study level , they will have to work for too much years to hope a quiet retirment .
Contrary to the older who were retired aroung sixty years old .
The young people will not benefit from their retirment because they will be too exhausted to do something .
the older people use their retirment to travel a lot or to take care of the children of their children .
They have a lot of time to spend .

In my second point , I will speak for those who think that young people enjoy more than older .
They will argue that , when you are young you could to anything like going to night club , spend your holidays with your friends or doing a lot of forbidden things .
I will answer to these persons by underlining that older people have already done these things and the young do not know yet the pleasure to have a familly : a wife who is in love and children .
They do not know the pleasure to make a commitment during the wedding ceremomy .

My last point is that young people will have to deal with society problems that did not exist before , like terrorism .
Indeed , our society becomes crazy .
Relegion wars are very detrimetal for young future .
They will have to find the solution to this issue if they do not want to live in society ruled by fear and terror .
In my opinion , only older people could help the younger to find the solution .
Thanks to their life 's experience they were able to find an issue .

I will conclude my explanation by saying that older people enjoy life more than young because with their old age they have done everything and no young people could enjoy the life more than an older because he does not know yet what is the real life .
