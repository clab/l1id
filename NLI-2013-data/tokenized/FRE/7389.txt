Generally like to travel in a new place they had never been before in order to explore new area , new environmentfor example travel to vasit a new country or city .
For those kind of travel , i stronghly believe that tavel in a group led by a tour guide is faraway the best .

First because with a group led by a tour guide , to can discover and enjoy the most inportant place of the place visited .
the historical thing s and places easily without so many effort to get to the places .

With a group led by a tour guide , you can go where ever you want with a group of people ; furthermore , some of them can become you fiends later on .

Travel in a group led by a tour guide give you a global and details approaches of the you travel , you usually get more fan with a group than travel by yourself .
For example a couple of years ago , i went to Marroco by myself to visit the country , if it was not the tour guide that i did , i think that , i would spend the entiry amount of my money without visiting the main places of the country .
The tour guide was really helpful and unforgetable .

The easiest way the go traveling in another place is to travel with a group led by a tour guide .
