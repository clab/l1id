Understanding ideas and concepts suggests understanding a way of thinking or understanding how ideas are connected and concepts can develop .

To me , that is more important than learning facts alone for the simple reason that you can apply a way of thinking to many different situations .
Learning facts only is limiting one 's knowledge to a specific area or subject and does not even imply that one understands how these facts are connected .

However , I still do believe that a balance between both is necessary and depending on what a student 's intended job is , one skill might become more important than the other .
Let 's consider a historian for example .
Can a historian specialized in Roman history and who does not know the facts of the rise and fall of the Roman Empire for example still be considered a historian ?
Probably not .
A historian might indeed need to know more facts than a marketing executive for instance but he or she will also probably be a much better historian if he or she also understands how all facts are connected .

On the other hand , I believe that it is more important for a marketing executive to better understand concepts and ideas than it is to know all facts about a given undustry or product .
First of all , a marketing executive does not need to be as specialized as a historian , indeed , he or she should be able to apply his or her skills to any industry .
Second , not knowing all facts about a specific field might actually foster creativity and new concept development by removing any `` limits '' of the mind .
Third , a marketing executive who understands concepts and ideas might be able to see better synergies between them and apply them in innovative ways .

However , as I stated above , I still maintain that some sort of a balance is needed to achieve excellency .
A marketing executive would be that much stronger if he or she could draw some patterns from past facts for instance or if he or she demonstrates a more precise knowledge of the product or service and its related competition scene that he or she is working on .
