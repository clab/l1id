Usually , the traditional image is made of young , dynamic and fresh people having experiences and fun .
Old people are represented as calm , settled down , retired and mature .
This stereotype is used by ads , showing youngs in activity in a glamourous world whereas aging people are sleeping in a quite house doing their crosswords .
As if the age was a clue of your perception of life , of the kind of activities people like and do .
It raises the impression that young people enjoy more life than older people do .
In the first part , we are going to highlight the points that can make us think that this statement is true .
Then , in the second part , I am going to present why I disagree with this misconception .

It is widely shared that old people are at the end of their life so they had a lots of experiences and they know nearly everything .
It is the typical image of the wise chief in african tributes .
As a consequence , his culture is huge and he is not impressed , surprized by the things that are happening in his daily-life .
His life is a routine with nothing exciting .
On the opposite , children see everything with new eyes , every experience is a new feeling .
For instance , babies are surprised by plane , they compared it to birds and do not understand how does it fly .
They take advantage of every single moment because everything represents something they are not familiar with .
Then when they grow up , they are in better physical conditions than older people .
It allows them to do extrem sports like surfing .
As a student there is the traditional image of freedom that implies no responsibility and a lot of time to enjoy life .

To me , this image is misleading .
Because aging people are coming closer to their death , they make up for lost time .
They usually have the money , that the youngs do not have , to do what they like .
For instance , my grandmother worked all here life without enjoying it .
She saved her money and now that she is retired , she has plenty of time to travel when she wants and where she wants .
She is very active and has a group of close friends with which she goes to the restaurant , to the theater and do lota of activities because she have the time and the money necessary .
