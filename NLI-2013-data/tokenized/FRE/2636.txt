We only live once , and for a quite short period of time .
It is possible to divide life into two halfs .
The first half is from the birth to the age of fourty , and I am sure you will guess the second one .
The descending time follows the ascending time .
But is reality so binary ?

A proof that young people enjoy life more than older people is that children always laugh .
But why are they so happy ?
Certainly because everything is still possible for them .
They are able to run and play football while elders sit in their wheel chair .
They learn and improve their skills every single day while it is exactly the opposite for older people .
Young people are able to love and do not feel concerned by the problems the world faces : they do not even know what tomorrow will be made of !

Hopefully , older people have other sources of pleasure .
Above all they have a lot of free time which they can use to do everything they want .
They have no reason to doubt about their future , because it is behind them .
Everything is possible at any age and everyone can be

The most important to enjoy life is to keep young in his head .
Age does not matter , only what we do with our time down here matters .
