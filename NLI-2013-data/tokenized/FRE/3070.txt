Making so generel a statement ( such as `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' ) can only lead to an ambiguous answer : one cannot divide the world so easily .

It appears theoretically right to say that young people enjoy more life ; I would say they have less reasons to be bitter : they have not yet been confronted to the affliction .
For example they do n't know about the wounds of love , the stress of work or the responsibilites of adult life like monetary preoccupations .
Children have much to learn and their ignorance protects them from unhappiness .

But it is this same ignorance that rules their somehow unstable behaviour : unhappiness ( manifested through abundance of tears , screams ) can hit them for an unimportant reason .
A child who sees his parents go for work might seem to have seen them die , crying for long minutes ; their despair is intense .
This emotional unstability has another side : unhappiness does rarely last and the crying child can be seen a few minutes later playing and laughing .

Older people feel sadness differently and it changes their overall happiness in various ways : some will bear with pain the numerous difficulties they have encountered in their life ; they will accumulate and eventualy they will spend all day thinking about their preoccupations or afflictions , neglecting the simple pleasures of life .
A grown-up man will think about the girlfriend he just lost and think that there is no happy love ; he will see his parent grow old ant think of death , of the vanity of life .

But on the opposite hand a man with the same background can react very differently : if he has a philosophical temper , he will not fear death and think of a forthcoming love ; the thunderous atmosphere in his workplace will seem mundane , because they have seen it twice , thrice and more .
Nothing surprises him and he lives in serenity , or at least he knows how to deal with the pains of life .

To say that young people enjoy more life than older people can be true , but we must add that young people suffer more intensely from life and its small details than grown-ups .
Older people normally have a more linear behaviour , generally sad when they do n't know how to gauge the importance of what affects them , generally happy when they do .
