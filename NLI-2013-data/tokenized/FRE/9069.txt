In my opinion , it is more important for us students to understand ideas and concepts we are taught .
Everybody is able to learn but we will see in this essay why understanding makes the difference and what are the advantages coming along with that study method .

I consider understanding as the masterkey of learning , I have many examples to support this idea such as the following one :
When I was fourteen , I use to take biology classes and my big brother use to help me before my exams .
Depending on the topic he was explaining to me how a part of the human body would work .
I remember it would take him 10 to 15 mins to explain the functionning and to describe what was in question .
I did not even need to study or do anything else to remember everything and I was then even able to explain the topic to my classmate and get the best grade .
It was as easy as understanding .

On the other hand learning takes time , and if we think about my previous example we can easily understand that if you do not understand what you read it is going to take you ten times the time to learn the subject you are studying .
In addition , what is the point to learn concepts if you do not understand how they work ?
We are not machines .
The main point is the following one , you attend school to shape your mind and in order to shape your mind you read and hear about concepts that very important researchers worked on and the main purpose is to understand how they worked to build their theories .

To conclude , it is quite obvious that understanding is the most intelligent way to study .
It is the best method to shape your mind and get the best results .
Understanding is also a good method for lazy students .
