In our today 's modern world , we are invaded by cars .
Cars are everywhere creating big problems for the envrionment .
There are no more spaces to park his vehicle , they pollute the environment so much that it is hard to breath sometimes , but still , their number is increasing .
I do not agree with the statment that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
In my essay , I will talk about the influence of the economic 's growth , the new technologies , and the importance of transportation .

In modern societies the economie increases which also improves people level of life .
People having a higher level of life is translated by receiving higher incomes , in other words people have more money .
A family with low incomes will purchase only one car to fit their needs , however if the same family receives higher incomes , it gives them the possibility to purchase an another car etc ...
That is why today in modern societies , we only see one driver for one car .
With higher level of life , people are purchasing more vehicles .

An increasing economie allows to spend more money in reasearch of new technologies .
By purchasing more cars , you give the ability to the manufacturer to gain benefits to improve their product .
A google example today is the Japanese company Toyota , they created a hybrid model , which in short allows the costumer to save fuel and to pollute less .
To create new technologies , researcher needs money to be able to advance .
The vehicle 's market is on a growth slope , and every new model of cars shows a technologie improvement .

As far as human 's history is known , transportation has always been important .
the world today is not closed , boundaries are opened and always need to reach different point in this world .
it has always been for economical reason .
For example , a person works in a big city but cannot afford to live inside the city .
This same person will buy a place outside the city .
To be able to reach her work from her home she will need transportation .
At first it was walking , then bicyle but the person is looking for a faster way therefore she buys a car .
The car is not safe so she will purchase a safer car , and so on ...

Transportation is very important for us .
Purchasing new cars give the ability to the manufacturer to improve their vehicle .
I do not agree that there will be fewer cars in the twenty years .
The growing economie is allowing the cars to improve therefore will we have better , safer and even more cars on our road .
