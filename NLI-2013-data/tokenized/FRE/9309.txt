We know that facts are synonymous of results .
In another way we can associate facts as our daily experience .
Ideas and concepts for years years have been evoluating , changing from time to time , even if they helped and still help to solve many scientific , socilogical , and psychological dilemma or problems .

I am going to show by examples how i believe that facts are more important for students , even if ideas and concepts remain good tools to them .

First , i defined facts as experience because experience is one of the main element that motives a students .
The experience helps every person to face a similar problem in his or her future life .
From an empirique point of view , anytime we have clouds , we should have rain .
From a scientific point of view this is not right .
For a student , the experience of an internship is something that is enclosed for ever in mind .
This is something you can measure , not like just being given 1 + 1 = 2 .
It can be in the future 1 + 1 = 3 .

Second , ideas and concepts are tools that can help to learn facts .
Students should be prepared for their future that facts are the concretest elements that would lead them to success .
Because , facts are the element that would help them resolve daily problems they will faced in their working life .
Societies are guided by their past .
In the same way , the students experiences will help him face dispute between colleagues , and be strong to face daily life competition .
