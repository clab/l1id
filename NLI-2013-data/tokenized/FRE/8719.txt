It 's easier to learn facts than understand the ideas and concepts which generate them .
While some students may think it 's more important to understand ideas ; others prefer focusing only on facts .
In my opinion , it 's worth it to try to deal with ideas and concepts .

Ideas and concepts allow us to understand the reasons of what happen in our world .
Facts are only a result of something and never provide enough information .
When a student focus on ideas and concepts , he will understand much easier new events .
In my opinion , focusing on facts is too restrictive and does n't provide any new abilities .
When i was litlle , my physic teacher was always explaining us the reason why something happen .
It was hard in the beginning but i developed the will to work in a research department .

The last but not least , it 's just more interesting to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
When we learn facts we probably do n't understand the meaning of the event .
Students who are lazy will choose to learn facts without understanding the concept around .
I have always thought it is pretty borring to try to remember by heart something because i just do n't understand .
I did it when i was in history class .
I tried to remember everything and just gave it to my teacher during the exam .
When i begin to understand ideas and concepts behind those facts , i was able to learn more information .

In conclusion , it seems obvious that it 's more worth it for students to deal with ideas and concepts than it 's for them to learn facts .
The opportunity to provide more abilities in understanding others subjects and the interest to be able to learn more are two main reasons .
