My personal belief is that learning facts is more important and helpful in life than understanding concepts .
First , is it clear that a person who has learnt a lot of facts , in a word who has a great experience , adapts more easily to new situations than the one who first tries to understand the underlying cause of this event .
The former is able to imitate what he has already seen or done himself and to react quickly whereas the latter needs time to think it over and build his behaviour .
Coming back to the cause of anything to understand the hidden mechanism of action is starting from scratch every time and a hugh loss of time .
It is as if you do n't trust what others have done before in similar situations .
A lack of trust is basically a kind of anxiety that prevents from adapting to unforeseen events .

Second , knowing past facts increases one 's action effectivity .
Finding a solution is quicker when comparing to a similar problem that has already occurred than when modelising it into abstract schemes .
Now one could argue that experience is of little help to solve problems that are completely new and that one would be more successful if he understands the cause of the problem .
Well on the contrary , I believe that experience stimulates creativity and that it can inspire new solutions for new problems .

Third , learning facts is getting a realistic approach to life .
Focusing on ideas and concepts is too abstract in my view .
Of course this is can be seen as a superficial understanding of life but at least this brings liveliness and pragmatism .
And living is all about reactivity and ability to get in contact and communication with others .
Understanding deep causes of action is too theoretical and may cut counication sometines .
