Is the number of cars going to decrease during the next twenty years ?
That is a question we have to study according to many points of view .

Firstable we have to determine if we have enough ressources like petroleum to make our carswork .
We do n't have precise figures about that subject .
That let us think that producing countries prefer to hide them to make us think that it is not a problem .
However the amount of petroleum is still decreasing .
That 's why we can think that it wil have a bad influence on the number of cars during the next few years .

We may escape to this fate thanks to biotechnologies .
Environmental effort should be made to transform a car into a less pollutant machine .
We have to protect the ozon layer .
Researchers try to create oil thanks to some plants ' species .
It is an ecological solution to keep a certain amount of car on Earth .
But we will have to adapt car to this new oil and that cost time , money and need governmental authorisations to make it possible .

Another aspect which can inflence the number of cars that will be used in twenty years is that every owner has some habits .
He uses more or less his car .
Some people have to take their car each time he has to make shopping , to see other persons .
They can do anything else than using their car .
Researchers has to develop another way to move so that any physical efforts has to be provided .
Indeed , a man is not going to take his bicycle to replace his car just because of environmental reasons .
He will not be enough concerned about that .
But if there is another choice to move , I think I will agree to try it .

To conclude , I think it will be very difficult to decrease the number of cars in the next twenty years mainly because of economical and practical reasons .
However , in my opinion , the environmental problem the number of cars causes must make us react to create a less pollutant machine than car .
Everybody must to keep in mind that the whole planet is in danger and we have to change our behaviour .
