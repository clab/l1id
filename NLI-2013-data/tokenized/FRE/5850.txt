I do not think there will be fewer cars than today in twenty years , although I think it would be a positive thing for the environment .
There are many ways to discourage people to use their cars , but these ways are not very often put into practice .
Some countries , like the scandinavian countries , have been very successful in reducing the use of cars .
The methods they used are well-known : tax incentives , available and cheap public transportation , ban on cars in city centers , education and sensibilisation to environmental issues ...

By reducing significantly the use of cars , the standard of living is also enhanced : less pollution , less noise , less trafic jams , less stress ...
All of these are positive consequences of an environment-friendly policy .

Unfortunately , many countries are not following Denmark , Sweden or Norway 's examples .
The United-States for instance are the biggest car-users in the world .
One reason is that it is a very large country , with huge distances to cover .
Another reason is that oil is cheap .
Moreover , the public transportation service is disastrous .
Conveniency is also a reason for the intempestive use of cars : it is easier to take your car than to do a five-minute walk or to catch a bus .
There might also be a cultural element in the American taste for cars .

Given the governments'policy concerning cars , I doubt the use will significantly diminish in twenty years ' time .
An alternative method to escape car pollution might be the search for non polluting devices that would allow to use environment-friendly cars .
Hybrid cars , using partly oil and partly electricity or non-polluting oils , already exist .

But theres is also an economical aspect to the question .
Huge economical interests are at stake .
The oil market deals with enormous amounts of money , and big oil corporations do not want to see their profits decline .
They try to discourage the search for new technologies to replace oil .

But , as the stock of oil will diminish more and more , those technologies will have to be developped anyway .
But , first of all , the international community will have to become aware of this problem .

To conclude , I would like to say that there will probably not be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
But , hopefully , these cars will be environment-friendly cars .
