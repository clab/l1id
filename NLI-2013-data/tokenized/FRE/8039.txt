This is a very interesting question because it represents the current challenge in french education .
Indeed , the task of education is to teach students a lot of theories , ideas and concepts .
That 's also why we learn philosophie in school , to learn to doubt , to think and analize .
the follow quotation of Montaigne shows the real question : `` It is better to have a well established brain that a full brain . ''

But both ca n't work separately : we need comon knowledge to learn how to take a decision and how to behave in society .
History shows us the way to behave with other countries , mathematic shows us how to deal with other countries , geography teaches us how to reach other countries and languages allow us to speak in other countries .

The comon knowledge represents all ideas , concepts and theories we need to make the right decision and understand our environement .

Despite all of this , one day , students have to use their knowledge in a practical field to experience the profit of it .
The increasing rate of internship demonstrates this need of ` facts ' .
Education requires always more from students without teaching them the real work they are attending for .
That 's why , there are more and more private schools that offer a practical schooling with a long period of internship .
University realized this problem few years ago and tried to adapt themself to the reality of the market .

To conclude , I would say that this is a central question in education field .
In my point of view both are as important .
The question is no longer to know if we should teach ideas and concepts but more to know where is the border between ideas , concepts and practical facts ?
