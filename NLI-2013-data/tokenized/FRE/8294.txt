The way , professor should teach students has always been a heated debate .
The question of the best academical system is not solved yet , and many scholars continue to propose alternative ways to teach .
If we take a close look at the way education is organised in France , in Germany or in the United States , we immediately realise that many different approaches are possible .

How the professor should act in front of his students is not an easy question to answer .
To claim whether a solution is better than another may seem , I acknowledge , a bit pretentious .
But I am deeply convinced that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
Learning facts and figures are , in my opinion , the worst thing you can do in a university

What we are asking to a student nowadays , is to understand and to analyse immediately the situation he/she faces .
This is what we call , the ability to react in front of an unexpected situation .
This skill does not appear alone ; it must be worked and practised .

The student must be able to think on his proper way , but he has also have to master some important theories which are the basis of our common and recognised society .
For example , you cannot speak about the evolution of the species without referring to Darwin .

But , once this general basis of common knowledge is acquired , then the student is perfectly able to evolve by himself .
Our society should not be made of people only good at repeating what they have heard , but of people who are creative , imaginative , original .

The possibility offered by an university to learn and discover a whole range of new knowledge , is certainly one of the most important thing ever .
It would be a shame to spoil this unique opportunity by being occupied with the learning of figures that would be forgotten almost immediately .

Anyway , recently , the priority has been given to the free will of the student .
The curiosity and the knowledge of every students must be aimed at the improval of our society .
Understanding ideas and concepts may be compared to the keys which lead to the achievment of such a goal .
