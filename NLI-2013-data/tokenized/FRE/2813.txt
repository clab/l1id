This question has been raise for a long time now , to answer this question another question must be raise : How do u define enjoy life ?
Is it the activity you do ?
Is it your state of emotions ?
Young people enjoy life as much as old people but in a very differnt way , that often appear to be stronger .

As a young person most of the time you try to spend your free time at full speed , most of the activities asociated with enjoyment are spend in outdoors at tha age .
I remeber as a young child i spend most of my free time riding bycicles , riding skateborad ...
and so on .
A good day for me was a day where i could tied , exausted .
That what most peolpe think when they see kids play around all day .

For older people the sence of enjoyment is more define with reflection , taking the time to relax .
As i can see myself today by getting older , my point on view on situation change , i spend more time now on intellectual refection ( sush as books , phylosophy .. )
and get more pleasure from little thing , such as kindness form others ...
Older people enjoy life with less physical activities .

The emjoyment of life for older people is less noticable then young people because they do not have the same point of attraction .
So for outsiders young people will always enjoy life more than older .
