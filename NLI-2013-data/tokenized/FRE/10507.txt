To be successful is the main goal for everybody life .
It concerns work , family , hobbies .
It causes different effects on people but it can differ from one to another .
In general , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

Success makes people happier and aware .
This encourages to try new things , to discover , to face new situations .
They are more relaxed and are less afraid of failures because they have already knew what is success .
Risk is part of things they can face but the stake to ace in another field is more attractive .

When you are successful , you see life in a different way .
You change your priorities to new ones .
For example , Zidane , a famous football player , finished his carreer as a football player .
But now , he supports fondations which aim is to protect children by giving time and money .

Furthermore , in your life , you are not forced to do always the same thing even if you do it in a perfect way and it is pleasant for you .
Successful people tend to think this way .
There is always something to learn and they are more curious .

When you have money and success , you do not care about opinion of other people so you are not afraid of doing new things .
You know that you are able to do good and successful actions .
You can find interests in some hobbies or activities which always atttracted you .
For example , Yannick Noah sings songs whereas he was playing tennis before .
