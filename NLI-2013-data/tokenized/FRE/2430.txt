This philosophic question , to know who is enjoying the more life between young and old people , is a current one .

An often answer is that olders have more experiments , and had to solve more problems , to reconize each new hapiness moment and enjoy it as it should .
But , i do n't think so , because to my mind it 's only a way to not be threaten by our futur .
In my opinion , young people are quite naiv and not realy aware of their environnement .
For them everyday is a new one , they are n't boried accumulating problems , their owne are essentialy about their boy or girlfriends ...

Moreover I think that a lot of olders , like my grand-grand-mother , was realy traumatished by the second world war .
And , even if they did n't done it , their children to .
Because , in many family this feeling of constent threat and fear from the human genre was quickly transmited from parents to children .

But , nowadays , we could see that all over the world , youngs try to make extrem actions , like being violent , practicing extrem sports , preapering atemotats , drinkng alcool and in many other ways ...

So can we say that yongs are happy and enjoy life ?
I realy do n't know .
My final opinion would be that not more than the older ...
