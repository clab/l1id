1 : broad knowledge of many academic subjects

2 : specialize in one specific project

During the studies , the students have many decisions to make , depending on where they want to work later and what job they want to do .
Is it better to have abroad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ?

During our school years , we are use to studying different subjects such as biology , mathematics , geography or history .
These different subjects helped us making our decision about about what we prefer the most .
This is always helpfull to have various types of information .
For instance , a student who has been studying both the economics and biology could have the possibility to get and understand documents about the memory process .
On the other hand , a student who focused his studies on biology and more precisely on the brain studies could n't get or understand some processes in the economics .

On the other hand , the student with a broad knowledge would n't have a subject in which he is specialized .

When somebody is specialized in one specific subject , he depends on the others for all the information out of his speciality .
During a conversation with people who all have a different job , the person would feel a bit lost .
Having knowledge on a various types of topics enable to work on different fields and to change field if you want to .

To put it in a nutshell , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects in order to polyvalent , unless you look forward to working in a very specific fields and that you are sure about it .
