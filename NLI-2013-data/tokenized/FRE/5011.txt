Advertisements should present a product on an objective way but most of them make products seem much better than they really are .
By definition an advertisement should make the public buy the product and so present only his better aspect and properties .
Moreover , since they are a lot of company producing the same product they should emphasize the properties of their product .
And eventually , there are always differences between a photo or a film and the real product .

First , the purpose of an advertisement is to create a need by convincing the client that he should have this product .
Therefore the product should be perfect without any disadvantages .
But reality is different .
For example when you buy a computer , advertisement show you computers as objects everybody should have .
You could have access to internet , a lot of information , it will simplify your life .
However , they never tell you that sometimes the computer should have some problems like virus , that by using it for buying some products on internet people could see your credit card number .
All the bad aspect of the computer are forgotten .

Nowadays , in our society there are a lot of companies producing the same product .
So each company have to make the difference with the others by emphasizing the properties of their product .
they should show that their products is better than those of the others .
For example , cleaning product for cloths all clean the clothes .
but one company will show you that our product is better than the other one for several reasons such as using less product .

Eventually , there are always differences between photo or film they made that are taken in the perfect condition to make the product seems perfect and the product that you received .
For examples the color of clothes are sometimes different due to light .
So you could see on the television a perfect black skirt and eventually have a grey skirt .

As a conclusion , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are by emphasizing their properties , not talking aboute the inconvenients and showing the product in the perfect conditions that you couldn'y have .
However in the way we always want perfect products are n't we a bit reponsible of this phenomenom ?
