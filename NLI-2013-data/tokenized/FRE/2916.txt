It is sometimes in people mind that young people are more likely to enjoy the life more than older people .
Everybody has already heard a fifty years-old person saying : '' Oh , if only I was twenty , I would do these things ! '' or '' What can I do to go back when I was young ! ''
.

But it is too easy to believe that older people or seniors does n't enjoy their life like young people .
Morover , it will be easy to show that their life can be even greater than the one of a twenty years-old person .
We will give some examples and headline the fact that enjoying life is just a question of point of view .

For a young person , enjoying life can be simplier because he is often healthier than an older person .
So a young one can more easily practising sports , going out lately , etc ...
For a student , life can be very nice , because of all the opportunities he is given to him , to do a lot of different and meet new people .
But as he has only a few experience of life , he ca n't appreciate well enough things he does .

In contrary , for an older person who have experience the world , people and life im general , it is easier to take more benefits and appreciate even more things he does .
But young people are just beginning their life , so that willness of saying `` I 'm enjoying life '' could be seen as a way of do n't thinking to the future because he fears it .
For a senior who have just finish their working life , it is easier to appreciate now a different way of living , without stress , and enjoying his family .

In conclusion , being a young people does n't automatically imply to enjoy more the life than older people .
