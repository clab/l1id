To my mind , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First , there are a lot of advertisements which lie .
For exemple , for products to wach white tee shirt , ads says '' more white than white '' , which is impossible .

Then , we discover there are a lot of liing advertisement when we try the product .
When we buy a product to wash bath room , they do n't wash alone althoug advevertisement say .

finaly , we find a lot of advertisements for only one product .
He is always new , but there are the same ingredients .

If we must n't be radical on this subject , we can say that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
