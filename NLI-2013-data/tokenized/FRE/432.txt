Nowadays , knowledge is something crucial in our societies .
People tend to study more in order to have the necessary knowledge to work and live in society .
But they need a specific knowledge for each situation .

We are going to see first of all , why it is essential to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and to finally conclude about why it is necessary to specialize in one specific subject .

On one hand , when children are at school , they learn many subjects such as history , geography , mathematics , languages .
They can have an overall view about their culture .
It is essential for people to have broad knowledge in order to express themselves and not to be narrow-minded .
For example , when people are discussing in an every day life conversation or about news from the world , they have to know about what they are talking about .
If they have a lot of culture and broad knowledge , they could talk with other people and have different points of view about many subjects .

On the other hand , when children grow and become students , they have to specialize in one or a few subjects in order to work in companies .
For example , a marketing director is specialized in one subject which is marketing because it is his function in the company .
But being specialized in one subject is not enough .
It is obvious that you have been hired for your specialization but for your knowledge in other subjects too .
The marketing director must also have knowledge in finance to fix his budgets .

In conclusion , being specialized in one specific subject is good but it is not enough .
You need also to have knowledge about many subjects for every day life but also for the labour market .
It is very important to develop this knowledge in order not to be narrow-minded .
You have to be specialized and have also broad knowledge .
Culture and knowledge are two things that can not be dissociated .
