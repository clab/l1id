As student I am directly concerned with the subject of this question : Ideas and concepts are they more important to learn than facts ?
I think it is interesting to see both point of view and to try to understand why it could be more important for students to understand ideas and concepts and then why facts could be more important to learn .

The first reason in favor of ideas and concepts is that when you understand an idea , a concept you are able later to find the way to the solution even the problem is not exactly the same .
For example in biology you would be able to find the good way to find the solution even if the problem deals with frogs and you have studied rabbit .

Then the understanding of concepts and ideas help you to build your own opinion because there is necesarly a reflexion , a discussion during the class .
That means that it helps build yourself as an adult .

The last point is that if you learn the facts without understanding the ideas there are behind them , you will build your judgement on a small part of the problem and you wo n't be abble to understand the globality of the issue .
For exemple if you learn about the problem of Israel and Palestina without knowing nothing about their religion you wo n't be able to have a general view of the problem .

Now facts also are important to learn .
First of all learning facts help students to understand our world .
For exemple if you do not know the important dates of the evolution of your country it will be hard to understand your country today .

Then , facts are very important in a discussion .
Indeed in order to convince somebody you ca n't present only ideas and concepts but also fight .
They will proove , explain , give more weight to your idea .

As far as I am concerned , I really believe that it is really important for students to learn both ideas and concepts , and facts .
Learning both of them it is the only way to avoid ignorance and to build real adults .
