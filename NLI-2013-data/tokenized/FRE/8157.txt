When the Education 's reforms hit the headline of the newspapers it is a strenous effort to know if it is more important for the young student to learn facts or understand ideas and concepts .

with the benefit of insight , I suppose both have advantages and you can not separate one from the other .

On the one hand , the schoolchildreen have to learn fact in oder to make their meaning to understand complex situation as the die and the birth .
You could not have the possibility to write or to tell something without vocabulary or idea wich you learn in your youth .
There are four steps in the developement of the childreen , and you do not become an adult if you do not learn specifics facts in this steps .

On the other hand , you do not spend all the times of your life in learnning facts .
In previous years after your schoolyears you will not learn some facts but only understand ideas and concepts in order to analyse them , and discover a solution .

For example a searcher in an institute of medecine , had spent time in books to learn facts as a student .
But , when he take time on fundamental experience like research on A.I.D's
virus he spend more time to understand it complex structure than learn about the fact he exist .

to put in a nutshell , the student and te adult when they are not student spend time in undestand ideas and concepts and learn facts .
On the whole , I am firmly convinced that all the time in your life you learn and trie to understand concepts or informations .

Owing to world change evryday at evrytime .
you have to focus on all informations if you want to do not be drop out the society .
