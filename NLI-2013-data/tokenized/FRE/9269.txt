During thier studies , students face different approaches to work on different materials .
These approaches focus either on the learning either on the understanding .
They depend on their teachers and on the material itself .
So is it more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts ?

First of all , from my point of view , learning facts seems to be a good way to study .
According to scientists the memory works like a muscle .
Therefore it has to exercise to become more and more efficient .

In addition i agree on the fact that learning facts is an efficient method to get a big amount of knowledge during the studies .

However , as far as I 'm concerned , learning fact is necessary but not sufficicent .
On the one hand , this approach should be undertaken in order to get a background on different materails .
On the other hand it does n't efficiently prepare student to their futur life .
So this method has to be completed by the other approach .

For me by understanding ideas and concepts , students know how to adapt to different situations they could face later .
For example , in their professional life they wo n't only be asked to use the facts they have learnt during their studies .
For me by understanding ideas and concepts they learn a particular way of thinking that could be apply in differents cases .

Thus this last approach is more important for me .
Indeed their availability to analyse and adapt to a special situation comes from their faculty to understnad .

To conclude , I approve that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
However these two approaches seem to be complementary .
in a certain extent .
