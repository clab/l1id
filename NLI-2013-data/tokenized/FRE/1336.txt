It is better to have broad knowledge of many accademic subjects than to specialize in one subject .
We will see in a first part why i schouldn t agree with this statement and in a second part why i schoud agree .

I schouldn t agree with this statement .
Indeed , i think in a first way that it can be better for a pupil to specialize in one specific subject .
Every body have a favourite subject , a passion .
It would be more interresting for the student to work in his favourite subject , he would work with happiness , and would like what he is doing .
For exemple , a student who loves mathemathiq would rather prefer working in a scientific subject than in a art subject .
He will have an idea of what to do for a job , he will be in good healthy .

I schould agree with this statement .
Firstly , i think that it can be good to studies different academic subect .
Indeed , this might be verry interrissing to have various subject , from scientific to philosophical .
For exemple , if a student doesn t like a subject , he would have other subjects that he should like .
Althought he would have lots of assignements , he would know about lot of things in the world Moreover , a student can be bored , annoyed with just one specific subject

To conclude , i can say that i m always at school and i am more scientific .
Next year , i would choose just one specific subject and i think it s verry interressing to change my way of life .
I think i would rather prefer next year because i would have just my favourite subject math .
But , it was verry interressant to studies differnts subects during my studies .
