Advertisements are increasingly present in our everyday life , in several supports and in severals ways .
To wonder if advertisements make products seem better than they really are could be seen as a non-sense question , because precisely the aim of an ad is to make a product unreplacable .

That is why I agree with this statement .
Advertisements are made to give people the will to buy the product .
It 's also the only way to get people aware of a new product , and obviously the better is this product , the more people will buy , even if it 's just to try .
So my first point is that advertisements should and must make product better than they really are , because they 're made for that .

My second point is that advertisements can do more than just showing a product at it 's best .
I mean that advertising is also a way to build an image , a spirit for a product and for the people who buy this product .
For example , in advertisements for cars , advertisers manage to show only what they want to insist on , in order to attract a specific range of customers .
They can insist on security , fun , sportivity , but it 's always to make people feel attached to a way of thinking and behaving .
So advertisements are a way for producers to sell their products by giving more to the consumers than only the product .

Obviously all people are not sensitive to the same purposals of advertising , and that 's a way to highlights the weakness of advertising .
An ad ca n't be liked by everybody , and sometimes ca n't be understood by anybody .
So ads can also be unproductive and unefficient .
The point is that I believe that advertisement can be both very profitable and dangerous for a producer .

That 's why I finally confirm that I really think that advertising is very powerful , and very important for the life of a product , but it has to be well prepared , well broadcast to be very effective .
