There are two ways of learning nowadays ; either students learn in books and understand some ideas , or they learn thanks to work experience and special facts which is more important and relevant for me .

Personnally , with my student formation , I have had the chance to experience both .
In an engineering school , you attend theoretical courses during a part of the year and then you have to perform an internship to go to the next level .
The theoretical courses explain the ideas and concepts used in different companies and the internship gives the possibility to work on special facts , which put together make your own experience .

At first I would say that the experience in a company , with some problems or special facts you have to face , is more relevant that some courses .
But after reflection , I would say that we need both .
It is not possible to learn and be able to face problems if we just attented some courses in class for a few years .
The real experiences are essential to learn the best way and get the best skills .
One can use all the theoretical courses we have had during the student formation and then make everything in practise on a real case .

Learning just by studying special facts is also not complete enough because it does not give the necessary skills to face other problems .
The skills used to explain or solve some facts are only for that fact in particuliar but they are different with other problems .
And it is impossible to study all the facts that can possibly exist .
That is why the ideas and concepts learned in theoretical courses are important .

So I think there has to be a balance between what is learned in theoretical courses and the experience lived outside the universe of school .
They are both needed to have a great formation and great ideas , but they can not work seperately .
Each student has to take ideas and skills thanks to his teachers but also with his own experience which gives more human values than theoretical ones .
