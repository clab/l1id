I disagree with the following statement .
I think that there will be more cars then it uses to be in twenty years for the following reasons .
First , I believe that developing countries and cities will get an increasing of their cars in a few year .
For instance , prospection of Mexico or Sao Paolo demonstrates that the traffic will get bigger and intense in a few year .
More people are goin In my opinion , cars tend to be a symbol and will still be a symbol of wealthy and success people .
Second , even if oil prices are getting up and oil reserves are diminishing , people will never stop using their cars .
For examples , in the United-States people can not live without cars because public transports have not been developed adquately by the government .
It is necessary for a middle class familly to possess one or two cars and they used it on a daily base .

Third , even if oil reserves are being reduced , scientists try already to find some alternativ to petrole .
In fact bio-carburant will be prehaps the new carburant for our cars .
Now , new kinds of carburants that are made of bee or others cropswill interest car concessioners .

Finally , I think that if we do not find any alternative to move from one city to another , cars will still be used a lot even in twenty years .
