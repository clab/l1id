As an engineering student I do think that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .
Eventhough sometimes there are facts you must learn in order to understand concepts .

One cannnot build a boat float if one does not know why it floats and therefore how much it can carries before it sinks .
The concepts of physics need to be understood in order to adapt to every case and make the best choice in materials , shape etc .

A historian cannot explain a revolution only by facts .
The understanding of the ideas shared by the different layers of the society is necessary and a simple description of events cannot replace the analysis of the historical situation which is at stake .

However , in order to understand subjects like biology or chemistry you need to learn a certain amount of facts .
Which element is to react with an other one , how the fast and how strong the reaction is .
A doctor must learn where are all the bones and the muscles in our body before he can even learn how to make a diagnosis .
He has to learn which drug can cure each illness .

The learning process is not just about facts or ideas and concepts .
To understand a concept , a fact can be helpful because our brain can associate an image to the concept .
And the other way is also true , learning the ideas of romanticism without reading examples and facts is not worthy .
Global comprehension of a subject can only be reached once both ideas and facts are learned .
To introduce a concept , it is a common easy way to start with a fact , something that can be observed , before the ides behind can be explained .
