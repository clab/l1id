In twenty years it will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

I think that petroleum is becoming more and more expensive and that in twenty years it wont be enought for the rest of ther global population .
So i 'm sure that it will be less oil or petroleum cars in use but i 'm sur that people and humanity will find a way to commercialise alternatives energies and we will be able to use it for our cars .
By the way , it 's already possible in Brazilia where petroleum is being fired by a new kind of oil , The Sugar Alcohol .
this new generation of car 's oil is well known in south america country as sugar is one of the most famous good of the country .

but it 's not a reason , the world population is use to cars m they are in our way of life since a hundred years and even if it works with a different kind of energies , people wont like to drive something else than cars because they are used to it .
There is no reason should be erased , our world live with it for so long that if we change it we will lost a part of our history .

It 's whatever important not to dream on the situation , huge lobbies in the united states and in orient are not enjoyed in those new technologies and they will make presure on the gouvernement for it not allowed those new possibilities to their countries .
for example in france it 's totally forbiden to ride a car that does n't work with petroleum or gaz whereas there is already a lot of new types of energies like betrave or hydrogene that should be comercialised but cant because of the oposition of the state .

However we will use some other energies than petroleum but in the next twenty years it seems pretty hard to imagine that the world will stop running after petroleum and will be cultivated differents kind of plants in order to go working or to be able to leave for holidays .

So in order to conclude i think we can say that whatever what happens , it will still be as much cars in twenty years but the real question will be to guess how it will work .
