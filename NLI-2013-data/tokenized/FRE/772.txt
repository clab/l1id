This question can be answered differently depending on the context we are speaking about : if we are looking at the professional environment , I tend to disagree with this statement , whereas as regards the personal life , I would rather agree with this asumption .

Fistly in the professional world , my opinion is that is it better to know deeply well a subject or a to be particularly performant in one specific competence , than to know how to do a little of everything !
It is quite obvious , especially in big companies , that you are designed for a mission that people want you to perfom the most correctly as possible , and even better , to be really good in your specific job , impressive and reliable at the same time .
It is useless to be capable of accomplishing some of the tasks of each service but do be unable to occupy a function in its totality .
I do not have the same point of view concerning the personal life : indeed , I think that having broad knowledge of many subjects , either academic or cultural , is really more valuable and useful than having knowledge only in one or two particular fields .
Because all the time when you are speaking with people about all the subjects others than the one you are competent about , you look completely ignorant and stupid .
However , I think that what every person tends to do inconciously is to focus on some subjects that raise her interest , and for which it requires less efforts to memorize information about .
It even does not require any effort at all to learn things about something that anyway passionate you , it is rather a pleasure .
One exaple in my personal experience is that I am fond of horseriding , and consequently know a lot of thing on my favorite hobby , but all this knowledge is one I meanwhile do not have on other subjects .
The problem of knowing a lot of answers on a lot of different topics is a problem that I know well , as what I am trying to improve in my daily life is my personal broad knowledge .
During the whole of my initial school training , that is to say until the French lycee , I completely disinterested myself of all the academic lessons that bring you with general knowledge , such as history , geography , litterature .
To me , at that time , these lessons where of no interest in my daily life , but today I struggle to recover my lackings , because they are sometimes useful in the daily life , but rather more because now my interest finally waked up towards a lot of various subjects .
Also because travelling open the horizons , the spiritual and philosophical awareness , I hope I will have the opportunity to accumulate a lot of experiences in my future life , and that my children will have this chance too .
It is really a trap , the fact to limit oneself to one 's daily life and specialized professional task or context , and to stay in one 's own routine .
We should try to learn new things every day and to take initiatives , to take profit of all the treasures of life
