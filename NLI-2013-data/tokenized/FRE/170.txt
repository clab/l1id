Nowadays , oil becomes even rarer and even more expensive and some people believe that in thwenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
We will explain why this statement could occur or not in the future .

On the one side , petroleum is becoming more and more expensive to produce because there are limited areas where we can find it and lots of them are unreachable or unavailable , for instance because they are under big cities .

Moreover , governments are developping tube , train or bus to encourage people not using their own car and to pollute less .
For example , lots of advertisements for taking the train instead of driving are currently shown in the tube in Paris .

On the other side , the population of Third-World countries is growing , and at the same time , lots of people who were using the bike in China are considering bying a car .

Futhermore , lots of workers still need a car when they do not live in big cities because busses are not as frequent .
For this reason , it is still easier for them to rely on their own car rather than on a bus that can pick them just every hour .

Besides , scientists are considering developping cars with hybrid motors , which rely both on electricity and oil .
It could be a very good solution to the cost of the oil .
For the moment , those cars are puchased above all in Japan but thay may be soon be sold in all the countries of the world .

To put it in a nutshell , the issue of the cars is rather an issue of oil supply .
Till hybrid cars are not very fame , the number of cars could hence decrease .
However , it would rather be the case in big cities where people have other ways to go to work .
To my mind , twenty years is a very short time to introduce hybrid cars but it is also a vey short time to make people change their behaviour by not using their can as often as today .
