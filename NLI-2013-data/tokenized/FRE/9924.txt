The question here is to find out if success is closely linked or not with risk-taking and curiosity , when it comes to try new experiences .
As a student who wants to set up one 's own business in the long term , I totally agree that statement and I will explain why in main three points .

To begin with , how is it possible to learn and improve oneself in any job if one does not open up one 's mind nor express one 's curiosity ?
As one does not know everything about a topic - how to use Excel for the first time for instance - , it is a mandatory task to try by oneself to succeed , to learn and bear the tips in mind .
It is the same when it comes to ask to somebody you do not know at all to find your way in the street .
Sure , you can bump into strange people , but what if you never ask ?
You will never get to your meeting , are you ?

Then , and as I mentioned above , how is it possible to create something new in the entrepreneurship field for instance , if one never tries nor make experiments ?
Somebody want set up one 's business cannot be a risk-adverse , all the more that lots amounts of money are at stake .
But if one never try - to have special conditions on the loan for instance - , the company will not be created .

Thirdly , true , I am strongly convinced that most of successful people express their curiosity .
Still there is a need to qualify the notions of risk-taking and keep doing what is already working without trying acting different .

I am truly convinced that a black and white answer cannot be brought to the question : are there only risk-takers who succeed and safer people never do ?
This opinion just becomes stupid if we consider the examples of people who die while trying for the first time in their lives how to escalade the Hilmalaya or how to swim with sharks .

To conclude , risk has never been a guarranty for success but it may be a condition .
And New is not always good , old methods have been working for years , unless a recently-developed new one is more efficient , one does not have to change .
