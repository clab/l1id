Many people may think that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
On the contrary , I believe that many young people give a lot of time to helping their school mates , families , and other citizens .
My reasonning here is built on the two following arguments .

First , I think that many people just does not see the young people 's help to their communities .
I will give two very relevant examples from my own experience to support this idea .
I spent my summer vacation in California , volunteering in the '' Trail maintenance crew '' at Redwood National Park .
During the two months I spent over there , I met dozens of young volunteers , but I met only one volunteer over the age of thirty .
Thus , many young people are volunteering for free worldwide in National Parks and Forests , but only very few people realize how much time these young people gave to help preserving the world 's natural ressources .
Another relevant example are beach lifeguards .
Many people lie and rest on the beach without thinking about those young lifeguards .
These young people spend their day watching for endangered swimmers , and sometimes risk their own life to rescue them .

Then , I think many people still focus on the damages that young people can cause .
I will again use an example from my own experience to illustrate the fact that young people who feel responsible of the well being of their communities still exist .
For instance , there an association in my school , whose members clean the facilities and repair broken items after parties .

Thus , I think that many young people continue to give their time worldwide .
