Some students prefer strictly learning facts , dates or rules , whereas others like better understanding the main concepts and do n't pay as much attention to the specifics .
This may derive from their way of studying , their abilities to memorize and understand , and also from the way their knowledge will be controlled .

Knowing facts does not require much thought , as it is simply a matter of memory .
One could go , eventually , through an entire schooling using only facts : they are often the sole requirements because they make it appear as real and extensive knowledge .

The people who recommend the comprehension of ideas more than the mere knowledge of facts for students expect that such an understanding will provide useful capacities to a person , those of adaptability and effective thought , more important in their idea than simple knowledge .

But I think that , in reality , there is n't one way better than the other , as even though they may be different , both techniques complete each other .
Facts provide a background to concepts , examples and arguments , to help them develop and construct new theories .
But at the same time , concepts explain the facts and provide their utility .

For instance , knowing by heart the successive order of all the Kings and Queens of the United Kingdom is n't of much use if one does n't know how these rulers reigned and influenced History and international relations .
On the other hand , being able to tell the consequences of Henry VIII 's reign requires extensive knowledge of the facts about his life , the era he lived in and so forth .

This applies to any field of knowledge , literature , mathematics , biology or Latin !
Facts are at the source of most concepts , which in return link the facts together and give them meaning .
One cannot go effectively without the other , unless for a very short period of time .
