Success attracts people in our society With the largely diffused `` success-stories '' of business men since the 1980s and the boom of the Stock Exchange Markets and the IT Economy , people are more and more attracted by starting from the zero point and getting to the highest positions of recognition .

Our world more and more globalized has showed that new ideas for improving our ways of living are welcomed and are often succesful .
The concepts from Microsoft/Apple ( make our lifes simpler with a computer ) , Ryan Air , Lidl , or Ikea ( give the capability to most of the people to buy their products by cutting prices ) seem easy to find .

Also , people who travel around the globe use their experience in order to make up an idea and implement it in their country of origin .
The example of TV programmes such as `` Big Brother '' , `` the weakest link '' or `` who wants to be a millionaire '' is particularly relevant in that case .

However , the media power is really strong and may be able to take us away from reality .
Indeed , the success of one single person is hiding the bankrupty of many others .

Loads of employed people quit their job every year in order to create their own business believing it is going to be successful .
Unfortunatly , for most of them , the balance between the risk taken and the probability of success is not equal .
Most of the `` start ups '' go bankrupt only 3 years after they started in most of the developed countries .

Consequences can be really bad .
Debts can lead many people to many more obscure issues .

It is therefore really important to measure the risk taken when a venture is taken .
That is the purpose of most of courses in Management and Business .
I am actually currently undertaking one degree related to this field and we do learn how to measure opportunities and risks on any markets .
We also learn that most our societies works as a market , where supply and demand are the key-elements .

The most famous of this market among the employment market or the ressources market is the financial market where the more you take some risk , the more probability the profit will be high .
