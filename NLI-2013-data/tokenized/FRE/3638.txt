Nowadays generation is completely different of the older generation .
In the older generation , young people , was more implicated in the environment benefits than today .
They take more time to help their communities by extra jobs , by being more concerned of the pollution factors .
Contrary to young people of nowadays , who primarily think for their own interest .
For example , when you see people in the streets , and its wright that this problem touch more yougn people than older , they leave the duties in the street , sometimes they break down objects or furnitures of their communities .
Moreover , young people , is less likely to participate to extra actions for the benefits of their communities , as for example , going to the religious place , helping the old people or at least your old neighborood who needs assistance , participating in beneficial actions or in humanitary actions , or whatever they can do and which could help to improve the situation of the communities .
They could organize brunch , or collective entertainments but they think more of passing their time watching television or films , smocking with friends , going out the night or weaking up late .
Young people are sometimes selfish and they take advantage more of their friendly life than from their family or community life .
They are less interested of what possibilities they could offers to their community and environment .
They have to give more of their own time to help and improve their communities .
