`` You can have any color you want as long as it is black '' .
This famous sentence from Henry Ford is the symbol of the beginning of the mass production of cars .
Before Henry Ford 's use of taylorism , car production was linked with customization and very limited .
Since the 1920s the number of cars produced has increased exponentially .

Back then , there seemed to be a plethora of fossil fuels and nobody could ever imagine that cars could be one day an `` endangered specie '' .
Nowadays , with the knowledge that fossil fuel is a finite resource , researchers are looking for alternative transportation ways or other energies .
Taking all aspects into account , I strongly believe however that in twenty years there will be as many cars in use than there are today .
In this essay I will present the reasons why I believe so .

First I believe that people will not renounce to use their car that easily and that quickly .
Since the 1970s and the first oil crisis , oil price have increased .
This has had only few repercussion on people 's use of cars .
Even in Europe for instance , where consumers felt ( and are still feeling ) this increase in price , you can see many people commuting to work with their car .
Furthermore car is a really practical way to go from one place to another really quickly .
People have gotten used to such an advantage which gives them a lot of freedom .

Second I believe that the solution of the problems does not lie in reducing the amount of cars .
I believe that it rather lies in finding alternative resources .
Researchers are working hard on other energies , such as bio fuels .
In Germany for instance you can buy cars that are adapted to accept bio fuels .
In France , a law has been passed on that subject allowing bio fuels to be sold .
Therefore I think that there will be as many cars , they will however use another energy .

Third I truly think that cars have become as necessary as a home in people 's mind .
Having a beautiful car is a sign of wealth .
It enables people to dream and to show off sometimes .
Some people invest in really expensive cars in order to belong to a certain class , even if it means that they will have to do some sacrifices .
For many people , a car is a dream object .
This positive image of car along with its role in the society ensure that in twenty years there will always be as many cars if not more .

To conclude I think that cars will not disappear within the coming twenty years .
Even if there are problems that could cause the car to disappear , its importance on our society is such , that scientists will always look for solutions and consumer will always want to keep on driving .
