Somebody who begins to study has two possibilities : he can on one hand choose to learn things on different topics , and he can on the other hand choose to specialize directly on one subject .
But what is the best choice ?

The first possibility - learning a lot of details on many subjects - is quite interesting because it gives people good general knowledges so that they can speak on many subjects and discuss with different people .
In France , we can choose this way by entering `` Science Politique '' .
This school permits people to be particularly well informed and to give their opinion on every subject .

The second possibility - specializing on one specific subject - is also interesting because it gives people the possibility to be very competent on their subject .
If somebody told you his or her opinion on it , you can response with a lot of precisions and impose , if you are right , your point of view .
This possibility is provided by very specialized and professionnals schools which give young students those precise knowledges .

In fact , if you choose the first solution , you are not going to be able to speak seriously on one particular subject .
You can just say different things on it but not very precisely .
At the opposite , if you choose the second solution , you would be competent only on one subject and quite ignorant on the others .

The solution is to begin with studying different topics on litterature , science , technologies , and languages .
This first period gives the student the time to discover those different subjects , to construct his own culture .
It gives also him or her the possibility to choice what he or she prefers .
Indeed , if you choose too soon , you can make more easily a mistake .
When you have choosen , begins the second period during when you will work on the subject you choose so as to be competent on that one , but not without other knowledges on other subjects .
This is a balanced solution who permits us to work on a topic and , at the same time , not to be isolated in you knowledges .
