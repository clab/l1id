Nowadays , and as it is spread in the mass media , a popular misconception is that young people have a far more interesting life than olders .
Indeed , they make parties , they drink alcohol , contrary to the '' old men '' who spend their time playing cards , talking about business ...
I am deeply opposite to this vision .
I consider first that there are a lot of different ways in order to '' enjoying life '' , then I would like to point out that young people have obligations too , and finally I want to highlight a substantial thing : it is olders , those who have the means to enjoy .
But let 's talk first about different leisures .

To begin , I would like to say that enjoying is not necessary connected to parties .
Indeed , you can enjoy life in your work because you make an interesting job .
For the sake of example , I think that a singer like Michel Sardou , or a business man , like Steve Jobbs , can have fun being at work .
Moreover , when you are older , you get experience which allows you to enjoy other things : a teenager cannot understand the same things visiting a museum than a senior .
And playing at Trivial Pursuit when you are 12 years old is not so pleasant .

Then , even if I cannot deny that young people have usually more time for leisures , they have obligations too : for a lot of working people , they have finished when they come back to their houses .
It is not the same for a student who has homework .
And it is noticeable that adults chose their work , whether pupils and students are at school because it is an obligation .
So , they can feel less involved in what they do .

Finally , we cannot forget the fact that , for a lot of leisures , you have to pay to enjoy .
Speaking about sport , about cinema , even about attraction parcs , nothing is free .
And in order to earn enough money , you have to spend a certain number of years , so you are older .

To conclude , and being a student myself , I do not want to complain about my situation , and I know that my parents wo n't let me without money , but I do think that , with the age ( so with the experience and the money ) you can enjoy your life in a different way , without becoming a vegetable in a chair !
