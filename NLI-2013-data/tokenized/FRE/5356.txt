In the modern world that we know , a lot of different products are available .
Are we always aware carefully about all those products ?
Should it be the responsibility of companies to make sure customers know everything about risk that could create by using their products ?
In fact , the law wants that all risk concerning a product be identified by the producer .
Some believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Personnally , I do n't agree with this .
Those advertisements make you think twice , and at least , they make sure the customer is aware about risks .

First , Those advertisements make you thing twice before to buy a product like alcool are tabaco .
Also , usully those argument are pretty stronght and they make yourself considere it a little bit more before using it .
Also , I have seen on pack of cigarettes , in Canada , photograph which are illustrating desease that can be caused by tabaco .
This is ugly , that freak you out the first time you see it .
This wo n't make a product more attractive for customers .

Second , at least it informes about some risks that customers may not know concerning the product itself .
It could be hard to believe for some people , but it may happen to anybody to use a product and do n't be aware about the effect .
If somebody have n't told you or teached you , how can you be aware ?
Company must be responsible about what they are offering to the population .

Finally , I believe that the law is not too stronght concerning advertisements on products .
They do n't really make products seem much better than they really are .
They make sure that everybody is aware about what they will consumed or used .
It avoid all misunderstood and surprises .
