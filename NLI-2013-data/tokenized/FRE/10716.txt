Everybody want to succeed in something .
But for some people , success is more about keeping a certain kind of safe situation and not taking any risk to obtain what they want , for other people , risking and jeopardize an established situation is the essence of success and one could'nt makes it without it .
Is taking risks and trying new things the only relevant way to success ?

On the one hand , one must acknoledge that , in spite of a more glamourous aspect than basically choosing for safety , taking risks remains by definition ...
risky indeed .
Taking risks or trying new things might lead to sucess , but can also often make one 's situation worse than before .

The statement should n't so be applied in any circonstance : take the example of someone who is burdened with a gambling problem .
Such a person will often loose all his money on the very justification that he can win tremendous amounts of money by taking a small risk !

Trying new things does n't implies success at any time too .
One good example is the franchising phenemenon that keeps on spreading around the fast food restauration services .
Experience have shown that using an established brand and well known products can be far more interessant for fast food restaurant .
Customers may be scared of new things , and introducing new products does n't necessary means being successful .

But on the other hand , no one can be really succesful without taking any risk .
If someone only follows established footsteps without adding any new thing , it is sure that his fate wont be extraordinary too .
Many of the `` success stories '' one could heard about are mainly grounded on an invention , or on a risk taken : Bill Gates became the richer person in the word by creating Microsoft Windows , Fosburry won all the high jump competitions by using `` Fosburry '' technique ...
Galileo himself took the risk of claiming that the earth goes round the sun while nobody else at his time dared believe it !

To conclude , I would say that to succeed , taking risks is essential but must remains a calculated thing , keeping in mind the fact that losses can occur , and dealing with this possibility .
