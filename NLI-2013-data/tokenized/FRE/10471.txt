How to be successful ?
Is it rather by only repeating thing that you already know how to do well or rather by trying new things ?
On the one hand , I think that to succeed in anything , everyone has to practise .
For instance , a tennis player , before winning competitions , has to practise for hours and even days .
When you repeat something , it becomes easier to complete and you will even be able to do it faster and more accurately .
The first time you try something , you will most likely fail .
Then , with the habit of doing it , you will improve yourself .
Consequently , successful people may be successful because they have practised enough and now know how to do well .

But on the other hand , with only repeating the same acts , maybe you will stop thinking .
You will begin to act mechanically , therefore you wo n't have the will to improve yourself .
So I am strongly convinced that trying new thing is also very important : you have to learn not to be afraid of what you have never met before .
For instance , I have studied mathematics and I was told by my teachers to practise with long and complex problems , that I had never seen before , rather than with small and repetitive exercises , with a view to learning how to deal with new questions .

Moreover , if at some moments of your life you do n't take risks , if you do n't put yourself in danger , if you always want to be secure , you may lose many opportunities : for instance , if you want to get a better job for which you are not quite prepared , you must be courageous and not be afraid to apply for it , to tru everything to get it .

To conclude , the solution of this concern is far from easy .
What would be the best behavior ?
To my mind , both are relevant , but at different moments .
You should n't hesitate to try new things , even if you feel unprepared , but to succeed in new things you must always keep in mind everything that you already know : what you know how to do well can prove very useful to do new things .
