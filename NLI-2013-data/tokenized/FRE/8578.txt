What is the most important things we have to learn at school or at university ?
That is the question ...
Is the most important thing to have a good understanding of the main concepts or ideas ?
Or is it to learn a lot of informations , without having a good comprehension of the main concepts ?
According to me , the main character for a good student at the end of the school is a good comprehension and an hability for reproducing the concepts .
In your argumentation , we will present some elements in order to give our own opinion .

First , I think it 's very important for a student to be abble to reproduce the main ways of a reflexion .
For example , concerning a mathematical exercise , a student wil be judged about his hability to do again the problem with different informations .
So that 's more important , it is'nt the basic informations but the way of reflexion .
It 's generally the same for evey scientific topics .
To my mind , it 's better to understand the general ideas until of the general facts .

Secondly , I believe for general facts as the history facts , students have all time to learn it in the free time .
For example , I do n't think a little boy , if he does n't know the name of the actual President , will be a bad student .
On the contrary , this boy can have the informations by other ways : television , news-paper , radio ...

And I do n't think the perfect student is the student who knows everything concerning all the topics .
So for me , a good student will generally curious and in the most cases , he will search the informations by his owns capabilities .

Last but not least , it 's clear that understanding concepts is more important in the real life that learning a lot of facts .
In fact , if a young student has many habilities in learning his history lessons at the age of 8 years , but without understanding concepts , it will probably be hard for him to continue high school .
So it 's necessary to early learn comprehension and understanding .

To sum up our reflexion , it appears that understanding the main ideas and concepts is very important for a student who wants to integrate an high school .
The facts are also important , but we have all the time to get it , whereas it is not the case for the general comprehension .
