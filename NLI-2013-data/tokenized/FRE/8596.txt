There are various methods that could be used in order for a student to learn new informations .
Some students would choose to deeply understand ideas and concepts while others would choose to learn facts withoud a deep understanding of them .

Personnaly , i would definitely choose the first method which is a deep understanding of ideas and concepts .
I truly think that it is much more benificial to understand rather than to learn .

First , i would say that this method is a very intersting one because when you understand something , you get intersted and fascinated about it and about the way it works .
Let 's take the example of a physics course .
I think that a student would be much more intersted by understanding a physic concept for example the way cellphone works rather than learning by heart some facts or conlusion .

In addition , i am highly convinced that when you learn things by heart without really understanding them , you tend to forget them very fast , So you would have studied these facts for nothing .
It would have simply been a loss of time .

Futher more i would add that understanding ideas could be very beneficial for the daily life .
Let 's take another physic example which is electricty .
When you learn how elctricity works you are then able to deal with any electrical problem that you could face while you are at home , and would n't be using the help of an electrician .
However if a person has just learned some facts about electricity , it would then be difficult for her to soplve her problem without the help of someone else .

Finally , i think that the more you understand a subject , the more professionnal you become in this domain .
and this is how we 'll be able to evolve , and make new discoveries that could be very beneficial for evryone .

In conclusion , i would say that it is way important for students to understand ideas and concept than it for them to simply learn facts .
A deep understanding of a subject could be much more beneficial than a simple learning of facts .
