No , I not really agree about this statement .
I think that , in twenty years , the number of cars in use will be increase in the world .
But I think the increase will be less important in the developped countries .
In fact , in each developed country , the increase of cars is already done ...
For exemple , in France , it was during the 70s , with the background of the economic increase , the unemployement rate was very down .
The French people bought a lot of cars during this period .

Almost 40 years later , french people buy still cars ...
but in general , it s to replace the oldest .
They just change the model of their car .
Now , each member of the family had his car ...
the wife and the husband , the young adult boy or girl ...

It s the same in America , in Great Britain , ...
in the developped countries .
So , in fact , in twenty years , I think that in the developped countries there will be fewer cars in use than tere are today .

But in the other countries of the world , it s not the same situation .
I think that in the countries on the way of the economic increase , the number of cars will strongly increase .
For exemple , China , the country that everybody is talking about and which is going to become one of the most important enconomic country in the world in a very short moment .
