This statement points at a very common and recently develloped way of thinking .
Nowadays , people tend to believe that all-included trips led by tour guides are the most inexpensive and pleasant way to travel .
According to my traveling experience as an '' aventurous '' backpacker , I will try to demonstrate in which extense , this unfortunatly too common way of thinking is very far from reality .

First of all , it is common sense that the less intermediates you pass by , the cheaper your trip is going to be .
Consequently , the number 1 rule for a cheap trip is to avoid travel agencies , especially on Internet , which practice abusive fees .
Dealing directly with airlines companies and hotels or hostels will always makes your trip cheaper since , this way you 're not going to have to pay any commision to anyone .
Regarding accomodation , you can reduce your budget to a very low price if you feel like staying in a hostel .
Contrary to what might be thought , many of them are very clean and really cheap .
It also has to be seen as an opportunity to meet , share and talk to foreign travelers from all over the world .
This is , in my opinion , way more enriching than staying with people with whom you share the same culture in regular three stars hotels , since you unescapably have way less to share .
Still in my opinion , the tour schedrule , and the unescapable uninteresting random touristic visits are the main reason why I 'm totaly against all included trips .
If you find yourself in a situation , or a place you do n't like , you 're obliged to handle it , and suffer in silence , waiting for your group to go back to the hotel .
As for the guide , he ' s totally optional since Lonely Planet exists .
