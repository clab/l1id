The actual word is a word of stress , activities , and business .
Most of current young people have activities and daly occupations , but I believe that amoung those young people some have time to help their community .

I realize that time is precieus and because of that I may be influence by that reason to say that I have no time for others , but it is not the case .
For example , I am involve in a student union and one of my duties is to bring some love around .

Also , there are differents ways to spreed this love .
For example , sheltering homeless people by providing them with food , clothes , and covers .
By that kind of of positive actions I get involve in the good of my communities .

Next , it is more ofen young people that organize car wash or parties to raise money for example to ameliorate their school , or environment of work .
this is a evidence that shows they are involve in what is happening around them .

Finally , even babysitting is a way to help your commmunity .
You help a familly , neighbours that are in difficulty by giving them your help .
So in that way you help around you mand you

In conclusion , by getting involve in my society I realize how it works , where are the issues , and try to solve them thanks to different kind of experiences .
I also believe that after have done something great , I feel better , proud about myslef because I have been busy but for something that will help around .
I am sure that a bunch of young will be agree with me because of the positive sens .
