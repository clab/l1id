Many people argue that it is best to do what they already know how to do well , and not take risks .
Personally , I strongly believe that successful people are those who constantly try new things and reach for the unknown .

In fact , as my middle school french teacher once told me , `` you learn from your mistakes '' .
I agree with her .
From my experience , I can tell that mistakes often help you to improve , because you remember them afterward .
Therefore , you know what you should n't do next time .
If you never try new things , though , how can you `` learn from your mistakes '' ?
You do n't improve , because `` improving '' implies that you are dealing with something new , and want to get better .

Also , I think that ambition is very important .
It makes learning exciting , and often contribute to your success .
If you keep doing the things you already know , it can get very boring !
For example , back in France , I played the piano .
After seven years , when felt like I had reached a really good level and did n't need a teacher anymore , I decided to play the cello as well .
I do not regret my decision .
To be able to play several instruments was very interesting and exciting !

Finally , I believe that taking risks is important because when you succeed , it gives you a lot of satisfaction and pride .
In fact , because you reached a new goal , you feel like a whole new person .
For example , I will always remember when my father told me that we would soon be moving from France to the United States .
At first , to be honest , I was very sad .
I did n't want to leave my friends and I was afraid of the unknown .
A few months after we had moved , I felt very different .
This experience has been great .
Now I know how to speak english , I made new friends ...
I even plan to attend college here in the U.S .
If my family had refused to emigrate because it meant taking risks , we would have missed the best experience of our lives .

In conclusion , I agree with those who say that `` successful people try new things and take risks '' .
Of course , when `` taking risks '' is too dangerous , I would not agree but in general , ambition is great .
