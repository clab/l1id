Life contains several ages ; childhood , adulesence and old age .
With the Science 's progress people are coming more and more older , and that changes a lot of society 's considerations .
Seeing and reading debates on magazines and television , It is a common way to say that old people are not interesting people .
Yougth is only nice and attractful .
To be old is an awful thing , that everyone has to hide , and not to speak of .

Yougth is the best way of thinking and of moving .
You have to think as a young people for beeing considered by people .
If you are old , you are not popular .

Such kind of thinking , such gathered point of view , engenders this statement ; young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Is this point of view relevant and effective .
Well , in fact it appears that this assessment is not true and depends of a lot of considerations .

The age is a spirit state .
People youg can be sad and unable to make project .
Otherwise older people can make project , for instance travelling , building a lot of projects for their future life , like buying a house , painting their house , and so on ...

To be young is a physical issue and a mental issue .
If you consider that you are 20 years old , you will be 20 years old , same if you are aged of 60 years old .

Everyone , what ever his age is , can enjoy life , more specially when you are retired .
You think that death is round and that gives you the wellingness of kissinf life , and doing everything you want .
Older people are richer than the younger one and can offer everything they want .

Younger people have n't got money for making everything they want .
So they can enjoy life only with their fnancial possibility .
Television , medias give this point of view that older people are unable to enjoy life as the younger one can .
It is a crticizes point of view .
Older people also can offer everything they want for enjoying life .
Everyone has to say that older people have the right to think that they are able to prepare a good life .

Media have to change their point of view , Everyone has not to give up this assessment and this consideration .

yOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE AS older people do .
But the wealth and the health are the main considerations for enjoying life
