It is a common opinion to think that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have the strength and the health .
Maybe this popular statement was true until fifty years ago but great shift occured and things have changed .
So , why can we argue that older people enjoy life as much as - or more than - young people ?

To answer to this horny issue , we will need in a first part to talk about the shift that occured in the way of life of the different generations and we will then discuss if young people enjoy life more than older people do .

In the fifties , we could say that young people had a better life than their ancestors .
Indeed , the older people often retired when they were quite old - often 65 years old - .
So they were very tired and did not enjoy the life .
Actually people died younger and they were often not very rich .
All the money was used to raise the numerous children of the family .
So , the older people spent their times complaining and suffering diseases .
But thngs have changed since the nineties .
Thanks to the technological and medical breakthrough , people can expect to live until they are 80 .
Difficult and dangerous works have mainly disappeared so people can retire with a very good health and many years to live .
Besides , thanks to the reduction of the sizes of the families , the older people have a lot of money to spend .

So , nowadays , the older people enjoy more life than young people in my opinion because they are strong and rich .
So they can do whatever they want and they profit !
They travel a lot , cares for their sons ' children - but with pleasure - , experience new technological activities , attend cultural events and even go back to school to accurate their knowledge .
However , it has become more and more dificult to be young .
Indeed , the lengths of degrees at the university have sharply increased and so did the price for the leases of an appartment .

In a nutshell I would say that the older people can afford to enjoy life more than young people because they have still a good health and live better thanks to the improvements realized in the field of medecine .
But money is not everything and the young people have a very strong advantage : they have still many good times to experience , they do not have to look backward .
