It is quite an important question .
I think it depends on the level of the studies .
Actually , if the student is a graduate student , it is quite different than if he is an undergraduate student .
In one hand , a broad knowledge of various subjects is important to aquire a good culture .
It allows the student to have interests in a lot of things .
Besides , if he does not know what he would like to do , it is a way for him , to hit various subjects upon , and why not , for what he will be passionate , or unless what he would do later .

In the other hand , to specialize in one more specific subject would be better for a student who knows for what he is interested , and who wants complete his knowledge , I mean , who wants aquire a deep knowledge .

This student could get bored by the others subjects .
Even though , I own up , it would be a way to allow him to find interest in other things .
Actually , as far I am concerned , I would rather praise for a progressive solution .
And I think that it is what it happens in the universities .
I mean , I suppose it is better to have a broad knowledge at first , in order to specialize in one specific subject after that .

This is why I told about the undergraduate and the graduate students .
An undergraduate student has a knowledge about various subject , unless a general knoledge , and when he become a graduate student , he can specialize .
It seems logical .
A graduate student needs the whole time to concentrate and stress his subject as better than he can .

Eventually we can also ask if the better was let the students choose .
Would it be possible imagine a personnal program which would match with the students plans ?
