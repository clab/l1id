When learning a specific subject in school , students are required not only to know the information regarding the subject but also to understand the concepts implied .
These two aspects are very differnt and require differnt abilities from students .
Though it is important to know the facts for a subject , it is more important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts in order to have a thourough understanding of the topic .

First of all , simply memorizing facts does not imply knowing the topic .
If a student does so , she is just regurgitating what she has read or heard which does n't mean she knows what she has learned .
On the other hand if a studen understands the concepts and ideas related to the topic , then he understands the implications as well as the uses of the topic .
For example in History , though it is often precieved as a subject which merely requires memorizing , a student needs to understand the concepts in order to full appreciate the subject .
Merely memorizing dates and occurences does not offer real insight as to why certain events occur and what effects these events could have on our present society .

Furthermore , understanding concepts as opposed to just learning facts allows a student to deal with any type of question .
A student that has only learned facts will be expecting questions that ask him to answer with the facts he has learned .
If a question deals with a deviation of these facts , then the student would not be able to adequatly ansewer the question .
A student on the other hand , who understands the concepts implied would be able to use her procces of induction and deduction to come to logical answer .
I , personaly , have come across such dilema in a physics test .
The question I found on the test , dealt with a concept that we had not read or discussed previously in class .
Fortunatly , I had a good understanding of the concepts and ideas involved wich allowed me to derive the appropriate formula that was required for the test .

Finally , understanding concepts and ideas , allows a student to retain the subject and topic for a longer time .
A student who memorizes facts is more likely to forget these once the test or examination is finished , so that the knowledge is thus not aquired .
For a student who does understand the concepts , though she may forget the facts in the future , but she will still be able to think the process logicaly and come to a conclusion that would be adequate .
