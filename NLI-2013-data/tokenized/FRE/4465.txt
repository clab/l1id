Obviously , it ca n't be denied that most advertisements try to insist on the qualities of the advertised product , and cautiously hides their dark side .
As a result , the consummers , who are the targets of the advertisement , may think that the qualities of the product are better than they are actually .

The very first reason supporting my point of view would be that i can barely imagine another goal for advertising than highlighting the qualities of the presented products .
And to do so , magnifying the greatness of your production is an appropriate way .
For instance , i can remember an advertisement for a washing powder which pretended to make your clothes ` whiter than whiter ' .
That may sound a little bit ridiculous , but that 's part of the deal as far as we talk about advertising .

Another reason explaining that behaviour can , most probably , be found in the growing competition on consumer-goods markets .
The marketing theory teaches us that if you want to overcome your opponents , you have to choose between two strategies : you can either improve your product , or you can advertise it in the proper way .
For some categories of products , only that last strategy is available : for example , as computers from various brands are all made with the same components , one of the only ways to distinguish yourself is to advertise your production properly .

But , on second thought , we may challenge our position in some ways as it is to be noticed that , on some occasions , advertisements does n't make products better than they are in real .

First , the law generally prohibit advertisements that would purely and merely lie about the properties of the good you sell .
This limitates greatly the possibilities for advertisement to make products better on screen than in real life .

Second , you ca n't exclude the possibility of having such a great product that it would be totally useless to exaggerate its faculties in an advertisement .

Finally , and that may sound paradoxical , some adverstisements seem to minimize the presented products .
The idea is to tease the consumer who is surprised because of such a strange message .
We can quote the example of the British car brand Bleinheim which present their luxury cars in a pretty poor way .
