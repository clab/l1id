Students go to the University to learn things which will make them more efficient in their job .
But is it more important for them to understand concepts than to learn facts ?

Understand a concept and/or an idea is very important in some subjects .
For example in chemistry understanding how a special reaction occurs can help researchers go further in research by inventing new molecules , find new or develop former reactions ( which were known to take place , but not knowing how it takes place ) .
Understanding an idea or a concept can make the student more efficient in his studies , researches , and in his future job .
Knowing how something occurs helps a lot in going further quicker .

Learning facts is also very usefull .
I take the same example of chemistry .
Some reactions are known but you ca n't explain how it works , so you have to learn it to go on .
Learning facts make you also more effecient , you do n't have to look every where for the answer to the problem asked .
If you want to use a known method to do each or each reaction , if you have learnt it before , you do n't have to look in the litterature everytime to do your reaction .

I think that both are very important for the students .
You need informations that are given to you by the lecturers and you have to learn and understand them .
Sometimes learning something can help you understand a point which was dark for you .
Learning things can make you also be brighter than you are already .
Sometimes you do n't have to understand something .
Learning things which can be useless to the students can be revealed later to be very important .
Learning gives you general culture .

In a sense I agree that for students it is more important to understand than to learn because once you have understood an idea you do n't have to learn it , and it make the students save some of time .
But your also have to learn .

In conclusion I would say that both learning and understanding are the keys which open the gates of the knowledge and of conciousness .
