I cannot say if there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today , because there are a lot of things to take into account to have an opinion .

On the one hand , there are more and more regulations about cars in big cities to avoid pollution and make inhabitants of towns feel better .
People want to be able to walk on the street without feeling oppressed by the cars there are around them , the noise they create and they want also to smell other things than petrol .

In addition , nobody knows whether there will be enough petrol in twenty years so that everybody can use one 's car as much as one uses it today .
If petrol becomes less and less available and , therefore , more and more expensive , people will have to find new solutions to move from one place to another .
I think it is totally possible because there are a lot of means of transport which waste much less petrol than cars .
For exemple , people could take the train or the bus , or even their bike .
The main problem is that they are used to driving their car at each time they need to go out from their home , so they do not think to take their bike instead , or to walk .
When driving will have become too expensive for the majority of people , one will learn to live without one 's car , and people will probably enjoy it .

On the other hand , the cars industry is still growing and brands are developping new models which are more comfortable , better designed and possess all the new technologies .
They want people to keep buying their new cars so I think that they are going to do their best to attract customers , especially if the trend confirms that people give up using their car .
