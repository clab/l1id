`` Where there is a will , there is a way '' , this may be the successful people 's favorite sentence , and may be the key of their success .

As a matter of fact it is by willingness that they have reached their goals , and having goals , dreams is already risky .
Sometimes to achieve one 's dream it implies that you will have to go further than your natural borders .
Success goes with risk , if you do not try to do anything , and then stay with what is securing for you , you will never be successful .

If you are already successful it will be easier for you to try plenty of new things , because you are sure of what you have already achieved .
We can take the example of the President of an international company , he is setting up numerous businesses in many different sectors ( such as Megastors , sodas , Aircrafts etc. ) , he knows what are his company competencies but he still is looking forward to create something new .
Even if one or two of his new start ups fail , he will have the others to secure his position .

However , I assume that they really know what they are doing , they are not planning things that they know , they will not be able to keep .
They do take risks or try new things , but they are also aware of what they can do , of what they know , and therefore , they are not risking so much in what they do .

Successful people certainly have a lot of confidence on what they can do , and in their qualities , thus they will be able to reach their own ambition in life at any price .
But they are smart enough to know when and where to stop , they may take more risks but these are known and controlled .
And perhaps this ambition gives them the interest in going always further .
