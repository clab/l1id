A lot of people specialize themseves in one specific subject at university and take corses in the same department in order to have degrees in a particular field .
We can wonder if it is good to have a specialized knowledge or a broad one .

Having a specialized knowledge on an academic subject could be great if it is in the view of being a researcher , a specialist or a technician in a certain field .
Moreover , it is easier to concentrate on one specific subject during studies and it is easier being more known because specialist of some subject are rare .
For example , it is rare to find a specialist in treatments water process and so some people who are could have more chances to find a job after graduation .

To the opposite , having an overview of sciences and some knowledge about religions and phylosophy is necessary in every day life and also because some fields could cross others .
For example , taking course about both politics and economics is better to understand the way a country goes .
It is also very important to discover things in order to know what it seems to be the more interesting and which correspond the most to a personnality .

According to me , the best is to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects at the beginning of the scholarship and to specialize at the end .
It is like that the American universities work and I think it is better than in France because people are too specialized .
In United States students must have credits from others departments they are studying in in order to have an awarness and a culture more important and so they can compare and choose a field in which they are interested in in order to specialize themselves after .
