In my opinion , understanding is the key to the educational process .
While teaching , a professor not only transmits his knowledge to students , but he also gives them the keys to comprehension .
The most important point is not what we learn , but how we learn .

For example , Education system deeply changed during past years .
If we take the time to ask our parents how was School when they were kids , we would probably be astonished by their answer .
Indeed , they were used to learn their lessons by heart , and this was a very mechanical exercise .
Sometimes they did not even know what they were talking about !
Education system realized its mistake , and changed its technique .

Nowadays , an important role is given to interaction .
Indeed , students have now the possibility to ask questions .
The answers they would get would help them in easily understanding the topic they are discussing .
As they get the meaning of an idea , a concept , they remember it in a better way .

Moreover , this interaction between students and professors allow them to show their interest in some topic .
They are not passively listening , they can bring their opinion , their ideas .
This can lead to new issues , and open their minds .
A concept can be spread from one to another , illustrating the very basis of development .

The thing not only about knowledge , moreover about reflexion .
School teaches the power of thinking by ourselves .
As the students understand ideas , they learn facts , whereas the opposite does not work .
