why do we have the appology of youth in our modern societies ?
To me it is clearly because life sounds better when you are yuong !

Of course some of you could say what we are eager of in our societies is apperence .
People would like to look young for ever !
Indeed getting old is difficult to assume not only moraly but also because your body is changing .
That is one reason why people like to be young .
But being good looking is not the only explanation why being young makes you more enjoy life .

Actually it is secondary in my opinion .
What is so joyful with being young is that you have every thing to built .
You are in a moment of your life where you can still chose to become anyone .
No regrets for the moment , no errors in your background .
When i think of my mother 's sister i feel sad for her .
She is a person very sour .
She tried all her life to become an actrice and never succeeded .

Whem you are young you can still be optimistc about your life because anything can hapend to you .
When you have nothing you have nothing to lose !
An other advantage with being young is that usually yo have n't got many reponsibility .
You have a selfish existance , the only person you have to take care of is your self .
Your not in charge of the education of a childe , you do not have to feed a family .
Life is less stressful .
You do n't have to compromise every day life to make everyone happy in your house .
Specially when you hinge up on your parents financially , you have even less worries .
I mention this situation because i am luky , that is my sitation .
But some young people have to endow their life alone of course .

An important point a really appreciate with being young is that socially there are not as much conventions than for adult .
Young people are more relax when they get in contact in professional as well as in social life .
the proof is more older you get less friends you have .
It is the case for my parents .
It mus n't be true for everyone but it is a general tendency i have noticed .

To sum up being young gives you a feeling of freedom
