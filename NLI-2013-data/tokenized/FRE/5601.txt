Nowadays , it 's hard to open a newspaper without seeing an ad which describes `` the most important object that you have to have '' But because of the repetition of this type of ads , some target groups suffer from saturation .
That 's why the real question is : Is it really important to buy this ?
does it really improve my way of life ?

In order to solve the problem efficiently , we have to consider some advantages ( I ) and disadvantages ( II ) of an innovative product .

First , in terms of advantages , we can say that a real innovative product such as the invention of trains can help people to move more faster and with a higher degree of security than before .
It can also help people to manage their time .
Indeed , when they travel by train , they can work or relax themselves .
But , a real innovative product is very rare .

Second , the greatest disadvantage of today 's innovative products is that some products are just updated with new technologies .
As I said before , real innovative products such as cars , trains and telephones are very rare .
So , I think it 's just a marketing process in order to increase sales and profits but it 's not crucial to have it .
You can buy it only if you want to satisfy your appetite of early adopter of fashion victim .

To put in a nutshell , you have to keep in mind that it 's all about marketing process that transforms desire in need .
You have to consider the real worth of the product before buying this because real innovative products are very rare .
It 's up to you but I think that today we have to imcrease our judgement ability in order to keep safe our personality .
That 's why I think that we have to be cautious in order not to buy everything .
