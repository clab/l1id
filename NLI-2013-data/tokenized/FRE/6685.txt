I do not really agree with this statement saying that in twenty years the number of cars would have decreased .
That does not mean that I object to the goal of reducing the number of cars in the world ; of course , this is a necessary evolution and industrialized and rich countries are currently trying to follow this path .
For instance , in Paris , the mayor tries for years to prevent people from taking their cars by making the circulation very difficult and by encouraging the creation of new bus lines .
He also promotes bikes , having created new roads that can only be used by them .

I consider all theses actions as positive actions : it shows that people are eventually aware of the urgency of a change in our attitude towards pollution .
We are responsible for the world we are leaving to the next generations and we can no longer live as we do now ( using so many resources ) .

But , what seems to contradicts this movement towards a decrease in cars in use , is the situation in developping countries : we can study the case of China .
As a matter of fact , China is getting more and more powerful and is now going through this period of industrialization that western countries already experienced a century ago .
A part of the Chinese population is getting richer and richer and can now afford cars .
So when a country of more than one billion inhabitants gets access to car markets , we can imagine that in the years to come , the number of cars is not really going to dwindle .
But what can we say ?
Can we deny them the right to get a car ?
to consume after years of being deprived and seeing how it was in western countries ?
After all , we did the same before , as we were not concerned about the environmental issue ...

In conclusion , I would say that it is a really difficult question to forsee whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
But it is a tendency that we have to further , especially in poorer countries , by explaining how necessary it is and maybe helping them financially to build public infrastructures that could replace the use of cars .
