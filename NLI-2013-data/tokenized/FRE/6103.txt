In the recent years , the number of cars has grown up to a level that was never reached before .
Nowadays , the traffic problems are getting more and more serious .
The question of reducing the number of cars will be one of the most preoccupying matter of concern .
There are the arguments that sustain my opinion .

First of all , since the number of cars has ben growing up fastly , the society have to face with a major problem : how to regulate the trafic and to deal with the queues that happen every day on major highways and in major cities .
It is now getting more and more difficult to circulate at the rush hours .
If the number of cars still grow like it does nowaday , the risq to face total blocking of the circulation will be real .

Another argument is that the oil and gas reserves are getting rarer everyday .
As a long term consequence , their price will increase in a huge proportion .
Scientifics know the problem very well even if they do not know when the reserves will be over .
If we ca n't find a substitution energy , we 'll have to change our habits .
One of the consequence is that we 'll have to live in areas close to our job or to choose for another medium of communication .
Both of those situations will lead to a decrease of the number of cars used by the citizens .

Last but not least , using the car is one of the global warming 's major causes .
The consequences of the phenomenon will be desastrous for the future generations , such as the increase of the level of the ocean , climate 's changes , ...
I think people are getting more and more aware of this concern .
Sensibilisation will make people change their own mind and consider to choose for new media of communication , such as bike , rollers , ...

In any cases , i think that , according to those arguments , there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .
