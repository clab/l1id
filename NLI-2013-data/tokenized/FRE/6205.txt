The issue that in twenty years the number of cars in use will raise or drop is difficult to deal with because there are different arguments involved .
Some people think that there will be fewer cars because of the environmental impact in wich the use of cars is sued .
On the contrary the increase of the number of cars in use can be partly justified because the number of inhabitants on earth is still raising very fast .

Most importantly , rejecting CO2 cars are responsible in a wide proportion for the atmosphere pollution .
Every body knows the consequences of a high grade of CO2 in the atmosphere ; warmer temperature , climate changes and so on .
So most of the governments , acting for the well being of its citizens , are writing new laws and inventing new solutions tending to reduce the use of cars .
For instance , in paris , during the summer , only the pair or unpair patterns number are allowed to circulate .

Secondly , we can stress the lack of petroleum or gas resources today , and the raise of pump prices .
As cars are big users of petrol , their utilisation involve that car owners have the financial power to pay it .
As the resources are not eternal and prices are getting higher and higher , it seems as an evidence that the number of users will decrease in the next twenty years .

Another important argument would be that the automotive industry is very big enrgy consumer .
Indeed , to make a car requires lots of products such as platsics or iron wich consumes a lot of energy to get in available form .
Then the assembly chains , mostly composed by automatic machines consumes also a lot of energy .
So , in the next years , governments will probably realise that providing very efficent popular transports would have a good impact on the country energy consumption .

To conclude , my strong belief is that even if the populattion is growing all around the world , the trend of environmental legislations in the prevalent car using countries will be to decrease the production and the traffic of this type of vehicles in the next twenty years .
