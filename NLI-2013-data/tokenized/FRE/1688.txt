First of all i think that both knowledge , specific knowledge or many knowledge have both advantages and disavantages .
When you specialize yourself in a specific subject you can study every single aspect of this subject and you will be very consatrated in it .
For example when somone wants to study business in college and he knows that he wants to specialize his studies in marketing , it would be better for him to start directly with marketing studies so he would learn every thing about it in specific ways .

When you study many subjects you might be lost and you will have a lot of information going true your head wich could be a bad thing .
You might then find yourself lost in what you want to do .

For example when somebody wants to study business in college but he does n't wich major he wants to do , it 's better for him to study 2 years of general business wich means to study every subject of business like marketing , advertising , finance , international business , etc ..

Actually i find my self in this situation right now , i 'm doing my last year of school and i 'm going next year to college and i would like to study business but i love Finance .
I decided to study 2 years of business in college where i could learn extra subjects and then i would specialize my self in finance .
This way i would have learn other subjects then finance .

In conclusion i think that broad knowledge of many academic subjects and broad knowledge of a specific subject have both positive and negative points .
A person should decide in the best way wheter he wants to study a specific subject of a lot of them .
