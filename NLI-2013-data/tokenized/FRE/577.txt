A lot of people would like to know about severals subjects instead of beeing specialized in one specific subject .
But I definitively prefer to be specialized in one very specific subject .
In fact , I 'm studying in civil ingeneering and environment in a school which is one of the only one to have that dual degree .
And some friends older than me who are already working in some compagnies told me that the school is very liked by compagnies for beeing very professional and having good students with a very good knowledge in civil engeneering .
That 's why we have no difficulties to find a job at the end of schooling .
More over if a person knows a lot about one subject , she can become in expert in that subject .

On other example : if a person is specialized in a very very specific subject she may earn a lot of money because if she is the only one to have that knowledge , compagnies will pay a lot to hire him before the concurrency .

On the other hand I admit that I would have liked to have a broad knowledge of many academics because some compagnies like to have employees who can work at very differents jobs .
for instance a lot of compagnies like to have people with a knowledge in management because that kind of people can lead a team and make the work be more efficient .

So to conclude I will say that both cases have their advantages and their drawbacks , and everyone wo n't have the same opinion about it , but my case is n't bad and thanks to that I wo n't have too many problems to find a job I like .
So I prefer to specialize in one specific subject than have a whole knowledge on severals academics .
Howerver my sister is the opposite , and she is doing very well too .

So you can have a good job and have a good carrer in both cases .
