Nowadays many people travel in groups , led by a tour guide .
I think this is not the best way to travel , and I try to avoid these organised holidays .
Since I 've been young , I have travelled very much with my family , and we have never been in a group .
This has made ties between us stronger , and it gives us the oportunity to spend time together , which is usually hard during school time .
If we had traveled with a group , we might not have had so much good time together .
One that bothers me about traveling in a group is that you are always with strangers that , even if they can be very nice people , are not close to you .
Moreover there can be people in the group who try to impose themselves as the `` leaders '' , organizing everything .
You then loose part of your autonomy and end up angry at them , and at yourself , for having accepted to travel with other people .
Moreover , my family holidays have always been organized by my mother , so we could choose what we wanted to see and how much time we thought we should spend in each place .
The memories we have of our trips are therefore very personal and , in my opinion , more satisfying than those of people who have to follow a tour guide because ours are unique .

Moreover , each time I see a travel group I get the impression that their trip is a mear product , that is sold to them and that has no personal content .
If they compare their holidays to those of other people in travel groups they will realise that they visited the same monuments and heard the same explanations from the tour guide .
We can also add that these organized trips leave no space for adventure .
For instance , one of my friends traveled to Cambodia with her family and had a serie of accidents due to bad weather .
Even if at first they were nervous because their trip had to be changed , they ended up having a lot of fun , doing things such as riding motor cycles on secondary roads , that they had not planned the least bit !
If this happens to a group , the agency in charge can not let them take these `` risks '' .
