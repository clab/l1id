Some say that life is a long long and endless road until it reaches death .
Therefore , life does n't only end when one gets old .
People usually think that old people are boring and lifeless because of their weakness and lack of physical action .
However , older people tend to develop their mental inteligence and imagination .
tha't why most of the philosophers and mathematicians reach a peak a their carreer when they are old .

As a consequence , they do enjoy life by using their mental powers in order to succeed in different fields , or by writting and thinking about life in general .
But do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
I personally do not think it is the case .
Young people tend to look at life in a more material way , playing in parks , having a girlfriend , practising sports , therefore , they do not appreciate the deep meaning of why they are living .
It is mainly due to the lack of culture and experience .
By growing up they will develop their sense of observing things and therefore , trully appreciate the meaning of the life they are living .

I saw once a film by a canadian director ( Denys Arcand ) named `` the barbaric invasions '' that talks about all of the barbaric invasions that come to meet us in life .
The main caracter , an old man , looks past his life : the different books he read , the different women he slept with ..
therefore , becomes furious of not being able to enjoy the things he used to do when he was young , he finally decides to commit suicide .
This if a good example to show that there are old people that do not enjoy themselves , and to support the idea that the peak of a lifetime is when being young .

I think that every person can enjoy life to the fullest , whether young or old , by doing the things he enjoys doing the most .
That is when he can reach a mental satisfaction , by dedicating himself to the true meaning of life that is to enjoy life .
