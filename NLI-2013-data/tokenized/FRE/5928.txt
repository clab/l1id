Today , the car industry is at a decisive turn in its history .
While the population in urban areas keeps growing , and there are more and more people that need transportation in their everyday life , the industry is facing both economic and environmental challenges : how will it take up these challenges ?
Will the world become a place saturated by cars , and totally polluted by car gas emissions ?

The car industry has enjoyed a tremendous growth since the Post War period .
It developped at a fast pace , and many industrialized countries adopted the individual car as the answer to meet the rising need of citizens for transportation .
During the last half century , cars have spreaded everywhere in the world , becoming the number one way for people to move .
The example of the US society is relevant to show how car is playing a major part not only from a practical point of view , but also on a symbolic level , as the first individual cars were the Ford T and this technological advance contributed greatly to develop the US influence all over the world .

However today , regarding the economic context and the environmental situation of the planet , I think it is high time we think about what I would call the `` Post Car Era '' .
Indeed , the whole car industry success lies on the fact that people have easy access to affordable fuel , a fact which is today increasingly questionned regarding the political situation in many oil-producing countries .
Besides , today people seem to be more aware of the dramatic ecological impact cars have on the environment .
I often reflect upon what would next generations think of our irresponsible behaviour , because although we know it is a suicide on the long run , we keep using individual cars even when it could be replaced by environment-friendly means of transport .

Anyway , I am confident and I think that soon there should be major changes in our daily habits regarding the use of cars , which should lead to a sharp decrease of their number .
But I know it will take time , and I think such goal cannot be reached without a prior global reflexion on what we , as human beeings , are currently doing to the planet we live on , and on what the alternatives to the massive use of individual cars are .
What is at stake , the future of the planet , is far too important to be overlooked .
