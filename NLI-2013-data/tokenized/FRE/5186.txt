Nowadays we can watch at television a great deal of advertisements for a lot of products .
Consequently , we can wonder whether the products we see at television are really good or not .
I totally disagree with advertisements because they turn people to be stupid .
Most people buy products only because they have seen them at television and think that they are good .
Most of time the products are not really so good .
For example , there are a lot of advertisements for food whereas everybody knows that these products are very bad for one 's health .
That is why I think that advertisement is really a con and is here only to attract naive people and so that businessmen might make a lot of money on those poor people .
Moreover , in my opinion most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Western countries are living under the reign of money .
Money attracts money , that is capitalism and this is one of the reasons why advertisement exists .
In the other hand , food scandals are more or less the consequences of advertised products .
For example , I can quote the foot and mouse disease or the mad cow 's disease .
It can also be added that because of the bad quality of certain products , some unscrupulous people dare to send these '' rubbish '' to lower developped countries and it is a shame
