What successful people has in common ?
How do they reach this success ?
It is probably a more complex question that it seems .
Some people are sure to meet their goal and to be successfull by taking risks and attempting new things .
Yet others are just trying to become the best in one well-known field and do not dare to go through new experiences .

At issue is how to meet your assignments and reach success .
To the most daring people , every experience is good to try .
That is true that an attempt does not do any harm .
And even if your experience does not appear as good as you expected , you still learn a lot .
Most experience does worth a try .
For instance , if you want to become a good cooker , you should try new receipes .
To learn how to cook , you need to invent new receipes and not only to follow others advices .

However , some people prefer to adopt a less risky behaviour .
They are going to reach their goal by following , pace by pace , others advice .
Some artisans seem to match this description .
They want a comprehensive view of their own field and they are going to explore what does already exist .
It is a different approach but they are likely to reach success .
Their knowledge need patience and long lasting research .
For instance , in order to know how to work wood m , you could explore different civilisations and cultures .
You will certainly discover a great amount of interesting details which are going to be a great help in your next work .

I found that I ca n't align myself on either behaviour .
Most of the time , I adopt both attitude to meet my assignments .
In order to be successfull , both taking risk and following the well-known path is usefull and effective .
