It is commonplace to criticize our educational system .
Many scholars pretend that the current learning organization in our colleges is too theoretical and it has to be more pragmatic .
Others assert the contrary .
The issue of the importance of conceiving ideas and concepts is a controversial one .
I totally agree with this fact and there are several reasons of that .
Firstly , students have to go to school in order to learn theories .
Secondly , everybody has to improve his or her analytical skills for the rest of his or her life .
Thirdly , reflexion enacts better in order to solve a problem .

First , the main purpose of the school system is to prepare the young people for the adult life .
In fact , students firstly have to learn a lot of things in vast fields .
It could be quite impossible to learn without books or explanations done by a teacher .
Having a good introduction about a new grammar rule can help the student to figure out how this rule can be use in the current life .

Second , schools have to learn how to analyze subjects .
Only a performing educational organization can transfer knowledges with analytical techniques .
It is very important for students to have the good tools in order to learn perfectly .
In fact , the conceptualization of an issue permits to understand the reality .
For example , when someone is becoming sick , a doctor has to have an overview of all symptoms ( facts ) , but he also needs to understand the concept of the illness : only his analytical skills can help him .

Third , before acting , thinking .
This issue is crucial , but everybody can understand the value of these words .
Learning contributes to help us in our decision/making process .
For instance , you have to understand the ideas , before you decide to do something or not .
Driving is the best example , if you do n't want to crash everytime .

In conclusion , I completely agree with the issue of learning concepts and ideas .
Having a good theoretical background , improving his or her analitycal skills and thinking before acting are the best reasons in my point of view .
