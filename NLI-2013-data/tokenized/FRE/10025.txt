Nowadays , risk is a part of our everyday life .
While some peolple are more likely to take risks , other are just ready to practice what they already know .
But , i noticed that people who try new things and take risks are most successful .

in fact , risk is a component of success .
Usually , there is `` no success without risks '' .
People who take risks are always innovating and thinking about new project and new strategies of success .
For example , if my field of study is biology , i have more knowlegde and experiences in biology than in any other field .
But I decide to invest my money in a coffe shop , which is purely business .
That is a huge risk because , obviously i do n't have any specific knowlegde and experience on how to run a coffe shop .
Now , because I want my business to succeed , i will hire a specialist in coffee business to guide me and help me run my business .
By working day after day with the specialist , i will learn how to run the business by myself .
However , taking risks can turn into a bad decision sometimes .
for example , i can take a risk and not succeed right away .
But the failure is a good experience because i 'm learning from it and the next step will surely be better .

In conclusion , i think that taking risks is a good decision in most of situations .
By taking risks , we innovate , anticipate and we are more likely to move forward in our life .
