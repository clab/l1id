It is a common thought that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
This is no surprise when we think about how good it can make someone look in a cocktail party or in a fancy dinner .
Indeed , who does not admire people who know about varied subjects ?
But can we say that having specialized knowledge is not as worthy as knowing a little bit about a lot of things ?

I think that society does need specialists , that is people with highly specialized skills and knowledge .
Indeed , some professions require high accuracy in knowledge .
For example , a surgeon is generally specialized in a part of the body , as brain surgeons are .
In my opinion , that is due to the fact that people concentrating on a subject learn a lot more about it than people learning a little bit about everything and who just cannot find the time to go further in each field .
Other professions , such as teaching , engineering or accounting , need specialized knowledge , which is restricted to a field or few fields , but that is very thorough .
That is why I really think you cannot say that specialists are unworthy compared to people who know less but about more fields .

I also think that society needs generalists , or people who can cover a lot of fields , because they possess knowledge from a vast range of subjects .
In fact , I believe that those people have to work hand in hand with generalists : they can either assist them ( as a secretary would do with a doctor , for example ) or they can manage them ( as a chief executive would manage a staff of engineers ) .
Indeed , as these people master knowledge about varied subjects , they can deal with the details of specialists ' work , such as classifying patients ' files or financing engineers ' projects .

That is why I do not think it is fair to assert that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject : to my mind , both specialists and generalists people are necessary in the society , and extensive knowledge of a precise topic can be as helpful as more restricted knowledge in more fields .
