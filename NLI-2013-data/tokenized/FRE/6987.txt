The car has rapidly become the main way of transport for active citizens in the 20th century .
Still , some say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use then there are today .
Of course there are many arguments that support this statement but there are also arguments that refute it .

In effect , the car industry is in no way slowing down it 's production .
On the contrary , news cars appear on the market all the time .
Most car companies are aware of the new restrictions for car owners and these new models work around them .
For example , when faced with the mounting parking problem , a company issued the Smart , whose size permitted the owners to park easily .
Other models use less gas thus working around the pollution problem .

However the arguments in favour of this statements hold more weight .
One of the many reasons the number of cars will go down is that right now , even with small cars , it is too hard to park your car in cities .
Parking is becoming an issue with commuters as it is also a waste of time that many could do without .

Also because of environment issues such as pollution , many governments encourage public transportation such as the train or buses .
In Paris , the mayor has rendered certain parts of the city difficult to access by car .
The bus service is becoming more adapted to the needs of the citizens ' needs such as comfort and availability .
To make trips faster , the street is divided into corridors , one for buses and one for cars .
Of cours there are still many cars so now car owners are faced with monstrous traffic jams while bus users just whiz by .

The metro system covers most parts of the city so many resort to the subway as means of transport .
If I wish to cross Paris rapidly , I know that it is faster to take the subway than to take a car .

Even though a car provides comfort that public transportation lacks and is also easier to use for your schedule the cons are largely outnumbering the pros and with the awareness of all the trouble the environment is having , many are rethinking their frequent car use .

I believe that in twenty years there will indeed be less cars is use , as they will be reserved for long trips or transportation in rural areas .
