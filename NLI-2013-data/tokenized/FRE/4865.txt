I have always believed that all advertisements make products seem more efficient than they really are .

According to my own experience and to other people 's stories , I can tell that there are some relatively huge exagerations and ornamented descriptions .

One of the points that I totally disagree with is when they show us two different situations or images .
In the first one , there is something to be done and it has to be the use of the adverised product .
In the second , they show a different picture with a perfect result , which is not realistic .
In fact , it 's just a simulation that does n't garantee in any way such a result .
I remember once , my brother saw the commercial on TV about the best selling product to treat acne .
They made everyone believe the stories told by some different people who , acording to them used the product and had amazing results in a limited number of days .
What proves that the person who had the face covered with acne before and who has a perfect skin looking now , had used the product ?

On the other hand , it 's obvious that the seller 's purpose from this advertisement is to persuade people and encourage them to purchase the product .
Thereof they make it sound nice and matching the client 's needs .

It is also clear that competition is among the major reasons that pushes the seller to make the public compare their products to their competitors ' .
This leads most of the time to an over-description of the item .
For instance , many commercials show us the efficiency of detergents by washing the same dirty clothes using the advertised product and another detergent of a different or unknown brand .
Then , they show us the result , with a distinct difference .

After seeing the advertisements , I have personally bought a car that was supposed to be gas-efficient , a cream to eliminate acne and pills to lose weight .
However , there is some truthiness missing .

I do n't exclude the efficiency of all the advertised products , yet most of them are to a different extent over-rated .
