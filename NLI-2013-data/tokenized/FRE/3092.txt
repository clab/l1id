If the youth new and if the youth is an old thought which has always been used to question the issue of this essaz .
This is a controversery issue .
Indeed how could life be characterized to enable us to affirm that young people more enjoy it than older do .
Considering the interresse , expectations in life , culture and financial abilities , one would agree or not .

Indeed about young people , although they have the physical power and the strenght to try everything and to make new experiences , they can travel all over the world , are able to lern many things and plan for a tomorow , they still have a lot all misadventures coming and are rarelly realy fit to accept some realities and therefore go through deceptions bad sides of life .

Older people have gone through or have had the opportunity of going through everything live had offered to them , have made their choices and now can look over their shoulders and smile or not .
In any case , for them the action part of the life belongs to history and they can enjoy other features of the life they have .

Rich people from reach family have a defined way and they don t need to burder for what they have to achieve .
Still their youth is uncertain because everything changes and they also lack of everlasting certainity .

I believe One can only really enjoy when the work is done and although life can be exiting and pleasant some time , everybody always get up in the morning and start again to built up .
Everydaz enjozment helps us to get over but the real enjoyement is that of the older who know how thez have have done .
