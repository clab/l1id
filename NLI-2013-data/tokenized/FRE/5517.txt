In the industralized world , it is a common practice to advertise different products in order to generate as much profit as possible .
This method is used in different ways like television , internet , newspapers and magazines .
A close look at these advertisements will unveil the negative effect that they have on the consumer .

As a matter of fact , most advertisements are based on profit making .
The products are shown by their advertisors as the ultimate solution for a problem .
For example , a detergent company may resort to showing the negative effects of using another material and suggest the use of their product .
This logic is not based on a scientific approach .
It stems from a an irrational and inhuman desire in profit .
To make things worse , some companies would not even advertise the real product .
Instead , they only display a sample and sell a completely different type of product later .
Therefore , this method pushes customers to be more aware of advertisements .

Another factor that explains why products are not shown as they actually appear in reality is the ineffectiveness of the product itself .
For instance , in the car industry , any advertisement of any car will ensure the buyer of the reliable vehicle , but reports made by different consumer agencies have shown the misleading ways that the advertisement relies upon .
The company , for example , will not stress the importance of the engine , but they will show the luxurious interior of the car .
As a result , consumers are trapped between what 's real and what 's not .
A lot of people lose their money because of what they saw on television and a lot of warnings of those misleading ads have been shown .
Also several courts legal agencies hve long debated whether companies should not lie in those promotional messages that they support .

To conclude , consumers should not take advertisements as they are .
A more rational approach to propaganda should be adopted .
I consider much of the advertising companies an obstacle in face of the true human progress .
