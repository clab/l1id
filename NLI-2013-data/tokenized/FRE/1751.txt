I think that we all need to have a minimum knowledge of many academic subjects but we have to specialize in one specific subject .
During the childhood , we all studied mathematics but also skills on language or history .
And we all agree that it is essential for everybody to know some things on many academic subjects , because it is usefull all day long .
You use mathematics when you are going out shopping , you have to know a bite of history if you want to understand what is happening on the political news , and you must know how to read in today world .

But if you want to succeed in your work , you have to be the best or at least one of the best in the subject that you are dealing with .
Because today 's world is done of concurrence and nobody will help you if you do not succeed .
So you have to train a lot and become the best in what you want to deal with in your life .
Look at a sportif .
Is Tiger Woods practicing other sports than golf ?
Maybe sometimes but he is really focused on golf and he is really specialized on his subject .
If he had done during his childhood many differents sports he may not be the world number one at golf today .

But culture is also essential and culture is about everything .
The definition in french of a ` gentilhomme ' is somebody who knows many things on many subjects and who does not have a passion .
If someone can speaks on many different subjects it will be someone looked like an intelligent guy .

Thus if you want to succeed in your social life you must have broad knoledge of many academic subjects but if you want to succeed in your work and earn a lot of money you then must to specialize in one specific subject and become the best on that subject
