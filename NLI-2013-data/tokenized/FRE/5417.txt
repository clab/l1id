Advertisement is the best way to realise the existence of some products , but some advertisements allow consumers to appreciate the products , unfotunately it is not all the time proved .
First how can i know that something exists if someone does not show me or tell me its existence .
Unfornately , the advertisemenrs oblige the consumers to buy and consume sometime what does not really good .
For instance two years ago in national television network they made an advertisement about pesticides which were supposed to kille some insects which were destroying crops in the eastern part of our country unfortunately some farmres died Advertisement is good when really they say the thruth about the products ; for instance our factories fabricate good chocolate and it is appreciate by many people ; tourists , students , workers , and other foreigners .
Thanks to the thrue advertisement , there is no complain .

Finally , a product can never be known by the population if there is no advertisements To avoid what happened to my country , governmeent to take all the necessary precaution to protect consumers and government should encourage population to set up many consumers associations in order to revendicate when it is necessary .
