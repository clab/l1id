From my point of view , i would say traveling alone is the best way can go and have fun an dnot worry about anything else .
traveling alone means , someone is able to go at there own pace , not worry about others , have a good time , meet others and have an alone time .
Traveling alone is more relaxing , you have no stress , no on etells you what to do .
It 's also a great experience .
you learn on your own , it 's always good to have acknowledge other things .

If you were to travel with a group led by a tour guide , it would probably not be a good idea , from my personal expereinces .
i was to go once with my Class to a city called Jacmel in Port - au - Prince Haiti led by a tour guide .
everyone wanted to do something different .
People were getting aggrevated at the tour guide , because she was n't listening to what we wanted to do .
But her job was to show us around , but she was talking more then showing .
It was n't a great expereince .
although , we actually did have a good time together my friends and I , because we were togther an das a class trip that 's what we wanted .
fro all the class to go somewhere and saty together .
Our goal was accomplished .

From my own experiences , i disagree with the statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
Maybe if I were to travel in a group it would have been different then with a tour guide , because you are to do what a tour guide does .
And personally , i usually hate when someone tells me to do something , i get vexed .
Traveling alone is a better idea , because of many reasons .
When traveling alone , you do n't have any responsibilities , but only yourself , which is a huge burden of a shoulder .
Experiencing , visiting , learning alone is great , no one bothers you and you do n't get annoyed , and I belive that is a great way to travel , with no stress , it 's all about having a good time , relaxing and having no worries .
