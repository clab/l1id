Nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree with this statement .
I will argue my viewpoint by giving example and explained the importance of the community .

It true that not all the young now dont give enough time for their communities but other youngs have a particular devotion for their communities .
For my view , the a large number of youngs are individuals .
Nowadays peoples in general and youngs particularly focus on individual success .
for example life go fast and has become very difficult that youngs have to work hard .
There are only face to new individual challenge in order to satisfy their need and there familly .
For example me , I know that I could help my communities with my academic experience , but it more important for me to find a job , to work hard to keep my job , to be married , to have a children and to take care of them .
It only after that , that I will think about how to help my community .

Therefore It very important to think about the community .
The question is how to help my community ?
By giving my viewpoint on some importante subject , contribute for school bulding , by undertaking research project in order to develop my community etc .
So I would like to advise young to pay attention for the community , even if there not interested to participate for the development there are to take care by not destroying what the community has built .

I would also like old people to understand the young because now life if more difficult than before to focus on many thinks at the same time .
