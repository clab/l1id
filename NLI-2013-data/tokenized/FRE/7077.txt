The future has always interested human beings , as well as technologies .
We happen to wonder about several topics , like guessing if there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today or not .

We could agree with this statement and think that there will be other ways to move around in the future , but we are not sure of anything for now .
This is the reason why I believe in cars rather than in future technoligies , such as flying ships or so .

We can evoquate the presence of the train and the plane , which have a rather good success among people nowadays than in the past .
This would be a good point , because people take them a lot more than ever .
This is due especially to their efficiency and safety .
They are faster than a car and safer , for example .
Some of us might prefer to travel by train or by plane since we do not have to drive or to focus on what is going on , and that we can fit a lot more people in these means of transportations .
However , it is rare to arrive exactly where we want to by train or plane .
That is , we will still rely on someone to come pick us up at the train station or at the airport .

To my mind , I do not think that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
Indeed , people are buying more and more cars , as in the United States .
Other countries are beginning to do the same .
Everytime we need to go somewhere , it is becomimg automatic : we take the car .
This is faster and easier for un since we do not have to walk or do some physical activity .
Human beings are becoming dependant on their cars .
This is another reason why I think there will be more cars in use in twenty years .

In conclusion , I do not agree with the statement given , but in the pursue of the car industry .
The car has become a part of humans ' lives ( for most of us ) , therefore I believe it still has good days to come .
