I agree with the statement according to which most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .
I have often made the experience of disappointment in front of a real item that I had only seen on a television screen or on a billboard .
And for sure , I am not the only one to come to the conclusion that advertisement is just about misrepresentation .
Every day , one has the occasion to see , for example , a poster that presents the wonderful characteristics of some new beauty cream and the terrific effects it will have on the reduction of lines and dark circles .
The fact is that the efficiency of such potions have never thoroughly been proved , and that their using has never prevented anyone from reading the traces of time on the face of an old woman .

But nowadays , advertisement is a necessary evil in consumer societies .
Indeed , the goal of producers is to sell more and more every day .
Advertisers are hired to achieve this goal .
They try to present the product so as to create a desire , even a longing for it , so that people buy it as soon as they can .
They repeat the operation in order to accelerate the process , and to earn more money .

Advertisement , then , necessarily uses spectacular words and emphatic images to make people dream .
Advertisement , for some people , only sell dreams .
Hence the habitual disappointment when consumer face products as they really are .

Advertisement then is often a legal issue .
The problem consists in knowing if the advertisement is mere puff and blow , or if it really corrisponds to a visaul form of contract .
If such was the case , the advertiser would maybe be liable for making a fraudulent misrepresentation , and one could clame for damages .
