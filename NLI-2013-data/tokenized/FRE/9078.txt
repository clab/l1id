Nowadays , some people think that it is more important to understand ideas and conceps than it is to learn facts .
As far as I am concerned , I think it should be better to learn facts especially for students .
In the following lines , I will developp my point of view .

Firstly , ideas and conceps are not always true .
They can often be based for example on myth or on rumors .
In that way , if students fixe on an idea or a concept that is not true their education may not be right .

That is it is important for students to learn facts .
Because by learning facts , they can discovering by themself that what they are learning is true .
They will first start by a statement or a situation , analyse it and find why it is in that way .

Secondly , learning facts is more adapted in an academic environment .
Thirdly , learning in facts provide more informations to students than learning ideas or concepts .
For example , a concept is something that is already stated and your professor would only explain it to you .

But if you learn facts , you will have certainly informatins from your professor but also you will get your own new informations due to your discoveries .

To conclude , I can assert that learning facts in better for students than learning ideas or concepts because it provides more advantages to students .
