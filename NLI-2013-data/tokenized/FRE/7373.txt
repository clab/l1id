I strongly agree with the statement saying that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I have two reasons for this .

First of all , travelling in group is far more exciting than travelling alone which may be quite boring .
Moreover , experients showed that people are more excited to go see new places when they travel in group than when they travel alone just as the experiment that show that peolple eat more when they eat in group .
One member of the group can motivate the curiosity of others and vice versa .

The second reason why I have this opinion is that when you travel , of course , you want to know and see new places , but where are you going to see those new places if you do not have someone to guide you .
Of course , you can use a map but how useful will be the map to you when you want to see as many places as you can see ?
Instead of spending time reading a map you would be on your way to see a very exciting geyser , for exanple .
Furthermore , there may be a language barrier .
if you travel alone , even though you could hire a guide , but where are you going to find him or her and how good will that person be in guiding your through the cities and places you want to know ?

In my opinion travelling in group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel because it brings you all what you need during a trip in just one place .
In other words you have everything at your armreach .
