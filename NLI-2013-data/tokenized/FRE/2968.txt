What seems to be obvious for the writer of the statement above is not for me .
Widely , I would say that the issue is centered about what anybody consider '' enjoy life '' .
In a short essay , I will try to show in a first part what are the reasons for young people to enjoy life , and in a second part , those alloted to older people .

On the one hand , I clearly agree that young people enjoy life .
Indeed , it is a period in one 's life where every day is an occasion of new things .
Meet new people , begin new activities , study topics very different , discover new cultures are some different things that a young age allow to do .
Moreover , it is sayed that young people are very open-minded , and it is another reason for why they could enjoy life very deeply .

On the other hand , I think we cannot state that elderly people enjoy life less than young people .
Actually , most of workers have waited all their life long the retirement in order to enjoy life again !
Whereas an old age does not allow them to do all what they did younger , old people take into account their differents ability for life in order to enjoy the current time .

To brief in , we can say that whatever the way to enjoy life , young people and old people have got all the faculties to appreciate what they are living .
For the one , it could be the fact that everything new is a great thing , and for the others , '' life is like a quite flood '' ...
