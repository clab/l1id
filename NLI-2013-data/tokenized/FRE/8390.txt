Most people usually tend to tell the facts without having explained the ideas and the concepts .
This would have a worst impact on students .
I think it is wrongly done and it would be a lot more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it would be for them to learn the facts .
It is so for many reasons : less geniuses in the world , a non evolution of the world and the promotion of a non democratic system .

By learning facts , the students will never gain a lot .
They do not really understand , they will certainly know what they are said , will memorize it , but will never understand why is that , making them foolishes or machines with no brain .
It would even be harder for him to memorize the facts .
But on the other hand , if he understands the ideas and the concepts , he would be able to get to the facts on his own , without having to memrize them , perfectly knowing what is going on .
Understanding these concepts and ideas , the student works his brain and can even think of something new and way better .
This is how the world grows and expands and the evolution goes .
The student will also learn how to work on his own , express hiself , his opinions and contribute to the development of a stronger and powerful society .
If they just learn the facts , it means that only one or a few persons will know the reasons , giving him or them the entire power over the others , the ability to make decisions as he wants , even if they are wrong or should not be done .

I strongly agree with those who think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts .
We will build a more effective world that way , and promote the world solidarity .
