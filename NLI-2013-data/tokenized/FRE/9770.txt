How to be a creative person ?
It is really tough to answer to it since everybody knows that the result of any creation has to be appreciated and approuved by other peolpe .
Therefore , it does not only depends on our personal feeling .
Well , it is not a good raison of evoiding to try new things instead of keeping doing well what we already know how to do .
In the following paragraph , I am going to give illustrate and give arguments according to my point of view .

With the evolution of new technology and the growth of the global market , competitions between people and other entities are increasing .
Hence the need of releasing new things in order to remain in fashion or be more competitive .
All this can happen only by trying new things .
What the domain of competency , you would need to put in place new attractive things .
As illustration , let 's talk about cellphones .
Mobile phones companies allways release new type of device , and this just because they have try new technology instead of doing or trading the same model .
Futhermore , if go back in the past , we will realize that all discoveries made by scientists , physicians , biologists and so on , have been possible because they haved tryed new things , new concepts , new experiences .
All can see the result today : we hace electricity , cars , aircrafts , tablets and medecins , water and so on .
All that make our today 's life , better to live .

Therefore , I encourage people , whatever their social life , their occupation and their personality , to take a risk and try new things .
This can contribute to the development our world and their own partuculary .
We can not stay in the same way , for all our time we are going to spend on this earth , with taking any risk by putting in place new things .
We just need to try , and one day we will get a good result .
