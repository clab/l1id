Opting for general academic knowledge instead of a more specific one is a defining choice .
It will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the student 's future professional career .
While broad knowledge is often prefered , I personally think that focusing on specific topics is more relevant .
Indeed , I am convinced that it is essential in order to become competent in a field .
Moreover , a freshly graduate student with very specific skills is more likely to match an employer expectations .
Nevertheless , in the particular case of management , broader knowledge is still preferable .

First and foremost , going deep into a subject allows students to master perfectly a field , while surfacing it results in the end in useless skills .
By tackling everything , we finally stop working on a subject when it is getting interesting .
For instance , in high school , we discover many things : just enough to have a vague understanding of how things work .
I would have loved to go further on biology , physics ...
But we lacked time .
In order to go further on a subject , making a choice is needed .

Then , I think that a student who is specialized will better fit a company needs than if he had general background academic knowledge .
Indeed , in the modern industry , what is needed is very focused people , working on tiny tasks .
The gathering of those tiny tasks , with each of them perfectly performed , makes the final result great .
For instance , a friend of mine was specialized in micro frequence wave lengths , or close .
He had no difficulty to be hired for a top level position in a military company because his profile was very rare .

Finally , I would underline the fact that there is one field where broad competences are better : management .
As a matter of fact , what a manager is asked for is not doing things well .
He is expected to be able to make his team deliver a great job .
So he should understand the tasks of each of his teammates in order to manage them properly .
The higher his position , the broader his skills .
For instance it would be a non sense to ask a CEO in a pharmaceutical company to having very deep knowledge of drugs composition .

To conclude , I would say that having a specific approach is a winning solution for any student .
Then , if he is to reach managerial positions , he will have the opportunity to get an MBA in order to learn broader things for instance .

| More competent : surfacing topics vs having an in6deep knozledge .
Zith broad learnings : stop zhen it starts getting interesting .

Specialized : today co ; panies , research specific knowledge for efficiency

The exception : management .
Need to be able to anyone and understand
