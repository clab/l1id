Nowadays most students understand ideas and concepts but generally they do not know facts .
I think it can become a real problem .

As far as i am concerned i think that most students know ideas and concepts .
Indeed they are more taught in the universities .
I think they are the first point in a teachers lecture .
With this point students can understand facts .

However I think we shuold bear in mind facts .
They are important too .
For instance if all presidents or rulers knew the history of the world they could avoid doing the same mistake .
Wars are proof of this .

Moreover facts are also important on economic grounds .
For instance in order to make forecasts .
Indeed facts are always the same if we consider a long period .
But after a fact we have to analyse it with concepts .

On the other hand I think that students prefer learn facts .
It is more interessant because it is co

To conclude I think that the both are very important fot our futur .
It is a question with a real stake .
