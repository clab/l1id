Nowadays , there is so much information that it is tempting to get interested in many subjects .
Although it is very easy in our society to gather information from a wide range of subjects , I prefer to specialize myself in one specific subject because it permits me to build a solid knowledge and eventually to be able to broaden it .

First , when somebody specializes himself in one particular topic , he has the opportunity to understand issues in-depth .
These issues are often complex , and that is why it makes this type of knowledge very valuable .
As a result , it is possible to take position on debated issues .
For instance , I have studied psychology for many years and in my country , different types of psychology are debated now .
Having this deep knowledge in this particular field , I can easily understand the different points of view and make my own opinion .
Also I can stand a position very strongly if I debate with someone about this issue .

In addition , I think that if I know very well one subject , it will then allow me to broaden my knowledge to other subjects .
As everything is related , it seems obvious that an issue can be discussed in many ways .
And I believe that having a strong knowledge in one field permits to approach better very complex issues .
For example , early this year , the governement of my country wanted to rule a law involving changes in the social system .
Since I had experience in this field , it was easy for me to consider the bill from a social worker point of view , but I also enjoyed getting very interested in other points of views as legal or economic points of view .
I was all the more interested by the subject that I feel very involved .

From this , you can understand why I prefer to build for myself a sizeable knowledge on one specific subject .
Owing to this , I can take position to complex issues , and consequently I get very interested in some subjects .
This strong interest permits me to open my mind to new topics with a lot of curiosity .
