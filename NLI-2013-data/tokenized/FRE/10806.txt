It is a well-known fact that most people 's purpose in life is to succeed , whether it be at the family , academic or working levels .
Now the question is whether or not we really need to exceed our current abilities to be considered a successful person .
In this regard , I think that it would be particularly interesting and relevant to deal with the business world .

On the one hand , I tend to think that an employee deserves the right to be considered as a successful person to the extent that they previously had to prove educated and motivated enough to meet the employer 's requirements for a specific position within a company .
As a matter of fact , given the level of selection regarding a position of teacher in macroeconomics , I argue that the status of successful person is not to be neglected .
However , I want to highlight the fact that the applicant is all the more granted recognition in the way that their knowledge is not sufficient in these situations ; indeed , not only is the applicant 's academic background important in the hiring process , but the ability to teach to a given category of students is also to be considered .

On the other hand , I also think that we could consider the concept of being succesful from a different point of view .
Indeed , I also agree with the argument according to which successful people try new things and take risk .
For instance , the latter qualities could enable people to evolve in a company ; why would we have to restrain ourselves while we could take advantage of external opportunities to improve in particular fields .
As far as I am concerned , the only risk would be to fail .
And it is a well-known fact that everyone learns from their past experiences and mistakes .

As a conclusion , it is worth-mentioning that the definition of a successful person is subjective in so far as this concept implies to first define our current abilities and then our objectives in life .
Successfulness can be considered according to different levels .
