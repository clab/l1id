According to me the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide .
first of all , the best way to enjoy to travel is to go with an other person , its n't good to go with a group , because it 's difficult to share your feeling and make a plan quickly and efficiently with many people together .
For example if you need to shop you have to be worried about of the feeling of your group , but it 's more easy when you travel with a friend or a menber of your family to change the schedule of your journey .
Secondly , all of your mouvements during the travel are restricted because you are in a group .
For instance , if you have plan to enjoy to eat in different restaurant , if you will meet many new people , it 's not possible to do this in a group because during the travel you are always with your group , so you do n't have the time to meet someone and the travel can be borried .

Finally , if you travel with a guide you are not able to quit the group and to do what you want to do .
You have to follow the instruction of the tour guide it 's like a travel information that 's not good .
For example if you go to some country in Africa like Ivory Coast , all the tourist like to go to yamoussokro to see the biggest catholic church in the world , the tourists do n't take the time to visit the capital which containts some interesting stuff too .

In conclusion the best way to travel is with a partner like a friend or a menber of your family it 's more fun .
On the other hand , that depend of what are you planning to do and what 's your purpose .
For instance if you want to travel for a history class or whatever .
I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
In fact you can take all the information who want about the topics of your class .
