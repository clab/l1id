The young people and the older people are very different .
The younger think that the older people have never already been Young because they do n't accept the crazy of the youht .

In fact , the young people do too noise , listen too high the music , speak too strong , drive too speed and they do n't respect the older people .

Then , for the young people , they think that the people older do n't want understand them .
The younger believe that the older people have never already crazy like them .

This two groups think different but they are just human people .
They do n't just have the same age .
That why they do n't have the same reaction face to the life .

In fact , for the young people , an happy thing create many situation like smile , cry ...
For the older people , this same thing create just a smile ...
because their life is behond them .
