Nowadays , people are used to living with their car in such a daily way that most of them could not act without it : going to their job , doing their shopping , and so on .
On the other hand , the increase of oil price seems to lead people to think of using their car less .
As a consequence , such a controversial situation can make us to wonder what the future is destined for cars .
To my mind , even if ecology may act so that in twenty years there is fewer cars , there will be as many cars as today or even more .

First , in my opinion , we must consider the situation in states which are developing , in order to have an idea of the future about such technologies .
Indeed , in countries such as India , people ca n't afford a car for every members of a family yet , like it is the case in the United States , but in twenty years the state will be more developped and the citizens might have more money and thus might be able to buy more cars which stay a sort of myth of success .
Hence , even if new better technologies were put in place , they would be too expensive for the developping states , and that 's why I believe that there wo n't be fewer cars .

Secondly , the habits and the economy are not to be changed staight away and people may be going on buying cars .
As a matter of fact , people are used to driving themselves everyday and everywhere ; as a consequence it would be difficult to make them to use other means of communication .
For instance , although students have a large access to bus and metro , parents still buy a car to their children for their majority in the United States ; more than an indispensable object , it is a symbol of freedom and of wealthy .
Otherwise , the factories are not also ready to give up their usual product , and this all the more since it is very expensive to look for new system of communication .
Therefor , I think that the car is so integrated in mentality that it will take more than twenty years to change is place , and so people will still buy cars .

Finally , from my point of view , news technologies will permit to improve cars , in particular about oil necessity and pollution , however they wo n't lead to the end of cars .
Indeed , I think that scientists will find new manner to make the car to function but I fear they wo n't find such a revolutionary means of communication that people will no loger buy cars .
For example , even if tey find a new product , they would have to adapt roads , to make it not too much expenseive and to answer to all the demands .
It seems to me that is more o project for fifty years than twenty .

For all these reasons , I think that they will not be fewer cars in twenty years ; this useful tool is part of our life for still many years .
