In a first approach , we may think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people , and even more very young people like children , do n't take into account several factors of the life , and they seems to enjoy life .
For example , the every-day-life of a child is not as much difficult as one of an adult .
Someone takes it to the park , he can play with the other children , even if he does n't know them , the communication is very easy .
Then when he goes back home , he do n't have to take care of the lunch or dinner , he just have to seat or to be seated and he eats .
He does n't have to buy products , to cook them and so on .

Elder children seems still to enjoy life , and therefore they are more independant than when they were babies .
They do n't have yet to borrow of earning one 's living , they must just have their homeworks done .

Then , when one become an adult , several problems appear .
First , after having chosen to make studies or not , one must find a job , and then a appartment .
Then there are the taxes .
But people are independant .

Between 50 years old and 65 or 70 years olds , some people have accumulated money , and they can now have the benefits of it .
They have no more young children , they may travel when they want or just where they want .

Of course , the elderly people , living either in their own houses or in a retirement house , do n't seem to enjoy life as mush as the younger do .
Of course the death ca n't be further and further ...
So they must enjoy every events , even if it may look very common for the younger people .
