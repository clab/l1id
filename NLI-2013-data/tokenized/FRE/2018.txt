In my opinion i believe that young people do enjoy their life more than older people .
they have the opportunity to go to parties , make a lot of friends and do all fun activities they want to that older people ca n't do .

young people can do all kind of fun and interesting things like me i enjoy parties a lot with my friends .
but i am more focus in my school work .
when i am doing my school work i found it is fun and i am enjoying doing it .
when you are young what is when life is started , that the time you going to do everything for when you get older .
because when you are old you defenitely ca n't do the same thing you use to do when you were young .
it 's the time to take a rest looking back in your present .

i encourage all young people to enjoy their life while they are young because once you get old you will regret that you did n't enjoy your life , you will feel that you miss something that you should have done before and you can not done when you older .
so do n't let all the great opportunities pass by and after to feel bad about them .

however when i was a child i did n't like people who like to go to parties , movies , have fun or anything because my mom always tell me to stay home , go to school only and never have fun .
but now when i get older i realize it was a good advantage for me to enjoy my life while i was younger than when i am getting older .
it 's also help you to get ride of stress , make your life easier and help you stay and live longer .
