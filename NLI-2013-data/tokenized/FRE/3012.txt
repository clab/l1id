When I read this statement , I automatically think that it is right , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
But if I think on it , it appears to be , in fact , the contrary ...

It is true that young people have the discover everything .
When one is born , one has to learn and to built all of who one wants to be .
Therefore , a young person has to try and to search all that he can , to know who he is .
In that sens , he enjoys life more than older people , who already know who they are .

It is also true that young people have more opportunities to enjoy life tham older people .
The education system permit them to meet many different persons , until the entrance in the professional life : the student has to change of educating place all his student life , with the school , the highshool , the college , etc ...
At the contrairy , older people already have a durable placement in their company , and therefore have less occasions to meet other persons .

Finally , we know that young people make sports and have activities that older people can not exerce .

That is the first impression that I have when I read the statement .
But I am young and that is why my spirit only saw avantages for young people .
If I am objective , it is obvious that older people also enjoy life .

They have their life already lined , that is true , but all the exemples of adults around me show me that it is not a reason for us tu stop their hobbies and to stay at home without doing anything to enjoy their life .
My father , for instance , decided to quit my mother because he founds his life too calm ...
He has many friends , and now he profits of everythings more than , even if I am younger ...

With the world of today , and the globalization , we can have only one job for our entire life , that i why older people have the opportunity to change oh life , to discover other things and other fields .

When we travel , we can see that the majority of tourists are not very young , and I thing that travelling is the best way to enjoy life .
All these reasons show that older people can enjoy life as well as young people do , and even more .
It is only a different way to enjoy things .
That is why I disagree , after reflection , with the statement .
