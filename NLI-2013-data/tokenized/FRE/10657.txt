Nowadays , with our capitalistic way of thinking , and our huge ideology of research for wealth , it has become a common concern to seek for the best way to be succesful .
Thus , many people argue that it is easier to be successful running risks or trying new things .

Actually , we cannot denied that taking risk can lead to success .
Because finding new things is obviously the best way to give to the people new need ( for economy ) , and also to anticipate your competitors .
Marcel Bleustein , for example , became one of the most famous French advertisors , being the first one to try to do advertising on radio .
One another hand , trying new things lead you to take risks , and becoming unsuccessful if nobody takes care of your idea .

However , it is also possible to be successful only doing what you know how to do well .
The principle is that , if you know perfectly how to do something , you will consequently do it on a better way that your concurrents .
The big Americane telephone compagny AT & T , for example , prefered in the 20s continue to be the best in the telephone technologie , rather than developpe new technologies such as wireless telegraph .
As everybody knows , it was a good choice .

Actually , the best way to be successful may be both doing something we know well , and trying to find new things .
In art for example , it is diffucult to be a real artist , that is to say to create new things , without be aware of what existed before .
That is why , before becoming one of the most famous French movie director and one of the leader of the Nouvelle Vague , J. L. Gaudard firstly worked hard to know a lot of things about classical cinema and more generally about classical art .
