Nowadays when we see the movie on the tv we can see a lot of advertisements .
Generaly the adverdisements has a connection with the sitcom or the movie , for example when we see a sitcom about a students life ( dawson , beverly hills ) the advertisements whose follow is the products for the students , and young people .

The question is difficult because the goal of the advertisements is to catch the customer to buy the products and how the advertisements seem much better than they really are ?

We can take some reasons to answer to this question .
First reason , in the most advertisements we can t see really the products we have for example two peolple whose kissing much better and the topic of this advertisement is to buy a car , I wonder what is the connection between the kiss and the car .

Secondly when you read your news paper there a lot of adverdisem ent not interesting .
For example we have a picture of the lot of the men in the fuel appartement and just the name of the compagny we can t find the connexion its just to sell the name of the famous compagny .

Last reasons the advertisements make the bad effects toward the children .
When the child seated in front of his tv and when he sees a advertisements with a fight or a gun , he wants to do like the person of the advertisements .

To contrast this reason we have most adavertisements to prevent to the people by teh danger of the car or the fire at home , in this case the advertisements make producs than they really are .

Finally I agree withs this statement because the bad effects of the advertisements is several and much dangerous for the children and for the young .
