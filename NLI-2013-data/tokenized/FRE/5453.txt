I would like to start by stating that I fully agree with the statement that `` Most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are . ''
I will present three arguments that support my opinion .

Firstly I would like to explain that a good advertisement always has the best picture taken of the item marketed .
For example , when you go to the fast food restaurant you usally rely on pictures to decide what you are going to eat .
The nice pictures tempt your appetite and make you salivate .
But when you actully receive the end product , like a MacDonald 's Hamburger , it never looks as nicely constructed as the picture showed it would be .
A nice picture can speek a million words .

My second argument is that most advertisements are performed by very good looking individuals or endorsed by someone famous .
To utilize such powerfull individuals will influence what you think of the item advertized .
For example , if Jessica Simpson says that the leading acnee medication is Proactive and that she uses it herself , then it must mean that it is an exeptional product because she is very rich and famous and can decide to use any product she wants .

We trust the people we look up to or wish we could be .

My last argument is that a good advertisment and brilliant marketing will undoubtebly bias our own personal experience .
Who can actually tell which product is a brand name if it has no label on it .
If I were to blindfold you and have you taste 10 different macaroni and cheese could you pick out which one is the real Kraft Dinner ?

An advertisement is very brilliantly constructed to attract consumers .
I truly believe that we are all influenced , at some level , by cleaver advertisement and that we can all admit that we have been suckered into the latest gimmic at some point .
We might not admit it to others though !
