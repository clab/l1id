I fully agree with the statement .

For me , the main purpuse of an advertisement is to show a product to someone ( a person , a group of people , a company , etc ) in order to sell it to the person .

So what other way to sell a product than show it the best way possible .
And if the product is not so good or not that good looking , the only way to convince the audience that this product is worth buying is by showing it a tiny bit better than it really is in fact .

A great example that I have in mind to illustrate this , is the following one : When you are waiting in a fast food , restaurent and you are looking at the pictures of the food you are about to order , you always see all the french fries lined-up and '' facing '' you .
You always see the food displayed in those posters in a way that you have never seen it on your table .

The reason food is more attractive on the posters is that the servers , would not have time to re-arrange every french fry in order before you eat it .
And of course , there is no way that a fast food brand displays it 's fries just like it is in real life , because nobody would order it .

Some might say that if the product is really good , there is no need to make it seem better than it actually is .
And again , this is usually wrong .
Let 's take for example a big brand .
Whatever products they manufacturing , they will probably be another company out there that is selling the same product ( usually a little bit different ) .
In order for the first company to sell its product more that the competitor , the company needs to invest on a advertisement .
And the main goal of the advert is to show that the product is better than any other one that looks the same or have the same functionalities .
So basicly the advert has to show that the product is better than the other , so probably also better than it in fact really is .

And finally , is a product is really good , there is probably nood need to make an advert in the first place as it will be a self selling product .
