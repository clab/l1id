Over the past decades , atmosphere pollution has become a major issue for the international community , as the signing of the Kyoto protocol , ment to reduce toxic gases production , in 1992 showed it .
Cars contribute to such a pollution , and therefore it is essential for the future of men to stop using them .
But yet , it does n't seem to me that neither politicians nor people are ready to get rid of cars in a period of time of twenty years .

First and foremost , it is clear that in developped countries , where most of the cars are used nowadays , politicians are not willing to implement policies that would force citizens to get rid of their cars .
In the most powerful of these countries , the USA , the current administration does n't even consider atmospher pollution to be a problem to tackle .
It will therefore certainly take more than twenty years before something is done about this .
In other countries , if politicians acknowledge cars contribute to pollute the air , they prefer protecting the car industry whether than taking measures to restrict their use .
Only London and Stockholm have restricted the access to car in their historical centres .
And as infrastructures that could replace the use of cars are missing , people are n't ready to get rid of them Besides , the emerging countries ' will to benefit of cars has to be taken into account .
For the good of their economies , they cannot restrict the developpement of the car industry , and they also want to benefit from the best way of life .
They will therefore certainly not forbid people to use cars .

All in all , considering the economic context , the current policies implemented at all levels to reduce the use of cars and the people 's will to do so , there is no doubt that there will not be fewer cars than there are today .
I 'm affraid there will even be more of them .
