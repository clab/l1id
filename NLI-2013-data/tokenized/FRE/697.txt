I feel certain that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

First of all , I consider having knowledges of various subjects could be a valuable advantage for general culture .
I really think that is important to be polyvalent and to be interested in different subjects .
However , you should be aware that all informations are not right .
Consequently you should n't be lost in a ' `` vast ocean of information '' .

Furthermore , you are not limited , that means you are able to talk with different persons about various subjects whereas a person who is specialized in one specific subject are not .
When you are speaking with friends for insance , you can take part at the conversation and express your opinion about the topic since you have studied several points about it .

In a nutshell , although being specialized in one particular subject do seem to offer certain advantages like depthy knowleges , they are outweighed by the advantages of acquiring knowlege of several topics .
