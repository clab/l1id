Well , the first thing that came to my mind when i read the statement was Oh my god this is so true , because we all experienced at least once in our life , buying this perfect shampoo that will makes our hair smoother and shinier , because you know the girl in the advertisement seemed so happy and beautiful and then we go back home try it on the next minute to end up really disapointed when loooking in the mirror .
Or when you try that new ultimate fantastic diet that promised you to lose one stone in a week and then a week after you are sitting on your sofa eating two bars of chocolate because it did n't work .
It really seem like a big lie but then I thought that as witty as it can seem it is somewhat logical because then why would i buy a product that does n't make thing better , that everybody wears ?
If you see in a newpaper the picture of a car with no feature added that you just have the crude photo of it without light to enhance the color or a particular settin , you are not going to buy it in anyway .
I mean it is the whole aim of advertisement to sell us a product that is n't common because common equals to boring or bad quality in our head .
It has to make us dream in some way .
In a way i think that when we buy those product we intimatly know that it wo n't make us skinnier or perfect as the model in the advertisement but there are still the hope , and that with what publicits play , that after all this product might really work .
But i do n't really blame the publicits because althought it can be perceive as lying , it is their job to do that and the only solution to that problem would be that us , customers , we stop falling for the advertisement they create , that we go beyong all the fuss they are creating to face the reality ( come on you know anyway that you would n't lose a stone in a week , that just does n't make any sense ! ) .
Besides who has n't try to make reality better in his every day life , i mean it is a human reaction , you know when for example you try to convince your kid that spinach do taste good , and i just think that it is how it works the same with advertisement .
