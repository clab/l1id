I believe this statement is true , but i would rather blame the community or the society than the youth .

Our society have gone through lots of changes in the last century .
In the past , the society of the middle age was built around the community and the village and further the basic family , which is the father , the mother and the children .
There was no needs to leave the house , unless mariage , and the school was mostly for the wealthy .
This type of organisation made it easy , and essential , for the community and especially the youngest to work hand in hand for the community , for instance on the field , because the life of the all the community relied on the amount and the quality of crops .
And also because the yougest had no choice than to work for the community in order to securize their own existence .
The society of the 21st century is pretty much different from that picture .

The young from the age of 3 or 4 to the age of 22 or 23 has to go to school in order to learn a profession and find his place in the society .
As soon as you got a job , the security you were obtaining through the middle age community in the past , is all gained through your salary .
The today world has become very oriented on the person itself , and not so much on the community .
People raise their children alone , go to work and come back at evening and prepare for the same ritual the next day .
Commercials appearing all the time on television or radio send clear messages `` Goods for your personal needs '' as a person .
The sense of community has almost disappeared from the screen .

Another factor to the discharge of the youth of today , is the lack of time .
Talking about school or workplace , things have to be done more efficiently in a shorter period of time .
So it become more difficult for people to concentrate on the problems of the others .

That reaction is exactly the one of the youth of today , which should n't be blamed but the society we are living in .
