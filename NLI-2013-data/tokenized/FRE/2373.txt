I do agree with the following statement !
I think that older people are n't in form enough to do think that young people do ..
Young people can do want they want to do .
Older people must always think of their body when they do something .

For example older people must always think about where they will do their next holidays .
They must always think about if there is an evaliator in the hotel or other impotant things referring the hotel .

Young people can go where thy want .
Most of them never have to worry about their health and body !
Another important aspect to explain my answer is that i think that young people always think about their dream and futur .
Of course older paople do it too , but they know that life can end soon for them and young people always know that they have still the entire life to realise their dreams .

Young people also can always do their sport they would like to do .
I think that sport activities are very important for having a satisfied life .
So i Think tht Old people cannot do the same sport activity i do and therefore i conclude that a life as an lod person does n't seem to be excitng and interesting for me .
All in all the are a lot things that either young people or old people can do , but i thing that there are also a lot things that older people cannot because of their body or health .
Even if they were able to do the same activities as young people do , i think that the quality of doing the activity is gone .
The same is with an old horse .
An old horse can run , but it cannot run as fast as a young horse and it definetely will not able to jump high in the air as a young horse .
Referring this example to humans i want to explain that when you are old you will loose a lot of the life quality .
Therefore i can just agree with statement , because you can just enjoy your life if you have a good life quality !
