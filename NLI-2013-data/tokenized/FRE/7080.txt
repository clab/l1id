Have you ever seen the stars while you were in Paris or New York ?
The pollution cloud does not leave `` their '' sky .
It is especially due to the cars in use .
It is said that : `` In twenty years there will be fewer cqrs in use than there are today '' .
Can we be so optimistic ?

First , I will focus on the problems linked with those cars .
Then , I will explain why I think twenty years is not sufficient for seeing a decrease of cars in use .

The cars in use polluate our earth , our cities .
This pollution threaten the health of humans , and so ; e of them begin to wear a mask to protect themselves .
There are other sources of pollution , but in the cities where we live , this one is the most important .

Moreover , cars use a lot of petrol , and we know that this material is becoming seldom and is becoming very expensive .
How could we live in fifty years if there is no petrol left because we used everything ?

That is the reason why , we have to reduce the number of cars in use .
All the countries are aware of that , but the policies to develop new energies and restrain cars in use are to shy .
Indeed , in France for instance , cities try to develop the common transports .
Once during the year , the inhabitants of Paris are demanded to use other means of transport .
However , it still being small initiatives and I do not know anyone who is ready to abandon his car , because he is not obliged to do so and policies are too shy .
It does not seem to be a priority of our society .

Finally , population in the world is growing , the number of people who will use a car is growing too .
Besides , a lot of countries become richer in Asia , South America ...
We can think their population will be able to buy cars too .

To conclude , to see the number of cars in use decrease , it will take more than twenty years .
I disagree with the statements .
The world will restrain this fact when it will be obliged to do so .
Maybe it will be t
