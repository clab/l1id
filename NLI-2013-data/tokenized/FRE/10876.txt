Successful people try new things and takes risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
This statement is saying that successful people takes risks and I am kind of agree with it by the fact that they are already successful meaning that they do n't have a lot to lose .

I will , in a first part describe how successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , in a secon part , why not , staying in the same field without taking risks ?

Successful people try new things and take risks .
We can say that some of the successful people try new things in the fact of get into something new , something that they are not in and they take risks .

Thoses risks they take is to try something new , to show to themselves that they can succeed in a new field .
Now , why taking risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do ?
Maybe to try some other things , to be oppen-minded , to know differents things , sensations and feelings .
We can take the exemple of Arnorld Shwazeneger who is an actor but also the maire of California .
He was a successful person as an actor but who could ever imagine him as a politicy member ?
Thus , successful people like to take risks , to prove to themselves that they can succeed in diferent field .

Moreover , we can asks ourselves :
Why taking risks ?
and why not staying in the same field where they are doing what they already know how to do well ?
Actually , it depens on the characters of each person , some likes new things and risks to get into something new all the rise , some prefer to stay in the same speciality by doing what they already know how to do .

Although , to conclude , I will say that I am agree with the following statement :
Successful people try new things ans take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

Once , by the fact that successful people have all the keys to take risks even if it does n't work .
Then , they are already successful in what they are doing so , they can take the risks to try something new .
And , it really depens on the person , some likes new sensations , to try new things , even if they do not succeed , at least , they have tryed .
