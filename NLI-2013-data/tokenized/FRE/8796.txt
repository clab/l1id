I agree with this statement .
Up to a certain point , I think academic education should be based much more on theory than on practice .
There will be enough time to get acquainted to practice and more factual information later , especially during our professional life .

This does not exclude inductive approach to concepts .
Starting from factual observation can be a very good way to understand complex concepts , but the aim remains to give the students a knowledge of the theoretical tools , which must be the main objective since it is the most difficult .

It is from such theoretical tools that a human being can develop his or her ability to go deeper into any specific subject .
As part of a specific society , we all have a common historical and philosophical heritage which influences our way of thinking , sometimes without us even knowing it .

To learn more about the concepts and ideas that others have brooded upon before us makes our judgment firmer .
It is only once we have mastered an idea that we can really reject it .

Moreover , practically speaking , it is much easier and faster to learn facts than to understand ideas .
Thus it seems the perfect time for the student , while he is studying , to spend time on ideas rather than on facts .

The danger of course lies in losing connection with reality .
But as soon as one goes a little deeper in the history of ideas , it becomes very difficult to be a genuine idealist .

However , there is an advantage that could stem from the learning of facts - students could draw their own conclusions from those very facts , and be in a way more active than the students trying to understand concepts with the help of teachers or authors .
But the thing is that this happens permanently and spontaneously in everyday life , whereas straining to understand a passage from Hegel would not spontaneously be a man 's activity .

Starting from the concepts create a virtuous circle between facts learning and concepts understanding since when a student really gets the core of a concept , he will naturally look for applications of it .
