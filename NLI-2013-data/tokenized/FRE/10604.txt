`Fake it until you can make it ' is one of the main ideas I try to keep in mind in my life especially when I need to make decisions .
I believe a person should be able to take risks and try new things in order to be successful .
If one 's limits itself to want it already know how to do well it has no chances to evolve .
For me having this attitud is like taking the highway to been bored .
Life has to be a game or at least a challenge .
How often do you realize that you just did something you could not imagine you were able to do ?
This behaviour is for me the simple key of success , it is what makes the difference betweem two evenly skilled people .

In order to enhance one 's chance to have this positive attitud , I would even recommand to add an acting course to highschools ' core curriculums .
It would help students to overpass their limits and explore their complex natures .

Another characteristic that is necessary to access this behaviour is self confidence .
You need to trust yourself and believe in your capability to adapt yourself and learn quickly .

But of course this behaviour is successful only to working people .
You will never be able to make it if you do not work and just keep faking it .
Furthermore it could eventually destroy all you have done by discrediting you .
If you not not plan to work , you should better stick to what you know how to do well .

Finally this behaviour is leading you to success only if you aim for something you are capable of .
