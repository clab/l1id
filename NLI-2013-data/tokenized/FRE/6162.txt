Today , people use their car for everything .
Short distance as well as longer ones .
Moreover , people do really enjoy their car , we can see it every morning and night when there is a lot of traffic , they prefer staying in their car to using public transports .
So they love them and they take care of them as a precious object .
Nevertheless , I strongly believe that in twenty years , the number of car in the road will sharply decreased , not because people will be willing to give up their car but because they will no longer have the choice .

First of all , the price of gas .
We 're experiencing a new era , where the price of petroleum reaches a level never reach before .
The increase of the gas price is badly and harshly felt by the population .
Petroleum become more and more expensive meanwhile people become poorer and poorer mostly because of unemployement .
So that , gas becaume a luxuary good and fewer persons can offer it .
Soon , only rich people could offer it .

Moreover , environmemtal concerns become more and more important .
Indeed , Polution has rech a rate never reached before .
For instance , France during summer period , when it 's warmer , has to ask its citizens not to take their car in big cities such as Paris and to take public transport or bikes if they have to move , or even move by foot , because the polution rate is too high .
If they have to drive it is recommemded to take more tham one passenger inside the car .
The french authorities have to rely on the environmental conscious of the citizens .

Nevertheless , as the polution rate is not suppose to decrease in the near future and as the climate is suppose to be warmer than it use to be , I am sure that people wo n't be able to use their car as often as they would like to .

For all these reasons , even if people are not willing to give up their car , they will no longer have the choice in twenty years .
