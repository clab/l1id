Nowadays , people start to begin frightened about the fact that pehaps in the next century , there won t be enought oil or petrol and so that it will be impossible to use cars anymore .

I believe that it is probable that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I think the most important fact is that people strart to pay more attention at how and when they use their cars because there are a lot of problems with countries which have the oil .
And another important point is that the ressourses of oil have decreased considerably these last few years .

In addition to that the governement of my country try to sensibilize citizens to the fact that cars pollute a lot and it is very bad for the environement .
Nature begins to take an important place in a lot of goverenemental decisions which could also deacrease the number of cars .

However , for some the idea to not use the car is somethings unrealistic and unbelievable .
These people do not care about the environement , and for them it doesn t matter if they pollute .
So they are going to use their cars .

Futhermore , perhaps , some new energies could be created such as electric or sun energies , which don t need oil and don t pollute and so that they could be used by the drivers .
In both points , there will not be a decrease of cars in the streets , because it would be new ones with new kind of energies .

In conclusion , I think that there will be the same amounts of cars in the streets .
Nevertheless , I believe that with the new technology and the decrease of oil in the wolrd , it will be new cars which don t need oil as energy .
I also hope people would try to use less theirs cars even if they pollute less .
It would be better for the environement .
