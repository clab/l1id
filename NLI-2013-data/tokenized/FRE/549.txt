It is well known that education is a tricky issue .
It raises a lot of questions and everybody does not agree on it .
Indeed , educational differences between countries is a telling example of those questions .
Specialization is prefered in some countries and others adopt a general educational pattern .

From my point of view , a general broad knowledge is better than to spezialize in only one subject .
I support the idea that with a real general knowledge you develop your ability to have a general view of the world .
A case of point to highlight is that , yet among Ancient Greek philosophers a general knowledge was the condition of the achievement of the truth .
That is a general statement in which I believe .

Second , this Ancient belief of general knowledge has gone across centuries .
I am convinced that it is still true .
For instance , in my school , I am studying sunstainable development .
Although some good actions are done without this general view , it is not enough .
You have to consider all the parts of an issue before acting .
If you try to develop fair trade , be sure that transports will not be to harmfull for the environment .

Finally , from my point of view you can specialize after having received a general education .
It is the French educational policy .
Children must go at school and learn various subjects before specialize at college .
In my opinion it makes children more likely to become good citizens , they have some knowledge in many subjects .
For instance to vote , they are more aware of main issues .

By way of conclusion , I would say that even though specialization is important and allows people to reach an accurate knowledge in one subject , a general view provided by a general knowledge is the way to avoid some big slides .
