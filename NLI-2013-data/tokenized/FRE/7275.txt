Travelling is a wonderful experience that everyone should access to once in a while .
So why ruin it with a group of people you do not know and who do not have the same interests as you do ?
Why let a tour guide take you to only the most crowded places ?
I do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group , especially not led by a tour guide .

Let 's start by saying that we are all different , and that while we may have some points in common with others , there is always an interest that is unique to us .
Therefore , imagine arriving to Paris and joining a group of people that does not include just your family , but also ten unknown persons .
How would you decide wether you all want to go and have a traditional `` pain au chocolat '' with coffee or wether you are all going to go shopping ?
Or how would you decide if you are to all go to the highest level of the Eiffel tower or just go up one level ?
According to people 's interests , it is impossible to do everything that everyone wants and you would be stopped from doing what you really want for the benefit of others .

If you absolutely must travel in a group , I disagree on tour guides .
Of course , they can be helpful on specific information about the city 's monuments .
The problem is that they do not go at your rythm .
For instance , if you are in New York and you wish to spend more time admiring the glittering Times Square at night , you may not be able to because the tour guide will have a precise timed schedule that he must stick to .
I would therefore recommend buying a book with all the information about the specific city .
This has two advantages : you are able to enjoy the city at your rythm and it 's much cheaper !

In all , I do not beleive that a group or a tour guide are the way to go when it comes to travelling because it brings too many restrictions to what should be a complete free pleasure moment in your life !
