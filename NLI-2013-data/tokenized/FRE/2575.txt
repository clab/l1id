In the same way that people from different cultures enjoy life in different ways , I am convinced that older people can enjoy life just as much as younger people do .
However , older people enjoy different things in life .

First , I believe that people change their definition of happiness as they grow older .
While young people would most likely associate the thought of enjoying life with the practice of physical activities , or a busy nightlife , I am tempted to believe that older people would tend to relate enjoyment to more intellectual activitites such as reading , writing , or any artistic activity .

Second , older people have financial resources that allow them to do things that they were not able to do when they were younger .
For instance , older people generally have a more significant budget to travel all over the world .
I can still remember spending entire summers working in construction in order to pay for my extra-curricular activites during the academic year .
Now , I have the ability to take several weeks off and spend all my time traveling to foreign countries .

Finally , I am convinced that you only enjoy life once you really understand its value .
Older people have more experience , and understand the value of friendship , community and other things that make anyone 's life enjoyable .
I would argue that younger people do not always have the same ability to step back and enjoy what they have in the than older people .
I remember that I would only care about sports while I was in high school .
Although the feeling of being a performant athlete provided many opportunities to enjoy life , I look at it differently now .
When I think about these times , I think about how I could have enjoyed this experience more thoroughly if I had been more mature .

In conclusion , I would strongly argue that older people can enjoy just as much as young people do .
It is just a matter of defining your expectations from life , and having the ablity to understand your own happiness .
