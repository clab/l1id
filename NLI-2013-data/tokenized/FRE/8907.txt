Education is the most important thing in our modern society - someone with good skills have much more opportunities to succeed in his professional life than someone with low skills or education .

The main goal of school is to well-train young generation in order for them to adapt and improve our fast progress society .

There are mainly two ways of education : one way that allow students to understand by themselves theories , concepts or ideas by different means such as scientific experiences or self thinking and a second way that provide to them all teachings without real understanding .

Someone who really understand the roots of things is better trained as can shape things based on the fundamental knowlegde he has .
On the contrary , a student who only learn the facts and does not understand the principle or concept will at any time applied what he has learnt but will be inefficient in a general case .
This last can never shape things or invent new things as he does not have the capability of thinking by himself .

However , thanks to the new technology , it seems sometimes even not necessary to understand concepts to accomodate in this society .
Many people who are trained - in the new Sciences & Technology like the Internet , without having the fundamental knowledges , are as good as those who spend time on getting the real concept .

It seems useless to get fundamental knowledge and people are living and succeding in their work based on their education of learning only the facts .

To conclude , we think that understanding the real concepts of main subjects is important and required but students cannot master all concepts , which will not prevent them from being good students .
