Better use of public transportation and different travelling habits , leading to fewer cars : surely , this is the way many ecologists dream of the ideal future .
But is it truly realistic ?
Not many arguments available today support this vision .
Quite the opposite , in fact , seems to be taking place .

First , urban planning tends to induce an increased use of cars .
The taste for individual homes , with gardens , away from the city 's pollution , encourages urban sprawl .
The result of this is that any travelling needs a car .
Shops , malls , museums , are simply too far away from the suburbs for people to simply walk there .

Some might argue that the oncoming limitation in available oil ressources , as well as the growing concern about global warming , might change people 's behaviors .
However , one could challenge this view by noticing the current improvements in engines ' technologies .
They tend to make cars cleaner and less polluting .
This could make the moral dilemna to use the car or not an irrelevant one .
Cars will change , not how often people use them .

Another important factor lies in the needs of developing countries .
China , India and Brazil nowadays , and other countries tomorrow , have a growing middle class and urban population .
These people can afford to buy a car , even two .
They might also start having country houses , and cars are often necessary to travel there .

Lastly , I believe travel by car corresponds to a deep trend in our modern individualistic society .
People , when confronted with a choice , would rather travel alone or with their families than with random strangers in a closed space .
This shows that time and money are not the only factors when people have to choose between different ways to travel .
How good you feel , how freely you can behave when in a car , could outweigh seemingly more relevant arguments .
The tendency in the industry to customize each car for the individual customer is an illustration of the importance of this `` feel-good '' factor .

All in all , I think these arguments tend to go against the statement that the number of cars in use will decrease .
Cars and the uses of cars will evolve - but their numbers are not likely to go down .
