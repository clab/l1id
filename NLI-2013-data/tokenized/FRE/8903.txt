I would disagree with this statement for many reasons , main reasons that are to be explained in the following essay .
First of all , I believe that concepts and ideas are barely understandable if there is no fact to illustrate them whatsoever .
Indeed , let 's take Pavlov 's animals conditionning concept saying that you could make anyone make anything simply by making him repeating the task that you want him to achieve everyday , several times a day .
Well without his experiments , you could n't think that it 's actually true , however the concept could have made you think that it was applicable to anyone , however , scientists have proven that it 's not this simple , regarding humans in particular .

Besides , facts allows you to set `` real '' references to your beliefs , references you could keep for the rest of your life .
This `` real '' part is another drawback that make concepts less important for students .
Simply because a concept is an overall general idea about one topic or common acknowledgement to something theoritical , it makes it lose its sense to a student 's eyes .
You need proofs and facts to build your opinion .
This is what we call the proof by evidence .
A fact can not be a concept since it 's too singular , however , to me and to many student , a concept is nothing without facts .
If we talk about the relativity concept established by Albert Einstein few decades ago , it still undergoes a lot of controversy and is still being tried to be broken down .

Finally , according to history , because facts make people moving on more than concepts , they are more important to a student 's eyes .
For a long time , everybody have been knowing the concept or idea that energy waste could result in serious consequences for our Earth , everybody ignoring it and not taking as seriously as it should have been taken .
Nowadays , the alarm has been triggered because of facts happening such as weather issues , environment concerns ...
probably too late .

To conclude , facts have proven their efficiency more than concepts , and this is the reason why I truly believe that they are more important than them .
