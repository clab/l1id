Nowadays , our society provides us with a new kind of difficulty : we always have to evaluate the pros and the cons of what we are going to do in order to keep our job or our husband or wife .
Consequently , we can observe two behaviours in the population : some of us keep on trying new things and taking risks to reach the success .
Others prefer doing what they already know to do well .

We are going to see whether a solution is better than the other one or not .

First of all , when you only keep on doing what you already know how to do well , you never discover new activities and thus , you do n't try things that you could however enjoy .
To illustrate my point , I can explain my own experience : I have always played rugby during my childhood , and I reached quite a good level .
Nevertheless , 2 years ago , I realised that I had never tried to practice another sport and that 's why I decided to become a triathlet .
Although at the beginning I found it hard to swim during many kilometers , I can claim now that really enjoy this new sport and that it allowed me to discover a new , more individual activity .
Thus , I could live a new kind of success .

Secondly , when you are working on a project , two solutions are available .
The first one depends on your own knowledges , and ask you to avoid any kind of risk .
In that way , you will perhaps be able to keep your job during a long time .
But is that the only thing you can hope during your entire life ?
I would rather say no .
It 's obvious that one day , you will want to have more responsabilities .
And the way to that success is to try new things and to take risks .

To put these ideas in a nutshell , I would rather say that I agree with the statement .
Nonetheless , perhaps that 's the best solution is somewhere between these two extremes .
