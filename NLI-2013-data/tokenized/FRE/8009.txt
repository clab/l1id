The widely spread belief that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is for me not only totally wrong , but in complete opposition with what the concept `` to travel '' is intended to be .

First of all , the transportation mean - a bus - is simply not adequate for the activity .
I would assume that if a person travels , this person would like to smell and taste to country to be discovered , would aspire to new connections and interactions .
How can you ever be able to accomplish those aims through the windows of a big tourist bus ?
The best way to discover a new city is to walk down its roads , to loose yourself in it .

Secondly , traveling in a group means that while you visit new places , while you cross unkown environments , mom and dad and maybe your best friend is comfortably seated on your right side .
You feel at home , you engage conversations with the people you live with every other day .
Akward position when the true beauty of traveling around is to meet new people , to ask about their way of seeing things or how they manage their ruts .
Being surrounded by a well organised group does not facilitate the aperture towards the other traveling should be all about .

In third position comes the tour guide issue .
Those guides are often paid by their governments to bring the tourists to specific sites , monuments or landscapes where the infrastructures have been built to receive them .
Economical benefits are therefore in the air , many tourist guides will not hesitate to equivocate supposedly rich people to fill their pockets .

Finally , the overbooked agenda the touring agency plans for you often ends up being more exhausting than the actual work tourists are running away from on vacations .
To travel should mean to live without a watch , to follow the wave , to let the unexpected surprise you .
I would rather avoid any time planing , thus leaving space to improvisation and first impulses .
Two precious elements that will never cross the path of a touring group ...

Traveling in a group led by a tour guide completly disconnects you from reality .
One should know the difference between being a tourist and being a traveller .
I believe the second to be so much worth than the first .
If only people could think that way , they would find a little treasure .
