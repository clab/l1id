What do people usually use to guide them when they are traveling ?
I remember two years ago , my friends and I went to New Orleans , Louisiana for a trip .
Before we left , we went online to find all the attractions in the area .
However , we got lost so many times because we did not know the area ; nor did we have a tour guide .
Therefore , I agree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because having a tour guide will decrease the chance of getting lost , and it will be less likely to get involved in an accident .

First of all , having a tour guide when traving will decrease the chance of getting lost .
A lot of people , when they go to a certain area for the very first time , inspite of having a map , have the tendency to get lost .
One reason for that is because sometimes the maps that they got online are not updated .
Hence , they get lost on the roads , which can cause them to be angry .
I remember while my friends and I were on our way to a mall , despite the fact that we followed all the directions in the map , we still got lost .
But , we had a tour guide , perhaps , we would not have lost .

Besides having less chance of getting lost when traveling with a tour guide , the possibility of getting an accident is also low .
In Florida , it is said that lots of people die when they go visit a place due to car accidents .
The reason why is by looking at the map while they are driving .
But if they had a tour guide who knows the area very well , they would be less likey to crash .
Thus , a tour guide would be very helpul when traveling .

In conclusion , I am strongly in favor of the idea of having a guide when traveling .
For , this will minimize the chance of getting lost and getting an accident .
