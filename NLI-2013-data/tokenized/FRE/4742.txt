I actually think that it is true : a product looks usually better in the advertisement than in real .
But I also think that it is normal and I 'm going to explain why .
First , advertising exists for two reasons : it informs you of every new product that comes out on the market and it encourages people to buy it .
When you look at an advertisement in the street or on TV , the advertiser wants you to need this object and to think about buying it , to desire it .
Obviously , you will see the product ( materiel or not ) in its best aspect , sometimes presented with others products that improve the image of the product .
That is the case for all the food product : for example , meat will often be presented with some beautifull vegetables or a charming sauce .
And you will never see a parfume presented by a normal man or woman but by one or several top models .
In this situation , it is not the product itself that is more beautifull but the context and you have the impression that the product is better than in your hands .

Besides , advertising is a kind of art , and sometimes helps research for the cinema .
You can test new techniques , try to film some places ( the film `` The Lord of the Rings '' was filmed in New Zealand after the landscape was tested or remarked in an advertisement ) .
That explains also why such money is put in advertisment and why they are often so developped and beautifull .

But the product seems better to a certain extent and they can not be physical differences between the product on TV and in the supermarket : the consumer is protected by a law that forbids to make false advertisement .

So I will conclude saying that advertising enhance the image of the products and it is better like that .
It only concerns us to be aware of that and not to be foul .
