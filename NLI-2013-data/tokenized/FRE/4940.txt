As the need for a better life is growing in developped country , there is more and more commercial business offering different product .
Some of them will make the same product .
Those company , not to lose money will , therefore be at `` war '' adainst each other .
They will need to advertise for their product .
To do so they will show us that , first we need this type of product , and second that the one they are offering is better than the one from another company .
How do we know if the product of a company `` A '' is better than the one from company `` B '' , or if the product is as good as it seemed to be ?

Everyone had once asked the question .
We have to understand that the company have to sell their product whatever might happened , and they have to produce it with the less cost possible .
So we may ask ourselves if the product we are buying are as good as the advertisements want us to believe it is .

It 's quite a tough question if we are looking at it closely , there is some company who will show us the product as it really is and some other who wo n't .
How can we make the difference ?
I guess it 's up to us .
We have to remember that they are here to sell whatever product it is and therefore has to make it look good .
You wo n't buy a product if we are telling you the whole truth , the whole thruth being that there is side effects on this new diet pills or that this cheap TV will only work 45 minutes a day .

For me companies have to sell whatever product they are making , and in order to do that they have to present those products on their brightside and telling us only the good part of the story .
Some will emphasize the good part and let the customer wondering if this wonderfull product really exists and some other will show us the product as it really is .
We can ask ourselves how we will be acting if it was us to sell something to another person , either we will be eager to sell it without mentionning couple of problems we had with it , the car we are selling will breakdown at the next corner , Or we will be telling the truth saying that the car we are selling will break down but this car is worth the repair to be done .
Either way , we are not telling the same thing , but we are selling the same thing .

I will then say that advertising make the products seem much better than they really are , but it 's for one purpose to sell and you wo n't sell something that it 's not good enough for your customer .
Adverstisment is to me like a painter painting a portrait , it will make the product seem better than it really is , the same way a painter will paint the face of someone seem prettier than it really is .
We just have to know how much we want to beleive the magnification of the truth .
