Nowadays , tourism has become an important part of the entertainement industry , especially in the Western societies .
People tired - and sometimes fed up - with their jobs always keep an eye on their agenda , waiting for the next vacation .
But when this day arrives , people usually have to face a dramatic dilemma : do they have to travel by their own or with a tour guide ?
This issue has been largely debated for the next ten years and is at the heart of the political campaign of many countries .

Travelling by your own implies that you can be organized : you have to book the hotel yourself and you have to speak the language of the country you plan to visit .
Overall , it will be difficult to understand the story and to appreciate the monuments you visit , except if you already know the culture of the country very well .

Actually , the choice depends of the type of vacation you like .
For instance , if I go on vacation to the beach and that my aim is to have fun playing volley ball and having a nap while staring at the sea , it is not obvious that I need to be led by a tour guide .
Actually I can still do so , but the role of the guide will be slightly reduce , since there is nothing special to visit .

On the other hand , if you prefer a cultural trip , things are different , and you might need a tour guide as I said belove .
I would say that being led by a tour guide is the best way to travel if you fancy cultural trip .

My point of vue is that I prefer travelling on my own .
Thus I can make cultural discovery and meet the inhabitants of the country I am visiting .
Furthermore , I can practice my foreign language .

That 's it : next vacation I will go to a English speaking country , so I could practice my English .
I will lose my horrible french accent .
And I will not need to pass the Toefl exam anymore .
Therefore I will no longer bother an anonymous corrector with stupid essay ; )
