The question of taking or not taking risks is a controversial one .
On the one hand some people thing that to be succesful they have to try different things .
On the other hand , by doing what you already know you may be more efficient and successful because you avoid risk .
However , most people have an aversion for the risk , and taking all aspects into account , I strongly feel that it is better to keep doing what you have been used to do .

To start with , it is true that if people do what they already know , they will be specialised in a task and therefore have a real social status .
This status is one of the aspects of success .
In our modern society , it is important to have a social position in order to be different from other people .

Futhermore , most people will agree that nowedays , professionals ask , from their applicants , a specialised profil .
In the same time , custumers have the same requirement .
For instance , most peoplpe prefer a specialized doctor rather than a generalist .
Thus , studies are more and more precised .

Eventually , the most important reason is that specialisation emprouve efficientness and avoid any waist of time .
This has already be prooven by famous theories like the Adam Smith one where he explain that specialization in the division of work , is a way to reduce loose of time .
Through the effect of experience , people know perfectly what they have to do and therefore are more rapid .
This can also be called expertise .
The examle used by Adam Smith occures in a Manufacture where people repet the same mouvement all the day long and have a uniqe tast .
This specialization lead this manufacture to competitiveness .

In conclusion , my firm conviction is that success can easely be reach by specialization .
By doing the same thing you can be an expert with a real social position and hence , be more efficient .
