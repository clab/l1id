To evaluate what will happen in twenty years is a difficult task .
One question is to know if there will be more cars or not .
First we will consider the arguments given to predict a reduction in the number of cars , then the evolutions that indicate a rise in this number .

Nowadays the price of petroleum is in a constant rise .
As the oil reserves are getting smaller and smaller , a oil crisis is predicted in less than twenty years .
So using a car will become more and more expensive .
Maybe people will try to use it less , which means a reduction in the number of cars .

Moreover as the center of cities are now overcrowded , the policie is to reduce the number of cars in cities .
Laws are enforced to limit this number , as for instance in London where you have to pay to use your car inside the city , or in Paris where new public transports are being built .

In twenty years we can assum there will be new and more efficient public transport wich will make car no longer a necessity for people .

Nevertheless I do n't believe in that evolution .
Even if there will be no enought oil to sustain the developpement of cars , other sources of energy now exist and will be developped .
Using biologically made oil , or electricity we will still be able to run cars .

Moreover , if we focus on the developpement of cities , we observe that car is a nessecity if you live in the suburb of a big city .
As ore people will live in suburbs than now , we can guess public transports , even if they evolve , will not be sufficient .

Last point is the developpement of China and India .
Even if there a proportionnally less peple who will buy a car in developped countries , when this two countries will be developped there will be a new market of more than two billiard people !

In conclusion even if argumets can be given to justifie there will be less cars than today , I think there will be ; ore cars .
