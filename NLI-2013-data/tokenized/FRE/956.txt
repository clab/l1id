The issue of the quantity and the quality of knowledge required to succeed is a very old one : in fact we today know that nobody can have the so-called ` Total knowledge ' of the world .

This was probably possible three or four centuries ago , when the state of our scientific knowledges was limited , that is why scientists , philosophs or writers like Goethe , Rousseau , Pascal have surely known everything when they lived .
But it is an utopy today , and in our everyday life the question that comes often is : Do I have to follow a generalist or a specialized cursus ?

I personnaly agree with the statement underlining the idea that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic areas than to know everything about one area , like cells biology or ship construction , for example .

My view is surely subjective because I made a French ` Classe Preparatoire ' before being admitted , two years ago , in a Business School in France .
So I had to study during two years no less than 8 academic classes : Mathematics , French , History , Economy , English , German , Philosophy , Computer skills .
Each one was very important and often evaluated with both writed and oral assessments .

To my mind follwing a great number of classes at the young age is a very constructive and usefull way to be educated : on this purpose all countries all over the world proceed this way until the child becomes a teenager .
But after that each country has its own view on education : Germans will prefer to choose a specialization very soon ( with 13 or 14 ) whereas France or the United States gives a priority to long studies at the university .
I remember a day when I was in ` Classe Preparatoire ' , a professor of Philosophy felt that few people followed his class , and he told one of the students that in spite of his probable future of Financial Manager , dealing with numbers and banks all the day , he will miss his classes of Philosophy because it gave him a way to think about everything in the life .

This explanation of our professor created by me a new view on subjects I did n't appreciate , and now I make efforts to interest me on each Business point that I have to study at School .

But to conclude with , I naturally understand that I will have to decide me for a specific orientation to my professional future very soon .
It is necessary , but I think that in a highly evolutive Labour Market , it is a n opportunity in conceiving to do very differnt things in his career .
