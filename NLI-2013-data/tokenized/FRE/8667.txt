Despite the fact that each people has his own way of learning and understanding , in a general point view , I think that best results can be obtained by focusing on ideas and concepts .
That does not mean , however , that facts should never be dealt with .
The best way is certainly finding a compromise between the two approaches .

Ideas and concepts are , to my opinion , the most important part of learning , like the foundations of a building which is growing bigger and bigger .
Theory is the first brick you can build on .
Moreover , ideas and concepts tend to be universal - I think a good theory is evaluated to its degree of universalism .
In a way , we could say that theory precedes the facts in that it aims at explain , and sometimes predict them .
Therefore learning and understanding ideas and concepts is important because it permits to think from a general point of view , without being tied by circumstancial conditions for instance .
It gives students ability to adapt to a broad range of situations .

On the other hand , I think it is not possible to only rely on theory .
Facts must be used to endorse - or refute - theories and , to my mind , theory alone is worth nothing : everyone can build theories but we should be only interested in ones that have direct links to observable facts , ones that use those facts to give more credibility to the general statements they posit .
Facts are essential in testing theories since they represents what has actually happened which give them strong credibility and thus they are key elements of a theory 's validation .

As a conlusion I would say that both are importants - ideas and concepts on one hand and facts on the other hands - because they are part of a general process , they do not exclude each other and one without the other is worth nothing .
However , I think there could be a chronological aspect : it would probably be more effecient to work on ideas and concepts before dealing with facts .
