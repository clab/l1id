I think that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is necessary , it is the first step of a good education , a good foundation giving the best chances to adapt .
But then it is often required to get a specialization .

In our society being specialized in one specific subject is more and more a necessity , vital to get a job or to hold a position in a company .
Also it helps to have a better salary .

It will often depend on the type of work or position .
For example , lawyers should have broad knowledge of the legal system , the main legal principles and cases .
But during their training , they are required to choose a specialization .
Corporate lawyers should have a good practice and experience in Company Law .
They cannot practice in Public Law and be good at it at the same time .
These subjects are too different .
The more they can get an experience in a specific area of Law , the best they will be in their area , the more they will be competent , recognised and well-paid .

The issue is the same for people working in Research or in the medical sector .
After a certain number of years of study , a specialization is often mandatory for a certain number of jobs .

But the above mentioned statement can be exact for managers for example who should have a good knowledge of many areas of their companies in order to be able to take the right and appropriate decisions
