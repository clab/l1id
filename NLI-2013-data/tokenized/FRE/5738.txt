We are , indeed , surrounded by cars .
Over the years , driving became men 's favourite way to travel .
So why would that trend come to an end in twenty years ?
Costs ?
Progress ?

Travelling by car has a major advantage ; You choose where you will go , when you will stop .
You choose your path and aim straight at your destination .
You are not a passive passenger , and you are therefore less bored .

Cars are also part of our culture ; Little boys play with plastic ferraries , and in some countries , such as America , so wide that public transports are less efficient than is other european cities , a car in related to freedom and independancy .

But the price of fuel has gone up , as natural resources diminish , and it is accurate to think this rise will only increase as time goes by .
People and governments , well aware of the situation , start planning their futures without Cars .

People also seem more and more concerned with environmental issues .
It is well known that cars pollute alot , releasing carbon dioxide in the air .
We need our planet , and some of us are starting to realise everyone can make a difference .

Moreover , other transport means are nowadays faster , cheaper , cleaner than before .
Buses and subways in big cities help us avoid trafic .
Planes are now easy to access .
Trains are silent , direct , and clean .

Whithin twenty years , progress might allows us to leave our cars to the garage .
Yet it is a tought goal to achieve as , like i said , cars are part of our daily culture .
And men are attached to traditions .
Would your picture James Bond without his car ?
Young boys think it might help them in seducing girls .
Adults forgot how to live without a car .
The car Industry is still creating new attractive engines .
We , indeed have a long way to go , and there is no assurance that the number of cars will significativly go down by the time we reach 2026 .
