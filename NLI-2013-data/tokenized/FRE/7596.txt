To be honest , I disagree with the given statement , which suggets that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , for many reasons .
In my opinion , if you travel accompanied by a guide and a group , you will not be totally free of any movement .
I mean , usually , this kind of organized travel plans the trip from the beginning to the end and you have no other choice than to follow it .
When I am travelling , I prefer to remain able to decide where I want to go and what I want to see .
The guided tour will obviously take me to the most touristic points in the country I am visiting , but usually , those places are not the most interesting , judging by the differents trips I had the chance to do .
It is not rare while visiting a city or a country to find surprising places , mainly ignored by the tourists but many time more attractive and pleasant than the well-known sights .

When I decide to leave my daily routine to enjoy the pleasures of a trip abroad , it is always to go somewhere I can be alone .
I live in Geneva , Switzerland , in Downtown , so I am used to live surrounded by a lot of people .
So for me , travelling means going as far away as I can go from that , and doing it with a group does not exactly help to find this tranquility .
I do not talk about leaving with a friend or a few people , even though I have never travelled with more than one person , but it is still a huge difference compared to travelling with a bunch of people you mostly do not know .

Another point which makes me disagree with the statement is that I absolutely hate the guided tours .
Do not get me wrong , it is not that I do not like the cultural aspect which can lead me to learn a lot of interesting things , but I find utterly boring to listen to someone who repeated his speech so many times he does not take any pleasure to do it anymore .
I prefer get the cultural information from a travel book or from a local citizen , who often love to proudly talk about the history of his country .
You cannot even stop some once they started , but at least they do it led by their heart .

To sum up , I could say I do not have any interest by going in vacation with a group and a guide .
