Nowadays , as we all noticed , advertisements have been becoming more and more atractive .
As far as i am concerned , i totally agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Indeed , first of all because i believe that it is a kind of marketing just to make people choosing one specific brand and not an other one .
For instance , you can quickly think that you want to buy something that you had see on T.V. whereas , if you did not have see it you even may not know that the product exist before .

Moreover , secondly i am convinced that advertisements are liable to lie about the quality but also about the apparence of the products .
Infact , most of the time , a product can seem the best of the world on the picture and when you go to buy it , you are generaly disapointed .

Finally , even if , sometimes , the product conrespond exactly to what the advertisement show , that case remain very seldom today .
Furthermore , because of the progress of new technology , you can now modify pictures even on television in order to turn them more atractive and interesting for people .
As a conclusion i would say that we do not have to trust in apparences but better in our own opinion of the product just to avoid falling in the new consomation society .
That is the only way to be less disapointed byt
