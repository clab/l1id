The way for student to understand ideas is a really important thing if they want to succeed in life .
Some tend to understand the ideas and concept , but in an another way , there are some who perfer to understand only the facts .
Nowdays , it is true that most of them prefer to learn facts .
But in general , what is the best way ?

Personnaly , i do not think that learning only facts is the best solution .
Indeed , this type does not help us in our everyday life .
For example , in history , i do not think that learning only fact is enough to understand the mains points , they juste pick them out and forget them later , so the work is not using .
However , this kind of understanding can work sometimes of course , but one day , you will not be able to deal with any subject .

Now i am going to deal with what i think would be the best way to do in life .

First of all , comprehenssion is the base thing that everyone must learn and improve in his whose life .
Indeed , if you are able to understand the ideas and concepts , you will be self confident and all steps of your life would be easier for you to overcome .
For example , in school and espacilly in highschool , the best student are those who use their brain in this way , that 's we uselly say that they are clever .
By the way , a friend of mine understand only ideas , i mean , he works only with his memory .
Thus , he is not so well in school and i am better than fim because i focus on understanding the concerpt of things than learn facts .

Finally , we havve seen that is important for student to understand ideas and concepts .
Althought many people regard this way as a wrong thing , they are probably wrong .
Everybody who think like that should change .
