I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do this maybe because of my personnal experience .
Actually , I am a young student still in high school and think that I really do enjoy life more than my parents for example .
I am saying this because being young meens not a lot of reponsibility and a lot more freedom .

First , I want to say that as a young student I am not responsible for a lot of things in my life .
Of course , except the education success but this could also be my decision , to be successful or not .
Nevertheless young people are not resposible for any criminal act : when a young boy is for example charged of something , the parents take full responsibiliy .
In addition , young people have no job stress , they only have a school to worry about but no more and the work done at school could not be compared to the work of a real job .
we have no responsibility of living as our parents cover all our personal needs .
We have then no responsibility of finding a job to be able to live .

Less responsibility , is more freedom .
I think that young people have more time in every aspect of life .
An important aspect are mistakes ; in fact we have more time when young to make mistakes and correct them .
For example , I can make a bad decision choosing what I want to study , being young allows me to reconsider my decision and start another program or course on another field of study .
I can see also from my situation that being old disadvantage you from doing a lot of activities .
My father , who was a grat tennis player in his younger life have now a back problem and ca n't even run for a long period of time .
I cannot immagine myself not playing soccer when I grow older .
Being young means doing things that a lot of older people would n't do , like partying frequently .
young people have this caracter that pushes them to go dance and spend a lot of time with friends and do a lot of things at the same time .

With the reasons and examples stated before , I came to a conclusion that being young allows to enjoy life more than being old .
this could be different for other people
