It would be too easy to simply agree or disagree this statement .
I will explain in the following paragraphs why both are very useful .

First we need experts who have a great and deep knowledge about a very specific topic .
The reason for this is quite simple .
Without expert how could man discover new theory in physics for example or create new technologies .
If Thales had never existed man might not have discover a very important mathematical theory , and it is the same for Newton , Galileo , or even Einstein .
Without experts we might consider than man would not progress much and would remain at the same state for millions of years .
When you see how was life a thousand years ago and how life is today you understand that these experts are compulsory for man .

On the other hand of course we need people who have a broad knowledge of plenty of academic skills .
We need them because they are the links between the different experts in our society .
Besides to fully understand a situation it is sometime a lot more useful to have a great background based on different areas of knowledge than being a specialist on one specific subject .
For example , to lead a project you will need someone , the project manager , who will be able to understand various areas of activity so that he can sum up all the work done for the project and lead the project properly to reach the expectations of it .
This person does not need to fully understand all the details which are know by the experts , but he needs to have little knowledge in various areas to understand all the experts who do not always work on the same subject .
In other words this kind of person are useful because they can understand the `` big picture '' .

To conclude , it must be understood that we need both kind of person because the work of the first one complete the work of the second .
It is like in nature , we need water and fire .
