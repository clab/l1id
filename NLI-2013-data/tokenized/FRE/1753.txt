To have large knowledge is well for your personality but have so much knowledge could destroy your base .

When Iwas young my dream is to become an engineer in electronic .
Everybody told me that i have to study a lot to become an engineer one day .
Thus I did my study in different school with different specialization : Architectural , Science , Communication , Marketing , Technology , etc ...
I was very tire at the end of my study because i did differents school , so i lost most part of my life just for study .
And what do I become now .
Do i an engineer ?
In fact I understood one thing which is important for me , now I understand that my really dream is not to become an engineer but higher than an engineer .
Six years before I began my really dream , I mean I study in engineering school after differents schools .
Last year when I had the diploma of engineer , I realised that I need to go higher than Engineer .
That is the reason why this year I decide to study the MBA School .
For sure that the MBA is higher that Engineer even I had it .

This is an experience that I would like to share with other people who need it .
What did I learn from this lesson .
In fact I understood that study to have broad knowledge is important but it is very dangerous and have to be carefully to not go away .

Therefore specialize only one specific subject is well but you need to enlarge your knowledge to extend the communication with other type of people , that 's mean Business man , Engineer , Scientist ...
