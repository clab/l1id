I I totally agree with this statement for many reasons .

Firstly , our ailing planet is in a bad state and I think that people will realize that we have to halt destructive pratices .
Cars emit greenhouses gases which are partly responsibles for pollution and global warming .
I believe that governments of developped countries will carry out measures in order to cut greenhouses gas emissions .

Some say argue that my point of view is not realistic but I think that natural related disasters like drought , coastal flooding caused by a rise in sae level ..
.0 will convince people to find alternatives energy and ways of transportation and use public transportations .
I think really that it is possible to sensitive people to environnemt problems .
To support my point of view we can cite the exemple of hurricane Katrina which has showed to the wehole word that it is urgent to decrease pollution otherwise we will have serious problems in the future .

Secondly , on my opinion an increase of oil cost will encourage people to walk or to use public transportations .
Indeed oil is scarce and it will become more and more difficult to find and extract it .
Until now , the high prize of oil has been responsible for some economic crisis .
Moreover , there are no other energy souces which can entirely be used instead of oil .

Another reason of my opinion is that thingsd are always changing and I believe that we we will find more interesting tranportations and that researchers will succeed in imagining more pratise , faster transportations .
