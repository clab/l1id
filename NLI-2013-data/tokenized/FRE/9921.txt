I think that this statement is true .
Indeed , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they allready know how to do well .
First , trying something new can only be positive .
Humans base their thoughts on their experience .
However , if this experience is repetitive the lessons to learn from it are always the same ones .
Experience needs diversity to be usefull as situations that we come across in life are always different .
Doing something different from what we are used to can therefore be considered as an investment and every investment has risks and returns .
For example , a painter who uses a new painting technique has more risks to fail in its tasks than if he sticks to his old technique .
However , he will learn a new way to paint that will probably pay off one day .

Another angle for this question is human nature .
Indeed it is in human 's nature to always take risks to improve .
People improve their way of doing things by doing them more efficiently and success can be defined as achieving one 's goal .
People tend to perpetually improve .
They find new ways to achieve their goals more efficiently .
They are considered successfull by their peers .
So trying new things and taking risk are in fact main factors of success .

It is even truer today .
In our society , everyone has to have the latest electronic gadget .
So being new is actually becoming part of the definition of success .
In a word , successfull people take risks and try new procedure to improve their way of doing things .
