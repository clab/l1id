In ancient Greece , a philosopher who founded his own school expected applicants to know geometrics as well .
Is that still the case today ?
We shall hereby prove that due to the advance of sciences , this has become almost impossible , though a broad culture is a paramount asset to modern life .

Many philosophers and geniuses throughout history showed that having an extremely broad knowledge was possible : Voltaire french philosopher of the end of the seventeenth century , was an famous writer as well as a good ingeneer in agriculture .
At these times , there had been a major intellectual movement whose goal was to gather every scientifical and technical knowledge in encyclopedias .
Since there was not many of them , contributors to those books had to acquire this knowledge themselves !
Moreover , it was seen as a way to set oneself appart from old religious schemes which were seen as a tool of obscurantism .

Yet , now that Science triumphed from religious doctrines which were judged somehow simplistic as explanations of natural processes , the scientifical methodology itself has made universal knowledge virtually impossible to gather for one individual alone .
Being the key to the improvement of production and the welfare of human beings , science was rationalized to such an extent that no one can publish any decent academic article or research works without having been granted the diplomas to do so , which implies studying the subject for durations that can reach decades .
One usually has to attend classes for more than ten years to become a doctor !

Nevertheless , one must not forget that science binded with elitistic norms of education can become a threat to democracy , as soon as knowledge becomes the private property of a small group of overspecialized office holders .
Ignorance as a way to keep people under control was most commonly used in authoritarian regimes such as South Africa , in which the coulour-skinned could not be taught in English , which was the language of the administration .

This aims to prove that though specialization is required nowadays , a broad culture is vital to everyone in order to prevent any abuse .
