The issue is a complex and though provocking issue that merits a closer look .
Some people believe that in the future there will be less cars in use than they are today , whreas others oppose this oppinion and support that there will be more cars than today .
The latter position is certainly the stronger of the two and would be expected in detail .

First and foremost , the poor countries will develop themselves .
For instance , they will create roads , will sophicate themselves .
Because the population will earn more money and the development of this countries , the population will use cars .
For example I went in marocco and it is very amazing to see how the development of the country has influenced the number of cars in the country .

Besides being important for the development of the poor countries , it is also important for the pollution .
We all know that cars are not good for the nature because they polluate it .
But , a new oil was dicovered and will less poluate than the older .
Two days ago , the french government annouced that we will use it soon and that it will be less expensive than the older .
So it will be very good because you will not be a real danger for the nature and you will spend less money by driving .

The position I support is the best because the car will stay usefull and the public transport will not be like the cars .
For example if you want to give a present to someone , you just have to put it in the case of your car whereas , if you would use public transport , you would have to bring it everywhere during all the day and to walk with it , it is not very usefull .

After examing the above examples , it is obvious that this indeed the stronger position .
When we took into account the next development of the poor countries , the new oil and the usefullness of the car , it is clear that we must agree with the following statement : in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .
