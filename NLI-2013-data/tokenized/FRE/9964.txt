I strongly agree with the statement that ` successful people are the ones who try and undertake new things but also take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well . '

Although without much further thought being given to the topic , it may seem that people who always do the same thing are ` successful ' in a way , there are many other factors to take into account .
In fact , the persons who carry out the same task every day or the ones who go through their life with the same amount and state of knowledge could be considered successful experts in their areas but they do not try to go beyond their limits - a clear sign of success .

Let 's take the example of a basic biologist in a laboratory whose daily task is to analyze blood samples to detect a disease such as AIDS .
This scientist is obviously an expert in his domain and most certainly successful since the accuracy of his decision affects the life of other people .
And yet , this biologist would not be qualified to detect more specific chronic diseases for example , thus reducing the scope of what could be considered as success in his area .

On the other hand , given the definition of success , it can be implied that the more success one derives is closely linked to the actions he or she will undertake and make proof of .

Let 's consider the business area : a successful manager will most likely be the one that is willing to take up new challenges .
By being creative and clearly demonstrating different skills from the ones of his or her competitors , this manager will probably take more risks but resulting in higher profits .

Therefore a manager will appear - and be more successful - if he is willing to face new challenges and take risks that will make his business famous .
Unlike a business leader who would only gain profits and recognition from copying the works of others , a successful leader will be praised for his or her creativity , a great part of success .

Bill Gates is probably the most obvious example of a manager who was ready to take risks and accept the consequences of it .
Who would have thought that his new generation of computers would become the world standard and result in such high profits both for the company and the man itself ?

Although money should not be considered a proof of success , it is a great part of it .
Therefore , the more a person takes risks , the more exclusive his or her derived product is and the more success he/she is likely to have .
