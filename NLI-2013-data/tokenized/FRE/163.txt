Cars have caused many problems to the society , such as pollution , some have been resolved , others not : For the pollution special equipemets have been invented to reduce it , but people wants more Will car evolutions be enought to make them survive ?

Cars are causing a lot of problems : pollution as I mentionned , but also costs required for their functionnement ( rising price of oil ) , noises they make and perturbations they cause in traffic of big cities .

To these issues car-makers are offering several evolutions , but it is not enought : many brands of car have recently be in great financial troubles .
General motors or ford are exemples in the United States : they had to reduce their productions and have made big changes in their direction .
They also lost many point in bourse cotation , and had to fire many people .

In France the same problem of lose of competition has appeared recently : brands like Renault or Peugot have lost more than 10 % of their market part last month .
This is going to lead to main restructurations in the next few monthes .
For these reasons cars do not have a bright future , and a reduction of their number can be predict in a few years .

Altought all of these elemets tend to confirm the car decrease , I think that cars have not already done their time , or at least the new generation of cars .
To my mind car brands have many resources , every sector has been in difficulties in a period of time .
They are inventing a new generation of car which is going to revolutionate the world of cars : new cars are going to work without petrol , but with more clean materials .
For this reason they are adapting to new mentalities of saving environment .
These cars will make less noise , and will be more adapted to an urban life .

Also all brands are not going bad : brands from Asia as Nissan or Toyota are growing up in the United States and in Europe : they may remplace local brands .

To conclude , in my opinion even if traditional cars may dissapear in a few years , they will be remplaced by new cars and the number of them is not in significantly going to decrease .
So we will be confront to an evolution .
