Nowadays , people start worrying about the future of the car .
The car is an everyday necessity for most people in our developed countries but it also raises many issues such as pollution and urban mobility .
I think that within twenty years , there will be fewer cars for these two issues will have been adressed .

Urban mobility is a major subject for all big cities all over the world .
If you want to keep a city attractive for investors , workers , tourists and inhabitants , people have to be able to move , and what 's more , to move fast .
Of course , to make it possible , there 's a need for space .
The issue at state is obviously economical .
Traffic jams are a sign of a lack of space and above all the need to launch great urbanisation policies .
A few years ago , London decided to instaure a fee for cars who wanted to circulate in the inner city .
Paris , is launching a great campaign to encourage people to take public transportation instead of their own cars .
I reckon that efficient public transportation is the key success to an attractive city .
Cars are no longer the future of cities and for this reason there will be fewer and fewer cars within two decades .

But the most preoccupying problem caused by cars is pollution .
Indeed , cars are responsible for a large part of environmental problems such as the pollution of air .
Even though , cars are used everywhere in developed countires , they are concentrated in small urban centers , which makes it all the more concerning .
In cities , the density of cars and the traffic jams make pollution a real preoccupation .
Despite the urban mobility policies , the development of alternative technologies can also help to reduce pollution .
But , for these new technologies are expensive , I think people will prefer public transportation to these new cars .
Over all , there will be fewer cars because they cause too many problems .

In conclusion , I think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars because urban mobility will become a field of economic competition between big cities and that environment concerns will be taken seriously .
