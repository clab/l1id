`` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
Regarding the actual circumstances , such an assertion might appears surprising and even unrealistic .
Indeed , the selling rate of cars keeps increasing all over the word and especially in overcrowded countries such as India or China .
However , I agree and hope it will be true .
Reducing the number of car is in fact a fundamental element in order to protect the environment and to preserve futur generations from dramatic aftermaths .
I acknowledge it is going to be very hard to realise such an affirmation but it is not impossible .
Indeed , more and more people are aware of the importance of what is in stake when dealing with environment .
They become more and more conscious of the necessity not to use the car too often .
Even politics realise it .
In many Europeans capitals , decisions have been taken in order to deter people from using their car and encourage them to use other types of transports such as metro or buses .
In London , for instance , you must pay an important amount of money each time you want to go to the city with your car .
In Paris , reforms have also been made in favour of buses .
Another important factor not environmental but economic will help the the reduction of the number of cars to be achieved .
Statistics have shown that the price of the gasoil have increased so much during the last couples of years that people no longer can afford it as they used to be able .
Therefore , they do not used it as often as they used to do .
If such a trend were to be confirmed in the next twenty years , people might think about no buying a car anymore .
Also , a '' natural element '' will probably plead in favour of the reduction of the numbers of cars .
Gasoil is a limited natural ressource .
Unless a new resource were to discovered in the futur , cars might simply not be able to be in use anymore because of the lack of petroleum .
