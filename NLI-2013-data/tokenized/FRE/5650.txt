In our consumptive society , advertising is a mean used by firms to sell their products .
That is why they may sometimes made their products seem much better than they really are , but consumers have to be responsible ..

In fact , advertisement is the way to inform consumers about a new product .
However , firms aim at making benefits and so , at selling most of their products .
They use advertising as a way to sell them .
That is why their products are embodied by glamourous and beautiful people .
If we think a little about it , we can sell an ordinary product , whereas our concurrent same product is said to be miraculous or exceptionnal .
For example , if we are the President of L'Oreal , we will not say that our make-up is just a good product , but we will hire Julia Roberts to represent our brain and to say that she can not live without it .
That is how advertising works .

However , we live in this consumptive society , for many years now and we are accustomed to these strategies .
All consumers know that they do not often buy a real phenomenal product and they have to be careful on these advertisements and not to believe everything told .
Children and specially teenagers have to become aware of these dangers , or they will quickly spend all of their money .
Many associations have been founded in France and in other countries to fight against advertising .
They act in writting on all the advertisements located in the Metropolitan .
Nobody knows how many they are , but they aim at stopping advertisment expansion .

To conclude , I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but consumers also have to be stronger than advertising power .
Advertising is known for this particularity and we ca n't stop people to believe in this lies .
