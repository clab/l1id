Succeeding in life looks rather like a controversial question .
On the one hand , it is widely admitted that people taking risks are awarded .
It is true that when a person is taking a risk , it can helps him to succed .
On the other hand , it is also admitted that when you know how to do something well , you can succeed .
I would rather think that it is a combination of these two elements that makes you successful .

First , if someone is taking risks , it is obvious that the person will have to be concerned .
This means that a person will rather take some risks if he has skills on a topic or on a matter .
This statement can be highlighted especially in a professionnal context .
Indeed , in this particular context , taking risks can be innovating and trying to get a product well known from everyone .
If we consider this situation , the person is taking risks due to financial matters .
So , it seems obvious that the person must be aware of what he is doing .
Therfore , takimg risk and knowing to do well something are not contradictory , in order to be successful .

However , it can happened that you are taking risks in everyday life .
It is true that it can helps people to have more opportunities .
According to this , taking risks even when rationality would tell us not to something could certainly help us to succeed .
If someone is narrowminded and not open to learn new things , then it seems more likely that the person will have less chance to succed .

Finally , we could also say that as the notion of success can be different fro ; one person to another , this statement is subjective .
Indeed , any definition of being successful is given .
Success can rise in different situation .
For instance , some people can think that success means success in professionnal life .
But , other people could say that you succeed when you have a family .

To sum up , both sides of the statement could be defended .
I think that a combination of taking risks and knowing how to do things well is mandatory to succeed .
