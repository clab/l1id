Since cars were invented by humans , each generation gets more and more cars .
My grand-parents had one car for the family , both of my parents had their own car and now i get mine .
This situation underlines a lot of problems that we can discuss in this essay .
I will talk about the resources such as gas or petrol , about the environement , about the public transports , about the new technologies and i will conclude with my own vision of the future .

The first argument that comes to my mind when i think about vehicules is the problem of the natural resources .
Indeed we are more and more on this earth and we use more cars .
But we do n't have unlimited resources .
There will be no more petrol in less than fifty years and we will have to find a solution .

The second argument is the one of the environment .
Cars reject a lot of carbon in the air and that 's so bad for our earth that is suffering more everyday .
With less cars there will be less pollution .
But are we ready to stop that situation ?

Those two arguments are a reality and in the facts , they will contribute to say that there will be less cars in the future .

But there are two arguments that i want to talk about and that could show the contrary .

First , public transports are not very developped except in the big towns .
For example , I live in Angers and if I want to go to my school it will last 40 minutes by bus against 5 with a car .

To finish , i 'd say that there is new techologies for the car resources such as the clean diesel that contaminates less and that consumes very less .
That makes economies for everyone .

To conclude , I think that there is a fatality for the car industry , with no resources there is no cars but i think that we will develop new technolgies such as oil carburant or things that could provide a cheapest and cleanest resource for ours transports .
My conclusion is that there will be more and more cars in the future .
