Understanding is an important aspect of the student education nowadays .
It is very important to understand ideas and concepts that should help the students to be aware on its subject .

In some areas in the world and at a certain level of the education , student learn facts and do not try to understand the topic .
This has a great consequences on the ability of students to express themsleves on any topic .
Understanding concepts and ideas help students to implement the ideas and concepts they understood by trying to make realistic as possible .
In the same way , students ability to to think is reinforced and their critical point of view would arise .
For instance , when we explain a concept to a student and then we ask him to use that concept in his real life experience , he would be able to do it perfectly and at the moment we are sure that he understood instead of just learning the fact given by a teacher in class .

Furthermore , a student who understands ideas and concepts should be able to give his own point of view in different manners .

Based on my own experience I encooutered some students that learn facts and are not able when you ask them thinking question related on that topic to answer correctly .
One day I helped a student to learn his biology lesson on root systems , they learned that are two types of root systems .
I asked him to give me the difference between those types and I was amazed because he was not able to do that , but when I asked him to give me the two different types he started to give me all the writings of his notebook ; this means that the student did not try to understand but only learning .

In conclusion , based on my explanation and support above mentioned , I agree with the statement that It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
