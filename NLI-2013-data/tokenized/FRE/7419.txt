First , it should be noticed that the statement can be divided into two distinct and independent parts .
A part of the statement says that the best way to travel is in group and an other part of the statment says that it is better to travel with a guide .
These two statments are independent because one can travel alone with a guide or a group can travel without guide .

Concerning the first part of the statement , I personally believe that it is better to travel alone or with a small group for the following reasons .
It is much slower to move frome one place to another with a group ; there is always somone late we have to wait for .
As a result , we spend more time gathering people and waiting for lost persons than actually travelling and seeing the country .
Another reason that leads me to think that travelling alone is better is that it allows you to meet people , which is to my opinion one of the most interesting aspect of a trip .
I like to travel because I enjoy getting in touch with foreign people , I have always been facinated by the diversity in life style that one encounters in our world .
While some people are mostly interested in taking a sunbath on the beach or having parties in night clubs ; I would rather try to exchange ideas an opinions with local inhabitants , which is I admit not always a success .
This is why I prefer to travel on my own since when we are in a group , which are most likely from our home country , we tend to stay with them instead of knowing local people .

Nevertheless , I do not think that being led by a guide is necessarily a bad choice ; a tour guide can show us places that we would never had found by oureselves , especially if the guide comes from the country we are visiting .
But here again , I believe that having a guide for a smaller group is more interesting since we have more opportunities to speak with him and to ask him questions than we would have in a larger group .
It would be even better if the guide is not someone we pay but a good friend ; good firends are the best guides because they what we like and they can therefore adapt the content of the tour to our personal preferences .
