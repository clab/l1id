More and more types of advertisements are being developed and improved , due to better knowledge and advanced technologies used by the professionnals in communication .

Today , everywhere you go , at anytime , everything you read , contains advertisements .
In the newspapers , magazines , in the metro/bus stations , on AM/Fm stations , on TV commercials , on Internet etc .
Our lives are surrounded by advertisements .
The problem is that all what we see or hear about is not truly the exact product or service that the advertisement claims .
The most accurate example is the advertisement of food , especially fast-food .
In fact , the picture advertising a huge hamburger made with fresh ingredients , in a precised shape , at an affordable price , is not quite realistic .
It gives you a feeling that it might be true , real and make you go and check it out .
But when this perfect lunch is in your hand , you do not look at the picture in the same way !

This is the main purpose of advertising : it is not only the opportunity to make people know about the company , but it is more about a product that we do not know , we do not necessarily need , but it looks attractive and accessible to all .
Also , with today 's advanced technologies in designing and imaging products , it is even easier to show anything , anything but what you really sell .
The actual hundreds ways to `` sculpt your body '' , `` redefine your figure '' , etc. using these new technologies in picturing perfect bodies , make the products seem to be the best and valuable , which is not .

In conclusion , I can say that I do agree with the fact that what we see in everyday advertisements is very far from what we really get .
In other words , everything that seems to be is not what it really is .
