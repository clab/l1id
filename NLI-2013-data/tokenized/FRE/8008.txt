Usually , when we think about globalization and its consequences , we often focus on economics implication or technological ones .
One major change that this controversial process has brought - but that is too frequently omitted - concerned the way people are travelling .
As a matter of fact , since the internet has started to be available almost everywhere , a lot of destination that used to be unaccesible for the common traveller are now safe and cheaper .
This whole new environment led many travellers to quit the traditionnal way of travelling abroad - in a group with a tour guide - for a wilder type of trip : alone without anybody to guide you - no matter what your destination is .
As far as I am concerned , I truly think that this new wave in the travelling industry is a good thing since it is way more interesting and exciting than the oldfashioned one .

First , travelling alone give you more liberty to visit what really you are really interested in .
If you do not like art museums then you wo n't be obligated to spend hours of your limited amount of time in a specific city admiring the work of Picasso .
Travelling on your own allow you to make up your personal itineary according to your tastes and not on the tour guide ones .
In the same order of ideas , travelling in a group can imply a lot of other constraints that may make your trip less enjoyable .
For instance , you often have to be at a specific place really early in the morning so you do n't really have the `` right '' to sleep in the morning , go the bed late etc .

However , the main disadvantages of travelling in a group with a tour guide is that it does not give you the opportunity to fully `` live '' and understand the culture of the country you are visiting .
Usually , tour guides bring you to the touristic hot spots where everyone speak English , have a camera and is able to act in a western way .
Consequently , you do n't really experience the real way of living of the locals as you do not get the chance to share their everyday lives .
On the opposite , travelling on your own - either with your backpack or in a more luxious way - allow you to explore hidden place , to get in touch with ordinary people from the street and to take the time to learn about the other .

I could go on with many others reasons that support my idea that the best way to travel is NOT in a group led by a tour guide but ultimately , I think than choosing the way you want to travel is more a matter of personality , of budget and of interest .
There is bad way of travelling .
But there is certainly one that suit you better .
