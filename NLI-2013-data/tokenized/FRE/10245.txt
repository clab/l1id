People who tries new things and takes risks are more successful than the other one because creativity , chance and work are the recipe to get success .
People creative have most of the time ideas more interesting and new than the other .
To success in a domain you need to the first one or to be the better .
For instance , when you open a shop you need to have a new concept to be the first one .
In this case you create a new market .
It 's harder for an artist the paintings or readings must be totally new to be loved .
Who wants to buy a product of all the day or sees a paintings already made ?

But creativity is not enough to success .
One important ingredient is taking risks .
Taking a risk means go through the barrier imposed by yourself or by the society .
The risk could be in anyone aspect of the life on different domain .
For example , creating a new painting is be exposed to the judgement of people .
Opening a shop caused a financial risk for you and could imply your family .
So the risk is enhanced when you have a family .

But even if creativity and risk are linked one of the most important ingredient of this successful recipe is the work .
Without working the success is not guaranted even if you take risks or if you try new things .
Of course you can succeed one times but we can measure the success only on period of time like the length of the life .
You can have one mater-piece but it 's not really a success if you do n't have more than one .
For a shop it 's the same .
The first year could be really good but it 's not enough to judge of your success .

The success of course needs creativity and chance but it needs beyond all of work .
We can finally judge the success not only an action but more then on a life .
