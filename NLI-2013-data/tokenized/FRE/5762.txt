The use of cars today is almost `` automatic '' in our society .
Most households have at least one vehicle and people use their car for any purpose , from major trips to going to pick up groceries down the street .
However , the use of cars is being threatened by the lack of oil the world will be facing soon .
On the other hand , the use of car threatens our environment , contributing to the pollution of our atmosphere and to global warming .
What will the consequences be in twenty years ?
Will there be fewer cars or just higher pollution ?
What solutions will we find ?
So many questions to answer , so little time , and so much of our everyday life and comfort affected ...

I think that our society , in order to be able to have the many cars we have today , will need to find solutions to our biggest problems .
First of all , we are already facing the problem of the decreasing amount of oil leading to the price explosion of gasoline .
Exploiting oil becomes more and more expensive and rare , and it is starting to affect everyone who owns a car .
Any trip or use of the vehicle becomes pricy , and as a result , more and more people consider using public transportation .
I think this will eventually lead people to a better understanding of what the society as a whole can do : if there are fewer cars , it reduces the pollution and helps the environment .
From an individual point of view , using public transit will become cheaper as gasoline prices will go up .
For those reasons , and because I want to be optimistic , I think there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
People will realise how much money owning a car represents and most households will simply not be able to afford it .

Nonetheless , if governements and innovative corporations start to work hands in hands , solutions to find better environment-friendly resources to replace gasoline will appear .
As a result , people will be able to buy vehicles that work with elecricity or natural gas , and will be able to keep using their private means of transportation .
In this case , we will tend to see more cars than today , as the world population tends to grow .
Some solutions have already started to show up and enable us to keep confidence in the future .

However , I do believe that we are reaching the highest point of consumption today .
I doubt there will be more cars in the future , and I really hope people will consider public transportation as a great alternative , for the sake of everybody as well as for the preservation of our environment .
