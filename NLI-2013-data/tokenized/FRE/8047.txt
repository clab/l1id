In my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .
A general concept or idea is made of facts , which are statements found in textbooks or encyclopedias .
Nevertheless , it is clear to me that the importance of facts ca n't be decreased , because in certain fields of study such as history , facts are extremely relevant .
But in most fields of study , without a general understanding of the concept , facts appear worthless .

On one hand , concepts and ideas have an importance that ca n't be diminished , because those are the elements that will help one to learn the facts .
Without understanding the concept or the idea , a student will not be able to learn but more importantly to remember for a long period of time the facts related to the concept or idea .
For example , in an astronomy class , the concept of how the planets evolve is more important to understand than to know the exact figures or paths constituting the planet 's movement .

On the other hand , concepts and ideas are what help a student in his future professional life .
The facts can easily be found again in a textbook , on the internet or in any database .
But if the concept made by these facts is not understood , the student will not be able to use the facts properly .
For instance , a law student , as myself , has to learn a lot of facts and regulations .
However , those facts or rules wo n't be useful if the concept is not understood .
When , in the future , this law student who became a lawyer is confronted to a tough case , the general idea of how the law regulates on that matter will help him solve the case , whereas the only regulation , if not understood , wo n't .
In that example , the everyday life of a lawyer proves the importance of the concept because facts or regulation can be found easily .

In conclusion , general ideas or concepts are the essential part of what should be known and understood by every student .
However , what makes a student excellent is to both understand the concept and learn the facts .
