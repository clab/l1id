Nowadays , anybody can tavel anywhere and I think that choosing to travel with a group is a personal chose and it also depends on where you 're traveling and what you want to do while your traveling .

If you are planing to travel to Europe , I think that going with a group led by a tour guide is a good chose .
The main reason that people travel to Europe is to visit and to learn about all off those towns , musems , castles , bridges and monuments .
The tour guide will probably satisfy your willings conserning those kind of subjects , that 's his job .
Using a tour guide is when your taveling to visit .

You can also choose to travel with your family or wife just to relax , get away from town and have a good time .
For that kind of situation , you do n't need a tour guide .
You take your vacation in nice resorts to relax , to lay down on your back on the beach .
What 's the use for a tour guide if you plan to go on a trip under the sun to just have fun and to chill at the pool with a drink in your hand .

Also tour guides can cost a lot , you 're already paying a lot of money to travel , why pay more fore a tour guide .
I think the chose to travel with a group and a tour guide will always depend on where you are going and what you want to do in your vacations .
What 's the fun of getting in a groupe with a buch of people that you do n't know and not have all the right of going where you want and do what you want .
Traveling is to have fun and for me , somebody that tells you what to do , at what time to get up and that decides for you where to go is not having fun .
Choosing the way you want to travel is personal and choosing whit who and whit a tour guide is also a personal chose .
It 's for those reason that I disagree with the statement .
