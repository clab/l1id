Even if I agree with one aspect of the subject , I disagree with an other .
Let me explain .
When you learn many different things in many different subjects , it makes you having very interesting discussions and debates when you meet people for example .
When the people you meet get interested in what you say , or when they see that you are understanding what they say on specific issues , they will appreciate you and what you are saying .
When you are specialised on one specific subject , people will think that you are very smart and that you know a lot of things , but they wo n't always be interested in what you say .
For example a specialised botanist who will talk during hours about flowers to someone who is n't interested in it , will seem to be a boring person .
Someone who knows many things will have more different friends .
There are also jobs where you need to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
For example , journalists are expected to know many different things on different topics , they would n't have time to get all this knowledge if they had to get specialised .
I cannot imagine a journalists who would n't know some things about politics , sports , history etc .
On an other hand being specialised , means knowing almost everything about an issue .
When you work or learn at school with people who share the same interests , they will appreciate all the things you know .
When someone has a passion in one field , why would he need so much knowledge in other subjects .
Finally , at school it is better to have a broad knowledge of many subjects because if you 're good at one and not in an other subject , you will fail your general exams and do the same class one more year , whereas when you are specialised in one subject it is good but it is not enough .
So even if I understand both opinions , I do more agree with the first one which says that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
