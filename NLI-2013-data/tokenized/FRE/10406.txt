I ca n't help thinking that people who take risks have to be rewarded .
But there are all the same numerous limits at this judgement .
First , I am convinced that when a person takes risks , she must be aware of the dangers of a possible failure .
When that person knows these dangers , I feel that if she achieves what she wanted , she is rewarded for numerous endeavours she did .
For instance , when a man or a woman decides to open a store or a restaurant , he or she does not know the success of it .
If this person works hard in order to improve his or her way of life , it is normal that his or her situation changes positively .
Furthermore , ambitious people can employ other people and help the society to fight against the unemployment .

In general , good things come to those who have the ambition to change their life .
However , numerous people make efforts to change their life but they do n't succeed .
They do n't have the success they hoped and are not rewarded .

What 's more , people who do only what they already know how to do well should be successless than people who take risks , at the conditions that they are aware of what they do .
We must also take into account the level of risks .
Indeed , the success may be proportional to the rate of risks , it is tantamount to saying that people who take more risks should be more rewarded .
For instance , when a man becomes a manager , he takes more risks than he was a simple employee .
He earns , therefore , more money than before .

I would like to conclude by saying that I agree with this statement because , as I see it , people who take risks should be rewarded .
However , they must know the consequences of a failure before starting their business .
