For student , to understand ideas and concepts which represent the theory , and to learn fact which is the practice ; are both important .

The practice is necessary in fields such as Sciences .
To make a theory , you have to practice first .
A basic example will be the gravity discovery by Newton : when an apple fell on his head .
All experiences bring to a conclusion which is the theory .
But before arriving to the theory , scientists have to define the problem , make hypothesis , practice , find a solution and draw an hypothesis .

Nowadays , in science class such as chemistry , physic , or biology , students have to follow the same pattern : problem , hypothesis , practice and solution which lead to the theory .

Thus the theory is the result of the practice .
For education and everyday life , it is very important .
It represents a base , a fundemental part to understand a topic .
Before doing an application , you have to know the application in the entire .
The theory is very important because , it explains how something works .
For example , you will not use a technological product without reading the instruction book .
Also , in mathematics with complicated formulae , the practice can be very hard , that is why it is easier to give directly the theory to students .

But we could say that theory can be easier than the practce , because theory demand only to speak .
On the contrary , practice is to get involve in a project and make things to achieve , which is much more difficult .

I disagree with this statement , because , to my mind , for students , it is not more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .
For them , both are important .

To receive the best instruction , it is necessary to undersand ideas and learn facts as well , if not the education will not be complete .
