Some people think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects while others think it is better to focus on one specific subject .

I do think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects for two different reasons .

First , students who study more than one academic subject are able to understand better the world around them .
They will have a more open minded view .
They will be able to talk with different types of people .
However , it is important to notice that it is sometimes very hard to study two very different subjects at the same time .
In addition , you are sometimes prevented by your college to pick up two subjects .
It is why I do think that the idea of broad curriculum introduced in some universities is a very good one .
Last year , I studied Law and was granted the right to pick up one subject of Business .
It was definitely a good thing because my business class helped me to underdand my Commercial Law class .

Second , in a lot of jobs nowadays , you need more than one qualification .
For instance , one of my friend studied enginering and business at school .
He is now the head of the selling division of an electric companies thanks to his double diploma .
As far as my concerned , I work part time in a property developer company .
This type of company is a perfect example of a job where you need the knowlege of many academic subjects such as enginering , business and Law .
You are faced with the writting of contracts ( Law ) , the financing of operations ( Business ) and sometimes a lot of problems related to the plans or the construction of the building .

To conclude , It is very important to have a broad knowledge of many acaedmic subjects because of the different types of problems we will have to face .
