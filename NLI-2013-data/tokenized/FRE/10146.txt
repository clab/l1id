I totally agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .
Many various examples can illustrate the exactitude of this statement .

First , the evolution of the medecine and of the new discovered remedies is perhaps the best example ever of this statement .
Over time , scientifists have made very important discoveries .
As a result , people can live longer and healthier than before .
Even though we have not found yet any remedy for AIDS , we have already made a lot of progress in the treatment of this horrible disease .

Another very illustrative example of this idea is the example of the chef in a very famous restaurant .
If he want to keep his reputation and his clients , he will have to try again and again new recepies .
He cannot keep the same menu for years and years .
Therefore , he has to innovate and try new tastes , new combinations of aliments .
This implies also to take some risks .
Indeed , the chef is never sure that the clients will love the new kind of food he has cooked .

Finally , the evolution of the plane is also very illustrative of this statement .
Years ago , people would not have imagine being able to fly one day .
However , thanks to some brave pilots , we can now flight from one continent to another in a very short time .
This amazing improvement in transportation would not have been possible without ambitious pilots and engineers .

In conclusion , I really believe that we have to try new things and take risks if we want to be successful .
Therefore , I want to find a creative job that allows me to try new experiments and to take risks .
I am conviced that it is the best attitude to adopt if we want to improve our way of life .
