I almost agree with this statement , but i think some criticize can be inferred .
Actually for some context it is obviously better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , like in college or with others students but also to be abble to choose what you want to do .
While to be specialize in one specific subject can close some possiblities , but it wil be easier to be outstanding in one specific subject .

On the one hand to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is the system of all schools , when you are young you do n't learn just french or math , you have learned everything in the same time .
There is a reason of this system , he has been created to be allow the student to be open minded , the history show us how is important to be not focus on only one thing , even the great genius was n't focused on only one subject .
Lets take an example , Leonard Da Vinci was a genius in paint so during his life he has developed this quality , but not only he was also interested by the biology , more specefically how the human body works .

On the other its allows to choose what you really want to do .
For me it is important to have choice between diferents specialities , i mean i have to know a little bit of everything if i want to make a good choice about my future .
For example when i was young i was really interested by litterature , i started to read really early so i thought maybe the best thing for me is to take litterature class later , but i realized how wrong i was when i discovered my love for biology .
So i decided to not make choice between two things that i love , i decided to try another academic subjects , to know a broad of everything , and maybe later i will specialize .

Now , i study in law college so i am specialized but it 's ok because i made some diferents things before i choose law .
So i just to improve myself in law , which is already hard but more easier than if i have all academic subjects .
