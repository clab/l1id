This statement implies a double response for me .
Indeed in my essay I will give several reasons to show that I agree with this statement but there is also some reasons which make me think that older people can enjoy life more than young people .

When we are young we have less resonsability so we make things without thinking of the consequences .
For example , if we want to act dangerously , this is our own decision , we have not a family to protect .
In this sense , young people enjoy life more because they have nobody to worry about .
If they desire they can just have fun .
We can also say that young people are more lead to do extraordinary things such as leaving a family and going in a place they do not know , just because it is a new experience .
Indeed most of the time they do not plan what they will do , they do not spend hours thinking about the consequences .
They just live the present moment .

However what is also true is that old people can enjoy life too .
Indeed they do but in a different way .
They are happy with very little .
For instance listenning the birds sing or staying in their home with their grandchildren .
They have a greater maturity than the youngers ones have .
So they do know care about details .
They have lived a lot of things and pains .
They are able to see the world with a distance so they can see what is important or not .
This enables them to enjoy life .

As a conclusion what I want to say is that we cannot really say if young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I would say that it depends on the context of our life .
It depends also on the experience we had throughout our life .
