Every body have a weak in learnig , it seems to be boring and annoying , we do prefer understanding concepts , in all case teenagers ans students nowadays dont disapprouve me. we first have to know the advantages and inconvenients of learnings facts then we ll pass to the carachteristics of undesating ideas and concepts .

pupils are less ans less patient in the academies and the try to escape the learning , but we should know that learning facts help us a lot for example if we have a test wich we are only required to give defintions like it was written in a book , we have to learn the concepts obligatory .
i can add the it certainly help you for your after conversations with the others , the quality of your communication ll be better and you ll have more things to tell .

There is now a kind of people who learn without knowing thhe concepts that is the big mistake , because in the reflexion questions the will be blocked and cannot response efficiently .

Understanding concepts without learnig them can be a possible solution but not adapted in some cases .
Understanding ideas and concepts show how the pupil is clever and his ability to print lesson in his mind .
nevertherless some students overact and limit there comprehesnion without revising anymore .
Unstead of escape the learning part , we must be clever and combine understanding and learning to obtain better results .
That s what i try to do this year , the french baccalaureat need learnings facts by heart , but meanwhile i do my best to understand the difficult concepts of economy , law and management .

it is shown that the best way to improove results in general is the combinaison of this two fundemantal procedure in school .
we all have to use it if we are ambitious and expecting succes .
