Is advertisement misleading ?
That I think the way we can rephrase this statement .
The question implies that actually yes it might be the case .
But let 's review what is advertisement and discuss whether the process is aimed at `` embellishing '' the truth ?

What is the role of advertisement ?
It is , I believe to make aware the largest population of consumers possible of the existence of a new product .
So advertisement technically has a value of information .
At the same time it has the mission to promote to graeter number of people the product .
The ultimate aim of the advertisement is to convince the majorite of consumers to buy the product .

But I believe there is clear distinction between informing a poulation of the existence of a new product and promoting a product .
Informing is communicating facts in its minimal and truthful way .
For example , a new drug comes to the market and as health advocate you want to inform the community and health professionals .
What are you going to tell thes professionnals ?
You will give all the elements about the drug ( chemical entity , mechanism of action ) that help people to understand what it is , who it is for , and what are the risks associated with its use .

Now when you see the avertisement for a drug , a drug for arthritis ( painfull debilitating disease ) for example what do you see ?
The add tells you what it is and who can benefit from it .
But it is also showing you some great , slim , lady happily jumping , running , .
In addition , in many cases , it 's also telling you that it 's much better than so and so .
So what does it mean .
Is this drug much better your cure ?
Does the advertisemnt refklects tells you what to expect from tyhat drug ?
My answer to that is not so simple .
The advetisemnt is not lying but it does n't give you the real facts , the truth .
It does n't telll you , for example , thatthis drugs is good f for only one category of the population , that drug may have some unplaesant side effect .

So my advice : be circumspect when it comes to advertised drugs .
