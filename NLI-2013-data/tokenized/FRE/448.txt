`` You should go to school , learn a lot of different things ... ''
That is what parents often said .
But I not completly agree the fact that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

In deed , I support the way that specialization is a good thing .
So , people know what they are talking about .
In some fields , like men who built houses , specialization is necessary : how could be someone as good the painting as wood table ?
Furthermore , it implies a more longer study if you want to have a broad knowledge .

Moreover , if someone has a broad knowlede , I think it is impossible that he knows accurently all his many academic subjects he had even learned .
This is a great problem , there is not a lot of people in the world who have this capacity .
You need to be very smart , like Leonard from Vinci .
He is a good exemple ...

Nevertheless , in contrary to my first explaination , it is important too , to have people who know a little bit of all .
Important because those people will bring an opening mind : they will be the referant between specialists .
And because of their knowledge , they will be able to resolve problem and manage a team .
That 's why they confere a great adaptibility .

To conclude with this statement , i think that in a society we need specialists and we need generalists .
The both are complate themselves .
But like specialized doctors in esthetic for example , could n't ze imagine more people who could have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and after that more specialized in one subject ?
