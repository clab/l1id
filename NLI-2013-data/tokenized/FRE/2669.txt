At first glance , we could easily think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
However , I disagree with this statement .

There is no denying that young people seem to be much more dynamic , excited and ambitious than older people .
As far as I am concerned , I have the feeling to do many more things than my parents do .
I study sciences , I practice different sports , I play saxophone and I go out with my friends every week-end .
By contrast , my parents are less active and prefer watching TV .
In addition , I will not reveal the number of old peolple that told me that I was lucky to be young as if they were suffering from their life .
Hence , young people give the impression to be really excited by life whereas older people seems to be less enthusiastic .

However , beyond these appearances , I feel that young people do not enjoy life more than older people do .
First and foremost , young people are not as happy as others could think .
Especially in France , the youth face lots of social and economic problems that affect happiness .
For example , last year , thousands of French students demonstrated in the streets to blame the government for not taking seriously into account the dramatic unemployment for young people .
Lots of them cannot find a job even if they have a good degree and thus they do not succeed in making an adequate living to provide their future families .
Moreover , it is frightening to see how great the number of young people who killed themselves is .
These example provide the evidence that young people are not as happy as others might think .

Lastly , we should not forget how happy lots of old people .
Being parents or grand parents might be one of the most important thing in a human life .
