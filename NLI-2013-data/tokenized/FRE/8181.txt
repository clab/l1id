In whatever lesson , we learn ideas , concepts and facts .
Ideas present the topic and facts are an application of these ideas .
I think it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it 's for them to learn facts .

The way to understand well a lesson is , first of all , to understand ideas and concepts and then , understand facts .
It 's not reversible .
For example , in history class about World War One , you have to understand why this war took place and why all the countries were involved in this fight before learning facts : battles , events , great names , famous days ...
Another example happens in mathematics class , you see that a theorem can be applied to particular cases but you should have understod before all the concepts which are used in the theorem .

Secondly , I think that , in a lesson , ideas and concepts are more significant than simple facts .
Indeed , facts are just applications of ideas .
I mean that without ideas and concepts , you ca n't totaly understand a lesson .
You can partially , of course , but it 's not the same .
I ca n't really explain it but you feel differently when you 've understood all .
I feel kind of victorious when all is clear in my head .
You ca n't get all the details explained if you 've just learnt facts because they are not enough to get to the heart of a topic .

At last , what is the point of a lecture or a lesson if you just remember facts ?
Facts ca n't exist without ideas or concepts whereas ideas and concepts do n't have to be related to facts to exist .
I know it sounds weird but some fields of knowledge such as metaphysics do n't really have any applications .
However , they exist .
Besides , we always can extract an idea from a fact , whereas the opposite is n't as easy as we think .

For all these reasons , I think that students should understand ideas and concepts before learning facts .
