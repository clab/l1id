Nowadays , a higher education is valuable for a student future career but it is not the main important point .
Indeed , even if lots of people and companies are looking for high-skilled students , when a students have to proove your intelligence , he must have understood all .
I personally believe that it is more useful and important to understand ideas .

Fisrt of all , for a professional carrer , even if lots of skills can be a way to enter a firm , a student will have to put into application the concepts and ideas he learnt at school .
In order to use the different concepts , it implies that the sudent has integrated them .
Furthermore , when a student works in a company , he has to exchange with his or her colleagues .
One can not deny that without understanding , you can not express yourself properly .

Secondly , during his formation , a student must have to learn facts , he can not do it in a different wat to obtain his exams .
That is the reason why I am firmly convinced that the students that are able to understand ideas are going to be well-appreciated , at the oral cessions for instance .
To my mind , understanding is a proof of intelligence and a way of differenciation .

Thirdly , we have to keep in mind that social life for a student is crucial and I personally believe that understanding ideas and facts should be a good way to build this social life .
Indeed , during student life , you have the opportunity to have extra currilar activities such as participating into associations .
But to do it , a student may be able understand the way the association works , he should also bring his own ideas or ideas he had understood during his formation .
Understanding is a way of integration .

To conclude , I would like to recap that understanding ideas and concepts is a way of profesionalization , socialization and integration .
When learning permits you to pass your exam , understanding help you to build yourself .
