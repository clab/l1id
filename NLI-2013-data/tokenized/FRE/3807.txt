We always heard that the young people are too lazy , that they spend too much time im front of their computer screens , chatting or playing video gamesand that they always refuse to work at home a I think those who said these words must have a look to all the activities the young people do to help the community before having such as this opinion .

The first thing we should notice is that the youth is the synonym of art , creativity and imagination .
Most of the teenagers are interested in urban art , music or at least cinema .
When they go outside to the cinema or to a concert , they are directly involved in the artistic life .

A lot of teenagers play a music instrument , sing or play theater .
It 's an efficient way to devellop art , to improve the artistic production .
For instance , walls graffittis were considered few decades ago such as a teenager 's occupation without any artistic value .
However , they are considered nowadays like real artistic paintings of this original urban art .
Rqp music music was considered also as a '' bad '' music but it becomes nowadays a real art .

In fact , we can see that the young people helped their communities to improve their qrtistic skills and to create new ones .
In other words , they do n't lose their time whem they are listening to their own type of music or when they are drawing their specific draws .

Besides , we can add that the young help the society to improve its organization because they are the first one 's who react when something wrong happen .
If the government takes decisions which go against the citizens , youth will be the first one who will be on strike to defend all the citizens rights and the values that they believe in .

For instance , when the French governement took a decision which made workers ' situation more impredictable , the young student went out in the street to demonstraste that this law went again their values .
this example shows that the young take time to defend the rights of the community whem they see that the society is in danger .

Finally , we can see that young people denfnd their rights and devellop the artistic activity .
They are not as lazy as is generally said .
