Fist , I want to say that I am agree with the idea to travel in group , but not to have a tour guide .

I think that travel in group is a very good idea because , when you travel whith somes friends you can increase your ang spirit .
In fact , when you do a travel it always happen some bad thing that you do not hope .
This bad things can increase the partnership of you and your friend .
I have in my head the example of the boys movie .
The boys hockey teams want to have a better team spirit before a big tournement so the team decide to go at < < La Pourvoirie > > and the team also decide to not drink alcool in this trip .
The < < Pourvoirie > > it on a a very big forest not very far so they hava to take a plane .
But the days when tha plane has to come for drop the team at the arena .
The planes is not there .
So the half of the team decide to wallk in the forest toward the arena and the other half decide to wait for the plane .
But the guys that go on the forest do not has the good maps and they are lost so they have to work in team .

I think to travel with a tour guide is not a good idea .
Because whith the tour guide you a have a very strict schedule .
So if you want to take more time for a thihg you destruct all the schedule and after this the rest of the day it bad .
So when you do not have tour guide you can do all that you want , you do not have to respect a schedule .
But when you do not have tour guide you can lose somes good place to see and the tour guide can have an interest approche about he 's city or country .
