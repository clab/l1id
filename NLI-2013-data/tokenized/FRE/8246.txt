I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because when you learn a fact you do n't have any explication about what you learn you just have to believe and everybody have the same opinion about it

why it is important to understand an idea ?

because you can study the idea and be agree with or not in the case of you do n't agree with the idea or the concept you have the possibility to give your opinion , students are more comfortable when they understand something because that ' why we go to school !
when we talk about an idea or concept it means that opinion will be different between the students everybody can tell his opinion contrary to when you learn a fact. a fact is generally something everybody knows because we learn it from school or my our parent without really know why it is like this and not otherwise .
concept id diferrent because we can talk about and find a respond to a better understnading
