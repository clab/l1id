As many specialists stress it , the countless number of cars in north-american and european countries is likely to stabilize and might even begin to whittle down in he next twenty years , because of environmental and energetical issues that make the use of cars much more expensive than what it used to be when nobody was interested in those problems .
There are cities , such as London or Paris , which create new laws so that it becomes very expensive and unpractical to drive in town centres .
I believe that the United states will soon change some of its habits and take similar measures .
On the one hand , I disagree with this point of view as many research scientists are on the verge of major scientific breakthroughs that should enable mankind to switch to environment respectful techniques such as all-electrical cars or hydrogen energy .
The ever growing interest for sustainable development may deal with these issues in Western countries .
On the other hand , I am much more pessimistic about poor countries , especially fast-developing nations like China or India where people are beginning to have access to cars .
Even though the high prices of crude oil are partly a consequence of the instablity in the Middle-east , we must no forget that China is another reason as its use of petroleum is rocketing .
There are hundreds of milllions of chinese people who will probably be rich enough soon and buy a car .
But all the new energy technologies figured out by scientists are going to be far too expensive for those people to use in the next twenty years so that they will probably buy regular cars and participate in the plight .
Even though science is the solution to the rocketing number of cars , I believe that the development of many Asian , South-American and African countries is likely to paricipate in this issue .
The opposite evolution will need much more than twenty years to be achieved .
