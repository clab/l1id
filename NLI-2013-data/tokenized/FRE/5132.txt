This statment illustrate the advertising policy issue whitch I personally agree with .

First , in our society of `` mass consommation '' , the economy is ruled by the profit implying that all measures are goods to increase benefits .
Thus it is always a relevent manner to make seem a product better than he really is by a `` lyar '' advertisements .
For example , MC Donnald always showes on adevertisement above the cashier better than they really are in their boxes when they are serviced .

Secondly , the successfull of a product is to attract costumers .
Whatesoever is the product , its advertissement have to appear better than the product is .
Beasides , if the advertissement on the product is a `` flop '' , the company who has lauched this one might lost a lot of money .
Futhermore profit 's policy that governs company 's behaviour imply to make a product seem much better than it really is .

Finally this behaviour has for result to create a fake image of the product in the customers minds .
Thus creating a legal frame work on advertissement should prevent this kind of lying advertissements and protected , in the same time , custumers .
