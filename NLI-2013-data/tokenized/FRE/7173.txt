I have two opinions on this question that I will developp .

Firstly , I think that it can be possible that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today .
In fact , today we have an important life problem which is the Ecologic problem .
As the climate is changing and the earth is warming , a lot of person consider , nowadays , that cars pollute and to put an end to the warming process , we have to use no polluted vehicules like bicycles , ...
This kind of mentality is more current in the north of europe ( Sweden , Finland , ... ) .
In those countries , they use already less cars than a few years ago and prefer using bus or others public transport .

Moreover , in France , we can notice that the cost of the petrol is very important and we arrive to a point that we can say that it 's a luxe to have a car as the petrol is expensive .
We can imagine if nothing happens that people will developp the North mentality and apply it , to make benefits or just economies .
And deffacto , the cars number will decrease .

But in an other part I think that it 's not possible that in twenty years there will be less cars than today .
In fact , I imagine that from today to 2026 cars wo n't work with petrol but I hope with hydrogen , water or electricity or Sun light which will permit to resolve the ecolicic problem we have to face on .
Changing the mod of carburation will permit to have a somethimng cheaper than the petrol so consequently , there will be more cars in twenty years .

Finally we have to reppear that in twenty years , there will be more than 7 trillion people on earth so normally the car number on earth will growing .
