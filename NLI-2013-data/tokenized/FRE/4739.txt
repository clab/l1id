` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ' , I think that this statement is true and based on my experience I am going to explain why I agree with it .

When I was younger , I have been fooled by advertisements several times .
One of the better example is when I decided to lose weigth , I saw at the telivision , peels that seemed like magic because without any effort , users could lose a lot of weight and very quickly .
Of course , these pills did not work as well as the advertise said , however it helps me to understand that the purpose of advertisements is to sell a product and to tell to the clients what tey want to hear .

On one hand , I think it is quite normal for an advertise to only talks about the advantages of a product , even if it is a kind of lie not to tell to the clients everything that they have to know about the product .
On the other hand , it can be really annoying for an user to see that it is harder than in the advertisement to make the product works .
For instance , it is always making me laugth when I watch my mother trying to use a very complex oven that she bougth because the old one did not have all the functions of the new one .
She never achieves to correctly put the alarm , thus the food is nowadays too much cooked .

However , now before I buy something quite expensive , I always go on the Internet to watch the points of view of users .
This is very helpful , for example , when I decided to buy a new laptop I spent over a month to compare the producer 's advertisements and comments from users .
Furthermore , I think that when the promises of a product 's advertise and reality are close that shows the seriousness of the producer .
