Some people ca n't travel without a perfect organization , without to know where they will be on each days and everything .
To my point of view this is not the best way to travel .
I prefer traveling by myself without a group let by a tour guide .
There is many reason who explain this idea : first of all , it is more conveniant and you feel free to do what you want , secondly because you can be integrated to the culture and not only visit touristic place .

On the first hand , when you are with a group led by a tour guide you know the program before to leave your country .
You have no surprise and can not decide to change your plans .
You do not have the possibility to like a place and want to spend more time because most of the time , you must look at you clock and follow the group .
For example , when I was in Florida , in Miami , I decided to go with my friend to visit Key West .
On the way to go , we get lost and , by the way , we discover other beautiful place that we would not be able to see with a tour guide .
Then we spend one night in Key West as we planed to do but we really enjoyed the city and wanted to stay more .
So we just did it , without any problems : we were totaly free to enjoy in our way .

On the other hand , when you are with a tour guide , you most of the time only visit the touristic place and where everybody go .
You see and visit what all the others see and visit and you are not able to know place that nobody know or where only the citizens go .
Also , by traveling with a group , you only speak your own languages and you not have any possibilities to know and experiment about the other cultures .
As an example , when I was in China , I met a girl who invite me for a dinner in her house .
It would never happen with a tour guide because I should follow all the group .
So because I was free to do what I wanted to do , I had a dinner with a traditional chinese family and it was such a great experience !

To conclude , when you have the possibility to travel by yourself , without any help , it is better to do it without a tour guide : you are free and even if you get loose , you will learn a lot about the culture .

So lets go and for your next holidays : be your own tour guide !
