Nowadays , our society is based on communication .
Not only , information , but also advertisement .
In a newspaper , on television , food industry , banks , music , ... , all companies explain us why we should buy their own product and not the one of their opponent by using advertisement .
This brings me to a topical issue , the accuracy of advertisement .
Some products often seem better than they really are .

On the one hand , advertisement is mostly inaccurate .
It shows you prepared meals that you just have to warm up and eat , that should be better than home made meals .
It demonstrates that the new technology of mobile phones allows you to make a call and take a photograph ...
of course your old phone is not good any more !
The number of examples is unlimited .
It helps me to come the point that advertisers show us what they want .
There might be a disadvantage of a new technology , but they do not mention it .
The prepared meal shown in the TV spot might be a home made one before being frozen .
As you do n't have the whole information , you are not really in a position to take a position .
But it seems to the great majority of people that products are not as good in the real life .

On the other hand , there are lots of controls done before the broadcasting of an advertisement .
For instance , products that contain zero percent of fat are really fatless .
But this does not mean that the product has a good taste .
It just indicates that it has less fat than the product of another brand .
The product seems much better on TV than in reality , paradoxically though , the advertisers has n't lied to the consumer .
In other words , the product respects the characteristics announced in the advertisement but is still not as good as it seemed .

To conclude , I have a mixed opinion about this question .
Advertisement often show images of the product .
Those images are mostly manipulated ones and show a better image of what we are going to buy than the reality .
This brings us to believe that products appear better on television .
But sometimes , the product shown is not displayed for its taste , but for some other qualities .
Those qualities cannot be seen on a TV screen .
In that matter , the advertisement is accurate .
