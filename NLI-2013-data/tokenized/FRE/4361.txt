Conflicts between generations have been aroud for centuries and still generate much debate .
Older generations often disapprove of the behaviour of young people , and this disapproval is obvious in the way that we understand young people 's commitment to their community .
Although I acknowledge the generous contribution of some young people in helping their community , I agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .

In the last three years , I have volunteered as a tutor for children from disadvantaged backgrounds and for various jobs at university .
I feel that it is very important to help one 's community , but when I try to think of examples of such generosity in my fellow students and in younger people , I struggle to find two examples .
I only need to look at the employment website of my university to see that the voluntary jobs being advertised are not popular ; the website counts the number of times that a page is seen and that number is particularly low for voluntary activities .

If we forget about volunteering and think of helping one 's community as just spending time with that community and taking part in its activities , one will still find that young people are rather absent .
Life has become a very private enterprise now .
The advent and the popularity of video games , the internet and mobile phones shows that it is now possible to enjoy oneself without leaving a room .
It is possible to be part of a virtual community ( in chat rooms for instance ) without having to spend any time with the local community .
This privatization of entertainment and of life in general means that young people seem much less concerned about their direct community and are more focused on themselves .
Most teenagers are rather self-absorbed and forget about the community around them .
For instance , my sister is often more concerned about the outfit that she is going to wear the next day than about sick members of the family .
She feels that she does not have any time to spend with my grandmother , so absorbed is she in her fashion concerns .

In a way , young people are involved in another community .
It seems that communities have become much bigger in the last century .
While a few decades ago events happened at a local and community level , the development of information and communication has led to an enlargement from a village community to a world community .
In the 1900s , people would listen to the news of their community , of their village , and maybe of the nearest town , but today we learn about the world on the news .
Although young people might be part of that community , there is still little sign of them truly helping in that community .

I therefore do agree that young people do not spend enough time helping their community .
However , they should not necessarily be blamed for this ; we just need to give them a sense of community to make them want to participate in that community ; it is up to parents and to the educational system to achieve this for a better world .
