I am agree with this statement and there are several reasons in my opinion ;

First , young people thinks differently than older because they do n't have the same way of thinking .
Young people are not self consencious , they often prefer playing instead of work at school ...
They do n't have the same p More they often do n't have responsability like work to win money and to live in good conditions , keep their children ...
That 's why

Then , young people are not responsable yet , contrary to their parents for exemple .
Generally they do n't have children .
So they often go in the club , go to the party with friends ...

But we can say the contrary because sometimes , older people are enjoying life more than younger .
For exemple , when they finished to work , they often decide to make a trip , travel , do their garden , cooking ...
They profite to realize some hobbies .
Because they won money during her life
