I believe that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
Understanding ideas and concepts can lead to interesting debates , it can be used in our everyday life and it can also help us understanding different facts from the past .
Facts are only dates and names in books or newspapers , while concepts and ideas let us imagine different possibilities through different aspects of life .

First of all , understanding ideas and concepts can lead a classroom or a group of friends into an interesting debate .
By exchanging opinions about a particular concept , for example , communism , we can learn new things and support our opinion by giving arguments .
Understanding the ideas of our mates is also important .
It gives us a chance to be in the other person 's position .
It helps us to have a wider frame of mind .

Secondly , being educated about many concepts and ideas can help us in our everyday life by helping us taking an important decision .
For example , if you have to vote at a provincial election , you need to understand what thesis each candidate supports .
You need to be aware of the consequence that each political party can bring to the population .
You can develop your own opinion based on ideas and concepts , and then make a choice about the party that will get your vote .

Lastly , the capability to understand concepts can help you understand different facts that happened in the past .
For example , if you understand the concept of socialism in the U.S.S.R. , you will be able to understand the actual facts about Russia , such as economical difficulties , health problems and the gap between rich and poor people .

In conclusion , I think that understanding ideas and concepts makes a student much richer than by simply learning facts .
Facts can always be learned in books , while concepts and ideas can mostly be learned through experience !
