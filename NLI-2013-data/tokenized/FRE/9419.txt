Studying , ideas , concepts and facts are very different way of teaching .
According to my experiences , studying in ideas and concept is more effective .

Ideas and concepts are , opinions , they are not objective , they reflect the thoughts of a person or someone , if we study them we will get to know several point of views .
For example , sudying ideas , in history is important , we can defferentiate the point of views , and try to explain what a certain politician wants , or believes , that will open a big , door , for conversation , and dialogue , and comprehension .
Or even in philosophy , trying to interpret Plato , or Socrate , in a logical way , is better to understand why do they mean what they said ?

Learning ideas and conceptions , gives a better chance to the student to undersand , and think , For example ; in a biology class , studying an expriment , and giving the results , these are ideas , if the students can manipulate these results in a certain way , first it will give him a chance of thinking , and when he will get the point , or interpret the result in the right way he will be able , to bring the fact behind the experience , himself .

But on another hand , studying Facts , gives you less oppurtunity to think and try to develop , a certain intelligent way , to understand thinks , and thoughts , of other people .
Therefore the class will not be fun , it will allways be straight to the point , the teachers , will be here in front of the students and they will just be , telling them what haoppened , whitout giving them a chance to browse there mermories and brainstorm .

In conclusion it is important , to give the students , a chance to think , and give his opinion over something .
But the teachers mus n't let the students mislead himself , they must allways leave him on the right track , even if it needs , to correct him , it will still be better than learning wrong stuff .
