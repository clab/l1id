I totally agree with the following statement .
First of all , if you are someone who takes risks , you are someone who likes challenges , who are not affraid to experiment .
From my point of new , it 's a main quality if you have projects and want to be successful in them .
For example , if you have a new concept for a business project , you take the risk your project wo n't work , but you also can be really amazed if it works : coming up with a new concept for projects that works means that you succeed in doing something new .
In other words , beside the fact your project worked , you have a personal success feeling .
Also , people who come up with business ideas ( for example some kind of restaurants such as the first fast food , the first bar where you can read while drinking a coffee ... )
took the risk to give all of them and ending with nothing .
But they tried , they believed in a new project and they finally succeeded so much that they became rich and also could , in the case of restaurants do franchising and extend what became a chain restaurant all over the world .

However , some people prefer to keep doing what they already know to do , they do n't feel taking risk trying something new that may not work .
This kind of people prefers the security , and I totally understand this feeling but from my point of view , if you keep doing what you know , you can end laking of confidence and be afraid of changing your life : keeping the same job and not trying to have a higher position , going to the same places not to risk to be desappointed by another place ( I 'm talking for example about a restaurant or your holidays destination ) .

In conclusion , even if I understand the feeling of being secure , I do n't think this kind of people can be successful .
So , from my point of view , the more you take risks , the more chances you have to succeed in your life
