I agree with this question .
And recently , there are a lot of tour in japan .
Most japan 's tour led by a tour guide .
because there are some reasons .
First , Japanese people likes to go to somewhere with groups and it is safety to go to travel .
If tour guide led us everywhere , We do not to think about every one .
Tour guide thinks about us .
For example , how many people are there now ?
or next , where do we go and so on .

In my experience , I have been to Disney land with my friends , and I led my freiends .
However it was very hard to led people .
it was not easy to it Second , tour guide has a lot of knowlege about that place or something .
If I had question and asked , tour guide can answer the question .
Last year , I have been to the china , however I can not speak chinese , so I was in trouble that I missed train , and I called tour guide .
And tour guide tell me how to get to ride train and come back hotel .
I felt tour guide is very kind .

Third , it is nesesally to go to travel with tour guide .
If I go to foreign country , I do not understand what people say .
So it is very bording .
tour guide can speak local launguage .
What 's more , I think tour guide know local imformation .
it is very important to enjoy in there .
If I go to somewhere myself , I can not to know about local imformation .
Of course , It is not free when I want to go to anotherplace

In summary , I agree to led by tour guide when I go to travel .
but it is very safety during travel .
and it is important to go to
