Nowadays , students are exposed to learn things that they do n't even understand .
It is why , `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ''

When students , must learn facts without knowing what they are talking or learning about , mean nonsense at all .
I agree that a fact is important but if they do n't know why it has happened it wo n't be necessary for them to learn that because the day after , it would be off their minds .
Usually , things that you learn at school must help you for the future , so if a student learn the fact before the understanding , he will not use this information again in his future .

Consequently , it 's better to understand an idea and a concept , because when you understand something it will be print much longer in your mind that you thought .
When an idea is understood , the brain will stock the information because this idea could be useful for another time .

A concept or an idea are exactly the same and they work together .
First you understand the idea and then when you know it you can imagine the concept more easily .

A student will learn more in defining and understood an idea or concept than just learn a fact .
Otherwise , sometimes facts are important in a way that they have a relation with real facts in a sense of natural events .
For example , when on BBC news they introduced the tsunami event , everybody was shocked but they learnt something before they understood why ...

Finally , i will say that the best for a student will be to understand first the idea , imaginate it and finally learn it .
