Some people think that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide and other people prefer to travel alone .
I prefer to travel alone with my own organisation for different reasons .
I disagree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I want to explain you my opinion and give you personal experiences .

First , when you travel in a group led by a tour guide , this person proposes you to visit only the most important place and not obligatory the most interesting place .
For example , I travel in India for two month alone , without guide and I visit and I discover a lot of small place very interesting .
I visit village and I can undersand the real culture of this country in this small place .

Second , the tour guide is often an international person and not a local guide .
I think this point is very important .
Nobody can explain you a country like a local people .
One time I travel in Paris and I take a tour guide to explain me the story of `` Versailles '' .
This guide was japanese and she speaks not very well french !
I like to spend time to speak with the other people of a country .

Third , I like to be free when I travel .
I like to stay one night more in a place if I like this place .
When you travel in a group , you need to follow the guide .

I understand that a lot of people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
For instance , old people can enjoy , because they have a good organisation with this way to travel .
However , I prefer to travel alone an to be free .
I respect an other opinion but I am sure that the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide .
