I agree with the statement that said `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

The reson why is because nothing is fair .
Life itself is n't fair because if life was fair why there are a group of people that are suffering and a group that is rich .
In my view to be successful in this type of life we living on today takes a lot of risks because to me being a successful is that when a person finish with school , have the type of job that he or wanted , and have a family .
For example school is n't easy there are so many steps a person need to finish with school .
That 's is the reason why today most teenagers are dropping out from school .
I believe in myself a lot i know that to be successful a person has a lot to go through .

According to an article that i 've read said a lot of freshmen dropped out from colllege because the course are to diffcult or they get drunk and get kicked out from there .
However i think the statement based on the article because successful is just word if the colllege freshmen step up than they will be successful which is they can get their college diploma .
The article and the statement touch me a lot the people that get kicked out from college could have been me , my family , or you .
As long as we know what there for nothing could step on our way .

Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is just a sentence everyone can achieve it .
If you or me is n't afraid of taking risk .
