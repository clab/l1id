We can assume when we read this that it would be right to say that young people enjiy more life than older but how can we be sure of this ?

When we are young we do lots of things : like to party see our friends , go abroad , but we do n't enjoy more life , no ?
For exemple young people can be born very quickely and often do not take time to do things , or spend most of their time watching television , or on internet .
and sometimes are not aware of the chance they have to be young and to do lots of things .
Some people always wants more and more , the more they have the less happy they are .
At the contrary older poeple are knozn to have the notion of what life really is and know that time is precisous .
We can see that in general older people schedule all their time and are really organized .
The older people get the less they want to loose time , they want their life to be like a calendar .
We wish We can suppose so that they enjoy life too but in differents ways but we can not be sure that they enjoy life as much as young people .
What is nice when you are young is that you only think of what you do at the moment and not of teh consequences you are often less responsable , so have more fun .
We can see that in discos for exemple or during vacations .

To conclude we can assume that young people do not enjoy life more then older people but in a different way .
