The use of cars in our modern societies is a crucial point which we 'll have to deal with in the coming years .
Cars provide us a tremendous confort in our daily life , but besides we are to see and notice that cars have sad effects on our natural environment , a spur that all of us have to reconsider .
It is a challenge because our own way of life and wishes for the next generations will be determinant to answer this question : can we reduce our consumption of oil ?

Beyond the fact that oil is essential in our economy , are we really ready to put our confort aside ?

I think the answer lies in two facts : we need to responsibilize ourselves and governments policies can be helpful to reach this goal , but in the same time the economical engine has many gimmicks to give us enticing offers we can of course afford ...

As we can notice , we are subject to many enhancements , We are told to use our bikes more often , told to prefer the buses to our car .
this tends to make us more sensible to our modes of consumptiom , not only for our cars but for all types of energy as well .

Nevertheless , we do have to confess that oil is the cornerstone of our economy .
As long as are not as reliable , as performant and as cheap as the cars we have access to , oil will continue to equip the majority of the cars sold worldwide , even if and it , s important , being responsible has a lot to do with the culture we evolve in .
Provided that it does not interfer badly with the economy , changes are possible .

Eventually , the conclusion of this is not so optimistic , because we need to emphasize on what is wrong with our consumption .
Of course this is not only a question of greenhouse gazes but we need to embody people who look forward to improving the world for our next generation , and this will determine for this , we are ready to leave ou car in its garage .
