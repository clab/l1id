Nowdays , more and more students sucess their baccalaureat .
However , it appears that their knowledge are not very good .
Therefore , some people think that we have to re-organize the educational system .
So , is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?

First , the comprehension of something begins in observing facts .
For example , in chemistry , we can do an experience , observe its , and then we have to understand the reaction .
So , I think that it is really important to understand ideas and concepts .
It is the first step of the knowledge .
It is the minimum .
next , if we forget this ideas and concepts , it is not important to understand it !
But education can not stop here .
If we only understand ideas and concept , we do not have enough knowledge to understand other things .

To improve its knowledge , we have to learn facts .
Indeed , learn facts equals get experience .
In the schorlarship , learn facts must mixt with `` understand ideas and concepts '' .
In one time , students only learnt courses by heart and sometimes they did not understand .
Thus , if students only learn lessons , it is not enough .

In my opinion , a good educational sytem is not only a system where students just learn facts .
They olso have to understand ideas and concepts : it is not more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
We can not done a difference between this two system .
