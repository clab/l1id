Several reasons make me to agree with the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in the streets than there are today .
These reasons are of various kinds .

First of all , the natural ressources of our planet may not be sufficient to make it possible to produce enough energy to maintain our traffic rate .
Or the price of energy will be to high for one to afford having or buying a car .
Gas is very expensive yet , because of the various conflicts in the world , especially in the productive regions of the globe .

Then , I believe than alternive ways of transport will have been developed and improved .
Collective transports may become cheaper and lot of people may prefer them to their car .
New means of transport will be found because the world public opinion is becoming aware of the dangers of pollution .
And the transport sector is the only one where restrictions can be made , since progress in industry can only be made in the long term .
Changes in the transport sector can happen before twenty years .
Campaigns can promote the use of the buses or explains that biking can be a better solution than driving when living in a city .

Finally , new solutions can also appear .
One can have difficulties to find the link between the reducing car rate and the Internet , but in fact it exists .
The net makes it possible to do shopping for example .
One has n't to take his car anymore .
If one emloyee who deliver goods at the Internet users is on the road , it makes the car rate divided by two .

All these solutions , even if I recognize that they sound quite unrealistic , will necessarily be examined by the decision takers .
Actually , they will not have choice .
I believe some global measures should be discussed , as an isolated one may not be enough .
