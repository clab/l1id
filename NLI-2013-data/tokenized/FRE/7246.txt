How often have people traveled on their own ?
In groups ?
By couple or with their class ?
what is the best way to travel to a country ?
Opinions differ depending on people , but I believe that the best way to travel and to learn about a country is by being led by a tour guide .

First , a tour guide can help us travelling in the country .
I remember the time I travelled in Italy with my parents , we took a guide who made us a visit of the entire Rome .
He knew every corner of the city as if it was himself .
We took the subway and we were amazingly surprised of how many stations and changements we had to make .
Because we could not speak Italian , travelling alone would have been much more difficult without a guide .
Thanks to our tour guide , we were spared interminable hours of wander in the intricate streets of Rome .

Secondly , a tour guide can give us some historical background that are specific to the country or to the region .
Our Italian guide , named Gino , explained to us in details the history of the Coliseum .
We thought we knew already enormously about the site , for we have read many books about it , but we never knew how it was built , in how much time it was built , and why was it a phenomenon in Rome .
He explained us how Italy undergoed a chaotic period during the civil war and the Second World War , facts that have not always been explained concisely .
But he also talked to us about Italian legends , that are only known by Italians .
He also familiarized us with the traditional italian music which originally bloomed during the Renaissance .
Gino also talked to us about the great thinkers , mathematicians , musicians , politicians and dictators of their country and I had to admit that I could never have thought about them if we were not guided by Gino .

Thirdly , if we are not completly familiar with a country 's language , people , or food , a tour guide can always facilitate our task .
I remember how lost my parents and I were the first day we arrived in Rome .
We could n't speak Italian and because we were tourists , some Italians took advantage of the situation to make us pay more than the regular prices in restaurants .
Gino got furious against the waiter and when we asked him what happened , we were horrified to realize that the waiter wanted to make us pay the bread , the table , the glasses , the fourks and knives .
Apart from this little misunderstanding , Gino always had great Museum , restaurants , bars , adresses .
He would recommend us the best Italian pasta dishes and would bring us the great comedy shows !
He would also bargain with street sellers so that we could afford cheaply a Dolce et Gabbana pair of glasses or a perfect imitation of a Gucci bag .

I believe that my experience in Rome clearly demonstrated the fact that it is best to travel somewhere by being led by a tour guide .
For he is more experienced and familiar to his country 's lifestyle and people .
