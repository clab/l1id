The issue of the reliability of advertising is controversial due to the impact it has on consumers and authorities .
On the one hand , companies need to advertise their products and create awareness in their target audience consumer 's mind .
But on the other hand , the actual market is constantly under pressure , as well as its workers who have obligations regarding the company they belong to .
However , sometimes we could argue that enhancing the reality of a product in order to achieve good results and sell more of it remains strongly unethical .

The first reason why advertisers should not make the product they are selling seem much better than it really is , is simply because they will not attract consumers on the long run .
Indeed consumers might try the product once but if their expectations are not fully satisfied according to what they saw in the advertising , they will not repeat the buying process .

In the same way , by doing so , consumers will lose faith in the brand which is advertising .
As a result they will turn toward more reliable companies and products .
This could have a very negative impact on the companie 's results .
For instance , a company which would claim the efficienty of its washing machine amoung the other on the market without the actual benefits would certainly lose u increasing number of its target audience .

As a conclusion , I firmly believe that advertisers should not allow themselves to lying to their customers so that they will gain consumers attention and trial .
