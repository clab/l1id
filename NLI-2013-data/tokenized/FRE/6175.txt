Nowadays , the use of cars is quite controversial .
Indeed , some people are defenitely still in favour of keeping them , whereas some others claim its use should be reduced , if not banned .
The consequences this debate may have on the future use of cars , and the reasons of this debate deserve to be discussed .

At frist glance , this issue may appear superficial , but it is an essential one , since it is related to one fundamental problem the whole world is facing , that is to say environment .
Indeed , the car is a major source of pollution .
However , western countries'inhabitants are used to it , and would see its disappearance as a step toward the past .
For a long time , car has symbolised modernity , but moreover freedom .
With a car , one can go wherever he wants , whenever he decides it .
In the United States maybe more than in any other countries , car has been praised as a fundamemtal element of one 's life .
Billy Wilder 's moovie , ` Sunset Boulevard ' states that he just ca n't live without his car , since it would be like having his legs cut .

Considering these facts , it is hard to assert that in twenty years , cars will no longer be used .
Though , there is no denying that its use will probably slow down .
More and more people feel concerned about pollution , and as I said it previously , the car is a major source of pollution .
These people aim at gaining some influence in the political fields , in order to get the opportunity to be heard .
In Europe , their influence over the debate is increasing , and countries such as Sweden as more and more often taken as examples , since it is a pionneer in this field .
In the wake of this change concerning the environment issue , many countries have already implememted different kinds of policies in order to lower its use .
Despite it is often rejected by the populations , we may hope behaviours will evoluate .
In addition to that the lack of oil which is more and more discussed may lead to changes towards the lowering of cars ' use .

So , as a conclusion , I would say that there will certainly be fewer cars in use in twenty years , but we will have to wait for a little longer I think , to see the obvious changes .
