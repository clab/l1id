From my point of view , young people enjoy their life more than people do .
First off , confronted to less responsabilities than the grown-ups , they have plenty of time to enjoy life .
Thus , They just see the nice side of it .
Indeed , young people are usually neither married , nor parents .
Moreover , they do have parents who care for them and pay for them when they need .
On the contrary , older people are less looked after and a part of their family is dead .
They have to care for their survival .
For instance , they must be sure to have enough money every day .

All of this considered , young people have less to think about and that means , they have less problems about everyday 's life .
Moreover , they do n't have lived much because of their age and everything has to be discovered .
Thus , they will have plenty of projects to acomplish such as travelling .
When concerned about their future , they would make a lot of plans .
As for me , dreams are very important .
The goal you want to reach when you are young heve to be kept when growing older .
For instance , I would like very much to study abroad and dicover a new culture .
I am very attached in making souvenirs .
I think when you are in an other country as every thing is new you will make a lot of souveirs in a short time .
Furthermore , you meat a lot of different people , Actually imn my mind , young people are very interest in nez experiences whereas , older people have already made the larger part of their experiments .

Eventually , being young is a very confortable position .
You can always relye on the perspective that you can possibly do in the future what you do n't have done yet .
To conclude , I would say that feel very happy to be young .
