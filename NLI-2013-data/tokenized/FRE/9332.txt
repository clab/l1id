Learn 's methods are really important , they allow education system to be more efficient .
There are several patterns which can be followed by teachers .
For instance , they can choose between focus upon ideas and concept s or on facts .

To understand ideas and concepts improves students ability to develop their logical skills .
These qualities are required by a lot of areas as mathematics , biology or economic .
For example , in economics , you need to understand all market 's mechanisms to be able to explain how works an economy in any country .
Ideas and concepts merely learn you how some events are engendered .

To learn facts is more important for culture .
It leads students to know the backgroung of some situations .
They can in this way easily picture in which conditions some concepts take place .
By following the same economic example , we can say that the knowledge of some history contexts allowes us to understand why at some moments economic theories have not worked .
For instance , it can be implied by an event that one of the theory 's assumptiom is no longer respected .

At hence , for all these reason I utterly disagree with this statement because understand ideas and concept is complementary to learn facts .
