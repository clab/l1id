Nowadays , young people have very busy lifes and it can be thought that they do not spend enough time helping their communities .
In fact I disagree with that point of view and I think young people do a lot for humanity in the daylife of their communities .

First of all , young people are very implicated in education of younger .
I have a lot of friends who give mathematic supports lessons to children after class or who help younger students to prepare for their exams .
In my view , helping in education is very important and this kind of help is very valuable for the society .

Secondly I have noticed on several occasions that young people are very helpfull to elderly people .
Some students help elderly to do shopping ; others go for a walk with disabled people .
These examples shows that young people are very implicated and feel concerned about the elderly in their communities .

Finally younger citizens are usually the most implicated in humanitary projects in their cities .
Many organisations helping disabled people like patients who suffer from toxicomania or unemployed people were raised by young leaders who were very involved in finding fundings to realize their projects .
Moreover when there is a natural disaster in a town , we usually see that the younger are the first on the field .

In conclusion , I trully think that young people are very concerned by the condition of living in their communities .
Despite their lack of time and money , they are really motivated to help people in needs and are often more implicated in helping their communities than the elderly .
Their differents actions are very encouraging for the future of our communities .
