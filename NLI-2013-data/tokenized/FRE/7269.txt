Travelling implies discoveries .
I have myself travelled a lot to different continents , I have however never been in a group directed by a guide .
The good point of having a guide is that everything you look at - the other type of architecture , the other culture , other rituels - are described and explained by the guide .
From what people told me about it , I guess that going on trip with a guide is a more relaxing way to discover new habits than looking by yourself into books to try to understand what is all around you .
Nevertheless , the point of view you get is the one of only one person .

As far as I am concerned , I prefer going to new places without a guide .
I like getting to know the culture by myself .
You take the time to discover .
In consequence , you interfer with the new culture and catch , understand the habits of the people around you .
It 's a more personal approach to the culture .
This point brings my second thought on the subject : I prefer travelling with a friend rather than with a group .

Travelling with a group means that you follow timetables .
You do not see what you necessarily would have liked to see .
Most of all you remain with people who have the same culture .

As a conclusion , my conception of travelling means that you should enter another world .
I come from Paris and lived in India for three months with two friends working in hospitals .
We dressed with the clothes everyone wore , so that people thought at one pointthat we had been living in India for a long time .
The experienced and time spent with people implies that we were three and not a group of fifteen people .
We were no tourists somehow but observers , discoverers , walking , eating with the people who live there .
