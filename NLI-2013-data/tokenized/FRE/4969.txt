In my opinion , it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Firstly because in today 's society , consumption has become a way of life where advertisement has a big impact on consummer 's beliefs .
What is important currently is not necessarily the taste or the quality of a product .
The surprising trend is that people are increasingly affected by the image of the product .
And the big companies have understood this trend and take the opportunity to develop their goods by creating solid brands .
Therefore , they play on the people beliefs and in some cases even cheat on them by arguing with pseudo scientific concepts .
For instance , we will probably buy the pack of milk with the metion `` special omega 3 '' instead of the one with no advertisements .

Besides that , we have to be conscious that there is no link between the quality of a product and its advertisements .
The proof is that it is a totally different company which is in charge of the advertisement .
And this last one has often much more money to fund its advertisement than the first one has to make his production .

Finally I think that it is very dangerous today not to take enough into consideration the way goods are producted .
Some balls are for example made by poor indian children we are not aware of .
And they will become high quality balls as soon as a brand will be written on it .
