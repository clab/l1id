Many students are used to thinking that preparation for exams involves learning by heart .
Of course , students have to make sure they remember some data .
However , knowing a fact whithout understanding its definition , for example , is useless .

- Clearly , it is easy to learn facts without getting any explanation .
However , it is also easy to forget things we do n't understand !
In fact , in this case , our memory simply fails .

- furthermore , in my opinion , students should focus on the most difficult things to memorise : the explanation of ideas and concepts .
For example , in the marketing field , it is very easy to learn the different steps of the consuming process , whereas it is much more complicated to understand the way this process functions .

- Moreover , learning the different economic theories does n't makes us good economists .
Thus , to prove our ability and our skills , it is necessary to analyse and try to understand every single point when learning .

- Finally , the best way for students to be efficient in their futur jobs is to be able to justify their acts , to support their decisions with explanations .
that is why it is crucial and very important for students to understand what they are dealing with .
