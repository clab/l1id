Nowaday , the science is reaching a top level of his history , and in particular in the world of high technology there is a spectacular progress .
So the varies company sponsorizing different projet try to bring the new knowledge to the population , and how .

As many company invest in research , at the end , when there is a new result , i mean a new product , the company the company make the other investment , to make peoples know the products , and this last investment is on the advertisement .

Tthe company then try to make know the product , by marketing techniques , creating the television spot , which some time do not have nothing to do with the product they want to advertise , only to capture the spectator , and make him believe that there is nothing similar , that is the best thing you had ever seen up to now , and by watching the television everyday , and then listening to these spot , at the end people are convinced that the product is the best .

So to end , I agree that most advertisement make products seem much better than they are
