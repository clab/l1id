in today 's world , more and more people find success during their lives , however , several causes could make the success of this person .
it might be the abundance of money , the personal instincs or also , the fact that are constantly creating and trying new things .
because i am the kind of person who takes a lot of risks , i strongly agree with the statement which said that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

first of all , in my opinion , success is depend on the capacity of inventing and creating new things either materials or immaterials things .
sometimes it is a brand new idea , another time it is a brand new item , and the other times , it is just a way to act .
but in all this case , the thing that is created has never ever been before .
although it is not the only reasons that lead people to success , it is one of the main points .
in addition to the creativity of the person , several factors could entered in count .
one other means to sucess is the fact to taking much more risks than a common person .
in fact , the person who want to try new things and to improve the way he lives has a lot more chance to succeed than the person who just does what she knows exactly .
as an example of that , i could speak about the difference between a machine and a human being that are doing the same movement all day long .
the machine always does the same act , and does not try to figure out ohow it is possible to do it better , whereas the human being try to increase his ability to do this act .
in this way , he try new thing and takes risks to improve his way to act .
he is more successful than the machine .
for me , those characteristics are the main one that make me do agree with the statement written in the introduction .

for instance , my godfather is one of the person who reflects completely the fact that success should be in accord to the risks and trying new things .
since at least a quarter of century , he works for an engineering company .
he is in the creativitypool .
he started as a common computer engineer , and now he his the head manager of a team of 45 people .
he started just with his willingness , and among a lot more other qualities , he started with his own ideas .
during his work , he talked about that with his collegue .
those latter made him increase his level inside the society because the majority of his own ideas were right , and efficient for the firm .
that is why , they all agreed with him .
now , he is on the way for the retirement , but , however , he is the proof that successful people had better to count on there own creativity instead of counting on the out factors , and also , doing all the time , the thing that they know how to do perfectly .
no imajination is equal to boringness .
creativity seems to say modernity , improvment , originallity ...
success

despite the fact that there is a lot of causes to explain a successful person , as far as i am concerned , i strongly think that a person who is taking risks and trying new things is more able to find sucess during his whole life than a person who jsut act as he is supposed to .
finally , otherwise , success required taking risks .
