The statement which attests that young people enjoy life more than older people is a controversory one .
This because , some are for and others are against .

From my point of view , it 's true because when people are young , they have vo many things to do .
I mean no many charges because if you do n't have a wife and children , you can enjoy life because when all these things will come , you will be obliged to reduce or to stop .
Young people are doing it because they are healthy , strong so they want to take profit of it before that it comes impossible .
For them , at this period everything is permitted but when you will be at a certain level , it will be impossible to do certains things because of social position , because of your family and because you are becoming older , what normally means you have to be wise .

We have to notice that it 's not every young people that enjoy life because some of them are responsible and know that life is a treasure with with we should not play .

Generally , older people do n't enjoy life because they said they have already sawn what young people are doing .
They will also say that they are old for these kind of things and as old as they are , it 's not permitted to her to do certain things and because they have respect for their family .
But sometimes , some of these older people are doing like young people , saying that nowadays life is n't long so they have to profit .

After examining this subject , we can say that more people enjoy life but some of older people do it also .
It a question of principle like us .
