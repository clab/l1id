Although being polyvalent is a good thing because you are able to discuss about everything , being specialized in one specific subject is more valuable to me .
Indeed , in my opinion , when you are able to be the best in one specific subject it means that you can focus very hard on something in a way to do your best .
That 's the most important .
People who have a little knowledge of a lot of things are common persons .
Being specialized in one topic is very important because it 's a way to make yourself different .

Being good at ease on several subjects is common nowadays .
You are not efficient when you are know a little of severals topic because your mind is not focus on something that you can do , or explain better than everything .
Even if you have an important knowledge of several topics , you are not able to be as good , in your argument , as someone who is very good in one subject .

Furthermore , being very good in one subject means being weak in other topics .
Because you spend most of your time in studying ( or working ) the same thing , you do n't open your mind to other things , or do n't even being interested in doing something else because you know that you wo n't be able to be as good as you are in your specialisation .

Anyway , if your are able to focus yourself to only one thing , it means that you can focus on anything .
Being well focus on something is one of the most important thing nowadays : in work , studies ..
anything .

To me , you are more efficient when you are able to forget everything around you except the thing you are doing .
As an example let 's take the car .
If you are focus when you are driving , if you are not changing the radio or dialling a number on your cellphone , nothing can happen even if a other car arrives very fast from anywhere .
Because being focus on something means control it .
