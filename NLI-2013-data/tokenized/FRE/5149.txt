I agree with the following statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
The aim of most advertisements is to make more money even if their product is not as good as they may advertise it .

In order to sell thier products , most advertisers say good things about their products in order to gain the marketting compare to other advertisers .
They may tell you of the low price , the good teast , how it , s good for your health and all the possible good things it can do .

when you go to buy the advertised product , you may find that all they said about it is not true but you already bought it .
What they are after is money .

Advertised products at time may have adverse effect on each and every individual .
This may cause some allergies in some people and even death depending on the severity of the allergy .

En general , most advertisments are not real , they are made to convince people to buy their product and not to satisfy the need of the population they serve even though some exeptions do exist .
