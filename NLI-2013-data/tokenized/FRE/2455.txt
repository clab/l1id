Nowadays it is quite difficult to answer such a question as we all live in very hard times .
First of all , i would say that , as being a young person , it is quite more easy for us to enjoy life as nowadays everything is possible .
Our grand fathers had not even the half of what we have today , meaning that the range of possibilities have largened .
It is also due to the fact that at our age , they were fighting at war .
several times my own grandfather told me this so i would realise the chance we have .
Secondly , i think this is so not to compare as we have totally other leisure times because of our age .
By this , i mean that for instance , a younger one will enjoy doing a huge travel aroung the world while at the same time , someone older wo n't enjoy it as it means to much trouble and moving all the time .

Also it is not true to state that we , being younger , enjoy life more than elderly people as we do n't have the same meaning of enjoying life .
For me it could be reading books while for another it would be boring to do so .
This means the same for elderly people .

However , if it is a question of travelling a whole year long or to practice some extreme sports , it is true that we take more advantages of life than anyone else whose working hard to raise a family .
So i would say it is more a matter of what kind of schedule you have .
If you are someone who has plenty of time to do all the things you like instead of having to earn money to survive , then it is true you enjoy life more than anyone else .
But it is not a matter of age .

In conclusion , i would say that i do not agree with the statement above .
It is not a because you are younger than someome that it is obvious you are enjoying life far more .

It is a question on how you oragise your time and with who .
