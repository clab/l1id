Today with an increasing globalization , having knowledge is becoming more and more necessary .
And choosing between having broad knowledge and specialized knowledge is an issue which merits a closer look .
Before determining which position is the stronger of the two , it is necessary to examine both in detail .

First of all , we can start examinig the main advantage of a specialized knowlledge .
The most important advantage is due to a world that is becoming more and more complex every day .
Consequently our society need people able to resolve modern issues .
Doctors are a good example , the specialists have become more important than by the past because of the complexity of modern healthy issues .

Nevertheless broad knowledge can provide tomorow two advantages more important .
First of all , it is flexibilty , in other words the possibility to change , to think differently .
It is easier to give up a theory when others are availiable .

Besides flexibility , broad knowledge can give the chance to be in an objective place .
Being specialized can be compared to a isolated situation in which nobody can share .
The specialized knowlege is by definition specific , thus it tends to have is own way of communication and the finallity of sharing knowledge can be impossible .

After carefully considering the above evidence , it is clear that the latter position is the stronger of the two .
If we take into account the advantages of flexibility and the possibility to stay objective in any case , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is the better way to manage knowlege today .
