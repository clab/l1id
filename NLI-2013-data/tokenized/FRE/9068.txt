I strongly believe that the ability for students to grasp concepts is of the utmost importance .
My belief is based on three main reasons , that are further developed below :

First of all , learning concepts and ideas allow students to understand the core of a scientific explanation , of a general idea .
While simple facts are more likely to change frequently over time , concepts and ideas tend to remain the same for tens , even hundreds of years .
Even though some main ideas can be contested , their understanding remains vital to the comprehension of current debates in a field of study .
It also allows the student to better understand ( and remember ! )
subsequent facts .
For instance , a Biology student has to be familiar with Darwin 's theory of species variation in order to understand the spectacular survival of a special type of bird .

Secondly , I feel that students , especially post-graduate students and-or research assistants , are often invited to juggle ideas themselves , to come up with an opinion of a specific notion or idea .
Being familiar with a general frame of reference helps them develop their own critics and makes them free thinkers !

I could also argue that there are plenty of ways to learn facts ( for instance , watching a news bulletin , reading books and articles , or doing a research on the web ) .
However , it is a known fact that concepts and ideas can be more efficiently grasped in universities ( or other academic institutions , for that matter ) , where the structure is designed to help students develop and perfect their ` mental framework ' .

In conclusion , I would repeat my belief that it is crucial that students be introduced to abstract concepts as the main focus of their studies .
Nonetheless , I feel that facts do have a place in an academic environment , in that this type of ` concrete ' knowledge can help students better apprehend the different conceptual ideas .
