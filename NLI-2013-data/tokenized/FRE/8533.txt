This statement brings up a very important concept that I have had several occasions to reflect on during and after my student 's life .
As my own experience proved me many times , it was more important to have the tools and concepts to understand the facts around me than to learn the facts without understanding the whys and hows of them .

I have followed a scientific education and been very sensitive to all scientific topics since my youngest age .
What always appealed to me in science was the fact that events could all find a logical explanation and that the world , after all , could be directed by understandable laws .
As an example , knowing that the water , when boiling , becomes vaporized , and therefore a gas , only gives the student a fact that he can observe , but from which he cannot draw any conclusion in the future .
On the other hand , knowing that all elements on earth can have three different phases , solid , liquid and gaz , give the students a concept .
This concept , in turn , can be apply to any material on earth .
It then explains why water boils , but it will also explain why iron melts or why azote can be found in a liquid form at lower temperature .

Another example could be found in history , where knowing the facts is , at first , the primary work of the students when they are teenagers .
The teacher would spend hours telling them about the history of their country and what happened when .
But , I know for myself , that the most interesting part of history teaching is not the facts , but why such events happened .
And how these events helped formed a nation 's history , which in its turn created new facts .
Knowing a date in itself does not really help to understand why a country decided to invade another one .

As a conclusion , training the students , to derive conclusions from observations and concepts they have learned , is a very important skill that would help anybody when faced later on in his life with new events .
Personnaly , this is how I have always viewed my education , as a provider of a great toolbox , that I could use anytime .
So far it helped me a lot .
