on the one hand , the following statement about advertisement show us that there is a real opposition .
As far as i m concerned I would say that it seems to be true about this , because advertisements are present to inform people about something .
But as we can remarque , is that finally people doesnt understand all the signification on them .
But on the other hand , we can remaraue that peaple take lots of interest about them because they product better than they really are .
For example , we can underline that children or teenagers points theirs fingers on them because advertisements creates a social movement .
Be at the top is very important for young people .
everyone want to show to the other that he can bring or wear what he saw on the advertisement .
That s why , sometime , avertisements can products much than they are .

But , there is differents form of advertisements .
So I think that , its create the difference .
Obviously , internet , tv program or paper in the street can influence people bying .
That why , I can say that advertising take a big place and certainly most .
