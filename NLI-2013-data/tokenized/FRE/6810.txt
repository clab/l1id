Nowadays everybody talks about environment , ecology , nature , ...
this refection blames that our society do n't take care about the earth .

The question about the cars is recurent .
And the associeted question is `` how reduce the pollution '' .
So we can ask if they are fewer cars in twenty years than today .

On the one hand , twenty years is a court period today .
In fact we are in the technologic developpement period which always rise .
But it is not say that ingeniors or researchers find answer at theirs questions .

Automobils ' ingeniors develop today news motors , conception , design , they try to develop new range , in oder to repond to demand .
More they try to give an accesse to their cars to everybody .
Despite the governemt try to imply everybody in the ecology battle , the fact is the automobil area is a business and they ca n't reduce it .

On the other hand , cars are a really pleasure for somebody .
the pleasure to drive , to go where they want , to be independant , to do what you want when you want .

Today we accused the price of oil but everybody always take theirs cars and do n't stop to use it .
Moreover today we can see the development of new oil , biological oil so ecology repected .

Finally , there is the city , the big city , where everybody is always worried by the traffic in .
On theirs city the cars ' number will be reducing in the twenty years comming .

In conclusion and to my mind , the cars ' number will not reduce in the twenty years because all the points I developped , but the reduction will be possible only on cities where they will develop othe tranport system .

I like to drive , such as take sometime train or fly , but car is the independance , and I think you ca n't take it at anybody .
