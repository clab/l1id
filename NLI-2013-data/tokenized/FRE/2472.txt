Some persons think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I think that it is not true .
First , older people may feel not having taken enough pleasure in their previous life , so during their last years they want to do things for which they had not enough time before .
Thus , they enjoy more each moment and take advantage of the present instant because they know it is their last chance .
On the contrary , young people are always in a hurry , they want to do a lot of things , manage to do few of them and they do n't enjoy what they experiment because they are not thinking to one thing at the time .

On the other hand , there is a more material reason for which older people enjoy life more than young people : older people are often retired and they are a part of the society with a higher consumption power .
It is easier for them to enjoy what the life can offer .
For example , they can do some trips that they could n't afford before because they had their children at home and because it was necessary to pay for their studies .
However they did n't have time for that because they were working .

Finally , older people have gain more maturity and they are aware of the value of things .
So they can better enjoy what is available to them .
The more something is difficult to reach and the more we wait for getting it , the more it will be valuable .
The more something is rare , the more it is enjoyable .
Nowadays , a lot of young people believe that everything is due to them and they do n't measure the value of what they get .
When we are older , we are able to meausre the chance we had and that we did n't measure in the past .

That is why I think that we must wait to be older to really enjoy the life , because being older give more chance to be able to do what we really wanted .
