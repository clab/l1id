Who is the smartest ?
An average student who goes to school 8 hours every day , or a student who goes to school just 3 or 4 hours a day and then has to go work to complete his degree ?

Basically , school is made to teach us ideas and concepts to be able to react to situations in our future life .
But what is the most important ?
To know a lot of concepts or to know how to apply them in a concrete situation ?
Both of them have an equal importance in life , it depends on the way people think and act ; furthemore , they complete each others .

First of all , we can say that everybody functiuns in a different way .
Indeed , some people prefer to learn ideas instead of people who prefer to learn and understand by using facts .
A very good example is the way we act with a using notice .
Some of us will rather read all the manuel and then start to look at the computer for example ; however , some of us will throw the notice away and will directly look at the computers to rty understand how it works ; they will try to make it functiuns by themselves .
They will maybe press a button they feel is useful and then follow their intuition to make it works .
If it does n't work , those people will try something else untill the computer is on .

In a second part , we can say that school should be more opened to taught students more fact than they do actually .
Indeed , if some students have troubles with school , it 's maybe because the system is not well-adapted for them .
Perhaps , they will fell more comfortable if the teachers were using more facts and more concret examples than whan they just teach their class with ideas and concepts which can sometimes seem unreal .
For example , when a business instructor is talking about a specific startegy , it seems unbelievable that he does n't give any specific axamples to his students to make them see how this strategy can work in a real job environment .
Moreover , everybody agrees to say that to apply or a job , a person with experience will have more chances to have this job than a person with no experience .
But experience is principally made of facts .

To conclude , we can say that if a student wants to have a good position in his profesional life , he should have references on his resume that show that he already had an experience , but he also should have a good scholar transcript that shows that he received a good formation for the job he wants to have .
