To know if it is better for successful people to try new things , including to take risk , rather than only doing what they already know to do well is difficult to deal with due to it also concern us , and the way we tackle life .
So ; e people thin it is better to stay in a zell known safe place .
On the contrary to take risk in order to test nez things can also be partly justified .
In my opinion , I am firmly convince that it is better to test new things , even if it includes risks .

The first reason I support this statement is that you cannot work wonders without doing anythings .
To try new things is kind of pre requisite to be successful .
If you want to work your way up , you ; ust try neq things .
If you do not , you just stay an ordinary person .
Obviously there are different levels according to people ze speak to .

Another reason I prefer testing nez experi ; entation is that it is pointless to do alzays the same .
Human being needs to take risk to progess .
to illustrate ; y point of view I can use the exa ; ple of skiing , to progessm to be successful you ; ust go on harder skipath .

Last but not least it is also clear that it is thanks to people who take risk on high level , who enable hu ; anity to progressm to find solution to get better conditions of life .

Taking all these apects into account , I am strongly convinced that successful people who take risk are right .
