It is very tempting to give a straight answer like `` yes '' , young people today are very selfish , they just care about themselves .
However before doing that , I would like first to understand what is behind the word `` young people '' .
Personnaly , I will separate this word into two categories : first , teenagers between 12 to 18-20 years old , I mean people in high school or beginning university and second the young adult between 20 and 25 years old .

Let 's start with the first group .
I do n't really think they are not helping their community .
Every day , TV shows example of a school doing goods things for people like cleaning the tags in the subway or signing papers against fur hunting or helping state to clean parks and streets .
At that age , young guys just see life in black and white , they are not yet interested in their jobs and how much money they will make .
In addition , at school , their teachers really try to motivate them to understand what citizenship means .
Sometimes , as I mentioned above , they do n't have choice and they are enrolled in school project .
So , in conclusion , for that particular group , I disagree with the statement .

Then , the second group is different and I think they are right to be different in a sense they are or will become soon active member of the society , chief of their household and they have to care more about themselves than the previous group .
However , I do n't mean in any way that at 25 you are right to become selfish .
Unfortunately , what we can observe is that , a part from social workers , this group is not realy willing to participate in helping communities .

To conclude , if think it is very important that before jumping into conclusion that we set clearly the defininion of young people because in function of the category they belong to the answer will be different .
For the12-20 years old the answer will be `` no '' and then for the 20-25 group the answer is `` yes '' they do n't give enough time to community .
