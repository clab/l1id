On the first part , we have to know what is an advertisements , if there is many type of them .
What they may products ?
Let begin with an exemple of advertisements that we can see every day : smoking kills .
this is a good advertisements cause we do know that it is not healthy to smoke and however , there are a lot a persons they do that .
So , if we continue with this exemple we can proove alos that the fact of reading on your box of cigarettes that it kills gave the opportunity to a good numbers of persons to stop it .

the problem with that word advertisements is its type , the destination of the advertisement , who makes it and what should be the effects on people .

In the foreign affairs , a crisis situation can conduct to advertisements from a country to an other .
We can read that everyday in the newspapers that the UN are giving advertisements to a country like Iran or North Correa about their own nuclear program .
The message has been delivrated but did it help , this is an other question .

On the other hand , there is a familiar expression wich is : an advertising man is like two men .
It means that when you have been advertising of something by someone , you are that much cleaver than Two of yourself .
It can illustrate very well the question .

To conclued i can say that i do not agree with this sentences cause i think that is the experience that can make products , real products .
