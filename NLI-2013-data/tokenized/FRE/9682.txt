Famous researchers , important people or successful stars have a common point : they all look further afield , wanting to meet other people and to broaden their horizons .
For all that , I think you can be successful only if you take risks , if you test and try new things ; so you can be successful only if you want or search something you do n't have yet .

Famous and successful people are very often ambitous and courageous people .
When we take a closer look at Christophe Colomb , Bill Gates or John Ford , we can see that they all had something in their personality that encourage them to test , to search , to try something unknow and rather risky .
How can you have sucess if you only do what other people have already done ?
How can you have success if there is no originality in your prospect and objectives ?

I will now tell you about a personal experience to show you have sometimes to take risks to succeed .
Because most of the time , the opportunities do n't come to you .
But YOU have to create these opportunities .
Here is my personnal experince : towards my final year at the secondary school , I had to combine a lot of things : I had to study for my `` baccalaureat '' , I had to take final exams in flute and piano , to obtain a certificate in music theroy at the conservatoire in Besancon , and to gain my drinving license .
A lot of people said I had to give up music .
But I was determined and I took the risks to continue my music and all my undertakens .
This was risky .
I could have failed .
But I succedeed .
And therefore I was able to find a very interessing placement in a big international company .

To conclude , taking risks and trying new things is a very important and unavoidable condition to succeed .
You have to be courageous , to experiment and to look further afield to success .
