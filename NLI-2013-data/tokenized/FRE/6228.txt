Who does n't have a car nowadays ?
Cars have become the easiest way of getting from one point to another , either to make short distances or to travel at the other side of a country .
Cars are one of the things ( with the cell phone ) that today 's occidental population could n't live without .
How will it be in the next few years ?
Will people suddenly stop using them ?
We will try to give points that show that the number of cars on earth is going to be higher and higher , and that in twenty years , people will still use them as their favorite means of transport .

We can start by saying that even if the gas prices did n't stop increasing those few last years and people coul n't stop complaining about it , it did n't prevent them from driving no matter what .
A car is something everybody needs , and they wo n't stop using it even though their own wages had to be spent on gas .
It 's a little bit like smoking , even if the government keeps rising the prices of cigarettes , people would not stop smoking until public and private areas start prohibiting them to do so .
People have become car addicted , and it will take a long time to change that .

Besides , driving has become a pretty cheap way to travel compared to the other means of transport such as trains or planes .
For people who ca n't offer flying , cars appear to be a good way for them of being able to escape from their life , to take a break .
Cars are seen by many people such as teenagers as a key to reach freedom .
You can go everywhere with a car as long as it 's rolling .

How can we prevent people from having their owm freedom even if it turns to be bad for the environment ?
We ca n't , that 's why cars will always be part of our lives , tyoday , tommorrow , or twenty years from now .
