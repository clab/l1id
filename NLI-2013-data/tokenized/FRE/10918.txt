I think that this sentence is true that is why I totaly agree with it .
I think that successful people are successful because they do n't wait for the succes to come to them , they go forward to it .

Life is not easy that is why you have to be audacious .
To be successful you need to be different form the other people , if you have the thing that make the difference then you will be different .

Soemone succesful like to take risks so they can be the first and before successful , When you are successful you need to be at the state of the art wich means that you have to be at the top if if want to saty there .

If you keep on doing sometghing that you are goood at it , it 's great you can keep doing but in long term , so ; eone zill take your place. ; king effort because the zorld is not nice out there I think that people can be jalous and that they zill try to take your place .

I also think that someone successful is someone who belive in what is does .
It 's one of the most importante thing in the worl .
You need to be confident and belive in you .

Because if u do n't believe in what you say nobady will .
So to conclued , I think that succesfukl take risks and try new thing because they zant to shoz the ; selves to pepole and I think that they like zhen people copy them , that is why they have to be innovante because zhen you do something you already knows well it 's not exciting anymore .

So if your are successful and you zant to stay there keep on beiing the best and then people will follow you , and you will shine .
