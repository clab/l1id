I completely agree with the statement which says that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to well '' .
Those people , who are well known , they often want to be more popular and to attract more and more attention .
We can talk about politicians as an example .
Like Bill Clinton , former president of the United states of America , or Nelson Mandela , ex-president of South-Africa , who are helping the poor contries in africa and asia , a lot of this category of people work in organizations which have the same purpose .
Another example is the entertainment artists .
Many singers after beeing very successful and popular as singers try to move to Hollywood where they have the opportunity to start acting .
And they even take a lot of risks like investing in a lot of businesses all over the world .
The benefit for them is that they are known and they use their name to attract people ; and even their investement does not succed as they want , they always able o try others things because they have the money they need .
In the United states a lot of artists , singers and sport-players have their own company or team .
Consequently , months after months , years after years , they become more and more successful and popular and try news things .
Consequently , they seem like handling the world in the pame of their hands .

In conclusion , people who are successful definitely try new things and risk ; they rarely just do what they already know how to do well and most of the time , tey do it to get more money than what they own .
As a result , that create in my view the problem poverty because the riches are becoming more rich , exploiting the second part of the population which is the class of the poors .
