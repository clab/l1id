Because of the importance of advertisements in our modern society , this question seems quite interesting and could be also written this way : Do advertisements lie to us ?
It always seems to us that the goods we see on TV or in magazines are perfect , or far better than they actually are , and we are often disappointed by the real products once we have bought it .

But could an advertisement work if he told us that what he wants us to buy is only quite good or not that bad ?
Advertisements are closer to propaganda than information and it ca n't be helped .

On an other hand , some advertisements are willing to give some results or marks that their products were given by different organisations , associations or consumers and we 're eager to believe that , most of the time .

We must n't forget that customers are usually well protected by laws which punish lies in advertisements but here is n't the problem .
Indeed , the problem is that people usually do n't make any differences between the picture and the thing itself , and are too eager to think that what they see just in front of them is real and ideal .
They always look for something perfect but ca n't realise that perfection does n't exist , moreover low-cost perfection .

Advertisements show us the best sides of what they want to be baught and it could n't be an other way , we ca n't blame it for that and furthermore we should face our own responsabilities by training to be more critical and careful in our decisions .

The fact is that advertisements do n't make products seem far better than they really are because only the consumer see what is beautiful , it 's a kind of game with the consumer who stay the only one to decide if he actually like , need or want .
