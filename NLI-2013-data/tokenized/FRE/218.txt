Cars are associated with the twentieth century -- they were created at the beginning of this century .
Nevertheless , since a decade , the sells of cars in Europe and in the United States of America are decreasing ; General Motors and Ford are still in the top 5 of the best car companies , but the first one is not an American .
Because of environmental issues such as the greenhouse effect caused by emissions of carbon-dioxyde , we may wonder if in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Even if , in my opinion , in the industrialised world cars are tending to decrease because of the pressure of some environmental think-thanks , groups or organisations , I fiercely believe that there will be more cars in twenty years than now .
Indeed , a host of countries which are nowadays in development , may reach their maturity in these twenty years -- for instance , when the Asian world , such as China or India , will be considered as industrialized countries , I suppose that an indian or a chinese car constructor would be next to the Toyota 's rank -- a car major companie .
In other words , even though the industrialized world may do a host of investments in common transports such as bus or subway , I assert that in twenty years there will be more car than now .

Oil rersources , which is the first car energy , are plummeting , and on the opposite , the demande is skyrocketing ; thus , it 's tantamout to saying that if there will be fewer energy in twenty years , there will be fewer cars .
However , I still maintain that there will be more cars : during these twenty years , I suppose that alternative car 's enegies might be founded or created by scientists or ecologists , and therefore , that cars would be still abble and allowed to be driven .

The twentieth century is the century of cars .
This one may be a bridge between two kinds of transports .
Nevertheless , the gap is still deep , and that 's why I think that there will be more , and not fewer , cars in twenty years .
