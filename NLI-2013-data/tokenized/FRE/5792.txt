Since many years and among the history of the Humanity , the use of the car as always being important and in some cases indispensable .
Nowadays , the situation is changing and we are face to a problem : do we still have to use our car while many factors influence us to use others solutions or to use less the car ?
In my opinion , I would rather say that in twenty there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

First of all , it is important to remind the actual situation on earth .
The cost of gas is extremely high and more than before .
We can also say that it might continue to grow for many years .
Why ?
To serve interest of the governments and powerful people who lead nations or corporations .
I think that people know that the gas ' price is too expensive and will continue to increase year after year .
Moreover , it is relevant to say that the car ' cost is as much expensive as the gas'cost .
In fact , today , if we want to buy a new car it costs a lot of money and in many cases , some families need to borrow money to get one .
It is becoming a luxury product .
It is useful to say that households are bored of this important growth .
They would like to find other solutions in order to avoid taking their car .

Then , one of the most important thing in our society today is the protection of the environment .
How many households would stop using their car and find other way of transportation in order to `` save the earth '' ?
A lot .
I think so .
The pollution due to the gas , the problems encountered with the forests all around the world become more and more familiar to the population .
And I really think that people feel more and more concerned by that .
By the way , it is important to notice that since a few months , we can assist to the development of a new form of transportation such as the commom transports ( bus , train ) and the come back of the bicycles in the big cities for example .
In my opinion , the best example to prove that is the city of Berlin .
In fact , I was impressed when I went over there for the first time , because we can see bicycles everywhere around us and people tend to use those new forms of transportation more and more .
I really like this idea which spreads out in many cities today .

Finally , we can say that the motivation of being a good citizen , the increase of the costs of the gas and the cars , will hopefully help people using less and less their car and prefer bicycles or common transports .
I really believe that in twenty years , people will find others ways to go from a place to another .
It depends on many factors but one of the most important is the motivation .
I hope that people will take these piece of information into account in oder to change the future and learn how to use less the car .
