Memory is the key to school sucess .
That is what certain people truly believe .
Of course having a wonderful memory can help you to remind some details of a precise subject the day of an exam , but can you learn anything without understanding it ?
We will first examine that it is not possible to learn anything properly wihtout understanding , then that learning by heart is not learning and finally that if you have understood something ones then you will know it forever .

Every science teacher will tell you that learning without understanding is a waste of time .
The famous French author Rabelais told it himself : Science without concience is a only the waste of your soul ( science sans conscience n'est que ruine de l'ame ) .
So it is clearly impossible to learn without understanding .
May be it will be quicker to learn facts then understanding the key ideas of a subject , but will you then be able to explain the subject to someone else ?

Therefore we can tell that learning by heart is not really learning , indeed one thing is certain and that is that when you have understood ideas and concepts of a subject , you must be able to explain it to anybody .
For an exemple , we know that the Civl War lasted from 1865 to 1867 but is learning this fact helping us to understand what has happend during this war ?
Certainly not , but knowing and understanding the economical situation from the first American states can truly help us to understand this war .
And it can help us to explain it later to someone else .

Likewise , if we have understood something like how to ride a bike , then we will know forever how to that .
Understanding concepts and key ideas about one subject is the same thing , you will understand it and then know it forever .
And this is truly helpful , imagine you have to pass an exam , you have learnt everything by heart because you think you have a good memory that will always be there for you .
But suddenly , somehow , you do not know why there is a huge hole into your head and you cannot remember anything you have learnt .
If you have taken the time to understand your subject this situation would never happend to you .

In a nutshell , we can say that learning only facts can be a real risk that should not be taken , it is not worth it .
But sometimes learning facts can help to understand ideas .
Like in history you need the dates of the events to understand what has happend in a certain period , in order to understand the logical order of the events .
