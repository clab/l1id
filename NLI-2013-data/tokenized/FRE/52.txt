In general , people keep much knowledge along their studies and are able to use these knowledge in the life .
While some people prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject other prefer the reversed situation of the previous statement .
In my opinion , Specializing in one specific subject is better than having knowledge of many academic subjects .

Firstly , I prefer specialization in one specific subject because it will allow me to improve my skills in this specialization .
For example , I prefer to study all time in n only one field to be able to study in depth all the phenomenon which are in this feild .
Also , It will permit me to be an expert of my specialization .

Secondly , it is better to do a specialization because I will permit me to be well organized .
For instance , my schedule of study will not be shared into many different academic subjects .
Then , I could be relax to manage my time to do an excellent work .

On contrary , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not a good way because a person who does it will not have time to study in depth all these subjects .
As an example , Someone who wants to study in the same time physic , philosophy , theology and law will not be able to know deeply each of these subjects .

Also , it is wrong to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because I will not have enough time to do all my works accuretly .
Such a person who has to submit within a tiny time eight or ten tremendous works , it will be very difficult for him to do good work and submit works on time .

In sum , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects has disadvantages and specializing in one specific subject has advantages .
As far as I 'm concerned , it is better to specialize in one subject .
People should specialize in one specific subject in their studies .
