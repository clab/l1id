Older people are generally considered to be more responsable than younger people , because they may have responsabilities that oblige them to analyze situatuations before acting .
Let take the basic case of parents and children .
Children generally receive money from parents and they do n't have responsabilities or duty that oblige them to save this money .
They general spend this money with friends in night clubs , pubs ...

Another axample is risk , older people are more risk adverse than younger people , they tend to do what ever they tink can be exciting .
More and more we can see young people with cars doing races without thinking about consequences of those actions .
what i think an older wo n't or will think a lot before doing so .

Furthermore , we use to hear this from older people : we did this a long time ago .
From this we can say enjoy life is a cycle and every depending on his age has to go by this step .

I think young people really enjoy life more than older do and this because older people passed their turn .
Enjoying life is a kind of cycle and every human enjoy life when he has less responsilities or duties .
