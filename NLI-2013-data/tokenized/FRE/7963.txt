I really enjoy travelling .
In my life , I would like to visit the most countries in this world .
However , what is the best way to travel ?
I have experienced travel in a group led by a tour guide .
Also , I have traveled in a group without tour guide .
So , I can say that I do agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I will talk about both way of travelling .

When I graduated in high school , some students and I planed a trip to Paris .
We choose to travel with a tour guide when we arrived in Paris .
This is the best trip I have ever taken .
The trip guide know almost any kind of entertainment in paris , with him , we discovered Paris and his surrounding .
He brought us to visit the Effel Tower , The Champs Elysee .
Second , the tour guide brought us to a small cities surrounding Paris , and we enjoy the nature , the architecture of this part of the cities .
The advantage of travel with a tour guide is that he know the map of the cities , therefore , he has no difficulty to guide us .
However , the most significant disadvantage to travel with a tour guide is that it require additional money .

I also travel with some friends without tour guide .
We decided to visit the city of Quebec .
It was really difficult for us to read a map and visit the city because it was our first time to travel in this town .
We did n't enjoy the trip as we did when we were in paris .
Must of the time we were in Quebec , we frequently ask direction to people around the street .
Some of these people were willing to help us , but other were to busy to take a time to guide us .
Fortunately , it was cheaper to travel without a tour guide .

To conclude , there are several advantages to travel in a group led by a tour guide because this person pocess knowledge related to tourism .
However , as I enjoy travelling , travel in group without a tour guide can be great especially when I do n't have enough money to pay for a tour guide .
