In our society , we have a lot of families which have more than two cars , whereas only one car can be driven at each time .
In addition the oil is more and more expensive and to drive a car might become a luxury .
That is why we can wonder if in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
First I will show why there will have always more and more car in use .
Second I will explain why I think that there will have less car in use per family .

First I think that in the world , there will have always more and more cars .
Nowadays there still have a lot of poor countries .
But some of them will become reacher .
For instance China and India are countries which have each one billion of inhabitants .
And as they have a quick growth of their standard of living , that is why in few years many families which have no cars will buy one .

But if I am sure that there will have more and more cars in the world , I am convinced that there will have less cars own by one family .
Indeed if the price of oil carry on increasing ( it is quite sure that it will carry on increasing because oil becomes more and more rare and difficult to exploit ) and if ingeneers do not find a new technology to replace oil ( for example electricity or hydrogen ) , it would affect the budget of a family and people would prefer riding a bike or taking bus to go to their work rather than using their car .
In addition more and more people want to preserve the envronment and that is why there will have more and more people who will take the bus to go to work .

To conclude I can say that , even if the price will be probably very high in twenty years , it is quite obvious that the development of countries like China or India will be responsible for the increasing of the number of cars all around the world .
But it is quite obvious too that , if we do not discover anothers technologies , the number of cars in a family will decrease because of the negative impact , of the price of the oil , on the budget of families .
