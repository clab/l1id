The research of happiness has always held an essential position in the life of human beings .

It seems to me that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Indeed , they enjoy a better health , they know that they certainly will live a long time .
They have everything to discover , they have everything to biuld , from their career to their family .
They are free and they have time to realize their dream .

However , I agree with this statement up to a certain point .
Indeed , In present-day society , people first and foremost try to find personal fulfilment through a constructive organization of their leisure .
Work is no longer a priority .
Nowadays , people live longer , eat differently .
The family structure has changed .
In my opinion .
new values often lead to a standardization of lifestyles and thought .

Many times , young people are scared about the future , they do not have the money to enjoy life .
They lack of experience , of wisdom .
They persuade themselves that they will find happiness in materialistic objects , in body worship ,

To my mind , the only way to enjoy life is to mix young uncertainty with the old serenity .
Helping each other might be a good place to start .
The older one teaching the young one ,,,
