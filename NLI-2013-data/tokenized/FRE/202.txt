The car industry has long been a central issue for most western countries ' economy , and constitutes even some of the most powerful and influent firms such as General Motors .
The case being such , the future twenty-year tendancy , apart for being of a critical importance for such firms , should be a good clue for the industry and economy evolution .

Some long term tendancies support the increase thesis .
The cars are becoming cheaper everyday ; and driving is becoming easier : thanks to technology cars are more safe et easier to drive , and the motorway web is developing and improving almost everywhere .
Cars have became unspareable nowadays , even apart from the deep countryside prejudice showing that poor lost farmer who cannot have his daughter 's medicine delivered in time without a car .
For the companies cars and trucks is the fastest and most flexible way to make employees and materials move , and being the best way to do it , it as became unspareable .

But some other tendancies leads to the opposite .
Today is the first time in 30 years that the car production is decreasing .
Moreover , in some of the major cities cars have been forbidden or submitted to a tax in the city center , such as in London .
In most of the major western cities , such as Paris , cars have become much more slower than public transportation .
And the increasing of public transportation is another heavy tendancy .
Of course the dramatically increasing oil price would probably enhance these tendancies .
However , and concidering these antagonists points , cars would certainly not disapear , but probably decrease in number .

These considerations were mainly theoric and concerning western countries .
From a more technical point of view of just basically counting the cars and giving interpretation , there are two facts : In western countries we have reached a peak and then should be decreasing from now ; in China and in India the car number will simply explode before twenty years .
And two billion people buying a car have more effect that 300 million americans not buying a third car .

Even if several complex tendancies will compete in western countries , and probably end up as a decrease , these evolutions will be nothing compared to the thirld world cars ' consumption which is very likely to explode in the next few years .
