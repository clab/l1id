This question is complex and appears very frequently in the world of education .
This essay will consider why it is necessary to have broad knowledges and why experts in some subjects are also very important .

Firstly , lots of academics subjects required knowledges to be well udestood .
For example , how can you learn physics if you are not very good in mathematics .
therefore , you always need to learn a broad range of academic .
Moreover , studying those subject is often not enough , you need to practise them .
For example , let 's assumed that a student works in a biological laboratory , he will of course use some chemical methots .
How can he cope wtih that if does not have basic knowledge in chemistery ?

Secondly , lots of current domain are between two subjects .
I 'm thinking about biochemistry for example .
To learn such a bject , basic chemistry and biology are required .

However , it is obvious that nobody is able to know everything .
Even one academic subject is too broad and is divided in different parts .
For example , chemistery includes organic chemistry , biochemistry , ...
Because of the amount of knowledge , sometimes , it is important to choose .
It is impossible to become an expert in every academic subjects .
Therefore , to make research in any subject , we need some experts .
To continue with my scientific examples , how can a scientist be at the cutting-edge if he is not specialized .

To conclude , I think that learning should be divided in two steps .
The first step would give knowledgs in a lots of topics and the second step would concentrate in one specific subject .
