I totally aprove this idea but taking risk can also lead you into failure .
One things is certain , if ones do not take initiative , ones would have a very borring life .
A risky life is an adventurous life .
That 's why it will be sometimes very hard to face some hardships but ordeals are unfortunately part of the thriving processus .
Besides a man who has take a lot of risks in his life is commomly called an experienced man and God knows that experience is a very important factor .
History illustrates also very well that most of the succesful persons have always been determined persons who believied in what they wanted to achieve .

However , you can analyze this question and have a more philosophical approach .
First of all we have to define successful people as genius who have managed to express their own interpretation of life .
Unlike common people , artists and scientits are not coward since they accept their challenge which consist in the main lines in a creation work which has not been done by anyone else before them .
