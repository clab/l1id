It is often accepted that young people enjoy life more than older people but I quite disagree with this view as it is merely associated with the concept of having no responsibility .

Indeed , the ways young and older people enjoy life can be very different and it has nothing to do with having responsibilities or not .

As a matter of fact , young and older people have n't got access to the same activities as they often depend on your physical abilities .
The fact that younger people are , most of the time , healthier than older people means that , for example , young people could enjoy playing a soccer match whereas old people could not .
Moreover , it would be harder for a Senior to spend every night in clubs without sleeping .

Fortunately , enjoying life is not restricted to sport activities and older people could enjoy other aspects of life like building a family , creating business relationships , take part to the city or the country social or political life .
These kind of activities can definitely bring a lot of happiness and maybe more fulfilling than simply play tennis or spending nights in bars .

Another important aspect is that older people may value life more as they might have been in contact with death of relatives .
Therefore , they might even enjoy life more than younger people as they know their time is limited .
On the contrary , young people are not in direct contact with death and just do not realize what is at stake .
They might then just live life as it comes and not get the most of it .

As a conclusion , young people and older people can both enjoy life in different manners .
Happiness is not a question of age but of perspective and I am sure that anyone , young or old can enjoy life if they are ready for it .
