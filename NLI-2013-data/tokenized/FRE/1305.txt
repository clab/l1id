In my opinion , it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many

academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject

because you reduce your choice of lifestyle and have to study for

many more years on witch you could already afford a nice job if you

had chosen to study many academic subjects .
By example , a

person studying medecine academic subjects will choose to

specialize himself or herself to be a chirugian or a dentist , but once

the choice is done , you have to study everything again to change

your job .
If someone wishes to specialize in one specific subject he

or she might get more into depth witch is a good caracteristic once

you 're looking for a job , but you could also apply for a job that which

is n't as good as you cool have refering to the studies you ` ve

accomplished .
Moreover , when you specialize yourself , you have to

study longer to get your master degree and your doctora .
On the

other hand , if you study economics or marketing you have a much

bigger choice and you can work in different departement .
When you

study economics , you can also specialize in one specific subject but most people end there studies at the master degree which leads

you to lots of differents jobs such as marketing , public relation , and

many other .
In conclusion , we could say that both thoeries lead you

to a nice life and that the choice dependant of every students .

However this choice can be made only once you get to this point of

your studies because you might descover a lot of new things during

your student periode .
Finally we could ask ourselves which of these

two types of studies leads you faster to the job you ever dreamed of

as you 're a child .
