It is often being said that older people do n't take advantage of life as much as we , youngsters , do .
Well , you cannot deny that , when you reach a certain age , you can no longer do things you used to do when you were in your sweet sixteens .
As a matter of fact , I am quite sure every single person has , at least once in his or her life , already heard an old person say bitterly : `` Oh , what I would n't do if I were your age ! ''
Is that to mean that life is n't worth living when growing old ?
I shall refute this statement , by showing that older people enjoy life in a different manner , compared to youngsters .

Firstly , I have to say that , when you are growing older and when your health is getting worse , it is very understandable that you are no longer attracted by doing the `` crazy things '' young people are nowadays so keen on , you were maybe used to do when you were young .
Enjoying life is not only about going to discotheques every night , experimenting new things such as taking drogues and so on and so forth .
It is true that enjoying life does n't only rely on extreme activities , and one should n't understimate the fact that old people may be not able to do the simplest things , such as going for a ride on a bike , and they may be suffering from this .
Yet , I think that older people do n't enjoy their life the same way the youngsters do , they just enjoy it differently .

That is why I do n't think that older people are not bound to live with their memories and it is a mistake to think that they are not able to enjoy life .
When you reach a certain age , you get to appreciate other things , such as tranquillity , family , all the thingsthings that you were n't able to take fully advantage of when you were young , mainly because of your job being too demanding and to time-taking .

As a result , all depends on the definition you make out of the expression `` enjoying life '' .
If you define it as enjoying the most crazy things of life , then , no , the elderly does n't enjoy life .
But if you define it as taking profit of each of the raptures life can give , then , yes , the age is not an obstacle .
