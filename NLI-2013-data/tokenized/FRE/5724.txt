Although a demographic explosion will occur particularly in China and in India , I am absolutely under the impression that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

First of all , governments are more and more concerned by the threat on the environment .

Although at the present time the lack of real global legislation is tangible , I am definitely convinced that in the future governments will be able to enforce sanctions against pollution .
Thus , sustainable development is more and more a part of political debates in the developed countries .
Everybody knows the dangers of use of gas cars on our earth .

Besides , governments will implement more public transportation networks particularly in some metropolis like Los Angeles where public transportation network is very bad .
For example , a new tramway line was enforced in Paris .

Moreover , goverments will encourage the development of co carriages by granting .
Positive discrimination towards these collective users can be a solution .

Therefore , new technologies will make gas cars disappear .
Electronic or solar cars will be on the market .
These cars will be competitive because of the oil price crisis .

Nevertheless , the biggest challenge will be to convince the developing countries like China and India to fit to this new legislation .

To conclude fundamental political , economical and environmental issues are at stake .
This is a topical issue .
