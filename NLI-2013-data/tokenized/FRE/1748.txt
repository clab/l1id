Broader knowedge for a broader world ?
In my opinion , there is no denying adults need to be aware of various issues , especially in a globalized system , because individual way-of-leaving influences global phenomena .
Schools have a great role to play in order to give people this knowledge , then people have to keep it in their mind their whole life along .

First , let 's briefly summarize what is a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
It is an education which gives keys to understand the world in which he lives to the student .
History , mathematics , languages , economics , philosophy , let 's call them all the scientific ways explored by scholars for years to understand matters of common concern .

Terefore , teachers are greatly responsible for children to become open-minded adults , or on the contrary narrow-minded people .
Indeed , teachers help children to learn the world is not limited to what they see .
They can guide them throughout flows of pictures medias publish every day .
Because people need to learn early to deal with huge amounts of informations they daily get .
And school is the only area were every child can receive the means to be able to defend himself against wrong or biased information .
These means broadly consist in strong knowledge of various topics .

Then , adults will be able to stand critically about informations they receive .
As a matter of fact , if they have learnt China is a communist regime , they will not trust every information published by Chinese medias .
The same thing about advertising ; thanks to a comprehensive education , with hisotry and economics , but also mathematics , he will be able to better chose the products he need .
He 'll fail less easily to notice lies .

For all these reasons , I think it is more important to have broad culture .
Nonetheless , it does not mean specialised scholars ar not needed , on the contrary they play an essential role in Progress .
