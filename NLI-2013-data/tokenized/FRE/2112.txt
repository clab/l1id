There is a big gap between the generation of young and old people .
And of course my mind will be biaised because I am young .
But to this question , I will try first to discribe the young people 's view of enjoying life , then I 'll put myself in older people 's shoes .

So , let 's begin with the young people .
When you are a child , your parents try to educate you and most of the time , they argue .
That 's why I do n't think that between 0 and 18 years old you enjoy in each cases your life .
But after 18 you become a student and I am sure that everyone had liked its life at this period .
You can do the studies you like , eat your prefered food instead of always thinking about to the vegetables your mother cocked .
You can go out with friends and meet new people by travelling .
It 's the moment you can best develop your open-minded capacity .

Then , let 's switch to the older people 's points of view .
Anybody wants to grow up and get older .
But it is a fate .
However , it urges you to try new things , discover new horizons if you do n't want to stay behind your television .

Furthermore , your thoughts may be turned to death .
So at this moment you want to enjoy life at maximum .
When you are retired , it 's the best period to go on holidays , read many interesting books ...

As a conclusion , I can finally say that every year , at every step you have problems with different rates of importance but the most important thing is to try to escape from the treadmill of a boring life .

We all expect a slower pace of life , of course life is not simple , but young and old people have to enjoy they life and those of them relatives .
