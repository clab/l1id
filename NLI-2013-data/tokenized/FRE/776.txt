Education is different in every country .
So ; e countries prefer to specialize their children in one specific subject , whereas some others countries prefers to give many differents academic subjects to their pupils .
My thought is that having a knowledge of many academics subjects is better than beeing specialized in one subject , and this for many differents reasons .

First of all , in our daily life , we all need differents knowledges .
As an exemple , we can take a typical day of someone living in a rich country .
Let 's say this person has to do his grossery shopping .
He will need some knowledge in mathematics for that .
If he wants to save some money , he will need to calcul in his head which product is less expensive than the others .
If he has a budget , he will have to calcul how much he is spending so when he will have to pay , he won4t be surprised .

Moreover , we need to know things on many subjects if we want to have a social life .
I think that when we are with friends , many subjects are discussed , and if we do not want to be seen as a stupid man , we need to know things in many differents subjects .
If the school teach us only one or two subject , we will have to be with people coming from our social class , because they will have the same culture as we do , so we wo n't feel stupid or rejected .
This would be a break to the social ladder .

Finally , if we think in a practic way , having a knowledge on differents subjects will allow us to help our children when they will be at school .
I think that everybody , when he was a child , has been helped by his parents , or by someone in his family .
It helps keeping the generation in touch and it also helps the mental development of the child .

As a conclusion , we could use a sentence of a famous philosopher who said that a perfect man is someone who has a good spirit in a good body .
It means that if we want to be in a good health , we have to practice some sports , of course , but we also have to know many things on differents subjects .
Those are the some reasons why i think it is quite better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
But we can wonder what do the politics think of that nowadays if we look what they are doing in France , where they want to specialize the children when they are 14 ...
