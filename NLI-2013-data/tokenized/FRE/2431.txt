The way your are living your life and the vision you have about are obviously changing when you get older .
You are not the same when you are 15 than when you are 70 .
At the first view , young people enjoy living much more than older .
But on the other hand , maybe older people know how to live more intensely than the young .

You just have to look out in the street .
You will probably see kids playing , crying , hurting , running ...
Look better and you will be able to gaze two tenagers kissing each other behind a tree .
That is life !
These young people are dry from life .
They have so much to discover , so many things to try .
Every moment is a surprise .
On the contrary , after long the years spendt on earth , you probably have lived everything , you do not expect a lot of thingd \ s from life .
And in many cases , the older you are , the more difficult your body to use is .
So how enjoy life as much as when you are young ?

Indeed young people seem to enjoy life more , but is n't it an important advantage to have experience to live better ?

Young people cannot understand how life is precious .
They live their lifes as they burn matches .
Life is just a highway in wich you have to drive the as fast as you can .
But this is not enjoying life .
It is living in a hurry .
When you grow up , your experience help you to deal with problem and more important , to really appreciate the time you spend , for example with other people .
When you are young you cannot realize how lucky you are .
But wiseness comes with the years .
And it is when life has really hurt you than you realize this kind of things which allow you to live in a better way and ti enjoy more life .
