In my point of view , to travel in a group led by a tour guide has two main advantages :

- First , traveling as a group one has the opportunity to easily meet new people which I consider as part of the fun to travel .
The experience that is shared combined with the proximity in which are kept the members of a traveling group will render the exchanges really easy among them .

- Second , when one travels , by definition , he does not know what to see nor do in the place visited .
A lot of people find it more convinient to take a tour guide rather than gathering this information from other sources such as internet or travel books .
The tour guide is generaly a local that , according to his experience , knows depending on the amount of time his group has , which sites will interet it the most .

Although those two arguments can be true , I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

Even though it is of course more easy to meet people within a group you are traveling with , the interest of traveling is to discover the culture of the places visited .
The best way to achive this is to travel alone and therefore be motivated to go and meet local people .
Those personal exchanges teach a lot about a local culture and can create long lasting links between people .

Also following a tour guide has more inconvinients than advantages .
First , you can not choose what you want to see , this choice being taken by the tour guide .
With the information now available there is multiple cheap sources that can let you decide what to see and do .
Second , unfortunatly , even more in some foreign countries , the tourists are only considered as a possible source of money .
Therefore , very often the guide will be partly paid by local buildings , shops , restaurants , ...
to make you come to their place although they are of minor interest .

In conclusion , I would recommand to travel alone without a tour guide .
