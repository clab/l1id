Everyone has its own qualities .
Some people are successful and others not .
In our development we will now try to learn more about successful people 's character .
Successful people are usually creative and have a lot of imagination .
They have spirit of enterprise .
Whenever they try something and that it produces a good result , they will persevere in ameliorating the method they used before and try to obtain best results .
They spend their time searching , learning , doing experiences .
Having already try an exercise for example , they continue in searching for other difficult ones in order to acquire more knowledge and develop theirselves .
Then , successful people , still talking about students , participate a lot in class thus being remarked by the teacher because of their improvement .

Moreover , in active life , successful people usually invest a lot and every time , in a different business .
They have the ability to make better , to go on doing well because of their creativity and research .

Finally , i agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
And i believe it is important for everyboby to copy that way of life .
