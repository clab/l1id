Comparing young people to older ones , people tend to think that the youth enjoys life more than its elder counterpart .
Indeed , it is easy to realize that in most of the cases , old people are less able-bodied than the young ones .
This physical aspect may interfere with one 's ability to enjoy life because it prevents people from doing a certain number of activities such as sport or even the basic everyday act of going outside to do shopping for example .

Moreover , most of the activities in cities are created for the young people , to avoid them getting bored and staying in the streets .
These activities can be as well night clubs than sport centers ...

Nevertheless it would not be fair to attribute an enjoyable life to the young people only .
Indeed , I really think that enjoying life simply depends on one 's state of mind .
For instance , if we are used to get bored of everything and to criticize more than to admire then we will scarcely enjoy life .
On the other hand if we are used to be positive on the events happening then we have less reasons to dislike life and not to enjoy it .
Thus in my opinion enjoying life is more related to a psychological aspect than a physical one and in that way it is possible for the old people to enjoy life as much , indeed more , than the youth .

The fact of enjoying life can also be influenced by the events happening or that already happened in one 's life .
In that way , as I said before , the eldest person may enjoy life more than the youngest one because if for instance a young has health problems or family ones while the old no , then the latter will be more likely to enjoy life than the former one .

As a conclusion I would say that enjoying life is not a matter of age but a matter of state of mind and way of thinking .
