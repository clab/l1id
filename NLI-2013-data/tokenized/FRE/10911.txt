Generally , innovation is better than just sticking with what you know to work well ; it is the way of evolution .
But it is still important to stay within an area of specialization when you try new ways to accomplish your goals .
That is to say , overdiversification can hurt your chances of success because you will not be as good with everything you can do , as opposed as when you are specialized .

But , when you try new experiences , you acquire a new perspective on life , and you may find solutions and ideas that help you succeed better in your own field of study .
Of course , taking risks is a gamble , because then you can lose everything you have already accomplished , so taking risks can lead to more stress in your life .
In turn this stress is a hindrance on performance , which just increases your chances of failure .
It is for this reason that you must still have a clear plan of action when you take risks .
Organizational skills come in handy to draw up a clear plan of action , defining what your objectives are , what you seek to accomplish .

So , we could say that the risk has to be calculated for it to be a good policy .
Indeed , if the consequences of failure are not known before you start a new initiative , this initiative has a very good chance of hurting you a lot more if it fails than if you had planned : after all , you may not be able to recoup the losses incurred by such a failure .

Which means , taking risks and trying new things are the way to success , but you must not embark on such entreprises carelessly , without due consideration of the consequences , or you may end up much less successful than if you had just stuck with what you already knew !
