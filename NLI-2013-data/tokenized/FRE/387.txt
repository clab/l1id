Centuries ago , a writer could also be a doctor , a scientist and an economist .
People used to have broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs as it is illustrated in the book Gargantua by Rabelais .
Nowadays , people become more and more specialized .
Let 's face it , our knowledge is so huge in every academic subjetc that it is impossible to know everything in every topic .

There is a common joke in Economics thats points out that every economist gets specialized in a very specific topic and does not know anything about the rest .
It is a consequence of the specialization of people that took place in the nineteenth century .
Indeed , progress has been made in many areas and the knowledge has increased .
In this respect , medecine is a case in point , people used to know very little about the organistation of the human body but nowadays , the knowledge is so broad that doctors have to get specialized to be efficient .
Furthermore , the only doctors who remain generalists ca n't cure everything and they often send you to a specialist to resolve your problem .

However , a bad consequence of this specialization is that people do n't know any more everything about their own subject .
If you have a broken leg , a neurologist wo n't be able to do anything to help you .
But anyway , according to me , this evolution towards specialisation is useful and , moreover , ineluctable .
It is first ineluctable because as I have said the knowledge is now so broad that a human being ca n't know everything .
Furthermore , it is useful because it allows us to better understand a very specific point of our subjetc .
For instance , all the progresses that have been made in the research for the cancer would not have been possible without this specialization .

To have broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs is pleasant but it also means that this knowledge will remain limited and it 's why specialization is needed .
