Nowadays , it is more common to travel in a group led by a tour guide , but it does n't mean that it is the best way to travel and discover a country .
The fact that you are dependent of a group and that you have not the possibility to meet native people are reasons which explain why I do n't think that travelling in a group is good .

Firstly , when you travel in a group , you are not independent .
You cannot visit monuments and places that you want .
You have to follow the group and the schedules which are provided by the tour guide .
For exemple , if you want to eat in a specific restaurant , you have to ask the permission to the guide and come back in a specific time .
Another thing is that if you are exhausted and you need to have some rest , you cannot not do it because of your appartenance to the group .

Secondly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide does n't permit to discover the culture of a country and to meet native people .
In general , when you stay in group , you have to go in a specific hotel .
You have not the opportunity to sleep in an bed and breakfast .
Tour guide will show you the most common or famous place , but not the secret and amazing places of a contry .
In touristic trips , you cannot be immerged in the culture or be in relation with the abits of the natives .
Even if yo are in a different country , you stay with people who are the same heritage .

To conclude , I think that the best way to travel is to organize a trip by yourself .
Even if it requieres more efforts , I am sure that you will apreciate your trip much better than if you travel in a group led by a tour guide .
