In order for a good company to sale its products , the company uses advertisement .
Sometime advertisement helps sale the product brilliantly , ans sometime the advertisement can just be uneffective .
In the following paragraph I will give an example to illustrate if yes or no a advertisements make products seem much better they really are .

The important questions when a producer make a advertisement for his/her product are : who are the consumers , and does the advertisement after being seen by the consumers will make the consumers want to buy the product ?
The producer must make sure that the advertisement gives the perfect informations of the product like : what do the consumer will gain with the product , is the product benefict and positive for the consumers , or is the product usable for a long period of time ...
For example , in Mc Donald commercials or Subways commercial they always talk about the taste .
They always show a big hamburgers or sandwich really great looking good .
Nevertheless , they will never talk about how many fat in term of calories people are going to put on their body , or how those extra calories are going to damage their body .
They dont have enough time ( considering that advertisements are supposed to be short and straight to the point ) to tell all the truth about the product .
So , they always debate the best part or side of the product .
The advertisement always shows the best part of the product , what you gain now by consuming the product , but never tells the what is going to happen after using the product .

Consequently , I truly beleive that the most advertisment make products seem much better than they really are because they never give the total perfect information about the product while advertising the product .
