But you for your professional work you have to be specialised in a specific subject .
Because today you have to be one of the best in your field to success and to be able to answer to all questions .
But their is not just the professiopnal world who is important .
And you ca n't progress if you are just able to speack about your job

In my opinion it 's very important to have a general culture to be able to discuss from all topic with other people , to be able to understand the world , the art .
You have to be aware on the world .

But general culture isvital in the all days life .
History is very important for example .
And you ca n't forget the history of humanity .
It 's a question of respect but it 's important to do not make the same mistake as in the past too .

Another argument is that to have knowledge in some field can help you in other subject .
For exemple you ca n't study art without having knowledge in history .
And I think that study mathematics can bring the logic you need to understand philosophy .

That 's why I think it 's important to have a minimum of knowledge in all the fields and to be specialised in one of them .
I think that the studies have to bring this balance betwenn the general culture and the specialisation .
It 's the key of the satisfaction of a person .
