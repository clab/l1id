Since you are a child , your parents , and other facors , teach how do well in your work , or in an activity .
When people grow up , they choose and follow their own way , which can be differents of that way that their parents teach them .
Some successfull person try new things and take risks , rather than other person only doing what they already know how to do well .
I agree with this statement .
People are influence by the money , the own personality .

First , the money has an important impact on someone 's behavior .
The money drives the people crazy .
Nowadays , the money represents the only thing that make people happy , relax and safe .
It means that successful people , people which have a good job and earn money , can try new things , take risks , and have novel experiences .
THey are safe and can pay for the new activities they want to try , or can take risk to play to Casino , for instance , because they are sure to have money after have lost .
It is the same way in the work .
They can take risks because they are succesful and have money .
If they make a mistake , they do n't worry because they have money so they are safe .
However , a person who are no successful and also not very rich ; this person ca n't do what she wants to do , try new things , or just take risks .
It means that all these three facts represent a risk or have to be due to a long reflection .
People without money do n't have choice .
THey do what they already know howdo well , in the aim to be safe and take risks .
For instance , a successful person wants to try something new such as rock climbing .
It is not a probem for her .
In contrary , a person without money ca n't wake up a morning and say she wants to try this activity .
SHe does n't have money to spend in that .
She has to work for that .
It means omly doe what she already know how to do .

Secondly , the personality of each person have a huge influence .
SOme people wants to enjoy the life , everytime , rather than other prefer just follow the cheep 's group , and do what their parents teach them .
After , there are the person who are afraid to take risks or try new things .
They are scared to pass away from the everyday life , and they are simply afraid of what they do n't know .
FOr instance , the person succesful are generally the person narrow-minded , extravageant , who express themselves and want to enjoy the life in every minutes whatever the risks .
In contrary , i remember than when i was fifteen years old i was scared of what i did n't know .
I did n't know it so i did n't if it was risky , good or bad .
ALso , i was afraid if my parents were agree or like this or this new things .
I just simply do what i know do well .

TO conclude , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
It enjoy the life , become independant , and live iyour own life in your own view of the world .
THe life its to short to do n't be ex
