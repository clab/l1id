In our society there are many communities representing the melting pot in our country .
The idea that every single person represents the whole community has changed these past ten years .

In the past the community represented a familly , a circle where people of the same apparence could stay together and grow .
Today , most of the young people grow without even knowing about major events , they are simply living in a virtual world based on the video-games , the cartoons ...
They do n't care about being up to date with international events , and major changes in the society .
Moreover , the youth is an age when one does n't really realize what implies being part of a social group .
For example , groups are made with people who share the same purpose , more than the same shape or roots .
This is why we can say that young people do n't spend much time trying to help their communities : they just do n't feel it 's their community .

I will use an example that occured in december 2005 in France , there has been several destructions in the ghettos near Paris and many main cities .
These children who were in majority less than twenty years old just reacted to what a politician said about a bad part of a certain community in the ghettos who keep on violating the laws : living as outlaws .
They thought their community was insulted but it was in fact a group of gangsters who do n't represent any community .

The fact is that young people lack q identity , being given an identity more than choosing one , by forgetting who they are and what is their true community .
I think the most important thing is that young people receive a good education by their parents first and by the society : it is their role to be part of a society as they are citizen and own a citizenship .

To conclude i would say that i agree with the fact that young people do n't help their community , given they lost their identity of being important actors of a society .
