From my point of view , a successfull person is someone who succeed in his life , someone who hit his goal , his objectives .
For my concern , I vote for the safety , that is to say that to if you always do what you already know how to do well , you will get more and more experience in the sector you 're working on .
You 'll specialize yourself , become an expert , and so as a matter of fact , will be successfull .

Let 's take an exemple , someone who has just started to work , he 's just started his professional life , generally he is going to do what he already knows , so , if he keeps working in his domain , he 'll become an expert .
But on the contrary , if he starts trying new jobs , specially in something he does n't know anything about , he 's taking too much risks , and he may not succeed as well as if he would have stayed in his domain and specialized himself .

This previous exemple implies someone who 's just started to work , but let 's talk about someone who had already a wealthy life and a good job .
He decides to vary his occupations by trying new things , things which he is completly unfamiliar with .
Suppose that he manages to succeed in all of his new occupations , we ca n't deny the fact that among all of his activities , if one day there is any problem that pops and that he ca n't find any solutions .
From one little problem he could lose lots of money by trying to save his affair , or even selling it .

So , through those two exemples , I disagree completely with this statement .
The only situation where I could agree , is that the person concerned , can afford itself taking those risks by trying new activities .
I mean if he has a really good business and a safety bank account that ca n't be going down .

But the safety is my priority for a successful person .
