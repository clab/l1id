`` Successful people are people who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' is a saying that I agree with for many reasons .
In this essay I will name the three main reasons why I argue in favor of that statement .

Truthfully , I want to put forward the opinion that people can only develop themselves and be happy in their lives if they have to take some risks .
One example comes to my mind : after my college , I could have decided to study at a general university because it was easy for me to pass the entrance exam .
Rather than doing this , I decided to sit for the business schools entrance exams , which were really more difficult .
It was risky because it assumed that I would have to bear two years of hard-working , to bear a strong pressure ans also to bear the risk of failing the exams .
FInally , I worked hard and today I 'm still proud of me because I have succeed the business schools exams : I have learn from my failures andI have get over the difficulties .

I mean , it is too boring not to try new things and not to go through some crisis !

Moreover , in a more general point of view , I think it is worthwhile to stay current and open-minded .
I would argue that point by telling that always doing what you already now could be risky and have some negative effects not only in your professional but also in your social life .
If you are too wise , that means that you have not the desire to stay current and modern .
In my opinion , it is very important to be interested in other and new ways of thinking and living .
For instance , I would love to live and work in China for a while : it would be `` risky ' because I would notice that there are different ways to work in a firm as in France , I will have to learn new ways of collaborating and negociating .
It could be difficult at the beginning but I will learn so much from this experience !!

The third point is a financial point !
I was educated in a close-knit family were my parents always push us to climb the social ladder .
The more you climb , the more you earn money .
The more more you climb , the more exciting you are !

As a conclusion , I would tell that trying new things and taking risks is the best way of approaching the life for personal , social and financial reasons .
