Travelling in a group led by a tour guide have many advantages .
First of all , it 's the easiest way to learn about the new country , and it 's culture , you are travelling in .
Most of the time , the tour guide has also many good advices , like where are the good spots located and what can be done , or what should n't be .
You also probably feel more secure by travelling with a tour guide , than by travelling on your own .
But despite all those advantages , i got to say that for me , there is nothing like travelling alone .
Because a trip must have a part of adventure , i mean you do n't really travel to feel secure , you travel to experience something new , you travel to discover new peoples , new cultures , new feelings , you travel to feel free , wich you really ca n't do when there is a tour guide telling you what to do and where to go ( eventhough it 's better for you ) .
But most of all , what i really would n't like to do , is travelling in a group .
I remember when i was in Africa with my dad , travelling on our own , when we met all those groups of french tourist with their guides .
They were probably sleeping on better hostels than we did , their trip was probably way more `` comfortable '' than ours , but i bet this was less interesting .
And is n't paradoxical to travel , wich mean to leave your country , to be surrounded by people from the same country ?
What 's the purpose ?
I 'd rather stay in France to be surrounded by french people ...

Finally i would say that even if it appears easiest to travel in a group led led by a tuor guide , you will never learn the the same things than by travelling on your own .
And to me travelling is about learning >
