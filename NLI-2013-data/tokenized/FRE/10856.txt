I actually think that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Let 's start with two simple examples .

Setting up a new restorant for instance .
The setter takes a huge risk : he spend his money , asks for loans .
All of this could lead him to sell his house , his car to give the money back to the bank .
But if he do not , maybe will he stay waiter for the rest of his life .

My second example is a person who wants to marry his girlfriend .
That could seems to him like a terrific change in his routine .
But if he do not , he can never know what a father life looks like .

I personnaly think that trying new things lead us to a better situation .
By trying new things you could invent or create something great .
In a financial point of view , creating new things is directly bound to the creation of new markets , new customers and so on .
Furthermore , inventing gives the inventor a better satisfaction than if he is always doing what he knows .

A other possible consequence is to find out a new way to do the things what you need to do .
In this case you could be more efficient , or making the others feel better .
For example a manager who set up a new method for his workers to create shoes , could reduce the noise that they have to face , and improve the factory 's production .
Anyway , if the new method does not show good results , he always can cancel it .

On the other hand , I think that doing what you already know is fine if you agree with your situation ; e.g. you could refuse a promotion to manager if you prefer spending great time with your family rather than having more responsabilities in your workplace .

I mainly agree with this statement , but I think there could be some exceptions , though .
