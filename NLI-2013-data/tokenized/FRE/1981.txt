Do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
Personally , I do n't think so , even if it 's quite difficult to know how much one enjoys life .

I do n't see specific reasons why young people would enjoy life more .
One could argue that their physical abilities are at their maximum , but in our modern societies , older people do n't necessarily suffer from health problems , and physical abilities are not the only sources of happiness .

I think some people enjoyed life more while being young , and others prefer life ` now ' , that is , while being older .
An idea widely spread is that being twenty years old is the best time in life , but the famous French writer Paul Nizan said he would never allow anyone to say such a thing .
This shows that it really depends on people .

Furthermore , it is not because one would like to be younger that he enjoyed life more at that time .
This can be explained by the fact that he would like to be younger , but also to know what he knows now .
Alas , if young people knew , if older people could !

The kind of enjoyment is simply different , depending on the age of people .
Maybe young people enjoy it more obviously , or , may I say , noisily : they want to make this known .
But people get - generally - wiser as time goes by , can enjoy other aspects of life , and are not concerned anymore by problems that , now they know it , are minor .

To conclude , I would say that this general statement - young people enjoy life more than older people do - is untrue .
This depends mainly on people , and the wise man can enjoy differently each period of his life .
