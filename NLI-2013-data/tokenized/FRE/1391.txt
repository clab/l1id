I think that specializing in one subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academics subjects , and this for many reasons .
At the time you begin studies where you have the choice to specialize or not , which means you 're entering University you already had a large view of different topics during high school years .
So a majority of people already know what tehy like and was is theiy are good at Specializing is also a good way to quickly do what you think you are made for .
It also allows people to find a job quicker as they have been specialising earlier .

During high school years pupils study a large variety of subjects and most of tehm at the end know what they like .
It can be rather science , litterature , sport , economy .
Thus they can already know where their point of interest are and specialize already in their freshman year .
It is time and money consuming to study subjects that you are not really interested in and that wo n't be useful in you career or even in your personal development .

If you think you like for example physics , studying it at the beginning of your university years will enable you , first to see if you really want to be a physician , second to have a greater involvement in what you are studying , by following more class and conducing more experiments .

An other important point is that by being more specialize it is more easy to find a job at the end of your studies .
People think specialist are more reliable in the task they are given to do than others .

However somes could say that by specializing you miss the big picture of the broad knowledge offered at Univerisity .
They also think that specialist are boringing people only focused on their subject .
It 's oftenly not true , if you specialize in one subject during courses you can also have many other center of interests outside your College our University .
You can be studying sciences like maths and play soccer at a very high level .
Some rugbymen who played in the English national were in fact doctors .
You can also focus on poetry and be interested in economy and learn it not as an academic subject .

Thus , I think that spezialing in one subject is not only the most efficient way of studying it'also a way to accomplish yourself through something you realy like and are able to do .
