Do young people really enjoy life more then older people do ?
Being a young person I cannot say that I 've experienced old age , and this makes the question all the more difficult to answer .
However when I hear about all attempts to try and remain young , with skin care products or even people selling their soul to the devil in exchange for eternal youth , I ca n't help but assume that being young truly is the most enjoyable age group .
Why would people fear old age otherwise ?
When I consider all the things I can do but my grandpa ca n't , I really do consider myself to be lucky .
I can play soccer , run around all day , eat thousands of calories without taking a pound but he can barely get off the couch to eat his soup .
I 'm constantly discovering the world and participating in it 's development but old people live in the past loosing themselves in deja-vus ...
Is this however only what makes us truly happy ?
Physical well being cannot only be the source to happyness .

Old people appreciate what has been done , they are proud of their accomplishments .
They get to see their familly grow , watch their children become parents , and grandchildren grow slowly taller then they are .
Older people do not have to worry about the mundane and often supperficial preocupations of a teenager .
Old people get to look forward to retiering , young people only the unfortunate prospect of a lifetime of work ...

How can someone judge happyness to be a inverse relation of age ?
Older people and young people just as they have different problems , can also have different ways of percieving joy .
I think it would be using a very limited perspective if we only took into account our steriotypical criteria .
Can the thrill of playing a hard fought game of soccer not be compared to the blissfulness of tranquillity ?
