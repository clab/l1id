An advertisement is a publicity for an object , a restaurant or food .
The company that makes it wants the people who watch the advertisement to go to that specific restaurant or buy that particular object .
We will first discuss the principles of advertising and then we will explain our specific opinion about the statement .

To begin with , an advertisement is made so that the company that offers the service or the good can sell more of it .
Therefore , the general idea is to make , for example , the object seem necessary at home , the office or even in the car .
To make it so attractive the producer needs to put forward its best qualities which will revolutionise your day to day lifestyle .
For example , we can put ourselves in the situation where we need to advertise car perfumes .
We will , in a first part , demonstrate that most cars have very bad smells and , then , that once the buyer purchased the car perfume these smells disappeared .
The producer will try to limit the fact it might take some time for the perfume to act .
But are these principles there to make products seem much better ?

In my opinion , I truly believe that `` advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
Taking our last example , the fact that the producer limits , in the advertisement , the perfume 's action time is false information .
The advertisement will necessarily show that the smell disappeared immediately after the man entered the car with the perfume .
Of course , there are many examples of this .
At Mcdonald 's , the Big Macs are nowhere near as perfect as in their commercials .
In a general way , most people know that every object will not be exactly like in the commercials .
The general population can make the difference between the ad and what the object will be like .
Eventhough , they do make products seem better than they really are , the only thing that counts is that the difference between reality and the commercial is not extremely large .

To conclude , our and our parents ' generations have been brought up with advertisements and with the companies ' will to lure more customers .
Therefore , I believe that if some companies `` stretch '' the truth about their products , as long as it is not in the extremes , then their advertisements are still ethically correct .
