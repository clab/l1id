Community ?
Who still helps his/her community ?
surelly young people do it less and less .
It surely is disappointing but there are obviously many reasons that explain this behaviour .
Firstly , it is hard for young people to find time to help their community .
Since school asks a lot of work and that more and more young people have sport after college , it is difficult for them to find a place in their schedule to help their community .
In fact , society is so much turned towards self-accomplishment that it is hard for people brought up with this ideal to turn towards someting else .

Secondly , the point of view of the friends matters a lot , and since it does n't sound very `` sexy '' to do community work , a lot of people just never do it .
Imagine the laughters of friends when you say are helping an old lady while they are going to play basketball !
the young people helping their community may feel rejected and thus stop helping their community .
I 'm not saying that paying attention to other people remarks is what I 'm doing or what I prone , not at all !
I 'm just saying that it is a behaviour I have observed .

Thirdly , unless youg people work in a political field where they really have the power to make things move well people do n't really find it interesting to help their community .
Nowdays young people are so much turned towards the futur that ( often ) their only idea is to leave their city , to build their own life far away of the one their communities have .

To conclude , young people do n't really help their community and it is a behaviour that is surelly pittyful .
But can we really accuse these young people ?
maybe it is also the fault of the society which build us up in a way that we don ' t really feel the need of helping our community .
A society yet more independant , more liberal and thus less familiar and social .
