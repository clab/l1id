I am under the impression that advertisements in general do not make people believe that the products that they aim at selling is better than they really are .
Actually , as far as I am concerned , I think that the purpose of an advertisement is to emphasize the qualities of a good .
Of course , an advertisement will not highlight the defects of a good because it will not be attractive for people .
The fact that a product is in reality not so better as it seemed is just a question of perception : it is a subjective problem .
This brings us to the matter of the subjectivity .

Actually , one consumer can be satified by a good that he has bought whereas another consumer will not .
The satisfaction about a good 's qualities is to be linked with what every consumer research in it .

It seems to me that there are no general rules that tell anyone what qualities are to be found in a specific good .
It is up to each consumer to make up its mind .

In that sense , to answer this question , we should make an opinion poll to know the peoples 's opinion about the qualities they expected from the product and what they really think once they have received it .

Moreover I would like to mention the fact that before buying , you always have got the possibility to ckeck the product so that you can see by yourself if the product is what you expect it to be .

I get the feeling that a good advertisement can make you think that what you will buy is a good product whereas in reality it is not .
For example , if you buy a product that everybody knows because everybody has seen its advertisement , there will be a such phenomenom that everybody will want to possess it .
This is the case of products that are said to be fashion .
No matter how the qualities of the good are : because the advertisement is well-known and attractive , the fact that it might not be a good product does not matter .
The fact that this product is attractive prevails .
But one must bear in mind that in that case , the product is said to be good because you possess the last new product of a company and not because the product in question has real qualities .

To put it into a nutshell , one could conclude by saying that the advertisement of a product has taken so much importance nowadays that it could make us forget to ckeck if we really need it and if it satisfies us .
