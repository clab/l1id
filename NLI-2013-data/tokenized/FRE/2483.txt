Since Humans exist , one point has always been discussed : advantages and disadvantages to be young or old .
Once again , we are going to try to determine whether young people or old people enjoy the most life .
Before starting , it is important to precise what means young and what means old .
For example , I have been treated as amn old person by my sister during the christmas holidays and i am only 23 .

For this essay , we wil consider that someone is young until his first official work day .

Young people are more able to enjoy life than old people .
As a matter of fact , they can project to do whatever they want without thinking to the consequences of their acts .
You can go out all night long and forget going at school in the morning .
you will not be fired for this .
However , if an employee is doing the same , it is going to be harder to provide good excuses .

Basically , when you are young you depend on your parents and you can be sure that they are going to help as much as they can .
So you can try .
Amn old person is going to consider the point totally differently .
First of all , this person can be responsible of a family , of a team , of a company .
It gives him the obligation to be ready 24 hours a day for them .

In contrary to this , how can you enjoy your life if you have just your time to spend .
In fact , the world is crual and gives the power to enjoy to people that have the less the time to use it .
Enjoying life is very easy if you have enough money to do what you want to do .
Unfortunately , only old people who work for years can allow them to enjoy their like .
Traveling around the world , going to the Stade de France for the world football cup final , buy the last Ipod ...

As I said , it is very easy to enjoy life .
Nevertheless , it is not free and it seems that only old people are able to do this .

All our life , we want to be what we are not .
When we are at school , we want the driving licence to go out during the week end .
When we are student , we want to work in a good and reliable company in the way to have a family and buy a house .
When we are employees , we fancy being in retire ...

We just need to be us .
