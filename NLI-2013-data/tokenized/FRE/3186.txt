In the past , young people used to help their parents and their communities .
But nowadays it has changed .
I agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their communities because of many reasons .

Helping the community is a very important thing to do but nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Firstly , nowadays young people have a lot of activities .
They go the college and after that they have homeworks to do .
A lot of young people have to find a job during their studies because they do n't have enough money to pay them .
And after working , young people do not have anought time to do anything else .
For example I am doing an European MBA in a management schoolm and to pay ; y studies , I have to work all evenings and all week end .
I also have to do my assignments and it 's a huge work .

I think that in the past young people had more time to help their community .
They did n't had as many things to do as we do nowadays .
I am sure that the problem is the time because young people often want to help their communities but they ca n't .

To conclude the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to their communities is right .
Nevertheless they have many things to do and when they can , they like to be helpfull , for their communities or for their parents
