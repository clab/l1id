Is it more important to understand concepts than learn facts ?
This question is mainly about the opposite educative systems in the world .
Anglophone countries such as England or The United States give more importance to facts whereas French educative system highlights the major role of concepts .

The French educative system is well kown for the large set of concepts you have to learn before being able to practice .
Teachers evaluate one 's ability to increase its theorical knowledge rather than the way he performs .
This system allows students to understand all phenomenons and to konw how they work .
For instance , comparing the french set of laws to the english one underlines the major differences between learning concepts or facts .
In the french code of rights , numerous articles are written in order to take into account all citizen behaviors .
On the contrary , the english legal system focus on reals cases that happened in the past .
This lead me to the second part of my study .

To contrast , anglophone countries believe in the pratice .
In universities for example , students work on case study more than on concept .
They consider that student will better react to their environment if they have already experienced all alternatives .

In my opinion , i agree with the angliophone educative system and with the importance to learn facts rather than concepts .
I consider that our future life will be full of positive or negative experiences and that we will need prior experiences to reference to .
As wll as i am concerned about education , i would say that french system should take example of the english system .
