I think it is a very positiv point of view and i complitly support it .
Only lazy poeple sit on what they have , and look where they are at ...
I think that you do not lose any thing except a little bit of money by trying new things .
What I mean is that you actualy have a lot of chances to fail but if you success you can make a lot of money and that is how poeple see you .
I would have to take for example for this point Mr. Bill Gate who has tryed to revolutionate computers and as result he is the wealthyest person on the planet .

I could also take my mother as an example , everytime she tries a new recepy , it is not always good but this way she gets better .
Because I can tell her what went wrong or what should she add .
Could you imagin a world where no one would neither invent nor change anything ?
That world would be the lazy 's world .
I would get bored after one second .

One day someone told me : '' It is by making mistakes that you will get better '' and until now nothing has proved him wrong !
He also sed : '' You can never fail , the only thing you can do wrong is not to try ! ''
I ' actualy glad I met that person because since then , I have just been going forward in life and in sports .

After that I think it is also a way of life and I think some poeple or born with desire and some are not .
I have rarelly seen poeple learn that kind of things .
I am going to have to take my brother as example : My parents and I think he is talented in a lot of things but he just does not expend his knowledge .
