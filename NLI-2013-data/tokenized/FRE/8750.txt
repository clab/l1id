This is a very common question in pedagogical circles .
Sometime , it can become a very political questions .
In fact you ca n't really decide to learn with one method .

A student who understand the ideas and the concepts behind a course will have a good grade at the final exam .
This method of learning allow a student to develop its own comprehension of a course .
He can develop some `` ways of doing something better '' .
If he understand the course , he can also anticipate the next class subject for example .
He can also ask some interesting questions to the teacher .
In general , this method of learning develop the student 's brain .
He will be more reactive .
For example , in a Mathematic course , it is very dangerous to learn facts only .
You need to understand the underlying ideas behind a theorem to understand it .
Years ago , I once decided to go to a Math exam without praticing and understanding the course .
The result was naturally bad because the professor wanted us to understand totally the concepts of his course !

At the opposite , learning facts can be also a good manner to learn .
Some courses can be very complex and with very little time so the best manner to finish the course is to learn theorems for example without demonstrate it .
Also , in certain domains , like history or geography , you can only learn facts .
There are not many things to understand .
You just have to learn .
In High School , I had a history exam .
I just learned all the notes I 've taken during the course and I finally had a A-grade .

I really think that understand ideas and concepts is the most efficient way to learn .
I had the chances to have a lot of professors who teached like that .
But in some really special courses , simply learning facts can be the best manner to succeed !
