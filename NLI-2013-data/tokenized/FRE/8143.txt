As far as I am concerned , I take side for the idea that it is more essential and useful to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .

First and foremost , it is worth mentionning that a strong aquaintance is based on the ability to classify facts and events .
Indeed , for instance , in order to understand historical events , it is unefficient to accumulate facts in a chronological order .
What is really thought-provoking is to be able to identify why it has occured .
To identify that , you must be aware of philosophical theories or political movements .
Thus , I personnaly believe you have to learn concepts and ideas to have a clear idea of history and to understand better facts .

Furthermore , knowing an accumulation of facts is useless .
As a matter of fact , it does not allow students to face all situations .
There is a striking issue ; Students who study economy need to know what is liberalism or Keynesianism but not the little event that arose in an unknown company .

Eventually , students have to prepare them to be efficient and dynamic on the labor market .
Broadly speaking , I think that learning ideas and concepts build your ability to face predicament or dilemnas .
In a company , when you take a decision , it is not only important but also , to me , mandatory to refer yourself to a concept in order to defend your viewpoint and your action .
A wellknown idea or concept may lead your boss to trust you about the efficiency of your action .

To conclude , I personnaly believe that ideas and concepts are crucial for a strong and logical knowledge in university .
Moreover , I think that it is essential to adapt to the labor market .
