The issue of that life is more appreciates by the young people rather than old people is a controversial one .
On the one hand when a person is old she appreciate life in a better way .
On the other hand certain young people consider that youth must discover lifer rather than studie .
However , in the final analysis I believe that an older people enjoy life more than certain young people do .

One of the reasons of my belief is that studies are too important to be sacrified by an edonist behaviour .
Indeed , every person who made studie and who have had a knowledge enjoy life with benefict .
More than a person who decides to leave studie for enjoy life .
The abbility of speaking different languages is the greatest example .
To my mind enjoy life would say bring to another people with another culture and another language .

Another way to justify my point of view is that life experience allows to discover more subtilities of life .
For instance love deception , familly death allow to take the time to discover and apprecaite life .
Generaly is not the case of young people .
The life experience bring some knowledge or behaviour that it is impossible to learn without experience .
It is probably a empirical pompous speech , but for me experience is very important .

Last but not least , I am firmly convinced that the life is very interesting to discover but with money this become amazzing .
When I say that I think particulaly to trip abrove in some part of the world .
For example a trip in Asia for an occidental person allows to discover a new culture and to enjoy life .
However this trip is impossible without money .

For all these reasons I believe that the age and the experience are necessary to enjoy life .
In fact , we can not pass our young years to studie and wait to discover the world and , by the occaion the life , but it is an hisytory of compromise .
