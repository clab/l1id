The question of whether young people or older people enjoy life more than the others do requires important consideration .
To my mind there are two mains reasons explaining why this question is difficult to answer .
First what does ` enjoying life ' means ?
Secondly , do you think that enjoying life is an issue of age ?
All these questions considered , personally I tend to think that young people enjoy life and benefit from life pleasure more than older people do .

Firstly , it advisable to explain my way of thinking about ` enjoying life ' : during the seventies , all around the world , many young people were expressing their fancy for liberty and pleasure .
At this time young people craved for enjoying life .
That was the first time in the history that the pleasure took a very important place in everyone life .
In my opinion , enjoying life deals with enjoying every pleasure , every good moment of our life .
Enjoying life should express hope , whishes and dreams , in other world , every day of my young life , I try to think and dream of a better future , when all my dreams will be possible .
With this way of thinking , it esay to understand why when you are young , it seems to be more easy to enjoy life , much more easy than you get older .
Because adulthood deserves more seriousness , more patience , more reflection .
Older people often have children to take care , and children become their priority far before their own pleasure .
Professional word requires also seriousness and reflection , it could be difficul for older people to give up all their obligations for taking time to enjoy life .

Secondly , enjoying life could depond on the age , but not really your civil age but your mental one .
I mean , if you think as a young people , you can act as a young people .
Thus , you can give up your activities if you feel boring , with the condition you are free , you do not have personal , familial obligations .
Even if enjoying life could be affordable for everyone , it ' s much easier when you are young

Always being young is not a wishfull thinking , do not forget the better is coming .
You will agree to Live fast , anddie young
