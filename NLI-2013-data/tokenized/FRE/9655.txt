The world is made up different people , those who are risks takers and those who do only what they know or those who only do what they are told to do .
But what makes people successful in life ?
Is it the fact that some of them are willing to take risk or simply because others will only and simply go by what they are told or what they know .
What are the characteristics of successful people ?

Someone who is successful inded is someone who is always willing to go beyong what he is being told to do .
Usually a risk taker will develop new ideas , will find new strategies and new ways to better explain a situation or an experiment .
FOr example , a student who is willing to go further in an experiment in order to find a response to a question or a problem will more likely succeed than another student who does not .
The student who is willing to go another mile will probably find answers to the problems that he is encountering in an experiment .
The risks takers usually succeed in life and in everything they do .
I say usually because it is not always true in every cases .

A good example of a risk taker is someone is someone who will travel to an unknown country not knowing where exactly he or she wil be going .
Going to an unknown country is quite challending .
The fact that you do not know the culture , the obstacles that you may encounter throughout your journey , make it a risk .
However , it is a new environment , a new culture and the person will certainly learn from that experience .
In any case whether it is good or bad , I believe there is always a lesson to learn from every experience .
The person who takes it upon him or her to learn a new language or live in an environment other than his or her original one will morelikely be successful because he or her would learn so much from that experience .
Rather a person who do not want to try anything new , will always be confined in the same environment and wo n't be subject to anything new .
By taking risks you may develop new skills , that you never thoughts you had .
But how would you know the strength and the qualities that you have if you are not willing to give it a try .

I definitely beleive that successful oeple are the one who are willing to take risks rather than only doing what they already know .
Being a risk taker is what teaches you new things , and makes you develop new skills and aptitudes that you were probably not aware of .
