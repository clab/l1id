According to me , I think that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
It allows us to have knowledges in differents domains , to understand so many things and to posses all the basis in order to choose a specialization , in case of one .

Firstly , I think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects gives us a very wide range of informations .
This range of informations permits us to become aware of a lot of things , subjects and topics .
We can learn so many notions that it would be a pitty of not integrating various knowledges .

Second , I think that there are a lot of things very intersetings in this world .
Knowing thoses , allows us to understand the place and the world where we live in .
It gives us a different perception of the life , not a focused one as if we are specialized in a particular subject , that could be a very deep one but not very large .
Be this way of thinking we become more open-minded and our place in the society will be a result of that .

And finally , by having broad knowledges of many academic subjects , a specialization will occur alone and naturally .
We all have affinities for a specific domain , so by knowing a lot of things , one points will appear as more captivating than the others .
This view demand more research than if we want to specialize us in one domain , but it also permit us to compare diferrents subjects and then choose the best one for us .

To conclude , I would like to say that a wide broad knowledge of academics topics is decidely better than a specialization .
We live only one time on earth , and knowing things in a hudge range of domain is a possibility that we have the benifits of .
So , why being closed-minded and focused on one thing we suppose the best for us when there is too many fascinating things to know ?
