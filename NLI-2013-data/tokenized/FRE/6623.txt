Nowadays , we can see a lot of cars in all streets of the world in spite of the growth of th price of the oil .
I think it wo n't change in twenty years .

I think that people want to be more and more indepedant and the car is one of the signes of this independance because you can go where you want when you want , you just have to pay the oil .
The need of move is very important for the man and people prefers take their car instead of the bus for exemple .

And it 's why I think cars will not disappear with the time , but the oil , will do .

It 's a big ecological problem because oil pollutes a lot the ozone , and we must find new way of cars energy in the future like alcohol , it 's already done in some countries like Brazil for exemple .

It is also a political conflict , as I said after , poorests countries than France , like Brazil , had already adopted new energy but for richest countries , it 's a way of earning money because there are a lot of taxes on the oil .

The society of consommation and benefits we live in is also a preponderant factor , because people are attract to buy more and more , they are touched by the advertisement done by all manufacturers , and if you close cars manufacturers , it will have big consequencies on the market , and create unemployment .

But by the same way , if you reduce the use of the cars , you must create new underground structure so it will create temporary workers which can be helpfull for the unemployment of people who are not qualified for another job .

However , a thing that we must know is that for the 2006 year , the statistics shows that the sales of cars have dicrease for a lot of big company like Renault .

To conclude , it is very difficult to predict the future of the cars market , but from my point of view , I can not live whithout my car , I am keen on driving .

So I hope cars will not disappear ...
