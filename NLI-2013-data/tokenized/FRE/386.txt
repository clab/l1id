As a matter of fact , it is impossible to know everything on every subjects .
Everyone has to make choices .
We can choose to know a little about many subjects , to have an overview of each academic subject .
Or we can decide to become an expert in one specific area .
In my opinion , becoming a specialist in one subject is a better issue because we will really understand the purpose of the subject and we will not obtain only a superficial knowledge .

It is trust to say that when somebody does n't know everything on a subject , he can arrive to the bad conclusions concerning a probleme .
Then , his knowledge is useless .
What is the aim of knowing a little a everything ?
This is n't usefull .
For example , if we study a part of the French law , we ca n't solve any situation because a lot of elements will miss us .
We must know all the articles refering to the problem , all the previous situations which look like the one we are studying .
Otherwise we are certain to make an error .

By knowing major issue of many purpose , we can seem very bright for a while .
But it is a superficial knowledge .
Somebody like that seems very interesting but in fact he ca n't assure a real conversation on any of the subject he pretends to know .
All his knowledge is a superficial one .

Deciding to specialize in one specific subject is the best way to be really usefull and to obtain an advantage from our knowledge .
Learning little parts of everything is a waste of energy .
Being a specialist is being professional , efficient and usefull .
