In a lifetime , be successful is very hard and people usually try to be only good at something and not really successful .
What is the difference between successful people and the rest of the world ?
This question has to be answered to understand why successful people are so special .
If someone said that the key of success is trying new things , I would strongly agree with this statement , because of many reasons .

One of the reasons for what I agree with this idea is the way you become successful .
Successful people are special people , which means they have done something special , something nobody has done before them .
The only way to make something special is trying new things , which is already a risk to take .
For example , a young and beautiful girl wants to be a famous model .
For what I know , the first step is being noticeable by a photographer , in meaning to be chosen between a large group of beautiful women .
It could be very difficult to do if this young woman does n't try some new attitude , posture , even when she is n't sure about her move .

Another reason is that successful people are often venturous .
They like venture and that why they can go further .
They go over their own limits .
Once they know how to do something , they always want to learn something else over and over again .
According to the `` people '' magazines , most of Stars were poor in their childhood .
They came from destroyed families , divorced families and all kind of big issues .
However , they had the dream of becoming successful , so they decide do to something uncommon .
They decided to leave all the things they already knew , to do something they had n't done before .

In conclusion , I think that the risk is the key of success for all successful people .
