Although people specialized in one specific subject have often a better knowledge of it as I do , I prefer to have a broad knowledge of many academic sujects for two main reasons .

Firstly , I believe that a good knowledge on several topics will help me to find more jobs in very different areas .
Indeed , I am doing engineering studies and I like both the automotive and the aeronautic industries .
In order to start my first job in one of these industries and to have the possibility to switch to the other one after a few years , it is crucial for me to keep a broad knowledge in both two fields .

Secondly , a broad academic knowledge will help me to better understand the world around me .
Indeed , even if a strong knowledge would allow me to understand a specific subject more in details , I think that a broad knowledge will allow me to understand many more subjects with a sufficient comprehension of them .
A good example can also be taken from my studies .
I learned fluid mechanics in details and I only had a short introduction to other subjects such as turbomachinery or acousitc .
Nevertheless , my basics in acoustics were more than sufficient to understand the most common acoustic phenomenon that surronds me in my day-to-day life .
I can now easily understand how a speaker or a microphone is working and explain the basic principles to my friends , even if I do not know all the theory in details .

In conclusion , although some students prefer to specialize in one specific subject , I definitely prefer to acquire a broad knowledge on many academic subjects .
It will help both in my professional life as well as in my life out of the office .
