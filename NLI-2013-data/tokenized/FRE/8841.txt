I am conviced that students should understand ideas rather than learn facts .
Nevertheless , I think that it is often worth paying attention to facts and , more precisely , regarding them as a strating point for a deeper study .

First , I think that learning facts without trying to deeply understand their origin is useless .
For instance , in economics , there are lots of facts concerning the way unemployed agents behave when they try to get information about vacant jobs .
When I was at the university , I have been precisely told about the percentage of workers that use word of mouth communication to get a job instead of formal means of getting information ( newspapers , unemployment agencies and so on ... ) .
To know such a percentage is really useless but makes more fundamental questions emerge .

When a student understands the ideas and concepts that lie behind an observed fact , he really develops his capacity to adapt to different problems and situations .
He is then able to analyse a greater number of situations than the number he could have analysed learning the fact itself .
To restrict his attention to facts prevent him from developing his autonomy .
