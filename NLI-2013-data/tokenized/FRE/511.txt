Today companies need diversity in order to stay competitive in a very rude market whereas student are more and more specialized in a knowledge for example they chose a special course to study marketing or human management .
This two fact are contradictory .

That 's why I am totally agree with this statememt for many reason .
Have a large knowledge concerning very different subjects give us many benefits .
First if student are performant in differents sectors they obtain a good mobility in work .
It allows to change lot of time of work for example if you study mangement and maerketing it allows you to first work in advertisment and the in the human ressources .
I think it is very important .
Your work is more exciting .
Whith general capacities concerning differents activities you will complete your knowledges and you will become more competitiv against other worker with only specialized capacity .
You will obtain easily a work qnd will better earn .

Then in a complex market you have to consider all side of the environment and so you have to improve your general knowledges in order to understand and act well on the market .
General information can help you to resolv a problem .
A complete foration allows you to best consider a problem .

Moreover a lack of general knowledge is an important drawback because it reduces the subject of discussion in your allday life .
All things you know will be used one time into a speak and so the more knowledge you can learn the more you must learn .
The people considered as open-mainded present lot of knowledges .
Actually they are specialized in a course but they have great knowledgs concerning others subjects .

To conclude I cqn say that it is a bad strategie which is used by education .
When student are specialized they have a huge lack in general knowledges
