From my point of view , I totally agree with the statement that advertisements emphasize and magnify some products in a questinnable way .
For at least three caracteristics , which are quality , quantity and effectiveness , advertisements often misleading .

Marketing makes us believe that the product we are buying is the best on the market and that you could not find a better product in the whole world .
For example , Mac Donalds ' burgers are often cited in advertisements as the best burgers in the world .
Although I agree that they are pretty good , Burger King 's burgers are also very good .
Other examples could be find with toys .
Children often think that that will have a toy bigger than it really is because of the way it is exposed in the advertisement .

You could also manipulate people with the quantity you are selling to them .
As for instance , a marketing campain could make you believe that you are purchasing 1000 kilograms of a specific ingredient , when in fact your are purchasing only 1000 pounds of it , that is a typical trap .

Another manipulation from advertisements is to make a product efficient when this product is not working .
There are countless version of advertisements claiming that a product is the one with which you will loose your overweight or with wich you will refind your youth .
In fact it never works , but the marketing does .

As to conclude it must be said that people , especially children , should take care about misleading advertisements , because it could lead to many disapointments and sometimes more than that .
Marketing is a science with a unique goal , which is maximising the profit on the product it sells .
