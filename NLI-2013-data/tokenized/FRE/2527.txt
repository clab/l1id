Youth can but does n't know , elderness knows but ca n't any more .
That the way I would answer this question .
In my mind , when you are young you can enjoy the simple fact of being alive and having the whole life in front of you .
Young people are unaware of the miseries that goes along with living .
For sure , health and hope help for enjoying life , but when you do n't know yet where is real happiness , you just waste your time .
Older people maybe have another way of being happy and enjoying life that may not be worst : they know what they have done , and hopefully get ideas of what they still can do .

Most of the time , older people have more material wells than young ones and the satisfaction of a well managed past life can keep an elder being happy , with his family , the house he built , or the society he helped to carry on .

Moreover , this state of things allows them to know that they will do pass ...
so , why not to do what you have ever wanted to do ?
Older people know that their time is to come , and regarding this , get pride of what they done before .
The reason why older people may enjoy life less than younger ones comes from the fact that they sometimes just live not to die , whereas young ones just live to be happy .

Youth is for fighting , building and lust for life , elderness is for being in peace , getting benefits of what you done hardly when you had the strength to do it .
or that the way it should be .

In the end , I would say that it 's easier to enjoy life when you are young , but elder way of enjoying life is much more true and deep .
