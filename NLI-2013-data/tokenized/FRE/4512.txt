Nowadays , competition among companies is increasing .
Companies use any means possible to make profits .
Advertisements are used to reach their targets and to sell their products regardless the qualities .
I do agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First , advertisements present only a picture of products .
Televisions are one of the main way used by companies to conduct advertisements .
Products seem very great when watching televisions .
There is no way to touch the product .
One cannot have physical contact with this product .
Subsequently , it is hard to verify the product 's quality .
I recently ordered a cell just by calling the phone number I saw on television during advertisements .
The cell phone seemed very good .
It had many features .
But , I did return this product because it was not working .
It was quite different from what advertisements showed .

Second , advertisements are conducted to make money .
Companies pay a lot of money to get their products known by customers .
Televisions or media in general do not care about the qualities of products being advertized .
It is therefore a contract between companies suppliers of products and televisions companies .
The contract has to be fullfiled bu each party .
customers ' interests are not really a concern .
Companies expect to sell their products towards advertisements .
Most of time , these companies will refuse to replace a defective product .
Customers are therefore victims of false advertisements because of companies that are only motivated by making profits .
Making profits is common .

Because advertisements make productts much better , customers have to pay more attention .
They have to make sure that producs are of great quality .
Products should therefore be sold with mandatory warranty period in order to prevent customers from false advertisements .
This is very important today .
