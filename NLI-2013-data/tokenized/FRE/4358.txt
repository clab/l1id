Did the young generation really forget their dues to their communities ?
Are we really that selfcentered ?
I tend to say that we are definitely not and that it is the image that is reflected by a minority of people who do n't care about others .

First of all , I 'd like to say that - working in a hospital myself - I have seen many young people takeing care of the older generations .
In fact , and this is what stroke me most , when I started working there , a great majority of the staff is made of pleople under thirty years of age .
They all seem to give the best they can in any situation .
This is why I ca n't stab them in the back , pretending that we are n't helping our communities anymore .

Secondly , I basically think - as I wrote at the beginning - that this image is has been created by some people , who , in fact , do n't care about their communities .
But is it really only their fault ?
No it 's not .
The way pleople act , stronly depends on the education they got from their parents and on the environement , the conditions in which they have grown to the persons they are today .

On Balance , I refuse to think , that all young people are that selfcentered as the question lets us thin .
While some may not help , other still do .
We do n't have the right to put all eggs in the same basket .
