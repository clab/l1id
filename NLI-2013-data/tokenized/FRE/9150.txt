I personally agree with the fact that understanding a concept or an idea is more useful than to learn about those facts or ideas .
To support my statement I will mention the followings :
- The learning process does not implies that the person has understood and may be capable to reproduce the fact in question .
- The definition of the learning process could be very much complex and its level could be difficult to asses .
- The understanding of a concept or an idea implies that the student is capable to explain `` what it is all about that specific concept ''
- The understanding of a concept or idea gives also to the student the freedoms to manipulate the information received and associate it with some of his other learned and understood concepts .

While the learning process could also includs repeating or copying of a concept without always being able to adapt it or use in a diferent context , understanding appears to be more important .

It is important to mention here the fact that the better studends will understand diferent concepts in schools the better will be their adaptation in the working environment .
The importance of understanding ideas rather that only learning them is , that whatever is understood psychologically remains longer inside our brain than any other thing what we have learned without being capable to acquire the concept or main idea .

Another reason , I may mention here is the fact that it is obviously less stressful for a student who did understood a concept to prepare and pass his exams , than to ask one student to learn some facts that he is unable to understand and reproduce those facts during an examination , or even to reminber them after some time .

In conclusion I personally believe that its weill be more usefull to our society to make sure that our student get whatever information they need in a such manner they can understand it , and make it theirs .
In this way we can be assure that the next generation have what its take to go further than the generation it is replacing .
