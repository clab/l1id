Concerns about global warming and cuts of green house effect gases tend to make us believe that in the future , there will be less cars than there are today .
However , I feel that this assumption is a bit rough and should be balanced .
To put it straight I do not think that there will be a dramatic decrease in the number of cars .
At least I do not think that it will occur everywhere .

First , car is a means of transportation the advantages of wich are somewhat hard to challenge .
It is probably the only means of transportation combining speed , 24/7 instant availability , high standard of comfort , security against attacks and possibility to reach in a decent number of hours any withdrawn place in a country .
All other long distance means of transportation make you dependent on departure times , exasperating delays and complicated correspondances .
For all these reasons I do not believe that need for cars will fall .

What makes us think of an upcoming abandon of cars is the feeling that huge expense is done to incite people not to take their cars in city centers .
In France , for instance , constant effort is done to improve the standard of service of railway networks in major towns .
For example , the city of Paris is building a tramway network at the moment .
Nevertheless , whatever important may be these efforts , cars will remain necessary to reach precise places at any time .

Moreover , in the countryside , it will long remain excessively expensive to create a powerful transportation network .
What I feel is the most elevant reason why cars will not be abandoned is the feeling of independance that they bring .
For young people for example , buying the first is an important step towards independance fromth
