I do n't completely agree with this statement .
In a certain way , young people ( young adults ) enjoy life more than older ones , but , older people do enjoy life , at least certain aspects of it .
Of course , it also depends on your definition of `` enjoying life '' .

When you are young , healthy , when you do n't have responsabilities yet , you probably enjoy life : travelling , going out , practice sports .
For instance , travelling requires a certain physical ability : enduring a 12 hour flight , an eight-hour jet lag , different weather ...
Young people adapt more easily to these changes , while for older people , it takes more time .

But the counter point of being young , is that you have to study or work to build yourself a future , so you might not have as much time as someone who is retired .
Enjoying life for young people nowadays sometimes means taking drugs , which can cquse irreversable damage , and because of that , they wo n't be able to enjoy life as older people .

But on the other hand , when you are older , in general , you have more money and more time to spend .
For example , older people in their early retirement years .
They are still healthy , they have more money than a 20 year old student , they can travel where they want , for as long as they want .

But with age comes responsability .
You get older , you have a family to support , you ca n't go out clubbing every Saturday night .
And , when you get older , health is n't always on your side .
And with a bad health it is more difficult to enjoy small pleasures of life , for example , skiing when you have a bad knee , going to a concert when your hearing is getting worse .

As you grow older , your occupations change .
When you are 20 , you like going to clubs and dancing all night long , but by the time you are 45 , you prefer a quiet night with a couple of friends .
This is still enjoying life , just at a different level .

Some people say the point of being young is to enjoy life , but what 's the point if when you 're 50 , you have a heart disease that 's unables you to do the things you like ?
