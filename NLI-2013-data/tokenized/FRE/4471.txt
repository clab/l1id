Even if we all have been once seduce by an advertisement although the product was not that good , I think that this question is more about what the real objective of advertisement is : to demonstrate the quality of an object or to give to someone the desire to buy it .

As an example , I still remember an advertisement made by san orange juice company .
It showed an young teenager who was coming home after playing basketball with his friend and asking to his mother where is the juice .
The boy and his life looked so great that for weeks I wanted to taste it .
It happens that one day , I found it in a supermarket and tasted it , of course I did not like it but the advertisment has already done its work , I had bought a bootle of it .

Neverthless did the advertisment lied about the juice ?
Not at all , it has only match with what I was wanting to see and what could make me desire the juice .

That 's why , I do not agree totally with the sentence as it is a bit more complicated .
An advertisement must be due to a type of persons .
To that group the product will seem great but to lots of other , they will not see what that advert is made for .
Advertisments play with a whole range of feelings that a man can feel , it can also play with confidence .

by making famous person only saying they use this product and not another one they manage to sell a lot .
Indeed the man who is buying the product will first think as his star that this product is the b

So in my opinion it is true that advertisements seem better than they are really but not totally
