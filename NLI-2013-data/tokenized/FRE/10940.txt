I think there is no miracle solutions to be successful but we can do the best to achieve this objective .
I am totally agree with people who said that you must take many risks to plan a successful career .
For example , if you want to open a restaurant , you must risk a part of your own money to have sufficient funds to buy all a restaurant need .
If you do n't want to take this risk , you 'll never open your restaurant .
But only take risks will not guarantee a successful career , I think you must be innovant to achieve this objective .
By doing only what you can do , you 'll never progress because you do n't try to experiment a new type of work and I think successful people are in constant progress to be the most competitive in their field of activity .
And if they failed in a project , they can change totally their activity because they more adaptive .
So experimenting new things is very useful to have success because the world is changing every day and it will not adapt to you , you will adapt to it .
Imagine a grocery which only sell apples .
If apples disapear on the earth ' surface , he has two solutions .
He can stop this activity or he can sell other products .
That 's the reason you must adapt what you do
