Nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Who are those who spontaneously share their time to help ?
What about those who do not help and what are their reasons ?

First of all , it is important to determine exactely the zone we would like to focus on .
We could consider the North American and French populations even we cannot deny the cultural gap .

In our western cultures , nowadays people grow up as consumers and within time they tend to be willing to satisfy their evergrowing desire to consume .
This behavior reflects the individualism that characterizes the nowadays young people .

Not only are young people individualist but they are also aware that time is money .
The more time you spare , the more money you save !

Those who spontaneously give enough time to helping their communities are people who consider being fair is essential .
A friend of mine used to be volunteer at the J. Carter 's Fundation .
She worked with a group of people coming from all over the world and coming from various walks of life .
They learnt how to built houses and they spent their whole summer building houses for the poor latin american families who cannot afford such comfort .

I could also provide the example of a friend who spends every saturday in a pension for elderly people as a volunteer so as to offer them company and sincere attention .
I do admire her devotion and the way she is involved in what she believes fair and good .

I belong to those who do not give enough time to helping .
i sometimes help associations especially in the winter when they need volunteers to serve food to the people in need .
But I am aware this is not enough and I could do more .

I do agree that lots of people of my age do not give time at all because they do not feel concerned .
Our generation is deeply rooted in an individualist perspective .
My parents ' generation has known Winter 54 ' for instance with the great national movement lqunched by the Abbe Pierre in France .
Maybe my generation suffers from a lack of such a charismatic spokesman who could be able to gather young people and to channel their conscience and their energy to give more time to helping the communities .
