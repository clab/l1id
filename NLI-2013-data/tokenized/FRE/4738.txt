Advertisement has become one of the most important business in today 's society .
Media are always keen on giving details about the budget this or that company has spent on ads , wether in the newspaper , on television , on radios .
Now , the question is : are most advertisements making products seem much better than they really are ?
In other words , are most advertisements misleading up to the point that we , as consumers , are fooled about the actual quality of the product ?
This question can not be answered in a rationnal , or scientifical manner , for the simple reason that all products would need to be tested by a panel in order to evaluate the discrepency between the conception of the product brought by the advertisement and the perceived quality .
Nonetheless , we can try to point out some ideas based on examples .

The purpose of an advertisement is to make people buy the product .
This trivial statement implies another triviality : the message used in the advertisement has to be emphatic , it has to praize the qualities of the products and highlights the characteristics that make it different from its concurrents .
Most washing powders have no choice but to state they can wash the nastiest kind of stains you could ever find on your shirt .
This is a classical example of misleading advertisement , and we all have experienced the stain that is not removed by the magic powder we saw on televison .
Most advertisement praizing an technical breakthrough should be considered precauciously .

Now with the development of new technologies , and with the dramatic changes the world has witnessed in the past centuries , there are two main points to be made in order to nuance this too affirmative statement .

Considerable progress has been made in the field of advertising .
Now , some ads do not even show the product they are selling .
Some others use humour .
By using different means of delivering the message , these ads are more likely to touch their target , and they could not even be accused of being misleading , because you were not shown the product , or not in its normal usage .
It would be an advertisement for a car which is shown 2 seconds at the end .
for example .

Finally , the sensibility of the consumer can not be excluded from the evaluation of the advertisement .
What can seem to be emphatic to some , can look boring to others .
Show a group of monkeys to sell a washing powder , the consumer 's response might vary to great extents .
This is an actual add .

Advertisement will remain , one should evaluate it with its one feelings .
