The new generation of people are more self involve .
if we get to understand them then we can see their evolution towards egocentrism .
The world has opened its frontiers since airplanes , trains and bosts are accessible and less expensive then used to be .
people get to travel more , their nomad live bring them to dicover new places , new civilisations but not to get involve in a community .
They basicaly lock themselves up and do n't even see what is out there .
So helping the community they live in is not a priority .

There are a lot of political issues that are involved in the negligance or even distruction of communities , like povrety , immigration , taxes , unimployment , ...
All of these factors contribute in the young peoples ' actions .
To help our entourage , we first have to like it and feel appart of it .
And in most cities the most of the time people do n't like where they live , they ca n't afford better so they just do n't even care .

If we compare it to the last generation which lived all their lives in the same house , with the same neibours , they were more involved in the well being of their community .
They were helping people and loving ones .
But they felt they belonged there , they just got over a war and were just happy with what they had .

But as for today , wealth is a priority in life , education leeds us there .
We get an education to be buy things we do n't need but want .
And for that we tends to want more , an addiction like the saying says `` time is money '' .
And greed comes with carelessness .

Being appart of the young people , I get to be confronted every day with persons whom could'nt care less about people and communities .
But knowing that this kind of toughts are just selfish and worthless , I try to get out of this stereotypic generation and tend to be less self involved in what ever I do and where ever I go .
