I would rather think than traveling in group and led by a tour guide is the best way to miss what can be thrilling in discovering new countries or places around the world .
The reason for which people choose to travel this way hides what they usually feel as a great delusion at the end of their trip .
Experience of travel has to go through such kinds of delusions to discover its true identity .

First , one of the favorite reasons for people to prefer a guide is that they are afraid to `` miss '' anything .
Things ( museums , buildings , an so on ) `` have to '' be seen .
Such a way of thinking assumes that things which are vital need to be known from the largest part of people .
But what one ca n't miss is what chance helps him to discover .
Sreets or building we love in peculiar cities reflect our personnal relationship to these cities and that is more important than to remember vaguely buildings as if we only saw them in guide books .
What I do n't want to miss when I travel is the progressive link that I build with parts of a city wether they are in guide books or not .
That ca n't be planified .

Also , people feel more secure when they travel in group or when they follow an experimented guide .
Although this can be a strong reason in some parts of the world , I personnallly appreciate when a trip contains a bit of danger because danger is a significant part of the pleasure to travel .
When one wants to reduce danger to a minimum , excitation disappears at the same time .
Not to be the master of a situation is one the major reasons to travel and this goes from the foreign language to real dangers .

Last , to travel in group is often considered as more interesting because of the possibility to share an experience with other people and because of the diversity of points of view .
But is n't it another way to miss the only truly significant different point of view , that is the point of views of people from another country ?
I prefer to travel alone because it obliges me to meet people instead of staying inside of a familiar cultural environment .
Once one 's in a group , one ca n't escape the group .
