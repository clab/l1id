Old people and young people have not the same activities , hobies , and tastes .
In fact , your life is totally different from an age to an other .
Whill young people study older people have more responsabilities .
However when people are young they are not considerate as adults so they can do what ever they wish for : have fun with their friends , party a lot , not take of the house , not have duties ...
Altough , they have to work a lot to get a good future .
Young people chose in a way what they will be after .
If they study well , they can have a better job .
This is n't a great joy , your are in competition with all of yours friends , you might loose some friends for better grades .
So in oder to have fun after school they have to be determinate .
Nevertheless , after school when you get a nice job well paid you will still have to work hard all your life .
It 's not easy , it 's stressfull .
People can be alone , when you are at school you have the oportuninity to make a lot a friend because you come from the same area , the same town , you have the same interess whereas whem people get older they fell lonely , sometimes because they do n't like their jobs or it 's hard for them to be part of worklife .
Altought if you get money you can travel a lot or sometimes enjoy yourself with your family and friends , but these moments are very rare .
Whem peopleget older they have new responsabilities in life : children , house and job .
Finally , old people can have an enyoing life when they are retired .
In fact , they can do what they always wanted to do : travel , take of their grandechildren .

In my opinion , when you can have a certain balance between school and freetimes young people have more fun than older people .
Altough life is never easy : the age do n't depend on when you can be protected or prevented from bad things .
