Since the begining of respectable civilisations people taught their children and students to understand concepts and theory .
But when you ask a wise student what he thinks is better the theoretical or practical aspects of things , he will respond '' of course practical '' .let 's take for example a history book , the chapter of '' Alexander the great '' is filled wih historical facts , Things that did happen , not ideas that has no shape in a students mind .

People are attracted by the practical things since theory is too vapid for them .
Theory needs a lot of concentration without really matching the concept .
A person will be able to match and understand something once he tasted the thing .
As a student i did not understand the chapter of '' probability '' by the first time i needed a lot of revisions and practice and especilly practical practice .
I did use a coin for example to understand the difference between two probabilities .
How can a student understand maths and history without being confronted to pragmatic situations .
In order to convey this kind of information a teacher has to make us feel the concept of the experiment .

Can we say that Alexander the great had two daughters ?
of course not , because the thing is that Alexander did not have any children .
This is a fact and cannot be argued , because history and ethnology are facts and not nebulous ideas without shpe .

Let 's talk about arts and music , how can we say '' This is the fact '' These hobbies cannot be considered as undeniable because there is no answer for a question of art such as '' is it beautiful ? '' i could say yes and my brother no .
But if someone asks me '' did Julius Cesar have a son ? '' i wuld say just as my brother '' yes '' because in fact this response is undeniable .

In conclusion concepts differ from facts and students have to manage both of them in order to be succesful in the viewing of situations in life .
As i stated earlier their are no different answers for a fact but their are infinite ones for an idea that one may not sahre or take as granted .
The real use or '' fusion '' of an idea and a fact will appear once someone tries to be a philosopher and then try to resolve unresolvable problems that our ancestors thaught of before us
