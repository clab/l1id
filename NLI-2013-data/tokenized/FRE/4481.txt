Our world is filled with advertisements , they are on the walls , on the radio , on TV , on the internet , and even in artistic items such as movies or paintings .
Can we consider the adds as being tricky ?
To what extent are they giving false information on a product and does it depend of the product or of the look that the consummer have on the product ?
As far as I am comcerned I believe that addvertisements do n't lie as far as the consumer uses the product in good conditions .

I am not working in the adventising world to have such a point of view , but for people who know a little about laws , it is clear that advertisments cannot lie .
There is a legal phrase `` lying advertisement '' that would punish all advertisers who would give to their products false properties .
And that is the main point about a product that is in add as it is in real life .

But how can we explain that products that are said to be wonderful do n't plainly work when you buy it and use it at home ?
It is not because the product is ineficient but because it is n't used in the same conditions as those in the test lab .
Let 's take shampoo for instance , they are said to make smoothy and shining hair in adds .
But when you do buy it , it does not make the same .
Why ?
Because at the first use you do n't benefit of the active elements yet , and because your hair are weakened by pollution , stress , etc ...
that make them suffer .
The shampoo yet can make your hair as smooth and shining it is said in the advertisement .

The less point would be that our consumer 's eye is not the same as the designer one .
He will find his product perfect and he wo n't stop talking about the new things it brings to us .
This is the main difference that separates the inventor from the user .
We wo n't have the same regard on a car as the one of the ingeener who made it or the designer who drawnd it .
The advertiser shares this regard with them .
