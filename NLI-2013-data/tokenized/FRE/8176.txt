The issue of whether or not it is more important for students to understand concepts than to learn facts is a controversial one due to its influence on today student 's education .
On the one hand , learning without understanding is claimed to lead to make students only ` wise monkeys ' .
On the other hand , the current twenty or so generation is said to know far less than former generations and hence should largely learn class content by heart .
On my opinion , I agree with the statement above and consider that understanding is a prerequiste to learning .

The first argument in favor of my position is that understanding is a real reflexion while learning may be seen as a deshumanized task .
If school education has to build tomorrow brains , it seems important that they can understand what they have been taught .
The movie ` Rainman ' can be taken as an example : the story is about a very smart man , able to compute how many matches fall out of a box in seconds , but unable to communicate with the world surrounding him .
Students learning large amount of facts without being able to understand basic ideas could be seen as future experts jailed in a very narrow mindset .

Then , it has to be noted that Leibniz is said to have been the last man knowing every field of knowledge .
In the current century knowledge has become so vast that it seems hardly impossible to know everything in a specific field .
One life is often not long enough for a specialist to lead all the research he wanted to .
Hence , it makes more sense to make students able to think with concepts they understand than full of knowledge they do n't even know how to combine the different elements .

Eventually , creativity is essential to cope with an unknown situation .
While students knowing many facts could in a sense recreate learnt solutions , students having understanding concepts and ideas could be more apt to deal with the unknown and to fit an acceptable solution to the problem they cope with .

As a conclusion , I think that understanding is a prerequisite to an intelligent learning .
The former may not really be separated from the latter but I think that wise advises and concepts are much more useful for the mind than a huge amount of data .
