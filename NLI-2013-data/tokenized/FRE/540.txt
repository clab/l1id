The knowledges can be defined like the possibilities of everyone to speak on the biggest variety of subjects as possible .
So it depends of the childhood , the luck to go to school and more generally of your life .
For a student it is a good and a current question to know if he must do choose early a speciality or keep during a long time many differents lectures , What is the better choice ?

It is not be sure that the better choice exist .
Nevertheless to my mind the recent evolution permits to think that a broad knowledges is prefered .

The first example which accreditates the thesis of a broad knowledge is better is a farmer lost in a desert area whith his cows he must primary to know how to take care them .
It is easy to believe that he do not need to have broad knowledges in an another speciality , but it is a restrictiv wiew .
In fact if he wants that his business stays prosperous he needs to know read and write , it permits buy and sail some cows or oter animals .
It is a simple example but there is another more technic .

In the future the degree of exigence about knowledges will be increase so much .
In fact it is not possible to think that an chemistry engineer who work for an international big company which is carried oil and gas will not able to speak englisk very well .
However he spends much of his time to study essentially the chemistry in this diferrents forms .
The english have a secondary importance but it is essential for not say vital to find a job .

To conclude the best it is know lot of things in lot of specialities .
But it is not easy to be competent in all
