I agree with the fact that most of the advertisements that we see on television , on magazines , on the news papers and on the radio make the produts that they are trying to sell so much better than they really are .
First of all because they know exacly what would attract the men , the women , the teenagers and the kids .
They would adapte any product for the client by telling them what they want to hear .
It 's like a brain wash .
We are all in this century , in this buble were there are icones and things we do just because everyone does .
We just all follow .
The worst is when on the television or the magazines they use models for the publicity just to attract the most they can .
And as a matter of fact people actually fall in this completely , of course they will rather buy a orange top that they saw on a celebrety than a radom top bought in the supermarket .
It 's nothing we can do about this right now because we are in the middle of it , i 'm myself influence by the trends and everythings .
I admit it .
But there is a limite to this because soon or later we wont be thinking ourselves , the people that decides and rules all of the trends , publicity will controle us , will set up what we think is nice or good etc ...
Hopefully we are going to stop looking up at the advertisements and choose from ourselves within we like something or not and not to be influence .
I 'm not drastic about this i just get a bit mad when i start to think about all of that because the product with the best advertisment are much more expensive nad there is a lot of kids that ca n't follow up with the trends and that will anything to .
