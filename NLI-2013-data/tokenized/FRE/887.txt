In the modern society , with the general growth of population and knowledge , more and more jobs and fields of study are available .
Therefore , it has become a difficult task to choose a way of study .
Is that better to specialize on a particular academic subject or to keep a good overall knowledge in many subjects ?

As far as I am concerned , I would first disagree with the idea that having a broad knowledge is the best thing to do .
Indeed , specialists are nowadays more than necessary because we are always discovering new things and expending our knowledge .
Nobody can keep in touch with the latest discoveries in every domain .
For instance , one of my teachers is a searcher in a very specific field : model driven development in computer sciences .
Thanks to him and his colleagues , new features of programming have discovered and are now used by a lot of people .
Because this teacher has been fond of his speciality since his childhood , he has made and still makes some important work on this particular field of computer sciences .
Moreover , when he is teaching us , we can fell he his giving us the latest and most accurate knowledge available .
This helps us understanding and appreciating the subject .
Thus , it can be a good thing to specialize in a specific domain mainly when you like it .

On the other hand , it is important to say that it would n't be good if there were only specialists in our societies .
Actually , as I just said , it is more and more difficult to know a lot of things in many domains .
So specialists concentrate on a special branch of a domain .
Sometimes , they can even work on very specific topics like `` how do the electrons pass through the silicium in a transistor '' .
This kind of work has to be handled by people who are not really specialists but who know how the results of the research can be used .
These persons with a broad knowledge are also essential .
They are the only one who can coordinate the works and give them some utility .
They act as a manager in a company .

In conclusion , I would say that both academic curriculae ( broad or specific ) can be good .
At least , they are both useful in society .
In fact , the choice depends on the personality of the student and the possibilities in the university .
