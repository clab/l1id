The issue of knowing if young people enjoy life more than older people do is a interesting one .
On the one hand , young people are certainly healthier than the older .
But on the other hand , older people have a lot of free time to enjoy life .
However , my firm belief is that it is easily to enjoy life for the young people rather than for the older ones .

Firstly , we have to think of the matter of the health .
It is an undeniable fact that young people are in general healthier than the oldest .
For example , it is easily to do exercise when you are young .
Indeed , a lot of old people do have diseases which makes them not unable to do what they want .
Therefore , if you really like a sport , you will be more able to practice it when you are young .

Secondly , young people do not have a long experience of life .
On the whole , youth may be considered as the time of discoveries , and there are different discoveries .
Some young people may want to travel all around the world , for example .
Of course , it is a fact that generally , old people have more money than the youngest .
But actually , it does not matter !
When you are young , you may think that the comfort is not a prevalent point in a trip .
Whereas most of young people , old people may have difficulties to travel a lot , just because it is really exhausting .

Last but not least , young people may enjoy life more than older people just because they have less things to matter .
For example , a young people does not worry about his job , about what he has to pay or not each month .
A young person has not lived his life yet , and a lot of opportunities are openned to him , he can still decide what is life will be .

To conclude , I would like to say that young people do not often enjoy life more than the older , even if it may appear quite obvious .
There are also a lot of ways to enjoy life when you are old , because you often have more free-time , and you have much experience than the youngest .
You can see your children and your children ' children growing , and I think that is one of the beautifulest thing in the world .
