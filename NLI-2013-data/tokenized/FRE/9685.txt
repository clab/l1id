Nowadays , most of the people are looking for a very secure and non-stressful life whereas , in the same time , most of their dreams are made of success , money and interesting experiences .

This is paradoxal as the behavior which consists to not be afraid of taking risks and trying new things is a must have in order to reach such goals .
This statement can be supported by pointing out how innovative people create their own success yet also by analyzing the risk theory in a financial view and realizing that we need to look ahead and not behind to create our futur .

By paying attention to the current most succesful businessmen such as Bill Gates or the creators of Google , we can firstly learn that innovation is a major key of success .
In fact , a person who has no fear to try new things , to take risk or just to think about something different or bizarre for most of the people will be more able to create a new need for customer .
For instance , the compagny Sony in the 90s bet on producing walkmans , which are portable music maker , and by this new product created a new market without any competitors .
Such a great innovation sharply increased Sony 's benefits during several years .

If we talk about risk on a financial view , we will notice that , furthermore , according the risk theroy , for every investment there is a level of risk implied .
So , if a compagny wants to develop its profits , this one must undergo risks .
in other words , the riskier is an investment , the more lucrative it will be .
This financial theory , which deals about shares and bonds , can be extended to other field such as education , self improvment , sport etc .

All in all , im my opinion , we can pretend to be success
