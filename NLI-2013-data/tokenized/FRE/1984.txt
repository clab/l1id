In my opinion , i would agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more than other people do because they do n't have to do anything but diostract themselves , I assume very young people around four or five years old when school is still a pleasure and a kind of distraction .
While growing up their life will become more and more complicated .
Homework going along with school will take most of their time until they 'll be graduate of an university .
At this point most of any human as achieve twenty-five percents of his live and it has been painful .

Then they 'll start to work .
For some of them it will be fine and other will consider work as the worst experience they ever lived .
during that time they will be able to do everything they want whenever they want only if is not during the time they are supposed to work .
They will enjoy life but they will always remember their childhood as the good old times .
Then they 'll have children and they 'll have to work to provide them everything they need or want until they 'll leave the family house around eighteen years later .

Some years after the childs will be gone , it will be time for them to get retired .
And at this point they will enjoy life again even more than when they were young because they will be totally free .
Itm is the time when people learn to take their time and enjoy life .
Most of them will use the money they saved to travel around the world and see all they ever dreamt about .
And then after they had had all the fun they wanted .
It will be time for them to accept the fact that they cannot fight against getting older and they 'll die sooner or later .

I will finish with the point that on a ninety years long life , an human would have really enjoyed life around 25 years .
Yes I agree with the point made in the statement , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
