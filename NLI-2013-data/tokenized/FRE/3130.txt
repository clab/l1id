Most people would tend to consider that youth is the best part of life .
Unlike them , I think that the older days are often much more enjoyed than the `` golden age '' of youth , which always runs to fast .
As we become older , we learn to become more aware of our environment and our being so that we can tste bbetter the flavour of life .

The main advantage that older people have on younger ones is maturity .
With a proper education , one learns to see and enjoy things that young people would no even notice .
Most children do not understand why the elderly take so many time in their garden takin care of flowers which may not be there the following year .
When one gets mature , he or she also learn a lot about himself or herself , so that they know how to control their feelings and thus , they manage to earn more freedom as they handle their unconscious reactions .

The second reason why old people enjoy life more than younger people is that they run out of time .
Since they have became more mature , they are aware that their lives will not last long .
Not only is each day become more and more special with the passage and time , but they also know they cannot do everything they would like to in this limited time , so that older people may try to have as many of their dreams as possible come true .
As a matter of fact older people have nothing to lose anymore , so that they can do incredible things .

When getting older , people realise the vanity of their childhood 's illusions .
They can therefore focus on meaningful matters , compared to which a child 's dream may look as a waste of time .
Older people enjoy the real life , whereas children often enjoy illusions .
