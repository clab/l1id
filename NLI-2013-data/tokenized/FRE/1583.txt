According to me , i would say that both can have benefits according to the situation .
In the first part you will see the advantage of a broad knowledge and in the second part you will see how specialize in a specific subject could also be an advantage .

The knowledge is the knowing of many subjects , when you have a broad knowlegde you can discuss with anyone about anything .
And I think that it is a good point specially when you are in the workplace .
Imagine that you are specialized in business , and in your firm they don t need salers ( or other jobs in business ) anymore , according to this you wo n't be able to find other jobs in the same company , because you are only specialized in the business subject .
In this case , i think it is really essential to have a large knowledge .

Moreover , they understand it at school because more and more schools propose formations which include various subjects .
Thanks to this the student or the future worker will be able to face any situation at work or in his private life .

In our world today , i think that someone has to be able to discuss or to understand the main academic subjects such as : computer science , business and communication , because i think that they ca n't be understand by someone separetly .

But on the other hand , i would like to say that specialize in one specific subject could be an advantage .
Indeed , if you know well the subject you can be the best .
For instance , at work if you are the only one who knows a software you might be indispensable .
You can use this to get more money .
So i would say that sometimes it s worth knowing something very well than know a litle bit of a lot of thing .
