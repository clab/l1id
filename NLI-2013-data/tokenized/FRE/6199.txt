In the past fifty years , the number of cars has continuously exploded as the need to move away from where one lives has made itself clear .
Such a dynamic has lead to an exhaustion of the oil ressources that will be effective in a few years from now .

The continuous development of asian and african countries unvariably goes along with a grow in their number of cars , making their gas consumption ever increasing , while the western countries ' keeps still .
Such an increase will ultimatly lead to the depletion of the energy that has kept them running until now : oil .
That depletion will lead to the reduction and ultimately to the extinction of the cars as they now exist , being ran on gas .

A total disapperance of the means of transportation on long distances would lead to the destruction of the western economy system which is not tolerated by those countries .
The rarification of oil has already led scientists to seeking new energies .
These so called `` green energies '' have to be available on a very large scale , storable and usable to run a car , without having any long term effect on nature , and having to be as safe as possible .
For the moment , chimical batteries have shown their limits as to how long they allow a car to be used before reloading the battery .
The Hydrogen battery that is for the moment the best shot for engine propulsion is still not effective enough and to dangerous for the users in case of a car crash .

For the moment , no viable solution has been commercialised on the market , and there is no knowing whether or not the solution will be found in the years to come .
But what is for sure is that once the signs of the real disappearance of oil are clear to every country , every one will seek solution that can support their economy , for their economy allows them to live .
So in twenty years time , the number of cars will not be lower than today , but higher as new populations us them .
But they will not be ran with oil .
So indeed , there will be fewer cars ran with oil than there are today .
