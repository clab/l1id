In the world , all people come to some point were they must make a choice and take risks .
These risks can result in being good or bad .
If no one taks risks the society of today would n't be the same because the leaders who profoundly changed our society took risks .

In the novel Franfenstein from Mary Shelly , Victor took the risk not to create a compagnion for the monster because he thought that it would be better for humanity .
If he had created an other monster , they could reproduce and a new species of creatures would be born .
The creature , having supernatural strengh , is a threat to society , and by creating a mate for him , there would be a hole specie of dangerous monsters .

However during the Roman empire , the romans liked having slaves .
Some of them became servants but others were forced to be gladiators and satisfy the people 's need for laughter in violent combats .
One day in a gladiator training camp , one man took the risk to kill the trainor , his name was Spartacus .
All of the slaves in the camp fallowed him and they began defeating roman legions .
Slaves from all over the roman empire wanted to join them .
Spartacus took the risk to gain their freedom and not die in a gladiator ring .

In history , some risks were taken at a nations scale .
The French Revolution is the perfect example .
In 1789 , the people had had enough of being neglected by the churche and the noble classes .
One day the representatives of the lower classes , during a meeting with Louis XIV , the nobles and the churche , took the risk to oppose themselves to the other classes .
The king dismissed them from the meeting .
The people of Paris heard of this action and they started to revolte .
They captured the Bastille and took power over the government .
They started executing every one who was opposed to the new government even the king .
The red , white and blue french flag was put in place and France was a republic .

Even if in our every day lives , we are not confrounted with such situations , it is a good thing to take risks other wise the world and our personalities would n't change .
