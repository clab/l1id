People who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are usually considered as intelligent people .
Why ?
Most probably because they will be able to have and give an opinion on any kind of topics discussed in society .

In my opinion , the fact of aknowledging a variety of issues in different fields is the key to an effective and constructive open-mindedness .
This open-mindedness is constituted by the gathering of informations from different academic subjects studied and the synthesis one can makes with them .
As an example , I would feel more comfortable debating on a President 's policy if I took a class about the contemporary history of the country he is leading to understand how he got elected , a sociology class to understand who elected him and a political sciences class to analyse the way he communicates his ideas and wht conclusion I can draw based upon his behaviour .
By contrast , if I only studied one of these subjects , I probably wo n't be able to have a wide view over all the issues that a policy involves .

However , being specialized in a particular academic field will provide me with the ability to elaborate an expert answer , that is to say deliver an in depth analyse based upon a more specific knowledge .

I personally think it is essential to get specialized in some academic field .
Variety is good for general culture and open-midedness but specialization is more useful in the professional field .
Becoming an expert in one field provides you with more skills and proficiency in the subject studied .
This reason makes specialization be a better choice when it comes to the application for a job .
For example , if I want to be a lawyer , I need to have a law degree .
By contrast , if I want to be a business manager , I can get experienced in a company as an in house consel and still be qualified for that job .
