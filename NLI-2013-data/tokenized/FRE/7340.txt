I totally disagree with this opinion .
To me , the best way to travel is to visit a country alone , or in a reasonably small group of friends .
When I travel around , I want to discover the real nature of the countries I visit and I want to decide alone the things I want to see , and these things are not possible in a guided tour .

Guided tours are maybe an optimal solution for old people who are not totally independant , for people who are afraid of the fence that foreign languages can create , or for people who do n't want to spend much time abroad .
But this option is definetely not an option for me .

Guided tours sell you organised , prepared , `` pre-chewed '' travels .
They make you run from one hotel to a point of interest , from one restaurant to a pseudo `` traditional '' show .
You can visit France in 2 days , Europe in a week , and have a picture of you in front of all the musts you `` have to see '' .
I want to have time to feel the atmosphere of a country I visit .
I want to explore the hidden regions , to go out of the the beaten tracks .

When you travel in a group , it is impossible to meet local people .
You stay with your conspecifics because it is easier , certainly more confortable .
Traveling alone force you to exchange with the local population , to speak the local language , to share the local culture .
And to me , this is the most interesting part of the travel .

Guides in a guided tou are generally professionnal multilingual guides who are hired by the travel agency .
They come from the same country and have only a specific knowledge of the country you visit .
Best guides are local people who can present you the really traditional aspects of their regions .
