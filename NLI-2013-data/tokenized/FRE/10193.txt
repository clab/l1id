Firsteval , it is important to remind that , usualy , successfull people are people with habilities and knowledges in specific fields .
Usualy , the success does n't come alone .
You succeeded because you have dared things , which means generally that you took risks .
Successful people usualy get money from their success , and we could think this is crazy to take other risks because you may loose the money you won .
To my mind successful people are people who like risks , and who are better under pressure .
As an example i will talk about my girlfriend 's granfather .
He is a decorator and he lost all his money and everything he made up several years ago .
But while some people would n't know what to do , he restarted everything from the beginning , to find success again and that 's what he did .
I think most of successful people are very self confident people , and that 's why they 're stronger than the others , because if they fall , they can also rebuild what has been destroyed .

Otherwise , trying new things and taking risks while you succeeded may appear as really crazy .
Would n't it be better to take advantage of what you won , instead of risking to lose it ?

I think the best to do , when you are a successful people , is to try new things but taking the less risks as possible ; indeed , even if you are successful one time , may be next time you wo n't and you will loose everything .

But in the opposite , if you do n't take risks in your life , you may never successful or at least , you may spend a very boring life .
That 's why a certain dose of risk has to be taken , even if you are successful .
Trying new things opens up your mind , whereas going on to do only what you know how to do well does n't .
