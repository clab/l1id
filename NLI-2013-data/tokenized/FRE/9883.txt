Success can be seen as the result of one 's capacity to try new things and take risks .
On the other hand , people who avoid changing and stick to what they now best are not candidates for success .

We will begin by pointing the advantages and disadvantages of these statement .
Changes can be a good thing .
For exemple , someone can decide to quit a unsatisfactory job for another one , one that is closest to its goals in life .
He can decide to become a painter instead of a accountant .
But by doing so , the person can find other difficulties and realize that it is not much better .

So changes can not assure success .
On the other hand , someone who stay at the same place all his life can miss opportunities that are giving to him .
He can have regrets later .
But in all , success can not be based only on whether a person takes risks or not .
It must be based on something deeper .
If success is being rich or famous , then of course one has to risk a lot .
But if success is defined as doing what is right , doing one 's duty , being honest and so on , then changes are not so important .
In other words , changes become submitted to doing what is right .
If it is right to remain an accountant in order to support a family and give others chances , then that is successful .

If changing means only to gain something for oneself without thinking of the others , then that is not success .
