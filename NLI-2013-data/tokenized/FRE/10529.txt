Some people says the successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks .
On the one hand , that is true .
On the other hand , successful people are also people who only do what they do the best .
My point of view on that point is successful people are people who do both of these things .

First , a lot of successful people are people who tried new things and concepts and also took risks .
The best illustration I can take on that point is Steve Job , CEO of Apple .
His company was specialized in computer science .
However , he decided to take the risk of a new market : the MP3 Player market .
Now , he succeedeed in imposing his Ipod as the reference in the market .
Almost everybody knows what is an Ipod and wants to have one .
The new marketing strategy he used is also an aspect of his success .
With a good concept , new ideas , and a great part of risk , people arrived to succeed but unfortunately this is not always the case .

Second , people also succeed by doing only what they know to do well .
Some persons are very good in their specializations .
They are even so good that they could not be replaced in a company and then access to leader roles .
For instance , my father was a business engineer .
He was so good in what he did that he was promoted every year until reaching the role of director of the sales .
He did not have new concepts and he did not take risks too but he succeeded very well in doing what he knew to the best and I consider him as a sucessful people .

Third , my point of view on the subject is the following : successful people are often people who try new things and take risks in what they do well .
I am convinced that if one is specialized in a domain and try new concepts in that domain he has more chances to success .
For example , the person who created ebay is a very relevant illustration .
He was a computer science engineer and want to make a website for the exchange of stamps .
That website became a true success and nowadays every kind of things are exchanged on ebay .
If he had opened a shop , I am not sure he would have obtained so much success in his company .

To conclude , I do not totally agree with the statement .
Some people obtained success in trying new things and taking risks but others also reach success by doing only what they do the best .
