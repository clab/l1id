I remember an TV-ad about some kind of perfume which , once applied on your body , could bring you all the beautiful girls or boys that you may have dreamed of .
I bought it and I can assure you that it does not work !
Maybe I was abused by the advertising but for sure , but in my view the advertisement tends to overstate the main features of a product , and I will give the main reasons for that .

First , the main goal of an advertisement - and it is also the aim of marketing - is to promote a good or a service in order to increase its sales .
As a consequence , the presentation of the product could not be fair in a sense .
Indeed , I am quite certain that if a TV-ad shows the weakness of a good or service , in order to be partial , this good or service would be as appealing as the same presented by an ad which shows only the good aspects of it .

Second , advertisement tends to reach the imaginary part of our person to increase the attractiveness of products .
By doing so , consumers are dreaming about such products and idolize them .
For instance , you may have the strong desire to buy a luxury car because you have seen it on the TV and it was shown in an ideal place .
Or you want to book your holidays in a pleasant place because you find the photographs you have seen very beautiful .
But in fact the real situation could be , at least , normal .

As a conclusion , I do think that the advertisement does not provide a fair image of the products it supports .
But it is worthwhile to mention that it depends on our own mind to distinguish between what it is true or not .
