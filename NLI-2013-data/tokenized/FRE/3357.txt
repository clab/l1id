In my environment I can find a lot of examples of young poeple helping their communities .
Examples like scout organizations or similar ones show clearly that youg people nowaday give enough time to helping other people .
That is why I do not agree with the statement .

First and foremost , think of all this organisations like scouts or christian yough movements .
In each country you can find this kind of organisations .
They all have the same goals .
They want to make young people more involved in the community and more over , teach them how to become a responsible adult .
In my country this kind of groups are very popular and they have a lot of activ members .
I also used to be a member of such an organisation .
That is why I can say that they do a lot for their communities .
For example , they help parents to guard their children if they do n't have enough time , they collect money for caritative organistations .
All members of such a group give surely a lot of time to help their community .

By the same token , I would like to say that you can also find young poeple involved in individual actions .
Let 's take for an example young people who go shoping for older poeple .
They also help immediatly their surrounding .
Other go to help older citisens in cleaning their house , or doing their garden work .
All this are nice examples of young person giving time to help their communities .

Of course you will always find some young , respectless , and egoistic young poeple who just want to make profit and to enjoy life .
But this is nothing new .
This kind of poeple have always exicted and of course exist also nowadays .
But they are not the majority .
Not where I live .

To sum up briefly , I really do n't think young poeple do n't care about their communities and do n't give enough time to helping them .
I really think it is like it always used to be , some poeple care and other do n't , but the majority is involved in social life and give enough time to helping their communities .
