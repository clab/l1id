Do i think that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ?
As far as i am concerned , regarding my job ( i work as lawyer in a financial law firm in Paris ) , i think that i have a pretty good understanding of that question .
In my essay i am going to give you and to explain my opinion .
In order to support this opinion , i will try to illustrate my point of view by personnal experiences at work .

The first point i would like to make is that , regarding my own experience , when you work in a law firm you can find the two opposites .
Some lawyers are the best in their speciality and do not want to practice in another department of law such as tax law , business law ...
and some others prefer to discover another type of law .

Though , they are strong advantages and disadvantages in both , i think that it is always more interesting to perform in different ways .
For this reason , regarding my personnality , i am rather in agreement with the subject statement .
If you want to progress , in your work or in your life , you often have to test something new , even if it is more risky .
Moreover , when you make a mistake you have to draw conclusions , and therefore your experiences can be use for positive things .

To conclude , if i step back , i realise that , in my job , i am always regarding the risk .
On one hand i have to make sure that my client does not run the slightest risk , but on the other hand i always have to test new things in order to be more attractive .
Nonetheless , like i told you in my essay i have rather a personnality that conduct me to try new things .
I do really think that , if it is not toorisky and if we do not expose somebody else to a risk , to experience life is also taking many risks .
