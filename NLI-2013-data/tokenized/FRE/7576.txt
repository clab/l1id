Some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
This solution presents the advantage of not having to worry about the organization of the trip .
Although this way of travelling is easy , I personnaly prefer to avoid the touristic routes and adapt my schedule to my own interests and mood , rather than be part of a guided tour .

Travelling in some countries , where languages and cultures are real boundaries ( Japan , China , ... )
can be really challenging .
Guided tours in these cases facilitate greatly the process of organizing a journey to such areas of the world .
Guided tour also generally focus on the most remarkable locations and attractions that `` must '' be seen .
They sometimes provide a valuable insight on the local culture and past .
In some cases , a guide is even absolutely required to venture in parts of the world such as deserts .

However , guided tours tend to always target the most touristic sites .
In countries like Vietnam or China , guided tours have created real touristic routes .
I believe that following these paths do not provide a good idea of how the country works , how the people live , etc ...
some highly visited places also are of less interest than what advertised by the gided tours , which result in loosing precious time .

When I travel , I therefore prefer to have the freedom to visit less touristic places , modify my schedule as I wish and meet with the local people .
Even if I do n't speak their language , I think that communication is always possible .
A few years ago , I spent two months in India .
I had the chance to live for four weeks in a small village in South Inda 's countryside .
I felt that sharing the life of the village inhabitants helped me to understand the complexity and harshness of life in this part of the world .
During the following three weeks , I traveled all around South Inda and I found myself much more receptive to the Indian specificity and customs .
This unique experience would not have been possible if I had travelled in a group led by a tour guide .

As a conclusion , I would say that when a guide in not absolutely needed , guided tours are not the best way to travel .
Travelling in a group sometimes results in missing little or extraordinary things that tells a great deal about a country .
