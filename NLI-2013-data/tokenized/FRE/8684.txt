Comprehension is very important so has learning facts .
We learn things every day but do we all understand them ?

If you can easily rememeber facts then it 's great but once you know them will you be able to really understand them ?
I am not so sure .
If someone knows by heart the whole history of a country but cannot make connections between facts then It did n't really helped him to know the information .
If he understands it then he could possibly imagine what will happen or at least make a change .

Of course he can tell the story to everyone but if someone asks him why it happend he will not be able to answer because he himself did n't understand it .

On the contrary , if the person understands the concepts and ideas of the fact but ca n't rememeber it exactly , then I think it 's not so bad .
Nobody can rememeber everything , that 's part of the human being .

This person can always search for information .
These days , you can easily look at the thing you are interessted in on the Internet or with the help of books .
Once he will have the information it will easy for him to make connections with other things .
He will also be capable to explain it to other people .
If they do n't understand it the way he explains it then he will find an other way of saying it .
Since he understood the concept it will be much easier for him then for the person who learned everything by heart but did n't understand it .

In conclusion , I think it is more important to understand ideas and concepts then to know exactly everything point by point without knowing what it really means and what he can do with this information .
