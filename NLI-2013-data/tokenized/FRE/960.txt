As i 'm doing engineering studies , the question of take my courses on one specific subject or on many various themas occured to me several times .
My choices follow the way of a broad knowledge , excepted the last year : I prefer to specialize myself in only one subject during one year .
So why ?
The first reason is that studies in diverse academic subjects give you a large view of how take a problem when it occurs .
You can have many ways to develop a solution which could respond to your problem .
If you studied only one subject , your mind is focused on one method which could finish in a dead end .
For example in microelectronics , a friend of mine proposed a solution using his knowledges in mechanics !

Another reason for learn about diverse themas could be to understand the world we are living in .
History , geography , economy , physics , mathematics , and languages are essential to see follow our changing environment every days , not only at home , but also when we 're working .
For instance , social sciences could help you to understand why your boss is in a bad mood today , and maybe learn you not to ask him some things which could be desastrous ...

My last argument for broad knowledge would be your abilities you can have to change of job , or decrease your time of adaptation when you enter a new firm .
Nevertheless , the specialization is - I think - also very important .
It will be the first thing a manager will notice when you will present him your resume , when you apply for your first job .

Moreover it is interesting when you study to keep time to make a deep analysis on subjects you prefer .
It will be give you the qualification of expert on the matter .

Eventually , as i want to have some managerial responsabilities , i choose to diversify my studies .
