In our modern societies , we more frequently come across zoung people laughing and entertaining than older people .
Does it really convey the idea that young people enjoy life more than people do ?
I believe that with maturity comes experience and a tremendous knowledge which helps individuals navigate their life more easily and have more time for fun and entertainment .
We will see how the periods of life , the personality of each of us and our aims drive our enjoyment of life .

It is a matter of fact that different periods of life offer different opportunities for enjoyment .
A younger person will believe he has his whole life in front of him .
Naturally he will feel less concerned about his future and long-term objectives .
Usually younger persons have a better health and feel invicible like if they would never die .
Taking all these concerns away is probalbly the reason why people who just came of age give the impression of enjoying very much their life .
Going through studies , youngers are for the first time facing their first fundamental questions : what do they want to do in their life ?
Older people have already gone through these fundamental questions and have their life accomplished , giving them more opportunities to relax and enjoy life .

Of course , given the fact that each of us is unique , we indeed have different personalities .
Personally I am an anxious person who always think about my future and the next steps in my life .
For this reason I sometime have the impression to enjoy less my life when I should like many other have a more cursory attitude towards life .
Older people when they reach the third age are concerned about how people will remember them and what they have accomplished in their life .

Although we all experience stress and difficulties at different period of our life , it is important to see the positive aspects of life and benefit from the experience we build throuhout our life .
Therefore I believe there is no specific age for enjoying more life .
What is important is to keep an open and positive attitude whatever difficulty we go through .
