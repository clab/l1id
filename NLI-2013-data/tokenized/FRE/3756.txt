I agree with that , but it ' is not our fault , in our time , we have to work harder than our parent , for many reason wich I will try to show you

the studies are longer and more difficulte than yesterday , we are spending more time to school and to look for a job because these times we have to be qualified if you want to succeed in life more diploma you will have got , more change you will have to find a good job wich will allow you a confortable life .

there are also the problemes that our youth do not like to live in the villages anymore due to lack of work they prefer to live in town where life has got another view of community .

Like in south africa , everybody knows the story of this country which has long time been divided by the skin color , the majority of black people do not trust anymore in the value of community
