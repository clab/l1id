During the last century , the number of cars in use has been growing fasterand faster everyday in the developped and rich countries .
The easy access to the petroleum , its low price and the development of the economical powerful of the people are the principal reasons of this enormous expansion .

Today different problems make people think that there could be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
The most important is the lack of petroleum .
We 've been drilling petroleum for many years without considering that it 's not an infinite ressource .
These last years the scientists have revealed that petroleum sould be missing soon .
The direct consequence is the increase of the price that we 've seen these last years .
It4s clear that we need to find another source of energy to replace the petroleum The gaz seems to be the best one for the moment , but even if we can already buy some cars using gaz it seems that people are not ready for that .
They keep buying some cars using petroleum .
Electric cars are not really popular as they 're not powerfull .

The other important point that could make the number of cars in use decrease in the next years is the environmental problem .
This is one of the biggest problem for the different governments around the world .
Environment is one of the most current subjects on TV since a little bit less than ten years .
It 's been proved that the high numbers of cars in the big cities like London , Paris or Madrid is one of the reason why the pollution is so elevated .
Some people think that the governments could limit the number of cars that a family could buy in the economically developped countries , as they already try to limit the use of the cars in the mains cities during the summer period .

What I think personnally is that , despite the development of the different public transportations ( like the tramway in Paris ) , the people here are not ready for this .
I think that they 'll try to adapt themself to the use of new energy but wo n't buy less cars .
I4ve seen a very interesting report about the recent discover of the biggest gaz reserve in the world in Siberia .
It was saying that this only one could give enough energy to the entire Europe for the next twenty years .
I really that it can work as the gaz does n't make as much pollution as the petroleum does .
And I believe that during these twenty years , we 'll find another type of ressource .
So my opinion is that there wo n't be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
