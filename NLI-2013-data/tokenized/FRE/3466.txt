About fifty years ago , one the greatest President of the United States pointed out the main problem of modern societies .
John F. Kennedy said , do not ask what the country can do for you , ask what you can do for the country .
We live in a society that promotes individualism .
Individualism can be definied as way of projecting problems only through you own scope and to pay less attention at your environment .

I think individualism is more and more developped and people tend to give less time to their community .
This subject is the great battle between the Ancient and the Modern .
According to the Modern , people are more and more focused on their personal environment , that is to say their family , friends , work environment and themselves .

In our modern society , this phenomenon reaches young people even more that parents and grandparents .
They used to be raised with a very high sense of values , focused on work and religion .
Even if each family , according to its history , need , wealth , had its own priorities , these were the main values .
And there was a sense of commun work and commun need .

Young people who live in modern societies tend to be more focused on themselves and to be more selfish .
In developped countries , they do not fear hunger , thirst , problems of wealth .
I think that most of them are self centered .
We must believe that this kind of attitude will change and that young people with give more time to help their communities .
On the one hand , there is always the role of religions .
They can be used to make people understand the importance of giving , sharing and receiving .
On the other hand , we can hope that intellectuals and politicians will raise these question in the future .
Not only is the idea of helping the community relevant , but it is also more and more important in a time of great incertainty .
