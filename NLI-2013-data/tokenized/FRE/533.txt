According to me it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I defend this point of view for the following reasons .

First of all I think that a broad general culture , in many academic subjects , is extremely important in the same time for professionnal reasons and social reasons .
This broad general culture make people able to adapt themselves to a much more important number of life situations than people who specialize in one specific subject .
For example what could do and become a person who only have good qualifications in a single job and that this job become old fashioned ...
nothing ...
this person will not be able to adapt itself to his new reality ...

Secondly I think that the mission of school and even of university is to allow people to make a choice about their future , and I think that this choice has to beclear and well based , so that I believe that only a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make people-s choice clear ans well based .
For example , if you only taught scientific subjects to children , how could a certain number of them discover litterature and discover that they are gifted for wrting ...
it would be impossible ...

That is why I think that before learning a job , young people have to discover as many as academic subjects they can to make the good choice .

The third reason why I think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a counter exemple ...
People who believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject will always say that it is easier , after graduation , to find a job with a specialization .
but I would that this specialization is , in the reality , never a real specialization and that a lot of practise is still needed after graduation to become a real specialist ...
So in fact specialization in college and even in university is not a real one ...

That is why I am deeply convinced that to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is much better than to specialize in one specific subject .
