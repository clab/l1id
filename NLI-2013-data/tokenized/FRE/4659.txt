I do think that most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .

In my opinion , advertisements have reached such an important and omnipresent place in our everydaylife that they should never lie about a product .
All is studied to make it attractive , brillant , colourful , nothing is left as a coincidence but I reckon it is overpowerful .

It occured many several times that the product was truly disappointing comparing to the advertisement .
Of course , it depends on what is the matter but very often I came to try new products that were not as `` fabulous '' as they were supposed to be .

I spent some money on various things , from CDs to a DVD player , beauty products for my sister or very diverse things , which happened to be smaller than it was said to be , less efficient or to break very easily .

My brother , who is keen on new technologies also tells me how unfaithful an advert can be .
The quality is below what he expected or the use of the MP3 player , for example , is not as varieted as it was written on the box .

Apart from the high technology , I would tend to say that advertisement does not lie so much about food products .
Is it because it is part of everyday life or more frequent to buy it ?
We can buy a television once within a couple of years , be upset by the product considering we have been interested in it through its advert in priority , it is different from the food advertisements , or the items we regularly need to buy .
Actually , if it does not satisfy us , consequently we will buy another brand .

Obviously it is important to say that it does not happen all the time , with everything , but well , I think that advertisement should not ` pretend ' so much thrilling qualities over a product .
However I understand it is part of the commercial system , the advert has to focus on the pros of the concerned thing and the greatest it will appear , the higher the sells will be .
