Today , cars are an important object of our life , it has become one of the bases of our life and a great means of transportation .
It is also a symbol of freedom and independance for both young and older people .
But with the progressive disparition of crude oil , we could wonder how it will be in 20 years .
To answer this question , I will see in a first part that there are no signs showing a decrease of cars in use and in a second part that there will even be an increase of cars in use but different cars .

Fisrt of all , I do n't think that there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years , I mean 20 years , it is nearly tomorrow ; the situation cannot change so fast .
Nowaday , we are in a mass consumption society , which consommates a lot of all materials objects and especially cars .
A statistic have be done and shows that cars are not a familiiy object anymore but are now an individual good , so it proves the increase of cars bought .
Moreover , in 20 years there wo n't be other means of transportation as developped as the car is nowaday .
there will be new cars but still at their bgin .
Today the scientistic research cannot propose a means of replacement to the car .

At the contrary , I think that the number of cars in use will still increase for some decades , but it wo n't be the same cars that we have today .
Everybody knows that there are less and less oil in the reserves , that pits are going to be empty in some decades and that the price of crude oil is always and steadily increasing .
But all this facts do n't mean the end , the death of cars .
It only shows that we need new sources of energies and new ressources , such as water , sun , vegetal elements .
We are only mooving to a new type of car , a new age .
Today , there are already test which are made for new cars but it is not developped enougn to be sell and use .
There are some prototypes of cars using water as energies but it is still a begin .

To sum up , I do n't agree with this statememt ; at the contrary , I think that there will be more cars in 20 years that there are today .
There will certainly be less cars using crude oil but more and more cars using new energies
