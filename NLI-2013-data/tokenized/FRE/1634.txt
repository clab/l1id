Broad knowledge of many academic subjects is interesting in order to get a general view on subjects .
One is then able to get involved in different matters .
The more general view you will have have , the more you will be able to understand other people isssues and what they are concerned of .

But by having a view on many subject , you will not be able to masterise them .
Specializing in one specific subject will allow you to emphasis the subject and develop high quality skills .

It then depends what you research .
If you know exactly what you want to be doing or that you work on high technicity subjects you will then need to get specialised .
If you want to keep an evolution possibility in the subjects you are studying or if you absolutly need a global view on your topic you will then need to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

From my point of view , it is necessary to develop a high level of skills .
It is to say specialise even if you have to choose between subjects that seem all interesting and challenging .
Studying geography , maths , physics , litterature or history will require a high level of knowledge and investment that will not allow you to get on several subject .

Ideally , on a five year academic course , a possible option would be to perform a double study class .
At the end you will then be specialized in two complementary subjects such as science and management , geography and economics , business and information technology .
