Many people say that a student 's main job is to learn facts-sometimes by heart .
It is true that if a student does not learn his lesson he wo n't be able to understand his next class or get a good grade on his test .
But is learning everything ?
Is it enough to fully succeed as a student .
Can a math-student pass his exams only by learning his theoremes , definitions and demonstrations ?

Learning is the basis for a student .
One time , I had so much work to do and papers to hand out that I did not learn my lesson for the next class .
And I was lost the next period !
This experience enabled me to realize how concentrated you are and how well you understand the next class when you learn facts .
When you learn something you make an effort and then ask yourself questions about a fact if you ca n't fully understand it .
But some people learn their lessons in a mechanical way and I disagree with this type of organization .

When students learn by heart only their short-term memory is working which means they only remember things for a short time-period .
When I learn my maths-definitions I repeat them to myself but try to understand them .
This theory works because I have observed that when I do n't fully understand a definition I do not remember it in the long term .
When you understand or try to understand a lesson you ask yourself questions about the topic which makes you want to know more and helps you develop extra-skills .
Students who want to understand ideas and concepts ca n't be inaccurate in their work and develop organization and clarity skills .

In conclusion we are faced with the fact that both learning and understanding are useful methods for a students .
To be totally efficient a student has to learn and understand .
