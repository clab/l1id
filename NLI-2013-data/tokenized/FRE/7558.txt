I very strongly disagree with the claim that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Such a position relies on a few logical arguments , but also on the results of a personal experience , both of which I shall now try to highlight : First of all , any effective decision coming from a group has to be the result of a very long , slow and fastidious process of argumentation .
Also the decisions , once made , are known to level the number of exciting things to do , museums to visit , to a strict minimum .

Even if the presence of a guide would undoubtebly temper the problem of an effective decision as the result of a collective process , it would only do so by raising another kind of problem , quite more preoccupying really : tour guides are not always reliable , and actually often turn out to be quite deceptive if not fully mendacious .

True , to the extent that it allows the traveler not to worry about any plan or any decision to make , to rely on a tour guide can be an agreable way to enjoy a holiday .
Also to travel in a group can provide a sense of psychological comfort , by knowing that one will never be on her or his own .

In the end , it seems that the personality of the traveler plays a huge part in the answer to that claim .
In my opinion , the best way to travel is unquestionably on one 's own .
No tour guide , no group , just a backpack and a city map .
As paradoxical as it may sound , I have always experienced it to be the best way never to be alone .
