Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
On one hand I agree with this idea but on yhe other hand I think it is not true .

Of course young people have usually no responsabilities and serious problems to be sad .
They play games and they live without thinking to their future .
Young people are very innocent and they ignore all the tragical events of the life .
This time is the best period for dreams , and young people think that they have all their life to do what they want .

When we become older , we loose this part of dream which caracterizes young people .
Death and illusions have destroyed our part of innocence .
But I can barely believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Happyness depends on lots of factors .
Even if old people have already lived a big part of their life , I think this experience is the best way to appreciate the events .
I mean that happyness depends on the value we give to an event .
Old people usually know what is the most important in the life .
There is a kind of wisedom which helps old people to be happy and to enjoy life .

Moreover many young people have a lot of problems .
They are not protected against the events of the life like illness .
So I think that those two periods offer different way to enjoy life .
We do n't enjoy the same things on the same age .
Each life 's period is like a season which gives a lot of fruits .
I think the real difficulty is to pick up the fruits ...
