I disagree with people who think that , nowadays , young people do not give enough time helping their community .

First of all , I think it is very difficult to compare a society at different times .
It is often heard that that young people were more respectuous and more polite in the past , but which past ?
During the last century , the society in developped counries changed radically , hence it is very difficult to compare young people now and in the begining of twentyth cenury .
For example , in the Middle-Age , there were a lot of wars and young people had to help their communities fighting against people .
But now , it is does not exist really .
So the evolution of our socities make the comparison impossible .

Then , I think we can see every day young people who try to help other people of the community .
We can see very often young people leaving their seat in a bus to a old person or a pregnant woman .
That is , obviously , something very basic , but this kind of daily behaviour is very important because it makes people feeling well and in safety .

Moreover , I think young people today have to study longer than in the past .
They have many classes , every day , except for the week end of course , and consequently they are more and more busy .
Our societies , and consequenlty our communties say to young people to do some sports , to go to the cinema or to the nightclubs , for example .
It causes that young people have less and less time to do something .
I also think that there is a kind of new definition of community for young people : for them this word represents people around them directly , and , for example , many students prefer to have activities in the different associations of their university rather than to do something for the council for example .
But it does not mean they do not give time to helping their community

As a conclusion , it is obvious that , for me , young people spend a lot of time to help the community , even though this time is not this one expected
