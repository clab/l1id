In our modern societies , individualism keeps growing .
Because of this fact , the communities need more and more help .
But nowadays , the generation of video games seems more preoccupied by itself than by their commuunities .
Does it mean than young people do not help their communities anymore ?
In a first part , we will discuss the growing individualism , and in the first part , we will see how young people help their communities .

To begin with , we live in societies led by capitalism .
This system encourages the personal achievement , through the American model of the self-made man .
Everyone has to fight for himself to realize his dreams , while at the same time , old or handicaped people , or even the family are alone , or in a bad situation .
So , should young people sacrified time they would have put into their career to help these communities or not ?

However , our societies are also the societies of all the associations .
In the last decades , many associations are born , living to help the communities .
And it is often young people that work in them .
For instance , the Association Habitat et Humanisme that help people to find a house by gathering funds is mainly composed by young people .
Furthermore , more and more Schools and universities develop associations that help people .
Helping communities has become a common fact for students .
I also think that giving time to helping communities becomes more and more a strong argument in front of a manager , when a young people is looking for a job .

To conclude , I would say that I clearly disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping communities .
In the contrary , I think they give more and more time for them .
