I used to think that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects gives people a widen point of view _that is to say a better one , as I thought_ on contemporary issues but I 've changed my mind .
In fact , I realised for many reasons that having this broad knowledge is unuseful to tackle real issues .

To tackle an issue , you do have to have a broad knowledge , but a broad specific knowledge on this subject .
You indeed need to have a very precise and accurate knowledge on this issue to understand the other issues it raises and to point out the consequences .

This specific knowledge is in fact necessary to provide a serious work , to challenge the society and the governement for instance and to give solutions .
Research in economic policies is a good example : it needs a very accurate knowledge in economics to tackle real issues such as unemployement and to try to find solution to improve the situation .

But we have to notice that this needs an interest in other academic subjects and other issues in order to be aware of the complexity of such an issue and of its consequences .
Let 's talk about unemployement , the economist has to be aware of social consequences of unemployement because it is necesary to give good solutions and improve the situation .

To conclude , I want to underline the importance of a multi-academic subjects learning during the studies before specialisation , because the two of them are complementare .
