Young and elder people have different ways of enjoying life .
In fact , some enterainment are specific to your age .
For instance , sports well illustrates that difference between generations .
So , with respects to those differences , do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
According to me , young people enjoy life more tha older people do .

First , I think that contrary to older people , young people do not have any physical limit .
They can enjoy life in any conditions , compare with older people , young people do not have any limitations considering their activity .
They can play any sport , they can run .
When you are young , your body is still a place to discover and to grow playing sport or doing any physical activity .
On the contrary , for many older persons , any activity needs a long preparation , for instance shopping or even just walking .
So I think that in those conditions , young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Second , when you are young , you know nothing , you are curious .
It means that during your youthness , life is an extraordinary place to discover through relationships , knowledges , travels , cultures , etc .
Everything is new for you : people , love countries , language .
Though , when you are young , you cannot be messed up .
Each experience is a new one .
On the contrary , I think that when you are older , life is hardly a daily surprise and , by the way , easily becomes a routine .
It s harder to meet new people , traveling becomes difficult .

So , that is to say , that young people have to take advantage of their youthness .
According to me , we are young only once in our entire life that is why young people do have to enjoy their life more than older people have alrea
