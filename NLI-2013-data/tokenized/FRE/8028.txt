I disagree with this statement .
I think it is much more important to learn facts that actually illustrate an idea , than to understand concepts and ideas .
Indeed , the latter are abstracts and thus , more difficult to memorize .
On the other hand , a fact talk from itself .
Once

For example , in marketing we are taught a lot of theories which are said to make a product more attractive , or to make a firm more succesfull ; we have to learn these theories by heart which is difficult for a lot of students , as they do n't have the opportunity to actually test this idea .
Fatcs would actually help them to understand each and every step of the theory , and understand why there has to be a theory by practicing .

This way of learning is what students of work-study programs experienced .
They are taugh a lot of examples about the theory they are about to learn , and they have to practice what they are learning , and to learn what they practice .

For instance , they will spend two weeks at shool , during which they will analyse several examples on a selected topic , and learn the theory .
The next step will be two weeks at workduring which they will have the chance to try , experience , and test what they have been taught .
And this process happens every month .

This method makes it more easier for the students because they have the opportunity to put their knowledge in practice .
And if they do n't understand a point during class , they will have the opportunity to get to understand it during their practice weeks , and to ask proffessionals about the question .

Learning facts should be the first step in the learning-process , followed by the theory step , and then , by the put-in-practice step .
