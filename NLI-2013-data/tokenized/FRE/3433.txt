A community needs the help of every members to be a nice and pleasant place to live in .
Young people have to participate like any other members , have to give the same time like anyone else .
I think that they do that but maybe they do not do the same thing as an adult and maybe adults do not see what they do .

Young people do things they like to do .
That can be a problem because , as young people , they accept less easily things to do than an adult who now that he does it for the well being of the community .
Youg people like to do things they like .
The problem is that adults often think that what young people are doing is less important than what they are doing .
so for example , when there is a party to oragnise in the community , young people will be happy to organise it , but as it it less serious than something than adults can do , it is not considered like it has to be considered .

Young people have not the same vision of a community like adults .
Times are changing and adult-s idea of a community is not the same as a young people-s idea of a community .
Young people can show their love for their community by writing a song about it , or bye painting grafitiy on walls about it , so that is is pratical help like adults do , but in the mind of zoung people it is a kind of engagment for this community .

So I think that youg people do things and give enough time for their community but in a different way than adults , but I do not think that what the adults do are more important than what young people do .
