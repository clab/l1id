Nowadays , in Europe and North America , almost each family owns at least one car .
However , a few current issues raise the question of the number of cars there will be in the next twenty years .
In my opinion , there will be more car in use in twenty years than today .

First of all , it is obvious that the world 's population keeps increasing , which means that more people are going to need a car within the next two sdecade .
Moreover , in important demographic regions such as China or India , more and more inhabitants buy a car .

What 's more , one reason for which there could be fewer cars in use in twenty years would be the lack of oil .
Nonetheless , according to scientists this should not happen before the year 2050 .
Besides , in order to fight against the air pollution issue mainly due to the car 's traffic , scientists try to find out solutions , and work on other energy ressources such as solar energy , or even hydrogen energy .
Then , if they eventually manage to create a new type of car which would not pollute the air , driving a car would not be a problem anymore for the atmosphere .
Hence , the number of cars would be likely to increase .

Another reason is that people tend to communicate more and more , and the road network is getting wider and wider .
Then , people really enjoy travelling with their own car in order to be able to meet whoever you want wherever you want .
Indeed , having a car provides me with a lot of autonomy .
For instance , if I intend to go from one side of the country to another its is much more easier to drive my own car than to take the plane or the train , if the place I want to go is far from the airport or the train station .
