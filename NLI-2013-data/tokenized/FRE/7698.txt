travelling became a very comon thing that people do for diffrent kinds of things like work , family , enjoyment , learning ...
and people do them in diffrent sort of ways they go with friends or just with family members or with a group of society ...
and somtimes they even include a guide , that usually accompanie them when they want more information about a monument or somthing they want to visit and other people use him just for guidness through out the country .

in my opinion travelling is an experience , an adventure , a knowledge .
when i travel i like meeting new people from diffrent cultures , i like to learn from them , learn there language , see how think , how they live , what they eat , in general just living a diffrent life .
if i m thinking of traveling with my friends all this passion i have about travelling would n't happen .
we will be to busy taking care of each other .
and when we have each other we would n't be looking for other things knowing that we get along better with our own invironment .

when i see new places monument , castles , historical evidence .
i like enjoying them and triing to figure them out by my self i would like to take my time guessing what happened in this place , and then to clear up my story i would rather sit in my room and read about it and remember all those beautiful and peacful moment i had there .

so one day when someone asks me what have i seen in this word of discovery i would be abel to say that i discovered it my self and be abel to discribe it in my own opinion and not someone elses .
