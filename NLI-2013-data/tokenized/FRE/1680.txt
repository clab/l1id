Beeing an expert in many fields is very hard , nearly impossible .
Everyone has been confronded making the choice between having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specializing in one specific subject .

Knowing a little in many fields provides a lot of advantages .
First , beeing able to understand , even react , over a subject .
It can help to recognize the experts from the others .
Even if you want to be an expert , you know from where to start , where you could gather informations .
Knowing a few experts in the field could provides a lot of value .
For instance , let say you are a project manager dealing with a project involving differents academic subjects .
Covering all the subjects would be more helpful from beeing an expert in one specific subject because you could draw a general scheme of the whole system .
The project structure is a lot more valuable than beeing able to build one part of the system , you just need to hire a few experts to get it done .

One the other hand , beeing an expert in a specific field is great .
It can be easy to get hired from a company that really needs an expert with a high salery .
For instance , a few decade ago , Air France had made a system written in a specific programming language to handle all their client reservations .
A few years later , they needed to modify that program in emergency but nobody was able to program in that old language .
They finally found an expert but he asked a lot of money and he got it .

To conclude , you ca n't tell weather having a broad knowledge is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
It really depends on the work you want to do , the opportunities you will be given wo n't be the same .
