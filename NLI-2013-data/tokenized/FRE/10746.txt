The question of take risks and try new things rather than continue his habits , is a very important question to ask himself in order to know what kind of life we want to live .

In my opinion , take risks and try new things is the best choice for many reasons .

First , if you try to do new things , you can discover new products or find new idea .
And this is the best way to succeed if you want to succeed because if you do something that someone have ever done , the copy will be less good than the original .
For example , the richest people in the world are often someomes who invent something and thus who took risks before .

Secondly , the life is more interesting and really amazing when you take risk .
In fact , you never know what will happen .
Therefore you ca n't worry .
Furthermore , I think that people are more interested to speak with you if you can tell them about a new and original subject .

Thirdly , if you take risks , you can do something different of others activities .
And that 's more exciting .
Furthermore , how to succeed if you try nothing and if you just follow the others .
Indeed someome who succeed is someome who work a lot and who do what he wants to do .
For that , it 's important to take risks .

To conclude , I 'm sure that if you want to be a successfull people , you had to take risks and was n't be affraid to do new things .
Furthermore Life is more interesting if you do n't what you will do next days , weeks or months .
