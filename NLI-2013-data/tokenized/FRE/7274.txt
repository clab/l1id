The way to travel that someone can choose is highly related with her/his personnality .
There is basically two way to travel : the first one would be to travel in a group leading by a guide and the itinerary is known before the departure , and decided in an certain amount of time .
The second way would be to travel on our own , and the itinerary will be mostly directed by the people we meet and places we outlined before the departure .

In this essay , I will discuss in the first paragraph the advantages that a travel in a group has , and in the second paragraph , the disadvantages that it implies .

When travelling in a group , we are more lucky to meet people who share the same way to think .
It can be a way for people who have issues in communication to meet people and open themselves .
It 's also probably for people who does n't want to travel alone , and enjoy having time with people they do n't know .
On the point of view of the travel itself , travelling with a guide has the advantages to learn things about the country visited that would be propbably harder to know if travelling alone .
Tour guide travels are also made to see the most of things and landscapes , to experience local traditions in a few amount of time .

However , this kind of travel gives not place for the adventure and for unexpected experiences .
By travelling by ourself , we have the right of decision on where we want to go and when .
We can decide to stay longer in a place that we enjoy .
It 's also more probable to meet local people and directly experience the culture , in contrary to the travel tour , in which culture are translated and explained by the tour guide , in our own language .
The fact to be in direct relation with the local used language is , for my part , of importance in travels .

To conclude , for my part , I disagree on the fact that travel in a tour travel is the best way to travel .
However , I do n't think there is a best way to travel in general , but everybody has its own best way to travel .
For me , the adventure and liberty in decision are important to travel .
