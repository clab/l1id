To answer to this question , i think we have to begin explaining what we think about # many academic subjects # and about # specific subject # .
For example , does # many academic subjects # refers to science and econonic , or do we have to understand mathematic and physic , which are a part of science , or nuclear and light , which are a part of physic .

The conclusion of this example is that there are different degrees of specialization and that we must answer wich one is the best .

If you have a passion in a specifict subject , you ought to specialize in it and to do only that .
However , it is interresting to discover many different subjects .
Besides , people dislike to do always the same thing .
These things depend of each person .

But there is a thing we cannot dennied .
The more science knowledge increases in each subject , the more it is difficult to be good in a lot of these one , as the great scientists of the last century .
Today each job requires such a good qualification in a specific subject that it is impossible to be good enought in one another totaly different .
In an other hand , in jobs like ingeeners , you often have to change the subject in which you work in , and this is i ; possible if you are to much specialized .
Anyway , in France you have to learn a lot of thing about different subject before being allowed to specialized .

In France , the most specialized ingeeners work alone and the others together .
Because i want to work in a team , i will not be as specialed as them .
