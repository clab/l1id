People often say that giving is receiving .
A lot of people argue that nowadays , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , to help people .
First of all , we will see why it is possible to argue that in our society , people do not open up to the others , that young people are not engaged for helping the others .
Then , we will point out that in the new coming century , a lot of people give time to their community , that they do not hesit in involving in programs opened to the others .

On the one hand it is possible to argue that the society we live in encourages people to live without looking around .
Everything goes fast , everything is turned to the financial aspect of the existence .

Thus , young people hesit to give some time to their community because they do not see what the community can give them in exchange .
Nowadays , the process of profits is the origin of the lack of involving of young people into associations or into charities .
A lot of associations need young people to act .
But unfortunatly , a lot of these groups only receive help from seniors .

For young people , they just have to give to the other , who is also able to give him something .
That is the reason why it is possible to say that young people really hesit to give time to their community .

On the other hand , it is also evident that young opeople are today definitly involved in several groups aiming at helping their communities .
Indeed , a lot of these young people join every year some student associations , some group aiming at helping homeless people , or disabled citizens .
Today , after each crisis like a war , or a disaster just like the great Tsunami or Katrina in the US , young people activly help the others .
They often are the origin of several movements .

As far as I am concerned , I believe that young people know how to act and that the ways of actinfg are nowdays differents than some decades before .
Young people are creative and do not hesit to give time to their community .
The way of acting for juniors is different , but it is still the same idea : giving is receiving .
