The French government is looking forward to implementing a measure that has triggered an important controversy .
Indeed , they want to enable children to drop out general formation when they are fourteen so that they could specialize in one specific field by attending classes on this subject and making internships .
It rests on the idea that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I agree with this idea , even if I would like to nuance it by saying that a basic knowledge of several academic subjects is necessary before specializing in one particular subject .

First and foremost , people may not need a broad knowledge of many academic subjects in their daily lives or in their jobs .
For instance , a baker may not feel concerned by the study of DNA .
People may also be more interested in a specific subject and want to learn more about it .
For example a scientific may be keen on mathematics ; then he will wish to concentrate on the study of this field and drop out a deep study of physics or biology , even if he will need a basic knowledge in these fields since these three sciences interact .
Therefore one can adquire a basic knowledge of several academic subjects and then choose to specialize in one specific subject , in order to become an expert in this particular subject .

Nevertheless , the step during which one adquires a general knowledge about fundamental subjects is also very important .
A law which would allow children to leave school when they are fourteen ay be criticized from this point of view , insofar as it is the period of teenagers ' life during which they should adquire this general knowledge that proves necessary to understand the world which surrounds them .
For instance , they need to have at least basic knowledge of history and economy if one wants them to understand what is at stake in topical issues .
This understanding is of critical importance inasmuch as they will become citizens .

As a conclusion , I would rather say that each and every one of us should decide to specialize in one specific subject which particularly interests him , but after having adquired a sufficient competence in several academic subjects .
