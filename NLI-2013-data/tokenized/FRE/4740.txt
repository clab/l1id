The quetion of advertising is for me very important , because my childrens seems to be very influencal about it .
I thing it is true that most advertisements make some products better than they are really .
I will take the example of the foods industries .
Every days we could show on the TV or the newspapers advertisememts that proved the qualities of the foods products .
They took as support wellknown peoples like football players our basketball players , in order to prouve that the products are very wealthy , So the people who are very influencable could take this message at the first level and imagine , if they have the same foods , that they will be able to improve their own performamces and fill better in their lifes .

As the results we all knows that there is a big problems in our socities and especialy in the U.S.A and in Europe with obesity .
Because of the message bring through the advertissememts a big part of the population are changing the traditionals ways of using food and buy every days industrials foods the a saturations of fat .

But that is the most remarquable in this situation and the dangers of the advertisememts , it is that the same compagnies that developped the products will a lot of fat are actually developping a new range a products in order to reduce the numbers of calories in the alimentations .
Again the advertising is use to promote the new products , and in this cases they wil use the same supports like sportifs to bring an over message .

The problem we are focusing is that advertisements have only a positive message and they forget to show the negative points of the product , So a majorities of consumers event they known this bad side they are more influence by the positive side a the message bring by the advertisements .

In conclusion we must all be able to understand that the job of advertsememt is to show only the bettre side of the product .
