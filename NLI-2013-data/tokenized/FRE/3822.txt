Although it may vary for each country , I do not think that young people nowadays give enough time helping their communities .
In the past , the sense of community was much stronger : people , and especially youths , were much more commited to their communities , and perhaps had a stronger sence of belonging .
But nowadays , this sense is fading , and young people are becoming less and less attached to these groups .

In my opinion , this growing indeference in our society is related to the phenomen of the extension technology and means of communications .
With the developement of these means , people no longer feel a real need to take some of their time to help their communities , therefore accomplishing an act that used to be considered as a social reunion .
Instead , they - and especially the young ones - have found an alternative in technology : cell phones , computers , and especially internet , by which young people perform most of their social interactions , and therefore , although having a perhaps infinitely larger number of people in their new communities , have a more and more restricted and limited contact , or even no human contact at all .

Indead , if we consider less developped countries , where technology is comonly used , but has not yet become a full part of people 's life , we can see that they are much more comitted to their respective communities , and give a lot more of their time to help them .

Therefore , the sense of community is being little by little shrouded by the modern and more and more dishumanized world we live in .

But this is not necesarily a negative fact : the people have evovlved , and this evolution , as usual , especially touches the younger ones .
Maybe the sense of community will , in the years to come , be redifined to be adapted to a more modern world , and to different ways of thinking and acting .
