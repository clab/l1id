The future of the automobile is today an uncertain one .
Car ownership has been raising in the last decades .
But at the same time , the cost of that ownership and the environment consequences of running an automobile have been on the rise too .
It is my opinion , that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Firstly , the pollution consequences on environment due to the multiplication of cars have been observed more and more over the past years .
For instance , this multiplication has had a great effect on global warming .
These consequences have motivated the governments of several countries to take action by adoption tougher legislations on cars ' emissions .
For example , the government and Congress of California adopted tough laws to make sure that the automobile manufacturers would respect the State 's environmental laws .
At the same time , many countries have ratify the Kyoto Protocol which deals with the issue of global warming .
Most of these countries have adopted legislations concerning cars that would meat accordingly with the Kyoto Protocol .
But , if this does not respond to the problem of global warming , governments might legislate so that car ownership is reduce to one per household .
Adoption of public transportation politics by government like tax reductions might incitate the general population to use more the public means of transportation such as the subway , the bus or the tramways .
Those politics might reduce the number of cars .

Secondly , the cost of running a car has risen drastically in the course of the past years due mainly to high gas prices .
It has come to a certain point that a lot of people have decided not to use their car to go to work and use instead the public transportation facilities .
Their automobile sits at home while not being used .
If it is in the city , this excessive parking time might cost a fortune to the car 's owner .
Undoubtedly , this car 's owner will not buy another automobile after this one .
And if this scenario is repeated for other people than it will see a general reduction of the world 's car ownership .

In conclusion , the high environment cost of using the automobile and the raising prices to its ownership are factors that will create a reduction in world 's car ownership .
