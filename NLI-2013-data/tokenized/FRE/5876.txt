Over the years there has been an increasing number of cars in use thanks to the new technologies which provided new motors and has enhanced cars ' security .
Such evolutions has lead to reduce the price of cars which turns out to be one of the main reason why cars have become so commun .

however the way cars harm the environment and the high prices of oil can leads to reduce the cars in use in the next twenty years .
Indeed the emissions of noxious gaz from cars are at stake in the greenhouse effect .
that 's why the environmentals movment tend to inform population about the serious impact of theses gases .
therefore they try to prevent people from using their car .
they advise them to take buses or subway instead of their car .

otherwise we can also point out a serious variation in the oil price .
since a few years the price keep on growing and is now so expensive that people cannot anymore afford for it .
it is over their means .
so they have no other option than stop using their car .

Fortunatly a solution is being developed which could solve both of the two main problems explained above .
i 'm talking about the new bio-energies which are biological oil to use instead of petrol .
this kind of oil could be used by every car and will only cost 0 , 80 cents of euro wich is a great stride toward oil prices .

besides this new oil is natural and does not harm the environment .
the bio energies are expected to be in sale in 2007 and are presently developed by ' Gaz de France ' conserning the country .

to conclude we can notice that solutions have been found to solve problems which could explain an eventual deacrease in the car use in the next tzenty years .
according to me that wo n't happened
