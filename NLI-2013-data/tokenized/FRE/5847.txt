Nowadays cars are the most common way to move .
They have been created in the nineteenth century and had become rapidely important .
Cars became popular since it was easier to move , in contrary to train you can go wherever you want especially when you have to do short distances .
Therefore why cars in use will be fewer and what cars company have to do to save their market ?

Cars in use will be fewer in twenty years .
Firstly the price of oil will still increase since their is tention between the occident and orient and therefore many people wo n't be able to drive anymore since it will be too expensive for them .
Moreover cars act negatively on the environment , they will be point as guilty for the pollution .

Further more new ways of transport are developped and will reduce the numbers of cars : trains are getting faster and more secure and plains deserve more destinations .
Finally the licence to drive is harder to get , therefore every year less people can drive .

Cars company can react to this future discrease by two ways .
First of all they have to find new energy to substitute oil with an other more ecologic , like in brasil where people use energy from corn .
they have also to discrease the price of the cars so that more people will be able to buy one , like the new french car call logan who has been lunched on the eastern europpean market .
finally numbers of cars wo n't discrease since new markets open in india and china where almost three billions will be hypothetical buyers

to conclude , i disagree with the following stament since new markets will open and car companies will research new concept like hybrid motors to keep their markets .
