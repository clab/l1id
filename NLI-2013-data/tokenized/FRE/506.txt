From school to the labor world , hu ; an people have many occasions to learn and learn more .
Then , people take time to continue discovering things , like science , technology , geography , culture ...
All around us is there an occasion of learning more .
Some people prefers learning about only one thing : languages , movies , history and so on and closing their eyes on the rest of the world .
Is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ?
That 's the question ...

Academic subjects are related with general knowledge : from what we learned at school to the latest news on TV , we will be able to discuss about the fact of a problem .
As Mr Wilde said [ if I well remember ] , there are 3 kinds of people : those who speaks about people , other who talks about facts , and finally people who discuss the ideas .

The specialized person is able to speak , to explain the birth of the problem , the facts , the risks , the advantages and the drawbacks .
But his capacity to know and to speak will be limited to some specific subjects .

Otherwise , having academic knowledge is something long : there are a lot of things to learn , from stranger languages to finance , between musicology and archeology .
Is it really possible ?

Knowing everything about a subject is something possible : everybody has a passion and wanted to know the most of things about this topic .
A musician want to improve his science by hearing music , learning to define the styles , to increase the technic and will automatically become specialized in this subject .
And it 's the same for a person who likes its job : after maybe 25 years in the same branch , people have experience and specific knowledge .

I think that a specific knowledge do not depends on a specifc willing , instead of the knowledge of many academic subjects , which one is the result of a lot of work .
