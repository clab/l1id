Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

This statement is very true successful people are always taking risks trying new things but this is what make those person successful .

If someone is successful in something and keep on doing only what they already know how to do , well he will never learn more and will stay in the same place he is .

The person who will be trying new things will stard to be more successful because he will be good in new things he tried so he will know how to do more things well .
This is the way this person will be more successful than the other one that just kept on doing what he use to know and did not try to learn more things .

If you look at the people who are around you , you will see that the person who are always doing new things will have a lot more problems to resolve than person who stay doing what he knows .
This is for sure but resolving those problems the person learn more and more , this is the way he will stard to do the new thing and to know how to do it .
Well if you can tell this person who is always taking those risks are successful .
The reason is that not all the new things he tried worked but a lot of them did work .

It is a very good sentence that I like a lot that say : `` How do you want to get fish if you do not get your feet wet '' .
The successful person is who get her feet wait to get some fish .
This is a very true sentences you have to get wet to get what you want and most of the person want success in life .

I agree that if you want to be successful you have to take risks trying new things this is why person who take risks tring are successful .
