People do things by differents ways .
Succeful ones try new things and take risks instead of using ways they already know .
I agree with this statement for many reasons .

Successful people used to find out new ways of doing well even if they already know others successsful roads .
It is because of their need to have more success and also need to be more proud of them .
Because they want proov them and people than they merited their ttle of SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE .
so they take more and more risks to increase , if they succeed their fame .

In addition when you are a person who succeed , you have to continue but not to be contented of what you already are .
Because ther is a hioghly degree of fighting spirit .
For example , a very successful company of cell communication , which is faced to a new one whose prices are more availabable than hers must take risks by cutting down her prices in order to have more profits .
It is a new popularity and money entrance .

All the same , even if having experience and use it is important , test new methods is also good , because people do not finish learning and must try to increase their abilities by trying more ideas .
So there a popular short word : If do not risk , you wil have nothings .
Successful people are knows as persons who are couragious , fighting , and humble .

Because of all these previewing reasons successful usually try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
From my point of view it is right .
Being more successful are important for successful people and they used to choose this way .
It is a paradix but it also law of the nature .
But some people only do that .
everybody has choice .
