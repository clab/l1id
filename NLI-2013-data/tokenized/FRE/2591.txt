I agree with this statemet because , generally , and even if certain old persons largely enjoy their lives , young people are more likely to enjoy their lives for many reasons .

First of all , older persons often have disabilities or illnesses .
When they begin to grow older , people 's bodies begin to be less and less effective , they may loose some reflexes or their mind for example .
They may also have heart diseases and be afraid to do some things .
Usually , they do less and less things .
However , young people will have a more effective body , they are at their optimal age and are most of the time able to do sportive activities , to dance , to go to bed later ...
They are able to do some things that older people cannot do .

Most young people also enjoy life more than older persons because they think they still have a long life to live , and they prefer living their lives as best as they can and doing the craziest things while they are young and still able to do them , and also crazy enough to do them .
When people grow older , they know their lives may be ending soon , and they often think that they have lived enough things in their lives to die peacefully and happily .
Moreover , people often do less crazy things when they grow older because they often have more responsabilities .
They may have a family , children or grandchildren that younger people do not have , and they do not want their families to loose them , so they live a quieter and a more peaceful life , and thus sometimes enjoy less their lives than younger people .

But I also think that some people may enjoy a quiet life , but some people may like to do crazy things , even at an old age .
I think that some people who like to live a quiet life may still enjoy their lives when they are older while those who like to live a less quieter life but who are obliged to do so because of diseases or illnesses must not enjoy their lives very much .
Some young people may also not enjoy their lives .

In a conclusion , I think that young people often enjoy more their lives than older people , but I aalso think that old and young people can both enjoy or not enjoy their lives .
I think it is a question of character and personality .
