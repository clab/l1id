I agree with this statement , I think indeed that in general successful poeple are more likely enklined to get into new and maybe more risky situations ( financially or personaly )
When poeple have reached a honorable level of social success , they tempt to be much more self confident and by that less subject to being afraid of taking risks .
Most of the time the risks are taken financialy .
But those are n't most of the time uncalculated ; they are done in a way that they will not be totaly in danger .
For example : if it 's a financial risk , they will probably mesure the level of danger in so far that even if it takes a negative turn , they will be able to handle it .
