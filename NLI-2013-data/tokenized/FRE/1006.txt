I believe we live in a whole world .
I mean even if physically and intellectually people are different , we live together and we have to feel good about that .
To feel comfortable we have to understand each other , that is why I think a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .

First I plan to work in the hotel industry and why not a day running my own hotel .
In order to achieve this goal I need to be polyvalent and know about many different areas .
I have followed business studies which lead me to learn things about many different topics such as management , finance , strategy , languages ...
I found very interesting to learn about different materials coming from different part of the world .

Then I believe that acquiring knowledge of several academics enables people to be more open minded and autonomous when they face problems perhaps not in their work but in their daily life .

I think the main goal of standard education all over the world is to teach people a base of vital knowledge which involves different topics : reading , counting , speaking , writing .
To finish I am sure that many people need to specialize in order to achieve their goal , but this is not my view of life .
I agree that some professional need to be highly specialized in their domain like surgeons , traders ...
but it does not prevent those specialists to have interest in other topics .

That is why I believe that a broad knowledge of subjects is more valuable than to be specialized .
