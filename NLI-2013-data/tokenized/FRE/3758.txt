`` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . '
I agree and I desagree with this statement .

First , I desagree because we cannot generalise so quickly what young people do or not nowadays to helping their communities .
Instead , no everybody has the same difinition of `` young people '' and furtherwards we have to make differences in `` young people ' : some of them are very interesting in what happen in their communities and invest time in it and other young people do n't worry about it !

Second , I desagree because not only young people do not give enough time helping their communities , adults too .
Actually , I assume that young people are the most concerned with this problem but I will speak about this later .

I agree for a large part with this statement .
In my opinion , a lot of young people just do n't matter about what happen around them .
They enjoy their life but they do n't think further than their own life in their little town !
We have to inform people about their communities and encourage them to invest time to helping them !
Instead , you can do both being happy in your own life and having interest in the other members of your communities .

And , in my point of view people do n't open their mind enough to the world .
A lot of people thing about the best way to gain a lot of money and are very individual what I can understand too .
But the world cannot keep turnig if it is only an addition of individual people who do n't understand the importance of their communities .
An individual person is nothing without communities around him .
An other important point is that young people are the most concerned with this because they are the future members of our communities .

But what is the best way to senbilise young people to spend time to helping their communities ?
I think that could be a good subject for an other essay ...
