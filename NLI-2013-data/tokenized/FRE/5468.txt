In our actual society , we can not avoid advertisements ; we totally live in a advertising space .
we find them every where around us : On the television screen with so many commercials every ten minutes , in the news papers , in magazines , in the street !

however most of those advertisments are just good publicity , and nothing more .
advertisements agencies spend hours and hours every day to find a new product which will attract more clients .
And lmost of the time , they privilege quantity to quality .
in such case , they make products seem much better than they really are .

they used very various ways to attract us , and most of the time pertinent or attractive visual images in oder to catch our attention .
lets just think about the huge number of advertisements to loose wait .
they choose thinny models , who are slim by nature , make us believe that thanks to their new performant diet product , they lost calories in a very short time and got this amazing results .

but when buyers use the product they are often disappointed by it .
sometimes they get in part the results they expected and sometimes no results at all .
morever , some brands try to fool people , spending huge amounts of many to get a star to represent their brand and appear on their advertisement campaign .
but even those brands are not even better , they just have take a bet on the visual aspect in order to better attract us to buy something not eventually more efficient or usefull .

often we buy stuff that actually we dont need or are not useful at all , just because we have been influenced by the products advertisement .
besides , if you make a survey on the efficiency of products bought from , a given population , probably much more than the half will assume that those products were not as good as they looked on the advertisements .
publicities are elaborated to get into our mind , and make us think that we need a given product whereas its probably not the case .
for example , teenagers often buy their favorite stars , specially girls , in order to ressemble to their icon .

that why , i hereby think that most of advertisements seem much better t
