Saying that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is , in my opinion , false .
Currently peaple need more and more mooving essentially for their job .
In developing countries , car is one of the more used transport system .
Today we are addicted to our car .

It is thrue that there are environemental problems caused by the fact that cars consume gasoiline and that reserves of petrol decrease .
It is a real probleme yet , and some peaple says that when we will not have petrol it will be not possible to continue to drive our car .

But it is not my mind , I trust in research and sciences I am sure that in twenty years we always will driving but with another oil wich will be better for the nature and the environement .

New sort of oil are tested like agriculture oil for exemple .
But the main futur energy are clean 's energy : like wind , sun and electricity .
Some engenneer students have made some experiences in order to taste a car witch goes on with solar energy .
Today Honda had market an hybrid car witch use two differents energy : gasoline and electricity .
We can even buy a car witch use electricity or natural gaz today .
The probleme is the expensive price , but I thing that in twenty years progresse will decrease the price of this new sort of clear car unless the price of petrol decrease ...

I think that I am realistic if i says that it 's impossible that the petrol price drop because reserves are less and less important and it can not change .
