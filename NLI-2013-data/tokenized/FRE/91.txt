There are many ways to study this subject .
To begin with , we would tend to say that children are happier than older people , but I do n't think it is totally true .
Let 's study it , explaining in a first part , why the younger should enjoy their life more than older people , in a second part , the contrary .

First , young people are without doubt in a better health condition .
It does a lot of job .
Health is an important part of a happyness .
When you get older , you become ill more often , and you have stronger weakness against diseases .
Practising a sport is a real pleasure when you are able to do it .
When we are under the age of 10 , we have no regrets ' thoughts when doing something , it is a real chance .
And it is also the moment of many first-times , when you discover the world you live in .
We all can remember amazing moments in our life that will stay written in our memory , due to the pleasure encountered .

Why the older people would enjoy their life more than young people ?
They have the knowledge .
It helps having fun , when you know how to laugh about a subject or a situation .
You better know how to satisfy yourself and your friends , because you got an entire life of experience .
Then , I suppose there is the family : it is very enjoyable to see the babies of our own children , during the holidays for example .
In some countries , old people do not work , they have all days to make what they want ; it is a kind of liberty .

In a nutshell , I would say life is enjoyable wether you are young or old .
Age is not that important , but the kind of situation that makes you satisfied change with the time .
To my mind , people should take profit of each moment in a lifetime .
It is the only key of a great life .
