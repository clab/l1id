When was signed the Human Right Declaration ?
Who signed it ?
Where ?
Are you sure to remember all the anwers by heart ?
If not , do not need to conclude that you are a bad person who does not know anything .
However , this conclusion can be easily reached if you do not know the objectives of the Declaration and its importance .
Maybe this example is not the best but it helps me to explain that even if facts are important , understanding ideas and concepts is a priority .

When students are going to school , they want to learn to better comprehend their environment .
To reach these objectives , they have to think , ask questions and learn ideas and concepts .
Ideas have the advantage to be transversal and be re-use on different subjects .
Indeed , the example of the Human Rights is not only an historical element but also a philosophical and anthropological question .
By knowing the concepts , students can make cross-over and see how some themes are connected .

Facts are still useful but they are mainly illustrations , examples .
They give value added to students to apprehend their lessons to give a practical dimension to a theorical problem .
They should be highly regarded and well-used , however , they should not be seen as the ultimate goal .
Knowing fact without being able to relate them to some ideas is a waste of time .
A person is not more intelligent by the amount of information he knows but by the quality and his ability to use it .
Therefore , students should learn to think no only to repeat .

Finally , once students have ideas and concepts in their mind , learning facts is not the most difficult thing to accomplish .
Our world with the help of images , television , media is full of facts .
You open any newspaper you will find fact on a multitude of subject .
The real difficulty is to analyze them .
That is why I will definetely encourage students to take some distance from facts , think , and try to make some relationship with ideas and concepts .
By that way , they will add value added to their work and remember easily the different historical date , names and facts !
