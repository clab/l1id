A major physics break through was made when Einstein suggest a brand new theory dealing with relativity .
This innovative vision was a success and Einstein had strong physics basis .
Do we need a real ceasure to succeed in one area or do we need to evolve gently to reach a key point ?

First , let 's explain how seeking excellence can bring us to a success .
For example , the computational fluid dynamics activity needs real mathematics and fluid physics knowledges so a person can then think about a revolutionnary concept .
By focusing on one point , we can try different methods to bypass it .
Working on something wellknown helps thinking about the major issue and not about mathematics ' properties .
People who keep doing well what they know are gathering knowledge , experience so they are recognized by other people for this and often called , needed to explain , show , develop this subject .
Finally , as a third point , shall I mention that taking risks is not really allowed when working on a nuclear plant or when driving a war , as human lives are at stakes .

But , many battles were won by using surprising methods like the horse made of wood during the greek Troyes war .
More over , taking space between a concept and our work can lead us to borrow ideas from other areas , like using mathematics for urban planning optimisation .
And this make the concept work .
However , an other reason of taking risks is that most people have too much fear about risking anything they already have .
So you are distinguishing yourself from others and then appear , when succeeding , as a successfull person .

To summarize , acquiring excellency in one particular field is the first step of a successfull story .
Then , an innovative concept would make the difference between success and daily wotk .
