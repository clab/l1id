About the statement which is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' I agree and we are going to see four points through this topic .
In the first point , we will see the behaviour of the children , secondly the problems and stresses that does n't concern the children , thirdly the way how a child think and live and finally the fourth point is about their way to act through someone else or something .

On the fisrt hand , we are going to speak about the behaviour of the children .
Indeed if a child is in a good and normal situation , he is all the time positive and his objectives are to play , to smile , to watch cartoons , to do some paintaings and all things which concern leisure and pleasure whereas an adult has a lot of problems and things to organize all day in the life .
However the children could have some stresses and it is what it is going to be analysed in the second paragraph .

On the second hand , obviously the children confront some problems but they are really poorly compare to the problems we are going to confront during all our life , adult life as the job , the house , to organize and gain some money to live and so on .
The problems for a child is to have some friend and to be in good relationship with them and so on .
However the children could have social problems but it is felt different when you are a child or an adult .
Indeed , the child has a special way to feel the life .

Thirdly , it is true that foe the child , everything is beautiful , marvellous and good , like the believe in santa clauss and so on but when we are adult , the life is often less magic .
Their mind is pure .

Fourthly , when they act , the children do n't think how to act and to do this or that , they are not worried about confuse somebody or nothing like that .
The way to act is like they want to do it .

Finally , to conclude I think that when we are young , the life is magic and we think that when we will be older , we will ne doctor or anything and everythinh is simple to achieve .
