In the question there is two very different points which are : have a broad knowledge of many academic or to specialize in just one specific subject .
In my mind there are advantages in the both of them , however I prefer the second one .

In fact , we are perhaps more broad minded if we have a lot of knowledge about many academic subjects , however I think it 's really difficult to learn a lot of things at the time since there is too much informations ; that 's why we could n't be excellent in all the subject .

Moreover , when we know a lot of things we do n't are very passionned , so it 's hard to choose a favorite subject or find a job which is very interesting and which regroup all the things we 've learned ; whereas when we speak about just one subject and we know only this subject we can be more concentrate on it .

In fact when we learn a subject deeply it 's more interesting since we can know more details and actually be more concerned by our subject .
Besides when we work just on one subject there is probably more motivations that 's why it 's easier to have good remind of the theme and all the details the subject .

For example it 's better to work in a management school To conclude I am not sure we can good learn when there are too much things to know .
However I think it 's easier to specialize in one specific subject to have more informations and eventually feel better thanks to our work which seems to be finished contrary to the work we do when we 've a lot of subjects .
