The issue of the `` quantity '' of the knowledge is a controversial one due to the fact that knowledge is unlimited !
Many people think that having a broad knowledge is a good way of being able to speak with everybody about every topics .
However it is also widely believed that you can specialize yourself in just one specific subject that you will deeper study .
Taking all these aspects into account , I strongly feel that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic topics , in order to be opener with other people .

One reason for my belief is that having a great and broad knowledge is a very good way of creating relationships with others .
For instance , during a private lunch with new people or friends or during a business lunch , it is easier to enhance the relationship with the people if you know what they talk about , which cities or countries they have visited or which cultural references they are speaking about !
However if you are specialized in just one subject , you will not have be able to understand what is told and you can feel very frustrated ...

Another reason to justify my point of view is that it is very difficult not to annoy people , if you are passionate just by one subject !
People can find it is very borrying to speak always about the same topic and it is sometimes too much , even if you know all details and features of the topic !
That is why , knowing several academic subjects enables you to be opener and to adapt yourself to the other people , to what they like ...
Moreover , you will be able to understand them better and to accept or criticize their convictions ...

Furthermore , it is often believed that being specialized in one specific subjet can be a good way of making an impressive reaction to other people ...
But I am convinced that the contrary is impressive , too !
For instance I enjoy speaking with a friend of mine which has a real broad knowledge , I can speak about everything with him , he always makes comparaison or connection with other topics that he knows and it enables me to discover new sublects , to extend my own knowledge and on top of that to create a real debate with him , by confrontating our opinions on several subjects !

In a nutshell , I would say that I agree with the statement , because having a broad knowledge is a way of being open on the other people , on the world and to develop one 's own concerns .
