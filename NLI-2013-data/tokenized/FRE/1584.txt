Wether it is better to have a broad or a specific knowledge depends esentialy of the point of view : if you are looking at the society general interest or at the individual interest .

Eficiency is one of the main argument in favor of knowledge specialization , because it is certainly harder to master a great variety of topics than to focus on a narrow topic .
Specialization is one of the main reasons of the great achievements of modern Science .
Today 's scientists are capable of very complex theories and projects because they are all very specialized .
A botanist would not mix with quantics , because he would loose some time in getting the basis , whwn he could have developed a little further a study on a peculiar animal behaviour .

So for Science and more widely for the human race specialization is better .

But as human being and individuals we need equilibrium which is achieved only throught a wider horizon of knowledge .
If your goal is self fulfillement then you will be better of knowing a large panel of topics .
That is why during our elementary and most of our secondary studies we are studying a large panel of fields in order to get a solid background on which people can build their minds .

And it is valable even in the scientific world , when some of the most extrordinary discoveries have been made throught interdisciplinar studies .
Like mixing ordinary chemistry with biology you discover the extraordinary possibilities of using one to dicover more of the other .
You can dicover some intresting molecules in some animals or plants and you can better understand how the brain works if you know chemistry .

I will end this essay by saying that a solid background of knowledge is necessary , and only then you can specialize in your own field .
