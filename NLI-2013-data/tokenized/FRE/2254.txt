I do n't think young people enjoy life more that older people do but in fact I neither think the contrary .

In my `` short '' beginning life I met lots of differents people from all ages .
I met young people like me who wanted to discover everything .
They wanted to test new sensations , discovered new cultures , go out every night to meet people and make parties .
When you are young and you want to do that you can !

But when you are young and you want to jump from a plane to experiment thrill of falling you meet an older instructor .
When you go to the best discotheques you learn that the owner is 50 years old .
When you drive fast on the highway and think `` I am the ( stupid and crazy ) king of the highway '' you see an `` old '' man behind you in a BMW / Mercedes / Audi car that drives faster than you .

I think most people thinks that when you are young you can make lots of enjoyable things because of your health , strenght , young mentality , freedom etc and when you get older you have more contraints .
But in fact I know people older than me that show me that you can enjoy life if you have children , if you ca n't run very fast and jump everywhere .
There is not an only way to have fun and all people have there own way to entertain .

To conclude , I think you can enjoy life while you are not so seak that you have to lie all day long on a bed .
It do n't depends on your age or the money you have .
Enjoying life is a way ...
of life
