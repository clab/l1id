Live is full of expereince that can determine some attitude and behavior and lead them to choose what is important in their live .
In the meantime , one can assume that learn from others theories , ideas , writting or experiences , can somehow be important to help them better understand a situation or a problem .

On one opinion , it is really important to learn from facts because one will have all the details at his hand .
It obvious that it is easy to make assumption about a situation , that one had witness or a situation where one had spend time digging to search the true .
One opinion is more critical and more explanatory that a simple description out of a bunch of ideas collected in differents books , ideas or concepts of others people that did some researchs on a problem .
Facts make you judge from your own angle , facts push you to the next level to use what you know from the results of your own work and apply it to previous ideas before you will conclude .
If you are a student in criminal justice .
it will be so easy and wrong to just beleive that someone can be guilty and sentenced just by what the criminal book or ideas and concepts that one learn from the criminal book to encriminat or sentence some because one verify the stereotype of a criminal behavior or person .
One can not judge like that .
One shoul understant that , it is important to have the facts , to search the true instead of just assume from ideas and theories .

it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts but the facts are what can make one avoid being wrong .
facts give one more insight about experiences and how to deal with your surrounding but ideas and concepts are more of ways of thinking base of others works or research .
