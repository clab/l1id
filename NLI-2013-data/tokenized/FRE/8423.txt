Some people thinks that courses taught in universities are too theoreticals and should be more based on facts instead of general ideas and concepts .
I strongry disagee with this opinion for several reasons .

The first reason why I think that ideas and concepts are more important for student than simply learning facts is that you can always learn facts by yourself .
Actually , you do n't even need to be a student in a classroom to learn them .
Indeed , most fact are just data that can be memorized with no or little understanding .
But what really matters is the the underlying cause of a fact , even if it is very general .
For example , a fact in finance is : `` you should diversify your portfolio in order to lower your risk '' .
But what is really important behind this fact is to understand how the risk can be evaluated , and what are the main factors that make diversification an efficient investment strategy .
If you do n't understand the concept , you might still be able to learn the facts , but it always will be a limited basic understanding .

Secondly , ideas and concepts will eventually help you to understand the facts and therefore are more important .
For example , you may be able to memorize the list of all the presidents of the United States , but is n't the idea of creating a democracy in America more important than a list of name ?
Students do n't have to become factbooks or encyclopedias but should be able to understand the facts based on the concepts and ideas that they have understood in class .
It is a deeper knowledge and probably more general but it is also a key to deal with new situations .

In conclusion , the role of a university is to make students become responsible persons able to think by themselves and to give them keys to better learn and understand facts : ideas and concepts .
