In todays business , advertisements has become the most powerfull tool to sell a product or a service .
This advertisement has reach a certain point where sometime it gives a product certains futures that seem to be better than the product is really .

In the past days we have experience few of these situations where after an advertisement of a bathroom cleaners which are very powerfull , they can cut the grease , remove any kind of dirts and unclog any bathtub ; turn to not be true after using them .

Onother exemple is my underwear that I bougth base on the advertisements ; which suppose to be very strong , color resistant , lasting for long time , was discolored after the fisrt laundry .
After two weeks of using them they become so weak that they start tearing into small parts .
The most disapointing situation that i have experienced is my car , which i bought by looking an advertisement in a newspaper .
It describe this car bieng very strong , confortable in driving with a warranty of about fourty thounsend milles on breaks .
After ten thousend milles of driving , this care was not drivable again .
The breaks need to be replace , the wheels started chaking ; and almost every thing need to be replace in this car .

Base on a personal experience , I agree that most advertisements make some products seem much better than they really are .
