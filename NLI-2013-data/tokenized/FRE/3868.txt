`` The new Generation '' is a very critisized topic these days .
Young people often give out the example of a modernised generation who care about nothing but temselves and how to stay entertained .

Even though young people always seem to be preocupied with themselves , they do care , in a way , about helping their communities .
It is true that they do not show it as much as older people do but that does not mean that this new generation does not care about helping their communities .
After all , they are part of their community , so by helping it they end up helping themselves .

For example , young people will tend to help their communities by making it seem more enjoyable .
They will plan numerous activities for different events , like trick or treeting and costume parties for Halaween .
By doing that they entertain people of all sorts of age : children will be happy as well as their parents who will enjoy spending time with their family .
Now of course this example might not be very revealent for older people who think that by helping the community you must decrease the number of unemployments , help the elderly , organise charity events ...
but younger people , are not always aware of the importance of these sorts of problems , which is why they do not give it attention .
This does mean that teenagers do not care about these social problems but it will take more time for them to understand how important they are for the community .

By saying that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' , we give out the impression that they are spoiled kids who do not give attention to their environment .
That is why i disagree with this statement .
Both teenagers and children help their society by not even noticing .
For example , they are aware of not throwing their rubbish on the streets .
By knowing that they help decrease the pollution rising in our world today .
Of course , they would not be helping their communtity as much as adults do , but it is a fresh good start that proves that this lack of care of the `` new generation '' is not always true .
