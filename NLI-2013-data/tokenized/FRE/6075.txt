The probleme of the number of cars throughout the world is often debated when talking about polution .
Even if personal cars are not the main factor of air pollution ( factories for instance pollute more than cars ) they are often heavily accused of polluting because they give an example of individual pollution that could be easily reduced by reducing the number of cars .

I however really do not think that there will be fewer cars in twenty year than today as the world population keeps growing from decade to decade .
I do not know exactly how many humans there we will be in twenty years but I have heard it would be around 7 milliards .
For a demographic reason , even if poverty does not decrease in the thrid world , there will be more Western people and consequently more cars .
So we can ask ourselves the question how the number of cars could possibly decreases .

It is effectively noticable that cars become cheeper and cheeper .
Consequently , the number of poor people who will be able to aford a car will increase and I really do not think they will refuse this privilege if they get it .
Mathematically , the number of car may exponentially grow .

This growth tendency might be reduced if the different governements and non governemental organisations try and work together to control that expansion .
The trouble being that they are barely able to find an agreement on other purpouses such as factory air pollution and water spoiling and chemical pollution so I do not think that they will consider cars like a priority .

Furthermore , I don4t see the resaon why it should be placed as priority because when you see the amount of drinkable water decreasing in coutries like Bangladesh for instance , I really think there is still to be done before prohibiting cars
