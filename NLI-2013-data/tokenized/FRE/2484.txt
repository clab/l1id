With the young and the old people , we have two different way to see things .
In some points you enjoy more your life as a young personn than an old one , but this statement works in the other sense too .

For a young personn , life is a train that you do n't have to miss , in other words , you must enjoy your life as much as possible as a young personn , because when you get old you are not able to do all the things you were able to do before .
When you are young you have a permanent energy that gives you this happiness of living that allows you to do everything , like go out on the evening and go to work the morming after without being tired , or just pratice a lot of activities like climbing , scuba diving ..
For sure , scuba diving is not advize for old people because of heart problems .
This example justify why being old can appears as the end of the freedom .
You are more fragile , your body is not the same , you are not the same .

But being old is not essentially the end of life .
As the wine is getting better when it 's getting older , people become better when they getting older .
In fact , you become more confident because of all your past experiences .
You become a brain who knows everything and who did everthing !
That 's one of the biggest advantage of being old , you have a knowledge of a lot of things .
It 's not the only thing , when you are old you can make a comparison with the past , society changes , new products appear , you enjoy to see all the improvement of the world you used to live in before .
By the same time you become grand parents , and you enjoy a lot to be with your grand children .

In my opinion , you enjoy more your life when you are young , because you are more able to have fun .
When you are old you are often seek , your body does n't work as good as its was used to , and futhermore you just remember the past , when you were young .
