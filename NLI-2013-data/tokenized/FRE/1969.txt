Young people and older people do not have the same point of view of the life .
They cannot enjoy the life in the same way .
I do think that it is not a question of the age .
In this essay , I will try to explain why I believe that young people could enjoy life more than older people do and vice versa .

First of all , I would like to say that you cannot do a '' generalisation '' .
There are , in this world , happiness and sadness .
On the one hand , they are young people who live it up and young people who are very sad and do not enjoy their lives .
On the other hand , there are old people who enjoy their lives and others who do not .
For example , my grand father , he has worked all his life .
He has found a company and he has spent forty years to build this company .
He never went on holyday with his son and his wife .
He was a kind of workalcoholic .
He started to enjoy his life at sixty .
Now , he is very happy .

In this rapidly changing world , money is related to happiness and unfortunately all people do not have enough money to live .
I really do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people do because it depends on much more things .
There are money but also the health , the environment where you grow up , where you spend your childhood , your conditions of life , your family life , your job and social life and so on .

Personally , it is for me incredible to think that .
Even if you have 80 you can live it up and enjoy your life as young people do .
