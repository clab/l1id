The contemporary society is used to asociate young people to energy , optimisim and hapiness .
I think that old people can enjoy life as young people do .

First of all , as life span is ever increasing , old people can enjoy a large retirememt period than before .
A lot of activitites are specially designed for them .
For instance , they can return to the university to attend classes .
That is a wonderful opportunity , especially for those who did n't have the opportunity to complete their studies .
They can even benefit from special fees as regard transport and entertaiment , and realise some dreams they never thought due to a lack of time and money .
That why you can see many old people in touristic countries such as egypt for instance .

Moreover , in the current society , the old are not viewed as they used to .
Because of the advances of medecines , old people are much fitfull than before .
Some have the abilities to keep working or practising sports .
I heard about a special new agency that proposes special part time jobs for old people who want to share their knowledges and their experiences with young executives within a company .

At the end of your life you are supposed to be wiser and clever .
All depends on your health .
But if you look at people such as the Dalay Lama , you can hardly be afraid of getting old .
Energy is not a synonimous of childhood .
All is a question of personality .
Many public figures displaid in the magazines feel better in their body and in their mind because they are fifty years old .

To conclude , I think that the ability to enjoy life is not directly linked with your age .
Our society is getting older and that does n't mean that it is getting out of order or worse sadder .
All depends on everyone 's personaity , mental and physical situation .
my grandmother is always in movement .
That the best evidence for me that
