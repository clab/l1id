The problem of helping his community is very difficult to deal with due to his complexity .
Many people belive that teenagers do not give enough time to help their community because they do not care about it .
On the contrary , the statement that people gives time to charity can also be partly justified because nowadays people try to be closer with the poor people .
However , all aspects into account , I stronghly feel that young people do not give enough time to their communities .

First , I agree with the statement that explain that young people are more interessted in video games or getting out than in helping people .
For instance , when we need to go the see my grandparents , my little sister always tries to find a solution to do something else this day ( chatting on Internet , meeting some friends , ... ) .
Another exemple to illustrate that young people do not care about elders is the bus .
I can barely understand what cost to young people to ask a old man or woman if he or she wants the sit .
Besides it better to stay on your feet after a whole days of lessons where you have been sitting for hours .

But it is true that is difficult to really help his community , it take a lot of time and nowadays it is hard to find some free time .

However their is some people who like to help people of their community , they do a very nice job like .
To illustrate my point , I would like to talk about people who give some warn food for people who do not have enough money to eat something hot during the winter time .

Therefore not everybody do not care about his community , but a lot of people think that other people do that for them .
I am not particularly active to help my community , but for me it is a lack of time .
But this year I have decided to help some young people to their homework in order to give them the pleasure of working .

To sum up we could say that not everybody do something for his community but I am not sure that 50 years ago it would have been better .
I have the feeling that people help more and more their community with money for associations .

Their is an age for everything and , perhaps , the youth who do not care about community will change their mind and become an activ helper .

The community needs help whenever and whoever gives this help .
