I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but they are several reasons for this and it is not always the case .

With the huge rising of cumsumption society , more and more products are proposed to the customers .
Most of the products are really similar .
How make the difference between two bottles of water witch have the same price ?
This is the role of Communication and advertising .

Companies will presents the products in the better way .
They will associate to it a lot of qualities and significations .
With advertising , companies create the image of the product , and it is this image which makes the difference when the customers buy the products .

So , the customers do n't have to mix the real qualities and specificities of a product and his image .
For example , a brand of water showed in one of his advertisements babies dancing and swimming in waters .
That does n't mean that each person who drinks this water becomes a baby and ju ; p directly into a swimming pool .

A second problem problem for companies is How sell a cake or a fragrance by advertising ?
People ca n't taste or smell the product .
Consequently , advertisements suggest the flavour or the tast of the product , and as everybody has his personal tasts and preferences , everybody do n't always agree with the advertisement .

Finaly , advertising do n't alwys presents the products in a better way than reality .
Advertisements are controlled by law and associations of customers .
Companies ca n't lye about thier products , lying advertising is punished by lawm and in this case the company looses all his credibility and the trust of his customers .

To conclude , advertising make product seem better to make business .
It does n't lye , it improve the reali
