I am not quite agreed with this statement because we can not be so radical .
It seems like all the young people would not help enough their communities .
I recognize that some teenagers tend to be lazy and people would like them to provide more efforts but it is unfair to say that everybody acts this way .

Now if we focuse on the vocabulary used in the statement , one word retains my attention : nowadays .
Implicitly it would mean that they were helping more their communites in the past .
That can be true .
If we go back in time , we would realize that our life style was quite different from this we have today .
People was more helpfull , they spend more time together .
Now young people are more independant .

I am wondering what communities refers to ; to the family , to school , to friends ?
Young people use to spend more time with their friends than with their relatives .
In that case , I can understand the point of view of the person who wrote the statement .
Now if we talk on a mondial level , I think that young people are interested in helping communities abroad .
I read an article in a magazine whitin they explain that more and more young adults would like to take part in worldwide exchange programs such as Humanitary Help in South America .
They stay in for example Peru to give free English lessons to children in primary school who cannot afford to have an acade ; ic education because of their poverty .

I think that young people give time to helping their communities in some ways that other people , maybe , can not see at first sight .
