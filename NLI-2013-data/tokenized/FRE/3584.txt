( It is a well-known fact that people who take care the most of the communities are authorities .
But we should ask ourselves , do we have to be working in the government to help in the communities ?
Should young people give more time to help in their communities ? )

To begin with , young people sometimes partcipate in helping their communities .
They organise games or some fun activities to raise some funds for maybe bying some sports equipments in their school .
We can add that young people do give clothes or unused objects to charity .
They might even help during their short holidays for taking care of the elderies .
Or sometimes help giving papers add in the road , to inform tha population about something .

However , young people give only very little time to help their communities .
Firstly young people are also busy , .
Their most occupying activities ins going to school , or to college .
So that might make them forget of the possibility or giving a hand to the weel-being of their community .
So , for an example , they can use the little time they have for themselves to relax an enjoy life .

Secondly , young people are not very responsible .
they do not really care about what is happening in their communities .
sometimes they do not even care whwt hwppens to thw
