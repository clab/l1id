Advertisments are a major part in the process of selling a product .
When you ask people about what they think of telling the truth in any situation , usually , their reserve is about business and selling in particular .
They will tell you that what we call a white lie can be an advantageous procedure in order to convince more easily to buy and that if the seller was honest , they may not want the product .
In this essay , we will discuss this point in order to demonstrate the agreement to the statement .

First , we can envisage the fact of someone who bought a product , trusting a really encouraging advertisment .
After trying it , the deception is huge .
She realizes that what the advertisment was saying is totally untrue .
It happens all the time .
The thing is that now , all these entreprises propose the solution of taking the product back to the shop .
In this case , they lose money , so this is a big risk to envisage for the people who want to sell the product in a large number and gain money .
Perhaps they lose more money lying about the product because of the large number of people who could show deception .

However , most of the time , this situation of an advertisment making products looking much better than they really are helps the business and push people to try and be excited about something .

First , it helps selling the product because it does not envisage the disavantages of this one .
People just see the good points and do not envisage living without this fantastic element .

It also helps the research because people , bying this product , will test it and eventually , when they are happy or not , call and make comments about it .
It is always good to know that in order to move on and to do progress .
It is always good to hear the users .

In conclusion , this is true that advertisment almost always act this way and lie about there product .
It is a part of their job to convince and that is something that cannot happen if the advertisment envisage all the problems that the product can show .
In the business world , they need this `` making much better '' to success .
