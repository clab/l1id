Yes , i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for the simple reason that understanding is a key of learning .
It is hard to do or learn something if you do n't understand from the begining .
For example , in sociology class we learn different cultures and diversities of behaviors of different group .
In order for a group of people to learn the fact or to accept a certain way of doing certain things , the teacher have to explain why this people behavior this way but not the others .
Understanding is more important because it easy the learning process .
Something that you understand the idea or concept you do not have problem doing it .
An example explaining why you should or you should not do this is more important than setting a ruler on what to be done .

When teaching , the teaher explains his expectation on his assignement to student , it very important at that stage for the student to ask him any questions that they may have to have a clear understanding of his idea than to learn by getting a bad grade .
when you understand the idea and concept , you can prevent the worse and you can succed .
In general life you notice that what is not well undestand is never
