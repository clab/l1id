I do agree with part of the statement about trying new things .
When placed repeatedly in the same context , individuals tend to limit their horizon to what they know .
In a business environment , this leads to two possible negative results : predictability and lack of innovation .
If competitors know that one will continue to do the things it currently does without change , they can adapt and exploit the company 's weakness .
In the case of IBM , for instance , led by Louis Gertsner at the time , the company knew how to build and sell computers .
The company did n't take any risk , such as engaging in software development or applications .
Emerging companies seized the opportunity , and that is how Microsoft came to market .
Microsoft , led by Bill Gates , took risks , expanded in new segments , and became a juggernaut compared to IBM .

On the other hand , I do believe also that always trying new things and taking risks can be a dangerous proposition .
An example of this comes from the automotive world .
Jack Nasser , Ford 's CEO at the time , wished to take Ford beyond automotive and transform it to a global consumer product company .
Ford engaged and invested in different ventures .
Eventually , this proved to be a distraction to the core business , automotive .
Insufficient investments were made in improving its product line .
And with so much focus on new ventures , Ford lost sight of the market forces changing the automotive landscape .
Ford had stopped producing the kinds of cars and trucks consumers wanted .
Toyota , on the other hand , focused its business on increased sales in the automotive sector only , and closed ranks to become a dangerous and growing competitor .

I do believe either option can be relevant for different people or organizations at different phases of their life .
Sometimes , people can use something they do well but still take risks .
I would cite the example of Apple , led by CEO Steve Jobs .
While successful early on thanks primarily to its ease of use and its attractive design , Apple computers became largely irrelevant when other options came to the market .
Recently , Apple took advantage an emerging market in digital music downloads and designed the now famous iPod .
The iPod leveraged Apple 's legendary design and ease of use and became an unsurpassed competitor .
In this case , Apple took something they knew how to do well ( design , ease of use ) and still took risks venturing on a completely new market ( digital music download ) beyond their core market .
