The world is already aware of the harm that the industrial revolution has made to the atmosphere .
Since it is an issue of worldwide importance restriction policies are implemented in the most developed countries .
Until new technologies will be discovered , unfortunately thos restriction policies will not work .
There are few reasons for this .

First it is evident that with the growth of the quality of human health , people will live longer and so the number of human beings on earth will considerably increase .
Thus the number of potential car drivers will increase allso .
Even though countries will try to limit car use and develope public transportation the development of human socities combined with the globalization will creat a bigger need for cars all over the world .

The developing or underdeveloped countries will need cars and all the new possibillities provided by cars in order to develop their economies .
Almost all the African continent will need motorized vehiculs in order to create a strong economy and ways to trade with their neighbours .
Moreover if we look at the recent boom in the Indian and Chinese economy we may suggestt that in twenty years those two great countries will also be the first car importers as their populations are the greatest compared to the ones of any other country in the world .

As the average conditions of living of the populations around the world are slowly and enequally increasing there are still some countries that did not undergo the industrial revolution .
I t seems quite obvious then that there will not be fewer cars in twenty years .
There may be fewer cars in the occidental countries as Europe or the United States or at least they will be less polluting .

As a conclusion I would say thay even with the best will of the politics thr car is still a product that is not only usefull but also beautifull for some people .
It can be used for a lot of different purpouses and as a lot of people like to show off and live in great luxury , the car will not disapear in the next twenty years .
