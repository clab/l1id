New York City , 2026 .
For a time-traveler from today , the city is hardly recognizable , for one main reason : cars have almost disappeared .
Where are all the yellow cabs , the traffic jams and the continuous flows of cars ?
Instead , there are electrical buses , and a few fuel cell cars , that only the richest can afford .

Is this assumption realistic ?
In other words , will there be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today ?
In order to answe this question , I will evaluate the different factors that play a role in this issue .

As we all know , oil and natural gas resources are doomed to be over by 50 or 60 years .
In the meantime , their price will continue rising as it already does .
This leads to assume that cars are going to become a luxury that fewer people will afford , and hence that the number of cars will decrease .

Furthermore , global warming is now being faced as a real issue for our planet , and fuel consumption by cars largely contributes to it .
Some governments are already raising taxes on gas , in order to make people reduce their use of cars .
They also encourage public transport : 30 people in a bus represent a much smaller impact on environment than 30 people in their own cars .

However , oil price rises and global warming are also faced with a more innovative approach .
Technologies are being developed which will allow cars to be cleaner for the environment .
Hybrid engines , cell fuels , electric engines , are probably what the future of cars is made of .
As soon as the price of these technologies becomes effective and competitive compared to oil , we may expect a rise in the use of such cars .

The remaining questions are mainly when this shift will happen , and whether the price of a car will be affordable .
I think we may first expect an overall slow decrease of the number of cars in the next thirty years , followed by a rebound .

Maybe by that time our behaviour will have changed , public transport will have spread widely , and the rebound will not occur so much .
But owning a car is - and will always be - a pride and a feature of independence , which leads me to assume that cars have a bright future .
