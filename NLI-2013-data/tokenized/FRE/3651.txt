The more time passes by the more young people got to think for themselves .
In the past , life allowed a lot more time for community , a lot more time to help others The world goes faster and faster and makes you more and more think individually .
Young people have to prepare their life earlier and helping their communities does not come first .

Even if it 's true , since a little while , young people do care about community more than before .
For example the CPE ( `` contrat premiere embauche `` in France ) made all the students go down the streets and show their disagreement , they had reasons for that and they did what they thought was right .

Young people are more concerned about politics than before , they follow the moving world an try to improve things even if they have to lead their own life too .
Young people begin to understand that their individual future is connected to their common future and that improving the community is improving themselves .
Nowadays , young people have their minds wide open on the world and they grow even quicker than before because of they are completely involved in the life of their society .
They bring new ideas and new problems , they think about ecology , bringing new technologies to help the earth developing itself with good intellingence over time etc ...

Young people are more and more concerned about every kind of problem and they are not afraid to get into them to help the community become better and better .
