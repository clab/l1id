In our society , young people tend not to spend a lot of time helping their communities , and that is due to the society in which we live .
Indeed , we observe at the moment a sort of individualism , which is expressed by the fact that people tend to live by themselves without taking care of their neighbours , acting like sheeps .

Young people used to care for other people , but that was what the society told them to do .
Nowadays , the matter is not that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , it is just that they do not have time to do so since our society is based on work and money .

How could it be possible for young people to care for communities when they have barely time to take care of themselves .
It is true that more and more young people live their lives according to their personal needs , which is kind of hypocrite in a way , but one has to admit that our society does not help young people very much .

On one hand , studying is becoming more and more expensive .
If you are courageous enough to make your dreams come true , you can try to find a job in order to finance your studies , but this does not seem normal .
On the other hand , you have some countries where studies are paid by the government , as it is the case in Denmark for instance .
In Scandinavia , one can notice that people and especially young people care for others , take part into helping communities .
In brief , they are deeply involved in their society , willing to help in order to make things go better .

In a nutshell , I would say that the young people 's investment in their communities is closely related to the society they live in .
If young people have to bear adults ' role in life when they are not adults yet , I do not see how possible it is for them to get involved in their communities .
