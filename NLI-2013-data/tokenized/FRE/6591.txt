The car is most preferred motion media in the world .
In western countries , almost each family has one or more cars .
In developing countries , people aim at having a car .
This is usually a proof of success .
And these countries are still growing , producing and coming to a mass market economy .
Therefore it seems difficult to see fewer cars in the next twenty years .

Yet this statement could turn out to be true .
For other reasons which are not directly linked to the comfort of people .
Nowadays , we can notice that an always greater part of the population feels concerned with environnememt issues .
The use of cars is directly linked to this new awareness of the population .

People became aware of the influence of car gases through climate evolutions ( temperature increase , unpredictable storms ... ) , through medical surveys ( number of child concerned with asthma , increase of lungs illnesses in the population ) .
At least in western countries , this awareness could lead to a reduction in the number of cars sold .

Another point is that in big cities , people are fed up with the noise generated by the cars .

An other argument is linked to the increasing oil barrel price .
Over the past months , the oil barrel has risen to incredible prices .
Reaching almost 80 $ .
Even if the prices have felt recently to a more acceptable 60 $ a barrel , the car has become a well in which families throw their money .
Furthermore , the organization of oil producers said that the prices would n't fall under 60 $ a barrel .

This situation has two possible solutions .
Either the scientists develop new fuels for cars .
This could allow people to use their car or at least to buy new cars which meets new environmental requirements and which are then less expensive as they do n't need fuel produced from crude oil .

Or the cars will be outnumbered , especially in big cities , by public transportation , as it is the trend today .
But they will remain numerous on the countryside where public transportation are less developed .

As a conclusion , I will say that I do n't foretell the disappearing of cars until quite a long time .
