Nowadays the world more than around the sun turn around technology .
indeed in 2006 everybody have a cell phone or a computer at home sometimes they wears it on themselves .
We lives in a technology area and this evolution made some modifications such as social modification .
In fact the socialist talks about the progression of individualism .
Anybody live in his world in his matrice ..
because he does n't need others because if he wants talk he can do it on the tchat with the computer moreover he does n't need parents to do his homeworks because internet can help him better than his parents .

so everybody and in particularity the new generation lives in their world there are less contacts between peolple .
Therefore in addtion of the progression of individualism we guess thinks that there are less solidarities between people because individualism and solidarities are linked .
so to summarize this we can say that we lives in a individualistic-society .
Therefore can i think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?
yes i can , so i agree with the following statement , whatmore i feeling concerned by this because i 'm one of theses young people and i have conscience of this but how changed the new way
