I agree with the fact that most advertisements make the product seem much better than they really are .
Of course when you watch television a lot of infomations and pictures goes in your brain .
You record all you have seen and after you want to buy it it 's a fact .
But when you go in a restaurent for exemple sometimes you are very desapointed because it does n't look at all with what you 've seen on television .
The producers are really strong because they can make an illusion of lot a things and the people fall in this illusion .
I have a personal exemple for this situation .
Last nignt i was watching television and i saw an advertisement about the newest cell phone .
The commercial said that he is very small , one the most resistant ...
in fact one of the most everything .
When i went in the cell phone shop indicated on the advertisement i discover that the phone was very big that he was n't at all resistant and in fact that he was very bad .
I understood after that it was only a commercial witch make me go to the cell phone store to buy an another phone .
I got punked by this wrong advertisements .
And i do n't think i am the only one who leave this experience in fact i believe that everyday people like me do the same thing but some people sometimes does n't go back like me and on the contrary enter in this vicious circle .
it 's the purpose of those commercial .
It 's to send you somewhere to make you buy something you did n't need at first .
But whe cant always said that the commercial are trying to play with us .
Sometimes the commercials are true and show us true things .
They do n't play this game often ( make product seem much better tan they really are ) because in this case a lot of person will be sent to jail !
