studens often have a choice to made arrived at a certain point of their study .
on one hand they can choose to make general studying on many subjects , and on the othe , r to choose to specialize themselve in one specific subject .
what arguments can help student in their choice .
in other word , what infer each choices ?

i will discuss both advantages and disavantages of each .

to begin , specialisation does not aloud numerous knowledges but these are quite precise and more detailed .
specialization is closer to a profesional aspect of the working world .
But getting specialize in one subject restreint evolution later as the student does not know many things about other subjects .
For example you have a small choice of career and sectors when you have made medecine study as it is a specialized study .
But for people who know what they wand , what they like and what they do not .
they will choose for sure a specialisation , avoiding to learn subjects they do not get interested in .

on the contrary , having broad knowlegde of many acaddemic subjects imply to have multiple abilities .
it aloud evolution in a future career as you know things about diverse subjects .
you can change sector of activities more easily .
broad knowlegdes show a capacity of adaptabilty as you are more open minded .
however the sum of many knowledges can not be enought if these are too general .

for me , as i am studying at a business school , i have made the choice of having a broad knowlegdes of many academic subjects .
that choice aloud me to learn abour diverse subjects .
it permit me to get more interested by other extra academic subjects as i am used to look for diversity .
