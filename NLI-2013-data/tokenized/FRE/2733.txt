Some youngs people have a good life , but dreams to a better life .
An important part of old peolpes thinks that their life was better in the past , werehas currently they has money and tree time .
In my essay I will discuss about the two opinions .

Youngs should have two opinions , be happy or be anxious .
In one hand , when we are young , we have lot of tree time and no responsabilities .
We have time to makes interessants thinks .
It is pleasant but not very exciting .

In an over hand we have no job , no money and no hands on experience ; so we have reason to be anxious .

My opinion is that old peoples had better reasons to be happy , than youngs ones .
A lot of old peoples have do importants thinks , be may have work and help the society ; maybe they had created company and producted interessants things .
Last , but not least , they have free time and wisdom .
so they can do interessants thinks , playing cheese , be artist or give time in charity society .

To conclude , I think that lot of old people had very good reasons to enjoy live .
In fact they may have do very interessants and importants things ; so they have reasons to be proud .
Wherehas youngs have no reason to be proud , But they could be excited by future .
