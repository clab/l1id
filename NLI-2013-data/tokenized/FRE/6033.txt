For the time being , the number of cars in the world has not stop growing .
Indeed , The technological breakthough with H.Ford and the Ford T provided the idea that each people would have a car .
But Nowadays scientits want to make people aware of the danger of cars .
So we can wonder if in twenty years ther will be fewer cars in use that there are today .

The market of cars in rich country is almost full .
In consequence , the numbers of cars will not significatively .
New cars are bought just when the former one is over .
In other way a lot of people especially in poor country do n't even seen a car or maybe so rarely .
In my opinion when those country will developt everybody would like to fulfill his dream and to buy a car as people from rich countries did .
Besides this problem , people that owns cars feel they depends on it because they take it so oftently .

But recent problems like polution make the point that the worl would have to reduce the number of cars .

The gaz exhauced by cars make the athmosphere poluted .
Those if we want to provide a available to live Earnt , we would have to change our behaviour .
Several govenement purpose bills to struggle with the widespead of air polution .
One of the major point is to put public transport much more available in big cities .
In my belief , this is a big step forward to recuce polution and also cars in cities .
If governement wants to reduce number of car in rich countries it have to make provide some waranties like developing also public transport in public area .
For poor countries , governement are experienced with problems of rich countries so I hope they will not make the same mistakes .
Before that cars become usual , they have to provide a good network of public transport not for population to see too much interest in having a personnal car .

Finally , I supports the idea that car will be fewer in the futur because , in my opinion , the problem of mass produced car is quite widespread and so governement will be smart enough to take them responsability to provide network of public transport and even to put restrictions .
However , I think that we have to focus in industry now .
