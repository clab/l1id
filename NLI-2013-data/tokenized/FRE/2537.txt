Happiness is an interesting issue : do young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
Well , from my experience , I believe that older people are in a better position to enjoy life nowadays than young people .

First , let 's take an example .
A lot of people may say `` living on an island in a warm place , far from the stress life of big cities , is like Heaven. '' and they add `` People who live in such place do not know the chance they have '' .
This example illustrates a major point : no one can appreciate his life when he has never experiment a hard situation .
Older people , from their experience , have an idea of the difficulties of life and when they decide to do something , they know how to enjoy it .
People tend to enjoy more when they know things are not so easy to get .
For instance , a child who uses to get expensice gifts does not know how hard her parents have worked to get their social situation .
But if he makes things by her own , she would like them even more because she remember the difficulties and time she went through .

Second , nowadays , life is getting tougher for young people .
Because of today 's economic and political situation , life beomes much more stressful for young people who have to make create their social situation .
Unemployment rate is high in a lot of countries like France and Germany and young people have more difficulties to find jobs .
Moreover , because of globallization , companies have to face competition from the entire world .
This situation leads to costs reduction in the majority of companies and a need to make profits .
Thus , young people have to face pressure coming from everywhere .
They are not in a position to take time to enjoy life , because for a lot of them , they have to work , work , and work , and sometime rest .
The situation is clearly different for older people .
They are retired for some of them and they do not have to face all this pressure .
They can spend more time on their passion and extra professional activities .

Third , the situation for older people is much better than one of those a hundred years ago .
Older people benefit from social enhancement .
Health care and health system have improved , and the life span has increased a lot in rich countries .
People live longer today .
Thus , older people have more time for themselves .
How about young people ?
Well , as said before , their new stressful life is not favorable for a healthy life .
Look at the amount of medication to reduce stress spent every year by young people !
A research has shown that the best time to have a baby is ...
retirement .
