When things are going weel , does it mean that it might turn bad ?
We usually say that what goes up , must go down , but is that a true statement ?
When we are in a successful situation we have two possible ways to react .
Some people will keep doing what they already do while others will try new things and take risks .

Few peole who succeed will try to keep doing what they already know how to do well .
That way , they will not put their life in a situation where they might loose everything .
For example , somebody who learned how to fear the futur like an old entrepreneur will know when comes the time to slow down an activity in order to make it safer .
Only very rational and experienced people will be able to take that kind of decision .
You need to know yourself very well to act like that .
But successful people are usually in that situation because once in their life , they took a risk , they made a decision that made them successful .

Most of us will get excited by success .
Money and honors usually turn us into non rational people .
Successful people will take risks and try new things .
It is true that successful people usually do n't take a step back to look at the situation .
Most of the time , they will take risks instead of trying to make there situation sustanable .
But is that a bad thing ?
Life is short and we have to enjoy our lifetime .
The better way to do it , is to take risks .
Our goals should be learning , meeting people , and discovering new things .

To conclude , there is a very important cultural part in the way people would react .
From my point of view , life is short and we should always go toward new things , that 's how we can spend an efficient time on earth .
The better way to go backward is to to try to stay in the same situation .
