Success often appears to induce people to look for new challenges .
As far as a reward is supposed to demonstrate how clever people can be , it seems logical that they may be prone to show that they deserved success and that they can do it once again .
Chance could be regarded as a part of the performance and such a view would casts doubt on the own competences of the subject .
Let 's fancy a sportsman , Michael Jordan for instance .
After all the won game he experienced , it was obvious that he could not stop to train and to compete for new cups .
He seemed during a few month to need rest and to benefit from his former performance but the public and some of his friend called for new exhibitions .
Finally he took the bet .

Of course , success may sometimes involve satisfaction and all the efforts that people coul have made may be considered vain if people cannot take advantage of it .
However , it is taken for granted that success often produce sides effects that could not be ruled out .
celebrity is a burden but a burden that people that is seeking for reward has taken into account from the beginning .

Moreover , human beings of thaat kind is mostly shaped for such a life .
There are a leading reason why they are prone to keep on struggling for new perfomances , their deep nature .
To put it in a nutshell , reaching a high is the meaning of their whiole life .
