It is generally agreed that the younth enjoys life more than the older generation does .
However , I will explain why I am not a strong advocate of this belief .

Firstly , most students have a lot of work to do for their studies .
As a student in an engineering school , I have to work a lot in order to pass my exams .
I donot have too much time to spend with my friends .
My parents have more time to invite friends and to attend to cultural events .
I am looking forward to having as much free time as they do .
A lot of retired people are in a good shape and are travelling a lot to discover the world .
I am personally convinced that many of them are enjoying life more than I do .

It should also bear in mind that when we have a job in a company , we are independant and it is for me a top priority .
We have the opportuny to spend our money as we wish .
We can set up a family and spend a nice time with our children .
I woud really appreciate to bring up my chidren and to do my best to enable them to be well educated .
I know that before this , I will have to work very hard to be allowed to go to the universty of my dreams .

Above all , it should not be brushed under the carpet that many young people suffer from the lack of assistance .
Some of them even commit suicide .
Also , some teenagers have to face drug problems that have tremendous effects on their health .
I think that much remains to be done to decrease the rate of these dramatic addictions .

To conclude , I back that young people do not always enjoy life as much as the older generation d. I think that authorities should focus more on the ways to help more the younth .
