A successful person need not necessarily try new things and take risks .
The knowledge of a particular craft or art and developing on it could also make a person successful .
There are a lot of artists , painters , musicians , dancers who already know a particular skill or have a specific talent and they dwell on it , improve it , specialize in it and become successful .

Different strokes for different folks .
Some people are successful academically , others do well in athletics .
It would be unwise for a person who is good in athletics to switch to an academic profession .
It would be an uncalculated risk and one is bound to fail .
It is better to bank upon what one knows than venturing out towards the unknown .
This is not to say that there arent any entrepreneurs who havent been successful , they have been successful because they have done something no one has done before , found something that works .
But it is a matter of hard work and great bit of luck .
There are many entrepreneurial ideas that never succeed and also several skilled people who arent successful , but the chances of a skilled person being successful is higher than a risk takers .
The knowledge of a skill is very useful and definately the right use with hard work would result in success .
Also one must continously strive in their own field and keep upgrading themselves .
If a person has not yet recognized his/her potential , then trying new things to find out what is suitable is a good idea .
But leaving a reliable option to trying new things is not very safe and is not a garaunteed formula for success .
If someone has a talent and does it well , then there arent many reasons for the person to fail except , of course , the skill or talent is dormant and of no use .
For example , someone is excellent at washing clothes and washes them really well , but that skill will not be awarded because everyone washes clothes in a washing machine and so the skill is useless .
So , one must only try new things and take risks if one does not already know how to do a certain thing well .
It is then one must set out to self discovery and risk .
