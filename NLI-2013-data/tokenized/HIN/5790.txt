The statement whether there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in the next twenty years is a controversial one .
On one hand , the number of cars are bound to increase since spending power of people is increasing which enables them to buy cars .
On the other hand , it may be possible that there will be a vast reduction in the number of cars due to lack of resource which drives the car i.e. Gasoline .
However , I believe that the number of cars in next two decades are going to increase .

One reason for my belief is that the ease with which a consumer can buy a car in today 's world .
Even if the consumer is short on cash , he can easily buy the car on installments , a facility which is provided by most of the showrooms .
Moreover , banks also play a big role in purchase of car by introducing auto loans which enables their customer to borrow the money from bank and pay them later with easy installments with marginal interest rate .

Another reason for my belief is that the humans in today 's world are looking for comfort .
Gone are the days where people believed in physical workout to make sure that they stayed fit .
Today 's generation holds the thought that comfort is the best pleasure of life .
With such ideology , its highly likely that each individual would like to own a car for his comfort .
Not only owning a car leads to comfort , its also considered as a part of ` status symbol ' in our society .
People owning luxury cars are given a high status in the society whereas people owning no cars are generally looked down upon .
If a person does not own a car then many people form the opinion that he is not financially stable which is why he cannot afford to buy a car .

Perhaps the best reason for my belief is that even though there is going to be shortage of gasoline in coming years , scientists are continuouslly trying to come up with alternative sources which can drive the cars .
Many such inventions have already taken place such as a solar powered car which gets its fuel from the sun 's rays or a battery powered car .
Although these cars are not widespread in use as of yet but its a great possibility that they will be widely in use in the coming decades .

In addition , there is also no restriction imposed by any governement in the world on ownership on number of cars which leads the consumers in buying of cars without worrying about breaking any law .
That is why we see many families owning more than one car .
Thus , the above reasons substantiate my disagreement with the statement .
