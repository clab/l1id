I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
there are many reasons for this point .
first as in group we would be safe as example in a strange country between strange people it would be good if remain in group as there would be less chance of robbery .

Other benefit is of tour guide .
A tour guide will show us the every important place and by this way we would not miss any tourist place .
Other benefit of tour guide is that he knows all the ways to reach that place so the chances of lossed in any place will be very less .
In a group we can also share each others feelings and experiances , and that would be entertaining .
The good aspect of travelling in group is that it could reduce our expences in some content .
so over all in my opinion travelling in group with tour guide is best way .
