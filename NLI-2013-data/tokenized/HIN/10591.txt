This statement definitely has a lot of truth to it .
I totally agree with the statement since I believe that only when one takes risks can he/she be different from others .
Being different from others means thinking differently than others and having unique ideas and thoughts .

One is said to be taking a risk when he/she is doing something out of the ordinary with an element of uncertanity .
This involves being creative , imaginative and most importantly innovative .
Most successful businessmen in the world are where they are beacuse they had taken a risk .
They took the first step and used their artistic abilities to do something that others had not done .
Bill Gates , the CEO of Microsoft took the risk of using his ideas and investing in it to produce a useful outcome .
He was greatly successful is his approach and now is among the richest people in the world .

Great figures in history have taken risks to achieve what they have aimed for .
Turning back time and looking at American History we can clearly see that the British took a big risk of entering an unconquered and undiscovered territory , which is now the United States of America .
They definitely knew that they had a fair chance or no chance of acquiring what they had desired .

Everything in life holds risks , whether they are risks investing in shares of a multinational or buying an good from the electronic store as an investment for your own home .
But , risks involved in being a successful person hold much more than that .
Logical thinking and one 's creative abilities encourages him/her to take risks .

However , sometimes taking risks can be dangerous .
We should clearly evaluate the degree of risks we are about to take and state the dangers involved .
Risks can directly or indirectly harm an individual or the society as a whole .
Therefore this should be considered before attempting any risks .

If everyone in this world continued to do what they already know how to do well , there would not be any developments in terms of technology , scientific achivements or even physical abilities to do something .
We would be living in a fairly backward society with no room for any innovation or creativity .

Sometimes , we should think outside the box and take these risks which will help us to be known and will probably bring fame and make us successful .
One who takes risks is more likely to be successful than one who does not .
The simple reason being the latter does not believe in himself/herself and does not have enough confidence and courage to get his idea out to the world .
