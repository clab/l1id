I definetely agree with the statement , ' The bet way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . '
Travelling in a group is an overwhelming experience since you are accompanied by a number of people which makes your journey much more refreshing and exciting .
Either taking a break from work or planning for a vacation results in exploring destinations .
Therefore the best way to do is to travel in a group and also making sure the right person is around to help you out the most enjoyable time of your life .
This is where the tour guide comes into play .
Though it might be a bit expensive to hire one but for sure you wont regret your decision as you will access yourself to having one of the most fascinating trips of your life .
A tour guide will help you plan everything , taking in account minutest of details and will at the same time make sure you 're satisfied by the outcome .
Whether it be the choice of staying in a hotel or having certain meals during the day , all is taken care of .
Tour guide helps increase your knowledge which leads to better understanding of details of that particular place .
On the way , he 'll be disclosing these crazy facts which you might have n't ever or read or heard of .
Usually a tour guide knows three or more languages which shows how flexible he is and is well equipped to handle task at hand .
This perfectly works well with family picnics and ensures quality time spent with family and friends .
However there are always two sides to everything .
People who are ambitious and adventurous , and those wo really want to explore the destination on their own are highly unlikely to accompany with a tour guide .
This is possibly found with a large bunch of high school/university students mainly because they 're young and energized .
