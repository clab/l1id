I think that the over the time period the number of cars being used today will surely decline .
This is because of the increasing concerns over pollution , shrinking fossil fuel bases , availability of better ways to commute , cultural shift in dependency or association with cars and increased traffic .
All these factors are now evident to anyone who uses or sees cars everyday .

Pollution has emerged to be a major concern over the period of time , and now , in comparison to older times when cars were considered to be a symbol of freedom , people have started to see them as major causes of pollution .
Air pollution is done because of the usage of the common fuel , gasoline , even though we have modified the structure of gasoline to do less harm , e.g. high octane fuel , and have even equipped the cars with better technology , multiple stroke engines etc , still the safety limits are being pressed to edge , and we have experienced the damage .
e.g. depletion of protective ozone layer and increased respiratory diseases among urban population .

Next , the crude oil sources used to supply fuel for cars have been continously decreasing and have reached at such an alarming low level that scientist have cautioned to start looking for alternative fuels , which are either not that efficient or are not economically as viable as gasoline .

Also , over the period of time , people have deviced better ways to commute like bullet trains , people in Japan commute almost 500KM each day to work , which was not possible with cars .
Also , in other major cities alternatives means of transport such as metro rails and high capacity buses are experimented and are well recieved by people .

Moreover , these days we are moving away from the need that gave rise to this effective means of commutation such as going to work , companies are experimenting better ways like work from home options which do n't require employees to come to office , another example is reaching out to facilities such as convinient stores , now you can have everything delivered to your home on one phone call .
This will eventually wash away the need of cars .

Increased traffic and its effects like accidents are bothering people so much these days .
They are more concerened about the time lost in the traffic and their safety , after all who will want an everyday commutation to office or school to become an adventure ride .

So to summarize , with the increasing awareness and decrease in the causes that lead to the use of this means of transport , coupled with environmental and health factors the car will eventually become an old means of commutation .
