This statement is true to every single word and at the same time equally convincing .
I strongly agree that successful people try new things , indulge in innovative activities and are risk-takers .

First and foremost , The proverb ' No risk no gain ' supports this idea .
Had our forefathers not tried new things and taken risks in their lifetime , we would not be sitting on our sofa watching a big-screen TV , talking on the phone with someone from a different continent , eating microwaved food and getting an automatic massage to our feet .
All these comforts at our disposal are results of the efforts and risks people have taken to bring on changes .

People who always try new things and take risks are likely to open the doors to fresh ideas , novel results , widened scopes , broader perspectives , new domains of thinking , and most importantly , a profound intellectual comprehensibility of what is around us and what can be done to make this world a better place .
Such people are not only successful themselves but actually help the society to be a role model .
On the other hand , doing what one knows how to do well is almost like living in a confined area with limited scope and results .
Not that these people are not part of the society and do not contribute to the well-being of the society and become successful , but they lack fresh perspective and ideas to anything that is unexplored and unexploited , in terms of its value .

A good example would be the invention of Airplanes .
If the Wright brothers did not take the risk of flying , we would not have airplanes today .

Therefore , I firmly believe that in order to be successful and be able to help the mankind , one must be ready to cross boundaries , explore the unexplored and make this world a better place .
