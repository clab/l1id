It is important for student to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn the facts , i agree with this that students should understand the ideas of the concept .

knowledge of the student is behind the theory .
he can do through theoritical .
students should get ideas on the both theoritical and the practical tests .
In the theory we will get the concept and in the practical we will get the knowledge in detail what is happening in that concept .
A student can learn and understand and anything can be made through theoritical or practical .
By getting the ideas the student can improv his knowledge .
In the theoritical he can get the ideas but up to certain limit , where as in the practical test we will get the ideas in the deapth .
In the practical test we can learn the concept in detail , and with the ideas we the do the experiment .
With out the ideas and the concept we can , t perform anything .
first we have to get an idea and the description of concept going to be performed in that concept .

student can improve the communication skills he can improve his ideas .
ideas are the strength of the students , with out the ideas student can not be performed .
if any one of them ask for an idea we will be in a stage to give the idea .
kowledge is the power of the student , and the concept without the concept we ca n't do nothing , for every small example there will be a concept , and without this concept we can not perform anything .
what we are going to achieve , and students should understand the ides and the concept .
this are the specific reasons for the students to understand ideas and concept .
concept will give the ability what is going to be performed .
