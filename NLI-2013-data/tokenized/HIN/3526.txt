I do not agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to help their communities .

This is a relative statement and like all relative statement , it is bugged with contextual inconsistencies .
When comparing two time periods from a perspective of societal contribution by young people , we need to understand that the challenges and expectations var widely and thus the statement ca n't be empirically justified .
Moreover , the current society is a result of the action of past and to blame it implies that the values enshrined by the societies of the past were not that great , thus challenging the underlying process on which the statement is made .

Just like organisms , society also evolves .
As such it has become bigger , more varied , adaptable and faster .
The value system it espouses is radically different from the past and thus are the actions .
To compare the actions of young people in the current socitey from the value lenses of the past society is doing great injustice .

The current young generation is expected to perform well in all sphere of life , be it a home , school , college , work , friend circle , society .
This is putting a lot of pressure considering that the time needed to perform all this activities has not increased .
Such was n't the case in previous socities .
Despite that , the young people are very motivated and concerened about the scocety and it 's well being .
This is visible if you look at most of the socially oriented organizations are staffed by young people , be it PETA , Greenpeace etc .
There are a lot of demonstrations around the world to stop the ravages of wars that drive their force from the youth of today .

The younger generation is looking at novel ways of making a change .
The new breed of social entrepreneurs are forming non profit companies that are run in a professional ways to contribute to the betterment of society .
This can be ascertained by the fact that there has been a mushrooming of social oriented business courses all across .
The work places are providing outlets for their younger employees to engage in socially relevant tasks , besides their normal tasks and they are lapping it up .

The younger generation , in my opinion is more awakened and sensitive about the needs of the society .
They are doing all their very best to fulfill the social duty in a more efficient and effective ways .
The only difference being that the areas which concern them are different from that of the previous societies , which reflect the challneges of the present and not the past .
