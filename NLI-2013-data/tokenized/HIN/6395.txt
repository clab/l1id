I completely disagree with this statement that there would be fall in the car usage in next twenty years when the number of cars being owned by the people is increasing day by day .
There is no reason to expect the reduction in this rate in coming future , or atleast in the span twenty years from now .

All of us are so dependent on the cars that it is very difficult to think about make smooth movement from one place to other without our own means of transport .
So rather than a luxury cars have turned out the need of common man .
And we all know that the nesseccities ' ussage never decline , so is the case of cars now .
They will probably increase .

Also if we see the current newspaper , the details about the increasing rate of number of cars on the road doesnot at all allows us to agree with the point that the cars usage will decrease in near future .
Rather it is truely convincing to say that this number would shoot up to an indeterminable value .

Also there are several new models hitting on the road every season .
This makes the younger generation to get attracted towards them and enjoy newer or advanced technology cars .
Also the latest models providing driving comfort makes them catch attention of sensible car owners making them ultimatelypurchase it .
But at the same time these people just sell off their old car to anyone who will can use it .
This leads to new car added on to the road rather than a replacement .
the second .
Would this prove that the car ussage will go down ?
Not at all .

There can be no prediction made atleast after reviewing the above examples that can give a conclusion that there would be lesser number of cars used by people .
The needs and dependence of people on cars as there means of transport will lead to raising there number and not declining it .
