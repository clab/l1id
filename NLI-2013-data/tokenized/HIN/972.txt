Having a broader knowlege of many academic subjects helps a person to have a wider information of the things present in the vast world that he is lives in .
It keeps him aware of the facts and helps him deal with problems with a wider perspection .

On the contrary , specializing in one subject on a particular area keeps him localized and makes him narrow minded .
Furthermore , it makes him lose the self confidence while dealing with situations that come to him unexpectedly .
He feels enclosed and lost in this world of varieties .

For instance , I have a friend whose mother is a teacher and has studied History , Geography and English .
When I see her deal with the problems related any of these fields with complete easiness , it makes me feel that she is very confident of herself in whatever she does .
While I also know another teacher who has specialized in biology and has confined herself to the world of biology alone .
I completely agreethat it defintely is a difficult task studying a specific subject alone and specializing in it , however the advantages my friend 's mother has over her is obviously more in number .

Receiving a broad knowledge on a variety of topics does not mean specializing in it on studying for it .
It can also be achieved by mere reading .
This is one reason why we are adviced to read newspapers .
It helps us keep ourselves up dated with the incidents happening around us in this world .
Reading books or magazines or any piece of article for that matter doea not go vain .

Schools and colleges also include a variety of subjects for the students in their academic programs in order to make them self confident and train them to face the hardships and obstacles they will come across in their future life .

I stongly feel that having a broader knowledge of many academic subjects is definitely more advantageous than the specializing in only one subject .
It makes a person strong and helps him live in this challenging world with full confidence .
