I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I believe that there is no requirement of an age for people to enjoy their life .
I do not claim that young people do not enjoy their life , instead older people do too .

Those who support this statement would say that when people get old , their enthusiasm dies and due to old age health problems set in .
But I would say that once we are old and free from the daily work schedule we actually get time for ourselves , your families , and our friends .
It gives us the time to pursue our hobbies or passions which we could not attend to when we are busy earning money .
We enjoy our grandchildren more than we might have enjoyed our children .
We have the time to take care of our health , which we probably neglected when we were young and busy with work .
We are more mature and more tolerant due to our experiences , and things do n't affect us as much as they did when we were not so understanding in our youth .
We enjoy our hard earned money after working during all our youth .
We have the time to go for holidays with family and see the world which we did n't see earlier due to lack of time .
In youth due to lack of time we miss out on a lot of things which we can come back to later in our old age .
In our youth , we are immature and things that we enjoy are more materialistic .
Whereas , in our old age , having known the world and become wiser we know that true happiness lies in being a good human and being content with what we have .

Old age brings with it , a lot of good things besides a few bad ones , of course .
But being old does not mean that one cannot enjoy it .
There is rarely a time in your life when you are fully content with the way it is going and when all is actually well .
It is all about the attitude that one should adopt to enjoy life not the age one has .
Old people enjoy life as much , maybe more , than young people .
