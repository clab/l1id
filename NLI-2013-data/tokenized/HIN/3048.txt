wisdom comes with age .
it does not matter whether you are old or young then .
but fun or adventure and excitement in life is explored to its zenith in the youth .
young people enjoy life more .

this could be debated on both sides of the wall , but the fact remains that the zest , enthusiasm , energy and vitality of youth allows more movement than does the jade , nostalgia or the knowledge of oldage .

young people have not seen life yet , they have not been there nor have they done it all , therefore their curiousity backs them in their fun intent .
while an old person will wait , watch , seek the pros and cons of his actions and then make a decided move .
spontainity is half the fun !

a young man , for example , could leave his studies , dip into a job and earn his bit for a while , since he may be single and not loaded with worldly responsibilities or that his partner and he have the capacity to work it out so that both of them can have some fun .
while and older man will weigh the repercusions of leaving his job for education or even in persuit of greener pastures because of his capacity and experiences that people have to face hardships unbearable at the loss of income or shift in earning to the lower end .

a youth , say in his early twenties , is capable of juggling an education and a career for himself , this is more difficult for an older person in may be his early thirties , and quite impossible for an even older person in his late fifties or early sixties .
this young man , in throes of love may even leave his job to go out with his mate , but to expect such an action from an older man is something of dreams .

a young woman , that is why , makes a better more attentive , responsive and active mother than an older woman .
it is besides the point that an older woman may find it hard to bear a child , but even child bearing is a part of youth full fun .
bringing up children is as much as a job as it is fun - seing what you have almost created grow and florish before you is a pleasure quite different from the one that grandparents derive .

a person in her youth may confidently go bunjee jumping , paragliding or even white water refting , something that and older person would have to get medical checkups done for !

thus it is quite apparent that younger people do have more fun , but it does not imply that older people cant .
its just that their taste in fun differs at thier age .
