As the maxim stands `` Nothing succeeds like success '' , holds true in either case , whether an individual takes risk and becomes successful or he does not take risk and still turns out out to be successful .
In my opinion , success is about taking risks and rather than only doing what they already know .
Thus , I agree to the given statement .

In my opinion people do become successful even when they adopt the old opinion but by doing that , ther are not the leaders in the society but followers .
For example , a company X opened chain resturants and decided to franchise its resturants .
The company X was successfull .
Company Y decides to follow the the foot prints of Company X and did not try anything different .
Company Y may be successful in the long run but may not a leader while as company X is a leader and other organisations will follow him .
Same is true with the individuals .

Secondly , by not taking risks , people always live in shells .
They lack creativity to do some thing different and their potential as an individual is not absolutely harnassed .
Take the example of director Steven Speilsberg .
When he was working on his movie `` Titanic '' , most people though he was doing impossible and would not succeed .
We all know what happened after that .

Changes in any field are inevitable .
An individual who is stuck to his old thoughts and do only that what he / she knows , may not respond in an optimum way when changes warrant different .
The individual may not be able to cope to the changes and thus may turn out to be a failure .

Last but not the least , the success involved in trying new things and taking risk is fast .
An individual may be successful in trying only what they already know but it may involve lot of time .
If the individual wants the output to be positive and quick , he may need to take risk at any stage of life .

To conclude , risk taking ability is an essential quality of an individual to succeed .
Howver , he or she should not get carried away with the amount of risk one is taking .
They should measure the risk benefit ratio before taking risk and thus finally decide if it is worth it to take the risk to be successful .
