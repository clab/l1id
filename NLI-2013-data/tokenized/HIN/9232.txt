Student are teach how to think but not what to think .
Yes i totally agreewith the statement that the student have to understand the ideas and the concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Till the time student wont understand the subject and wht he is studying that subject it is waste for any teacher to teach that subject to a student .

Thing which are byhearted can slip from the mind is very easy but the thing or the subject whcih is explained to student and telling what is the concept and the idea behind the subject then that is sure that will stay for longer time in student mind .
many Many of us follow that same concepts to explain the student then ask him to learn on there own .
the ideas and cencepts is not all time understand by student by him self but he or she need some one to guide and to expalin the concepts .

There is a small example to support my answer , the are two student one is studying on it own means not attending the class but by hearting the sybluses and the other who is attending the class revesing only once .
so who is better well i feel the person who is attending the class and reading one then the person who is reading many times but not understanding the fact and the ideas may be he will gain more marks in the exam comparing to other one but later the will be diffrent .
because in college u go to learn how to think but not for what to think .

So i will like to conclude the topic by saying that every one science or about space or of any subject but at tne end there r only few who pursued the career in that feilf there r many who dont have to do any thing with that but they learn about that but the school are made the student to think about the concept and the ideas
