Many people might think that travelling in a group is not a good idea , however I think travelling wih alot of people with a tour guide is the efficient way to travel .
It has so many benifits .

First , With the tour guide you can see more places .
Tourist guides are trained , and has knowledge about that place .
He can show many places , however if we want to travel alone then we may not see so many places .

Second , If we tour with travel guide then we spend less time .
When we travel , we donot want to spend more more time .
The tour guide can show so many places in very less time , whereas if we try to see by ourself then we have to spend more time because we donot know about that particular place .

Third , With tourist guide we can save money .
In new place we donot know the people .
They can cheat us .
We may have to spend alot of money if we want to buy any thing .
because we donot know the price .
Shopping can be very difficult without a touring guide .
The guide can take us to the cheper places , and we can save money on shopping .
We can go to the nice hotel with help of the guide and spend less money .

Finall , If we take tourist guide with us during our travel Then we learn more about culture of that place .
The culture of the place is very important that tells alot about that place .
If we donot have the guide with us then It willbe difficult to about culture of that place .

In conclusion , We can agree that having the tuor guide with group is the better than tourig alone .
Tuorist guide can show us more pleace in lesstime and we can learn alot about culture of that place .
