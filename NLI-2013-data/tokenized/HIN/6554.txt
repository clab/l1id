Worlds resources are ending fast today .
Resources like oil , natural Gas which are major fuel to the modern car are limeted sources of energy .
Therefore I agree that in couple of decades , there will be fewer cars in use than they are today .

With the effect of industrialisation in past two centuries the cultures have markedly changed , more ease in life , more amenities easy communication and travelling .
But all of these on the cost of fuels , which are rapidly eaten up as time progressed .

Main fuels that are used in cars are gasoline , deisel , natural gas etc .
These fuels scarcity has been now realized .
They are hinted by the recent hike in oil prices all over the world .
Major gulf countries , which are abundant in oil fields are now increasing prices because of its growing demand considering its availability .

Solar cars are the good option to secure our future .
But these source of energy is very inefficient and less productive than existing oil and natural gas fuels .
Electric Car may sound good which uses battery to run the car and is supposed to replace future cars .
But these batteries are to recharged again and again by electricity .
Now , from where the electricity comes .
It is made by utilizing coal in thermal powerplants , from hydal powerplant and nuclear power plants .
But since most of the powerplant in the world are Thermal Powerplants , which depands on coal and also a limited resource .
It will probably be over in future .
These fact also aggrevates the fact of availability of fewer car in future .

Hence it is the hightime that scientist today should find out the alternative ways to replace the existing fuels which are limited or face the bitter consequences of future .
Where the cars on road wil become history .
