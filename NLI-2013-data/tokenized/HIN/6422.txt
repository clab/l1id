In my opinion in th coming years there will fewr cars left in th country side as it is today .
There are many reasons , it is realy unsafe to walk on the road .
The polution level is increasing , it diffcult to live in metropoliton cities .

Firstly , as the popullation of the countris is increasing so ther is much less space is required to built up the roads , which cause the people to send lot of time on the stops for green signal .
As the time important key for each and every one people use to travel shortest distance on bicycle .

Secondly , the fossil feuls are depleating , which is only the fuel for the cars .
In the coming years when it will be finished that bring hault of the cars .
As the cars are generating to much noise and air pollution , the will harder there rule in the future which will decrease the number of vehicles in the future .
In my opinion awareness must be brought in the people mind to make less use of cars as tey are threat to the society .

Thirdly , the public transport is much convinent and cheap for the people to travel .
The metros are the best example to trvel within the city .
In the coming years , the government will prefer to spend on researches which give benifit to the whole society not to the specific class of people .

In conclusion , i want to say that it might be possible that the public tranport take the place of cars .
It may be possible that in the coming future be may trvel the longr distancs through the aeroplane .
As the chance of accidents are increacing the people may prefer public transport than the private cars .
Or scienties found air as the safer way to travel people may have another means of transportation .
