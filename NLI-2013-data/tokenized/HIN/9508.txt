I agree that it is more important and beneficial for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
This is because it is basically the ideas and concepts that lead us to various facts .
Ideas and concepts form the basis of all the learning .
Concept defines the rules and regulations assosciated with a certain term .
If an individual is clear with his concepts , he can understand everything related to that concept .
For example , if a person 's english grammar concepts are clear , then he can understand and write any of the views expressed in English language easily .

Idea is basically a motive behind doing of a certain thing .
Whatever , we do , we do it with some idea at the back of our mind .
For example , if a person is pursuing a management course , he is pursuing it with the idea that a management course will provide him a wide variety of oppurtunities in his career .
Similarly , various ideas form the basis of our different actions i.e drinking water to quench our thirst , eating food to satisfy our hunger .
If a person understand the basic idea behind any task , he will be able to comprehend the implication of that task completely .

Facts are normally stated .
They are the outcome of various observations and experiments performed under certain conditions .
But facts do not always depict truth .
They may be true in one sense but they might be wrong in some other sense .
For example .
if an observation states that a particular type of technology is the most sophisticated technology in its field , this might be true for some but for some whose parameters of observation differs from the parameters of earlier observation might not think so .
Moreover , facts can be altered to meet certain specific objectives .

Hence , I believe that it is more important and essential for students to get hold of ideas and concepts rather than cramming facts .
Understanding ideas and concepts will help them think more logically and practically .
Facts might mislead them but concepts and ideas will always lead them to a logical path .
Understanding of ideas and concepts makes individual 's thought process more effective and efficient .
