It my belife that whole purpose of education is to train the mind to appreciate , comprehend and eventually implement new ideas and thoughts that come along through the course of one 's life .
Hence , it is essentail not only to understand ideas but to have a will to try and understand ideas .

Unfortunately , we now live in the `` techno-age '' , where is it prime only to deliver , irrespective of how you got to the end result .
Results are of paramount importance as people and businesses have lesser time to spare on details and subtleties .
However , to deliver results effectively and efficiently is it important to know the facts , and to know them well .

Let me try and demonstrate this using the following example .
A students sits-up all night studying for an exam on the ` Indian struggle for Freedom ' .
She feels passionately for the subject , understands the emotions at play and reasons due to which one event led to another .
But , on the day of her exam , she is stunned when she looks at the question paper .
She has been asked questions requirring her to state dates of important events and names of revolutionaries .
She however , was so mesmerized by the determination of the revolutionaries , that she forgot to memorize their names !
Now , although she maybe able describe the freedom struggle as a story , her description will be inaccurate , leading to a low score on the paper .

In conclusion , I 'd like to say that , although learning facts can be as or more difficult than understanding ideas , it is important to be able to do both .
I will go a step further and say that , today everyone is expected to understand ideas and concepts .
What differentiates a winning student from the others is the knowledge of hard facts and a knowledge of how to implement them .
