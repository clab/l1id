The issue at hand is whether the number of cars in use will reduce , as compared to today , over the next twenty years .
According to me , this statement is not in harmony with my thoughts .
I think that the number of cars in use will , infact , increase over the next twenty years .

Firstly , using a car adds upto the convenience of an individual .
It reduces the travel time , that is , one can reach his destination earlier in a car .
It also gives comfort to a person during his travel , not stressing him out because the journey .
So , people will think of buying cars rather than wasting time and getting stressed out because of the journey .
This will lead to a considerable increase in the number of cars in use .

Secondly , having a car also adds up to the status of an individual .
Most of the people predict an individual 's personality by looking at the car he drives , that is , the car speaks for the man .
As years pass by , the physical appearance of the car will become more and more attractive , thereby hypnotising people .
This will help an individual to show of his personality by purchasing an appropriate car .
So , people will prefer to buy cars over years in order to create a distinctive appeal over other people .

Thirdly , considering the advancements in vehicle techology , it has become easy for an individual to afford a car .
The modern technology and innovations have brought down the car prices considerably , which now provides an opportunity to the bourgeis class of people to afford a car .
As , we know the major part of the world 's population comprises of the middle class , I think , this will considerably account in increase in the number of cars over the next twenty years .
Also , the recent technology has increased the efficiency of a car to run more miles on comparatively less number of gallons of fuel , that has attracted a lot customers which will again account in the increase in the number of cars in the next twenty years .

Finally , I conclude by saying that , as long as technology and human desire exist the number of cars in use will keep on increasing over time .
