If one had to ask me , I personally agree to the following statement .
In todays new world where students are competing with each other , where education has become a prime necessity and not just a mere hobby we often hear students having endless conversations about the assigments they need to submit or the tests that are coming up .
Each one having a goal to strive towards .
With more time for work and less for play we hardly find young people sacrificing some of their time to their communities .
community services hold little value to many youngsters in todays world of technology , the modesty that we would find in youngsters of the previous decade is absent .

On the other hand we still find youngsters making an attempt to find time for their community , to selflessly devote some of their valuable time to the helpless people of their community and to help interact with them , to help bring a smile to their faces .
When compared to the number of students that help their community , the number of students that dont outcast them however , there is still room for improvement , every cloud has a silver lining and therefore i can say that maybe in the near future some improvement might be made , however we notice that as the years are passing we tend to see more people involved with their materialistic world leaving no or less time for the helpless .

A good example would be myself , i start every month with an intention to help atleast one person i know in my community , to help bring a smile to atleast one persons face but the month flies by and before i know it the next month has started with exactly the same intentions but no progress .
The drive that we students have towards our education results in a fall back when it comes to serving our community .
Our weekends are used up in completing unfinished assignments and relaxing ourself from the tired week that just went by and therefore i personally feel that in todays world very few young people devote a good amount of time helping their community .
