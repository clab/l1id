I disagree with the statement that twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Nowadays people are realising the benefits that the automobiles provide to people .
Its more convienient to travel by a car than by other means of transport as cars provide us with a sort of freedom that we do n't get from other maens of transport And since the economy is improving more and more people can afford to buy cars .
This will lead to an increase in the number of cars in the near future as m Nowdays the automobile companies provide variety of comforts with the car and hence make travelling more fun in the car .
and thse comforts will only increase as the time goes on .

The safety standards of the car is also being steadily improved upon thus making a car journey much more safer .
The safety standars can only improve with time thus making cars much more safer than other means of transport .

Moreover it is easier to buy a car nowdays with the reduction in prices and the variety which is available .
and a few year from now we will see more variety thus prompting people to discard their old cars and buy a new one .

Also the one thing that will never go away is the enjoyment one gets while driving a car .
This will never go away and will make people buy cars .
Then their is the reason of economic superiority that we humans tend to show which make people buy many cars .
Thus all these reasons suggest that their will never be a reduction in the demands of car and hence we will see more and more cars on the roads few years from now .
