Twenty years from now , i feel that there would be fewer cars in use than there are today .

I personally feel that owning a car is a choice between the question of need and question of luxury .
For most people now a days owning a car is no longer a luxury .
With all sorts of loans and easy installments that have sprouted out of nowhere a common man can easily afford a car .
But the question here is , is it really neccessary that we own a car ?
In India atleast the answer is a yes .
With the unreliability of the public transport systems , and unaccessibilty of some regions by public transports it becomes neccessary to have your mode of transport .
But with the dawn of a new IT era and hence the looking up of the brighter prospectives of the Indian economy , the question of need is slowly diminishing .
Public transport has come back in its new and improved form , be it the local buses or the metros and it is even accessible in the remotest of the regions .
As for the choice of luxury , the ever increasing hikes i petrol prices due to limited access to the petrol reserves would limit it owning of cars to people who can really afford them , and not the general public .

Globally , the importance of pulic transportation has already been concieved of , and has been in practice for decades .
The modern generation being more aware of their environmetal issues of pollution and depleting fossil fuel reserves have aslo further established the need for better and efficient public systems , that would eventually cut out the depenency on personal vehicles for transportation .
Also with the decrease in fuel , the world all over is experiencing a hike in the prices of fuel which would make it more easier on the pockets of the common man if he used public transportation .
With the ever increasing awareness of the lack of fossil fuel supplies that run most of the automobiles combined with the fact that the emissions from automobiles constitutes a major reason for the increase in pollution in recent times , I feel that the people would start depending on public transport instead of their personal vehicles .

Even though the possibilty of using alternate sources of fuel in the near future exists , its not going to come easy .
The expenses for the use of such fuels would perhaps be as expensive if not more than the fossil fuels , not including the added expenses of manufacturing automobiles that can run on such fuels .
The viable solution to this would be , as I feel , is to rely on the public transport , as it would prove to be more economically viable .

The mode of transport for in the future as I see it is public transportation , which is not only fast but more economically and environmentally viable .
Hence with the increase in the technological advacement of the system cars with would be a thing of the past .
