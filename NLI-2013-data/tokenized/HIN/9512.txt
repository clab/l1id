knowledge of the student determines his abilities .
sharp ides can interrupt in the students mind if he or she is strong in concepts .
students thinkin ability has to be fast , sharp , innovative.a good student is one who can resolve the issue in quick n better way .

The way a student approches the task is also important , it can b done in two ways , analytical way n the other is fact way .
It is very important for the student to try to think in different possible ways he can .
if the student has gone throuh the concepts in the tradionanl way then his approch will be narrow so i prefer the analytical understanding rather than facts way .

Innovative ideas leads to success in a short period of time .
concepts of the subjet can help the student in many ways to resolve the problem .
but facts also play an imprtant role , if the student is not aware of the facts of the topic he is dealing in then he might not be able to solve the issue .
SO a student shuld first go through the facts and then try to think over them in an analytical way .

Considering a the fact that i hav seen my Senior design a 4 stroke engine in the college science carnival .
he was not a brilliant person in the class but when it came to the practical section he was awsome .
wen he was rewarded for his work he ststed that his area of interest was design , which always was foccused and innovative .
ho was very clear in his concepts , which ultimately lead him to success .
So i prefer firstly to know the facts and then to analyize those facts in an analytical way for success. a combination of both will lead to success in a very short time .
