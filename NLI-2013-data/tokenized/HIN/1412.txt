Quite often management gurus thrust an age old aphorism , `` It 's better to be a jack of all trades , than a master of one '' .
Ofcourse , specialization is indeed beneficial , however , what 's needed to succeed in this cut-throat competitive world is not just depth but breadth of knowledge .
From my perspective , a broader knowledge base of many subjects is what I call for and agree with the statement .

If seen in the corporate context , a typical manager is required to know not just about his immediate area of interest or work , but also about the work assigned to colleagues and sub-ordinates alike .
For example , a building contractor , today is not just responsible for overseeing the construction part but also various other aspects such as dealing with artisans , wood craftsmen , masons , architect and many other such people , so as to accomplish the set goals wihin the stipulated timeframe .
Moreover , today students at school are taught how to balance their academic and co-curricular activities .
Why ?
Because , this inevitably involves growth and development and better and broader learning opportunities .

Gone are the times , when parents insited their kids on becoming a gynaecologist or a paediatrist or an optometrist and started grooming them at a very young age .
Medicals schools today churn out more general physicians than cardiologists and experts in other medical fields .
Admittedly , specialization in such fields in the form of Masters is indeed imperative , however , that happens mostly for a purpose of a job or a career to start with .

Furthermore , as people grow , learn and develop , a variety of skills will be needed to cope with abundant and rapidly changing knowledege and information , especially in this information age .

A broader skill base , is what even professional organizations ask for .
For them , it 's all a win-win situation in terms of more skills , responsibility and work load in the same cost as for a specialized person .
A CEO or an entrepreneur would n't have been what they are if they concentrated just on their area of expertise .
They are master strategists , skilled in various business aspects - finance , accounts , engineering , general management ( a course quite popular in B-schools ) .

In sum , a general perspective and view of things and subjects is required in current scenario .
People with broad knowledge are more likely to succeed than the ones with a specialization .
