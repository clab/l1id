I strongly believe that it is crutial for students to learn and undertsand ideas and concepts than to blindly learn facts .
It is important to do so as it is neccessary for a person to undertsand information before applying it .
Many a time we will encounter situations in our lives where we may need to apply concepts or facts that we know .

Information that cannot be applied when needed is completely useless to us .
It is very easy for people to learn and memorize facts , but if they do not understand what they memorized , information that they just absorbed will prove to be completely useless to them .
For example , if a student learns a basic concept required to apply in a simple problem of mathematics , he or she cannot use the information they learned in order to solve a more complex problem of the same kind since they never were able to understand the main concept behind it .
If a person just learns facts , he or she is not excercising their ability to question .
Questioning is a very important aspect in learning .

If people do not question , it is very difficult for them to develop intellectually .
As questioning leads to reasoning and without reasoning one can not understand facts .
If we learn facts blindly , we are not applying the potential within is .
This may cripple our ability to advance .
There will not be any difference among humans and computers , except that we perform human functions such as breathing and eating and they do not .
After all , computers were created to learn , not think .
Facts are inputed in them , they do not have the ability to understand concepts .
We created computers because we understood concepts and idea , we can not advance if we stop taking advantage of our abilty to understand and reason .
