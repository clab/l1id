I do agree that the advertisements makes products seem much better than they really are .
Infact it is a art that has developed with new era and new technology .
It is a means of atrracting their costumers to buy their product .

Advertising industry has grown for decades and still growing today .
With the invention of computers grafics any product in the market can be made very beautiful and irresistable .
The advertisement is eye catching and it gets registered into your mind .
So when you go to the market , even if the product is not useful , you end up buying it only because the beautiful side of the product has been inculcated into your mind .

Lets take an example of a perfume .
In the advertise the perfume bottle was in a shape of a lady and it was being used by Jenifer Aniston .
T hat had registerd into my mind and i was wanting tho buy the perfume for a long time .
One fine day I finall got a cance to go buy it .
The price of the perfume was unbelievable , it was so expensive .
But i wanted it at the image of Jenifer holding the bottle just di n't go out of my mind , and guess what ?
I finally ended up buying it .
Even today I regret to the purchase that I made that day as till today the perfume bottle is only half used as I no more like its smell .
But that was a lesson for me , and today I keep control on myself and donat get waved away by such fantasies created by the advertisements .

I realize that I am not the only one , there are millions of people who has had this kind of experience .
But the key thing to ask is , do these people realise how they are trapped by the advertisement industry .
I guess there would n't even be 1 % of the entire crowd who understands this strategy used by the advertisement agencies .

This is one of the major reasons for the fast growth of the advertising companies .
But ` yes ' I do agree to the fact that the advertising agencies are doing a very good job and has a great effect on people 's mind .
