As the countries of the world progress into the 21st century , the ever-increasing complexities have yet again slapped the question of time-management on the face youngsters today .
However , I feel the young people of this century have responded splendidly by ensuring enough time for all activities .

The youngster 's of today are vibrant , dynamic , filled with an ever-increasing enthusiam to perform , achieve , aim high but in all this they still maintain their standards and attitude towards life .
Various qutodian examples of this can be citied from our society .
Renowed writer and Booker prize winner Arundithi Roy is a classical example of this .
She has not only helped in the cause of the ` Narmada Bacho Abhiyan ' ( for saving the river of Narmada in India from pollution etc . )
by preventing the formation of a dam that would have hampered the flora and the fauna of the region tremendously but has also added fuel to the fire by gainings wide-spread public sympathy and amenable opinion on this .

The founder of ` Microsoft ' ( the No1 software firm in the world ) , Bill Gates has contributed tremendously towards various social causes like building up Cancer hospitals , adopting entrie villages after the Tsunami earthquake and promoting education at all levels .
This would have definately required him to take out immense amount of time from his work and he stands as a perfect example with whom the youngsters of today relate .

A very qutodian example can be cited as that of my own society 's ` Help the Needy ' organisation of which I am an active member .
This voluntary organisation aims at heping not only those ( humans and animals ) who are needy but also aims at spreading similar feelings and enculcating in the youngster 's of today the very essence of helping their community .

At ground levels , it can be seen that the youngster of today are striving to help their communities and society as a whole by ensuring reforms are enacted and implemented correctly .
The youngsters today are intelligent and discerning and they know that by helping their communities and societies they are actually helping in making their own future better .
