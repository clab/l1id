I personally agree with the statement that `` It is important to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' . cause it is enough for a student to understand the ideas and concepts .
According to me , as a student , it is more important to have a clear idea and concepts of a topic rather than going for the facts .
The students should get a clear idea and grip on the topic so that he can know the things well .
students should first learn the things from their lecturers and then should have a knowledge on the particular subject , so gaining knowledge is really very important in building one 's carrier .
so the students should carefully follow the instructions given by the lecturer in order to understand all the concepts .

For example , when i was doing my 10th class , i was very much interested in learning the facts rather than the subject .
I allways use to spend time on finding out the facts and concentrated very less on the concept of the topic , as a result i got a poor grade in my acedemics .

so after this my teacher advised me to understand the ideas and the concepts than to understand the facts .
I followed the instructions given by the teacher , and performed very well in the next exams .

so its really important to have the knowledge of the subject than the knowledge of the facts .
so as i experienced personally , i can surely say that the student should have ideas and concepts of the topics .

Being a student its more than enough to get the knowledge of the particular subject , and under standing the concept of that particular subject than searching for facts ..
so , i personally feel as a student , that understanding the ideas and the concepts is more important than to learn the facts .
