The issue at hand is '' Do advertisements make products seem much better than what they really are ?
`` .
Yes , I strongly agree with the above point .
In today 's developing world media and advertisements do play in major role in enhancing the product .

Firstly the general public or the customers who are buying or going to buy a particular product are attracted by the advertisement of that product rather than the quality and the performance .
Advertisements are done with famous people which attracts many of their fan 's and they start using that particular product .
For example if a actor is using a particular brand of perfume then his/her fans do follow him without actually considering the quality .
In this way i feel most advertisements make product seem much better than what they really are .

Secondly most of the advertisements contains graphics and high resolution videos and images .
They are visually more appealing and attractive to look at .
Due to the use of multimedia technology more and more clients get attracted and buy the product instead going for their properties and long lasting nature .
For example in an advertisement its shown that a bicyle ( product ) collides with a bus and nothing happens to the bicycle which is not at all possible .
So again advertisements seemed to make products much better than what they really are in real life .

Thirdly advertisements lead to the increase in the sales of a particular product whether it is really good or not .
Many companies use advertisements to increase their sales of product .
Their main aim behind is to earn maximum profit .
Furthermore many of the firms use advertisements as an intelligent weapon to show superior features in their product when compared to the product of different firm , so that the customer is tempted to buy their product .
So i strongly feel that advertisements enhances the product than what really it is .
