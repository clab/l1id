Yes .
I do agree with this statement .
And the following explanations shall justify my stand .
Let us take a quick look at our past .
Ancient Socities took good care of thier communities .
They were forums , socities , co-operatives run by th people , for the people .
And what astonishes me is that even then they were run by the Youth .
And they had no financial incentive behind it .
they did it out of the goodness of their heart .
and while this does sound a little too model for today 's youth we must realize that therein lies the flaw .

Today its all about money and a cause .
The Cause that the we provide does n't cut it .
The Youth is seen vandalizing the cities .
Public Property is being abused and degarged as we speak .
Disrespect is the order of the day .
And while a few benevolent individuals come together to oppse this , they are persecuted for being too idealistic .
But this is what the Youth need. a push from the behind in the right direction .
Community Service was never meant to be a compulsion and it still is n't .
It will always be one of the best ways to give back to your comunity everything that it has so sparigly provided you .

Through Surveys and Statisitcs we have come to learn that although organizations have developed to promote such service and have intensive schemes to recruit the youth of today they seem to be falling drastically short of manpower .
Theu either dont get any youth at all , or the youth is severly disintrested at best .
in such a case even the organizations lose interest .
Are we willing to let go of Community Service as a whole .

One must consider the fact that maybe the youth just dont feel protective about their community .
Being Lethargic has become an integral part of who they are .
It 's not that they dont care , they just dont care enough .
and while they might attribute this lack of time to studies and other activities , we all know the cliched proverb ' Where there is a will there is a Way '' .
I believe that if this will can be intensively inculcated into Todays Youth , then all is not lost .

I once walked a little old lady across the street .
She did n't pay me any money .
All she said was `` Thank You , Son '' . and maybe thats enough .
That should drive the youth to help their comunity .
if they dont help the community they are part of , then who will .
eventually when they grow old and their community has fallen apart , will they look back and say `` its my fault '' .
I request every youh to do this think back your answer will define who you are ...
