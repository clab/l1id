Advertisements are the bread and butter of today 's commercial market and economy .
They can be best described as the `` necessary evil '' .
Although necessary , they can also contribute to waste of people 's money when they buy things they like on television but realize long after that the product is not at all satisfactory .

As an example , consider an advertisement of a depression medication .
If you watch it carefully you will notice that first it tells you all about its uses and good effects and then it tells you about all the numerous side-effects it can cause .
It is really interesting to note that the side-effects are mentioned really fast and can be overlooked .
And thats the way the advertisement is designed to be .
An advertisement is made to attract people toward the product and if such an advertisement is made for a non-prescription drug , a person may realize all the side-effects once they start using it .

A second example to emphasize the way advertisements can act as a blindfold for the customers , is the promotions for cosmetics .
The way cosmetics are shown to improve an individual 's comlexion and beauty by showing really pretty faces , the advertisements often fail to indicate that the brand being advertised may not suit every skin-type and may be harmful to someone 's genes , causing serious mutations leading to cancer .

But , inspite of these arguments about the way advertisemnts manipulate a customer 's mind , they do make us aware of all the new products in the market and normally if you see carefully an advertisement will definitely tell you all the positives and negatives about the product .
But somehow , it is the nature of human mind to absorb all the nice things , ignore the negativities while watching and then find someone else to blame for their ignorance .

Even though necessary , I still feel that advertisements do make the real product look much better than it actually is because of the way they are designed to take our minds off the problems about that product .
