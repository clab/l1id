`` Young people enjoy life more than older people . ''
That is a statement which I do not necessarily agree with , due to a variety of reasons based on the sheer wording of the statement , as wellas other issues like the current circumstances of individuals , their definition of `` enjoying life '' and what activities it involves .

The very first issue that needs to be addressed when discussing this statement is how we are to characterise the `` young people '' and the `` older people '' ?
Does young mean children , aged 1-12 while older is above that ?
Or does young include all pre-adults and older include those beyond 21 ?
The terms `` young '' and `` older '' are very subjective and therefore greatly limit the credibility of this statement .
In order to be as precise as possible , for the purposes of this response , let us assume that young people fall into the age bracket of one to twenty nine years of age , while older people are above thirty .

The pleasures involved with enjoying life for young and older people vary tremendously , based on the stage of life in which they are .
For instance , a child could derive immense pleasure from spending a day on the beach , simply building sand castles .
On the other hand , an older person could derive even more pleasure from driving a million dollar sportscar .
How can we measure the relative enjoyment received ?
Therefore , without being able to do so , it is impossible to make a claim that young people enjoy life more than older people .

It is possible to argue that in general , the pleasures of the young are more simple and pure as they tend to be carefree , with little responsibility , especially when compared to older people who probably have jobs to go to every morning and a family to support .
Looking at it from this angle makes it seem like young people have the better life .
However , another way to look at it is that at a younger age , people tend to have more restrictions placed on them , like parental rules , school codes etc , while adults or older people are free from such restrictions , to a certain extent , which gives them unlimited access to enjoyment .
Older people also tend to have stronger financial capabilities that enable them to enjoy many perks of life that youngsters do not have access to or cannot typically afford .

Therefore , for the above stated reasons , I cannot agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people because that involves having to make many assumptions which are unrealistic .
It all depends on the individual himself/herself , the circumstances in which they live , their likes , dislikes , their personality traits and so on .
A child could enjoy his life just as much as an fifty year old adult .
There is no limit that can control such a feeling and so agreeing with the statement is completely out of the question .
