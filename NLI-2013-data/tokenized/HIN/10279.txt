To be more successful in your life , you have to take a risk .
No matter how it cost and how it pay to you .
I think in your life you have to take risk to suceed some thing .
Life is all off risk , you dont know what is going to happened with you at time in your life .
So i am agree with this statement , which i want to express with supporting examples and reasons .

First example , Taking risk is noting but a part off the game , if you suceed then you wins if you did n't then you lost .
Consider and example off the Person who had just started his carrer in any field .
He is not paid good in his first job , If he get a chance to work in some other company where he could find a good salary and facilites , but he did't fine the job security in it .
well by taking a risk he will find a good paid job and facilites .

Second example , Mr billgates who is the richest man in the world , well he started his careerer in 90's .
After his first success off first operating system he did not stop and , done some other research in some other field like a programming field , at that time many company occupied their position in the programming field but he had taken a lot off risk and comes under the programming market and the also get success in that field .
In this way he holds many other fields and gets in to the bussiness very well .

Finally i think it is good to take a risk in you r life and in your growing futher , but you have to be careful by selection your important decision of life .
