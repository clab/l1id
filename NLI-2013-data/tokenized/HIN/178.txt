I disagree with the opinion that number of cars in use after 20 years will be less than what it is today .
Instead I believe that the number of cars in use will rise and will be much more than what it is today .
I have number of reasons to support my opinion .

The world population is growing at a high rate .
Since population and number of vehicles bear a direct correclation , I expect that with more people , more cars will be bought and used .
It may be argued that more population does not automatically mean more buying power .
But it should be noted the countries with high population such as India and China are experiencing high economic growth rates .
This means that progressively , more and more proportion of population will have better buying power .
This in turn means that there would be a bigger and bigger segment that will be able to afford cars and therefore buy cars .

The cost of producing cars is also declining .
Again with cheaper cars , there will be more people who will be able to afford cars and therefore buy them .
Besides with research in identifying cheaper energy alternatives to petrol , the cost of running car is also expected to come down which will further encourage people to buy cars .

The government spending on developing road infrastructure will also promote the car sales .
Governments tend to spend lesser on public transport as compared to constructing highways .
This indirectly promotes car sales as limited and congested public transport drives people to buy their own vehicle .
Hence more cars will be used to avoid the inconvinience caused by public transport .

Also there are social reasons leading to disintegration of joint families into unitary families .
Besides the women that were previously more confined to home are joining the work force and moving out .
This means that while previously one family of say 10 people could do with one or two cars , now a family of 5 needs two cars .
The continued disintegration and women moving out of home will therefore fuel car sales even further .

Besides , as humans get wealthier , they look for more convenient options .
It cannot be denied that car provides the flexibility to take you right through to the destination as opposed to public transport such as train and trams where a person needs to walk to a stop or station , board the train or tram , then get down at destination station and again walk to his final destination .
With more wealth , people will definitely demand more convenience and hence shift to cars .

For all the reasons above , I strongly feel that there would be more and more cars with every passing day .
Cars are today most flexible and convenient way to travel .
For number of cars to go down , there has be a even more convenient alternative .
Since I do not see any such alternative in next 20 or even 50 years , I see more and more cars hitting the road .
