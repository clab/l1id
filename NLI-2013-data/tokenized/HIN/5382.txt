In my my opinion i would agree that most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are .
There are many reasons and ways in which people can make low quality products look brilliant .
The main highlight which people see is the packaging of the product which can be excellent and also interesting also through tv and newspapers advertisements people give in easily without knowing the quality of the product just because they have seen or heard from their friends and neighbours .
A product which can be good for others need not be neccesarily be good for you because nowadys in the market there are more fake products then their original .
The choice is is yours whether you would be comfortable with the product and does it satisfy your needs it would be safe to buy form a store where there are more customers which shows the market value .

.

I would also disagree for the following reasons .
first , a new product which comes in the market may look bad but can also turn out to be excellent Eg-A new shampoo which your friend has used caused her hair to have split ends this may not be neccesarily happen to you you may have a better reaction to this product like even for perfumes you either like the smell or you dont .
Mainly advertisements are the best technique to sell a product and a good way to get recognized in the market .
other methods also include selling the product through door to door selling .
People in the world believe many advertisements which come in magazines or newspapers Eg-For a fitness Program medicines there are many frauds in the market selling fake medicines instead of the original and these cause people to destroy their lives due to the expenses and uncertainity of the item .

i have dicussed both opinions why advertisements can be dangerous and brutal to your pocket if u do not pay attention from which shop the product is sold and whats the market demand .
But i would say that there are more frauds out there then salesmans .
