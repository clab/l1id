Technology has revolutionized our lives i.e. the way we live , the way be preceive ..
Everything has changed with the advent of modern innovations .
We have become accustomed to this technology in our everyday lives be it a referigerator , washing machine , radio etc .
In fact it is impossible to think life without these things .
Modern technology has given us pace .
It has developed modern means of transport for fast movement .
The cars , trains and areoplanes etc all are gifts of technology Cars .
This is a quite familiar name in day to day life .
In fact every middle class home owns atleast one car , Car has become more of a necessity in today 's life .
Moreover , to a some degree it also has become a sort of status commodity .
But that does not hide the imprtance of cars in in our day to day life .
In life where time is everything cars are one of the fastest means of transport .
Cars are required at family outings .
Thus car is an indispensable part of our day to day life .

But , although technology has aided us , it is also leading to dangerous results .
Take for an instance , technology has made living more comfortable resulting in decline in health problems and cosequently increase in population .
Thus this large population is a large pressure on our resources .
Our oil resources are depleting at a rapid rate and perhaps be exhausted in another thirty years or so .

With their exhaustion , cars , which run on petrol , will be of no use to us Thus declining resources has forced us to look for alternatives which employ better utilization of these resources .
Thus the railways , trams come into picture .
In fact twenty years will now , there will be fewer cars in use then there are today .
With the scarcity of petroleum products , it would become quite difficult to afford a car at that time .
The people will go for cheaper means of transport .

Now a days people has become aware of this thing and already have started using public transport more often .
Thus the car purchase has fallen .
In twenty years time the existing cars would be disposed off due to the finishing of their utilization period .
This will also see an decline in number of cars .

Thus it has been clearly proved in the passage that with declining petroleum products , car quantities would fall in the time period to come
