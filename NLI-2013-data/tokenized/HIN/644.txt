During our last few school years , we are faced with choosing subjects which we would like to specialise in , in the future .
Some students choose a small number , while others take almost as many as possible .
The student with the more subjects will be more skilled than the other , and will have better career opportunities later on .

When one specialises in one specific subject , he or she can excel at it perfectly .
This can benefit us in many ways .
For example , if a person is so good at something , he or she will be so skilled , and will be able to perform the task successfully and efficiently , saving time and energy .

On the other hand , when specialising in only one particular subject , we are limiting ourselves and are unable to reach our full potential .
Having a broader knowledge of many academic subjects is more useful than excelling in just one , as not only does it give you more skills , it also increases your chance of success in the future .

Think about it logically ; would you rather employ someone who can only perform one task , than employ someone who can perform dozens ?
I would choose the latter .
Studying a variation of subjects also keeps us more fulfilled , and less bored .
If you studied the same subject over and over again , for a vast period of time , you would get extremely weary of the subject , and therefore would make it seem very uninteresting .

You are given so many opportunities in this life , so what is the point of wasting them .
You must always strive for the best and want to learn more .
Why limit yourself to just one thing ?
Although sometimes it is useful to excel at something , I disagree with the statement ` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . '
