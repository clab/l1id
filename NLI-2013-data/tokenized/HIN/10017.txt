`` { Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well } ''

Suceesful people are those who gain fame , prosperity in their lives and they are know for their work globally .
I do agree with this statement as people who are sucessful for instance taking an example of the richest man in India , like Reliance Anil Ambani. , has always tried out new things in his buisness , his father was into shares but he expanded his buisness by establishing a buisness in internets , mobile phones , this made him in to a very rich man , and subsequently he is investing his money in oil companies like Cheveron worldwide .

Now take another example of another buisness tycoon , say Ratan Tata in India again , he has always been in the steel buisness and I do say he has done good in his carrer but again to compare Relliance is far mor ahead tha Tata .

Lets see another example ,, Laxmi Mital had started his carrer with a small company but since he did try out new ways , today he is the world 's richest man .
A successful person would like to explore new ideas and work accordingly , this helps him to gain recognization globally .
he would like to expand his buisness in various fields and for this if he needs to invest in new projects , he would never hesitate .

I believe destiny also plays a major role in a man 's carrer , if for example the man was very well doing in his past years but now he is facing major downfalls , this can be due to his hard luck. , as he is the same man who was once a upon a time a very successful person but now he is no where .

If people stop trying new thins and work only on what they have been doing then our nation or say any country would never progress .
they would be at one point only , but with risk and challenges we are able to get things which we could never imagine before .

Considering another example , even the President of a country comes of with ideas which sometimes are benefical to the nation , and if he didnot the nation would never move ahead .

People inorder to progress have to take such challenges in lifes and face inorder to move forward .
To conclude I do agree and truly belive that for being a successful person , one needs to try new thing and take risks .
