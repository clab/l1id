Now a days young people are more occupied with their needs and wants .
They usually get less time to serve for their community .

Individualism is spreading across the globe and youngsters are getting most affected by it .
They are becoming more selfish and care about only few people around them .
This makes them indifferent to the problems of the community .
The needs and wants of the young people are increasing at a very high rate .
Thus , they spend less time doing community work .
The high level expectations of youngsters out of themselves make them study and work harder .
This leaves them with less time to help others .

Though the young people are getting more conscious about their enviornment and people around them , they consider the problems associated with the community and the enviornment less important than their own problems .
They consider personal enjoyment more important than societal development .
This can be seen by example of lesser number of younsters who go for social service than number of youngsters who party quite often or study more .

In some segment of society , young people now are more distracted by the modernization of the society .
They prefer to go to a party or hang out with friends as compared to help their parents in their work .
In other segment of the society , the decrease in concern for the community is also due to increased pressure from their parents .
Now parents are more concerned about future of their children and thus nurture them to study and work for more hours .
This results in less interaction of the children with the society and hence , less concern for the community .
The pressure from the society and parents make them introvert and selfish .

But sometimes the youngsters do help their communities by inventing new things and implementing new ideas .
For example , some young scientist may invent a machine which can efficiently remove hazardous materials from water in lesser cost .
This invention does help society .

Youngsters now a days do not help their communities much .
Instead they prefer either to party or study .
They have developed selfish attitude .
Though in some cases they help their communities indirectly by their inventions , but that happens occassionally .
