Well history has given enough examples that successfull people try new things and take risks rather than doing the same thing .
I strongly beleive in that .
I have good experince about that i worked six years steadly working in a same manner as like other in my medical proffession but than after i shiffted to new research based studies and that helped me greatly in improving my knowledge and offcourse my life and above that patient life .
I still remember when i discovered new method of treatment how dramatically the results i got but i have taken risk , I left my job for a year and did research on very minute things and definetly thats pay me alot .

As it is mention in history the great `` COLOMBUS `` found the west indies by doing different , like great scientist `` GALLELIO '' who is the first person to say that earth is round like a ball .
So it is like cristal clear that if some one want to become a successfull person he / she has to do something new .
Today is a world of competetion or we can say that `` SURVIVAL OF THE FITEST '' .
one should do some thing different from another .

Today world is going into new directions we are exploring in technology , in space , under the earth its only because of those successfull person who did something different .
Think if we would n't has done these different things in life we wiol probably would be same as animals no inventions no light no telephones .
today we cannot imagine the world wiyhout theses wonderfull objects .

In the end i would reccomend that every man who want tobe successful in life should think differently and do thIng differents but only and only for improving a man kind and its nature only than a one will be remember you a greatt successfull person .
