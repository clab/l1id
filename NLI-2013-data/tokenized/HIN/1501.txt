It will be unfair to be on either side of this statement , as both are good in their own context and usage .
But , in order to take one option , I will go with having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject .

As , we are living in a fast paced world where information is passed at high rate and we are rapidly becoming a residant of a global village .
I am sure that a person with just a specialized know how of creating new toys for children will not be able to go far if he do n't posses good marketing skills too or a comapny like TOYATA would have not been so succesfull if it had not able to match its supply and demand , ofcourse simeltaneously .
For another example even in one of the most specialized occupation , military it is essential even for a good and strong soldier to diversify himself and have a proper knowledge of his location with respect to his enemy which he can get with the help of new technologies like GPRS with a primary knowledge to fight and survive , its all about survival of the fittest .

It is also very risky for any individual to keep specializing in one field without knowing the scope and growth of that particular field .
It is after all the question of surviving in this highly competitve world .
Even to understand our own interests and strengths before specializing in any particular subject we need to diversify us into various academic or real life experiences and sometimes by even failing in few ventures where we are not strong .

So instead of keeping all my eggs in one basket I would rather go for various baskets before making the choice for the perfect one .
I would rather understand various academic subjects and will be in a position to effeciently corelate them and that will be more fruitful than specializing in one field .
