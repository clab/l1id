I disagree with the fact that in twenty years time there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Infact i believe that their numbers would have gone up ten times .
Cars have become the most basic and primary modes of transport in the world today .
From the time they were introduced until now , their numbers have gone up exponentially and there has been no decline in their sales .
Providing both riding comfort and safety , cars have become the basic necessity for all and for some it has evolved to become a fashion statement and an article of pride .

People now a days , are in the false belief that the use of cars might stop in future because the petroleum reserves are slowly getting exhausted .
But what they fail to realise that petroleum is no longer the only source of power that can drive the vehicle .
After years of research new technoligies have been devloped realising this danger Hybrid cars are already being produced and marketed .
So are electrically driven cars .

However some researchers are working on using hydrogen as a fuel .
Sucess in this will be the biggest break through ever in the field of automobile engineering .
Hydrogen is available is abundance and it also has a very high calorific value .
Thus capable of producing greater power than petrol driven vehicles .
In addition to this the problem of pollution is also solved as , the only exhaust that would come out of a hydrogen driven vehicle would be water .
Twenty years is a lot of time and by then this technology would have not only been tested but would be driving the entire world .

Seeing the latest innovations in this field , cars with better looks and aerodynamics are being manufactured .
In twenty years time concept cars , which have already taken a start , would be in full production .
Our world is full of people who admire beauty , safety , comfort and most of all technology .
Thus making cars not a curse of the past but refined gift for the future .
