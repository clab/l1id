i love to travel ...
and in my opinion travelling by yourself and by making your own plans one can enjoy better than travelling in a group led by the guide .
there are several advantages of doing so ...
first one can plan there trip for how many days they want to depending on the time they have available .
second they can decide how much time they want to spend in each of the places .
they can skip places they are interested to visit similarly they can spend more time in places of interest .
moreover if i am travelling by car i can enjoy the road side beauty of nature , i can stop and spend some time at the places i find attractive on my way .
there is noone to rush me ...
or my trip is not dependent on others .
certainly , if i want to leave a place in just few minutes i can even do that .
on the contrary , if you take a tour led by a guide i cant be my boss ...
i have to follow the tour schedule .
which would be very difficult for me as i am a very independent person .
