As soon as a child begins schooling he/she is taught to be creative , to think out of box , rather be unconventional at times , challenge the existing dogmas .
Perhaps these are the virtues that have helped mankind in the development of the world today .
These are also reflected in successful people .
They try new things , take risks and this is what makes them successful and different from the common man and perhaps I fully support the statement .

Imagine if people did not try new things and take risks , then would and new metal or perhaps discoveries by Madam Curie be possible .
Would America be discovered by columbus if he did not take the risk to venture out on a round the world trip .
Would we know of legends like Hercules , Achilles or Alexander if they did not take the risk of conquering the world .
Perhaps even today we would have thought that the earth is flat and not round , earth is the center of the universe and may be we would still be writing on leaves instead of paper .

Sucess cannot be quantified and what is success to one might be just an ordinary achievement for other .
To this critics might say that you should do your work with proper thought and achieve mastery in one expertise rather than be a master of all .
This what they would say that `` You should work on only what you know rather than take risks and try new things '' .
But in my opinion the answer to this is that , Would `` Microsoft '' be there where it is today if `` Bill Gates '' had not taken the risk and tried to be unconventional rather be submissive .
Also if we take the example of the field of medicine , then perhaps new discoveries would rather be impossible .
If our doctors had not taken the risk involved in organ transplantation , cancer research , or may be stem cell research then perhaps many people would have not been here today as they are because of them .

To this I may add that being foolhardy is also not advisable .
You should take risks only when you know that there is an element of success there .
Just trying to show off will not land you anywhere .
Therefore if i were to conclude then perhaps to be successfull you will have to try new things and be courageous to take risks but only when it is advisable and needed .
Imitating others might give you momentary success or may be even more but not the recognition wherein you will be remembered for something new .
