I agree with the statement `` It is more important for atudents to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' Here are a few ponits to impress upon this statement .
First , understanding the concept of a particular idea in a subject provides the student with a not only with clear and strong foundation in that particular subject matter but also enhances and expands their creative aptitude .

For example understanding the concept of the physical formula v = u + at ( where v = final velocity ; u = initial velocity ; a = acceleratoin and t = time ) allows the student to apply the formula to numerous problems in linear motion .
As such , the knowledge gained will allow the student to tackle the problem , however varied its presentation may be .

Secondly , in the feild of medicine , understanding the concept of the cell cycle and mechanisms of tumor spread allows doctors to apprppriately plan the best mode of treatment that they can give to their patients afflicted with cancer , such as radiotherapy , or cell-cycle specific/non-specific chemotherapy .

Also understanding of the concept is important in that knowing the concepts will in itself obviate the need to remember certain hard facts and figures .
For example , the value of `` Pi '' can be easily derived in problems ifd we remember that it is only the circumference of a circle divided by its diameter , rather than remembering all the digits .

To conclude , though facts are important in many ways such as historical dates and events , ( in such circumstances , they are unavoidable ) they are more cumbersome and less useful in lerning especially in the sciences .
Allowing the student to try and understand concepts and ideas will only help him expand his intellectual horizon and creativity as
