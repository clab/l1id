I strongly disagree with the statement that today 's youth does not spend enough time on helping the community .
The spirit of helping others , especially those who are in need , together with the sense of compassion , is not limited by age .
There are several organisations that are dedicated to hepling the community that are organised , managed and run by the youth alone .

A closer look at the records of voluntary community service in most American hospitals reveals the major portion of its participants to be in the 12 to 25 age category .
This could be attributed to the fact that younger people have a larger number of free hours to indulge in community service , compared to adults who have work and family responsibilities .

The recent tsunami on December 26th , 2004 , that wreaked havoc on the South East Asian coastline resulted in unprecedented death and destruction .
A large number of humanatarian organisations theat provided relief to the victims were youth and student organisations .
These international as well as local youth organisations campaigned to raise money and distributed relief material and compensation to the affected victims and also pitched into the rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts .

The United Nations has a special youth wing that holds an annual forum , providing a common platform for the youth to meet , discuss issues relevant to them and finally act on them .
Had young people nowadays not been interested in these causes , such an organasation would neither been endorsed nor been given assistance .
A peek into every activity involving community service , be it in donations for needy causes , rehabilitation of underpriviledged children or animal welfare , the youth is not just present : it is actively involved .

In conclusion , I would like to say that the young people of today have not lost their concern or forgotten their obligation to society .
They strive to put in as much time and effort as possible to the cause of upliftment of the society .
They do their bit and more to help their community and make the world a better place to live in .
