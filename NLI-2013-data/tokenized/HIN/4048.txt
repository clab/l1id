Communities have been there for the people themselves in making their lives easier .
During ancient times communities meant a lot to those ( people ) who belong to them .
Does the communities still have the same significanace in one 's life , now ?
Absolutely no , thats what that could be seen .
So obviously people are not giving enough time for them .

With the advent of industrialization people are getting more and more mechanical and self - involved than ever before .
Since nowadays they there are things which does n't need involvement .
For example if want to buy fruits , all you need to to is to go to supermarket and pay there and return back , but it was different earlier when people were using barter system there it required more interaction among people and consequently more interaction with the communities .

With the mechanical life people have comparatively very less time even for themselves and for their families so it is not surprising if they do not have a lot of time for their communities .

Industrialisation not only brought machanical life but also devaluation of the emotions .
People not only devalue the morals but also the significance of community ,

People now have more greed for money and less heed for the values .
All what people can do for their communities is donating money but it is not always the best way .
For example , in most of reputed colleges rich alumunis feel a sense of doing for the betterment of their communities by donating huge amount of money but sometimes it 's not the money but rather the need of their expertise , their experience etc , but unfortunately this all requires time which might not be available to them .

So , we can see that community 's significance has decreased , it could be accounted to the industrialization which made people 's life more individualized , paying more attention towards money than the rest with no time for community .
Therefore , one can be agreed with the statement that `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ''
