In todays modern and fast moving world , `` jack of all and master of none '' , dosnt work at all .
People needs to be more focussed on a subject or two , to really master it and become expert of it .
This , one subject appraoch , can help students to spend plenty of time to learn its basics clearly , during their early days .
It also helps them to stay more focussed on the suject of their liking .
Moreover , once they become a subject expert , they can really harness their mastery over the subject , by doing consultancy projects , which can help them build , a satisfactory and rewarding career .
On other hand , many subject approach , despite of small short term advantages has nothing much to offer in the students long term career .

First , to have a vast knowledge of many subjects , one needs to devote time for all for them , proportinally .
This is quite not possible in todays fast moving world , as students get limited time to study in thier busy routines .
On the other hand , having just one subject at their hands can really help them to spend plenty of time for preparing and building the basics of thier favourite subject .

Second , taking large number of subjects can be a big disturbance sometimes .
When somebody liks one particular subject the most , he or she doesnt have to spend unnecessary time in reading and understanding the other subjects .
In one subject appraoch , one can really concentrate and focus on one subject of his liking .
For example , if a student likes science more than the others , he can go really deep into it , instead if spending time in history or economics class .

Finally , having mastered one particular subject in great detail , make that person expert of it .
He or she can take up the job of consultancy later on in their life .
For example a person who is expert in fluid dynamics can help companies overcome their flow problems , using the vast knowledge he has gained in the subject .
As a result it can be really rewarding , as salaries of this people or so called subject experts will be sky high .
On the other hand as a jack of all and master of none kind of person , one can only do a superficial analysis of the problem , as he or she has limited knowledge of the subject .

To summarize , developing a specialization in one particular subject can be really intresting and exciting .
Students can save lots of their time in understanding their favourite subject instead of spending time on toatlly unrelated material .
Moreover , one subect appraoch helps a student to become a subject expert which can be again really rewarding and challenging experience .
