I completely agree with the statement telling us about how young people today do not give enough time to aid their communities .
I am going to use various examples to justify my opinion on this statement .

In olden times , people in some way or the other had to help their community in some way or the other as there was no other occupation other than agricultural occupations but as times have progresed , both chronologically and technologically , young people do not find it important to aid their communities .
People today have to be compelled to do something that will help their community , for example , schools today have community service as an essential part of their curriculum which is good as they are trying to instill values in their students but the question posed is whether the schools are successful in doing so or are students just doing it as a compulsion .

People today feel that helping their community is a waste of time and money in some cases but it is important for them to put themselves in the position and see the various kinds of sufferings people are going through .
For example , the youth of today has enough time to fit in time for computer games and movies in their schedules but they do not have the time and chivalry to go and help the lesser privilleged people in their community .

Some young people , who feel it is their duty to help their community , fear aiding their communities as they think they might be considered a social outcast and people might make fun or make a mockery of them because they are doing something ` uncool ' .

Through proper time management and a change in their outlook , the youth can make time in their schedules to help their communities and be of some positive use to society today .
