Knowledge is the key to success , is a saying which goes a long way .
Without knowledge we as humans are incomplete and not worth much .
Its knowledge which seperates a fool from a learned .
The most important form of knowledge in today 's world is academic knowledge .
Academis knowledge is what one needs today to make a stand in society .
Without academic knowledge one cannot go far in life .

I am personaly of the opinion that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in just one subject .
With the fast changing world its better to have broader perspectives and that includes broader knowledge in academic subjects .
I feel this way because in today 's fast changing and ever evolving world its better to have knowledge about more subjects that to be restricted to specific knowledge in just one subject .

Academic knowledge helps us choose the career we wish to pursue in life .
If we are versed with various types of subjects our choices are vast .
We are not limited to a particular subject and the few options available with it .
We have a kaliedoscope of choices to choose from since we are better equipped with more information about various subjects .
We have it in our hands to choose from those subjects which we were able to cope with or find interesting or feel an aptitude for .
Therby if we just specialise in a single academic subject we are limiting our own selves restricting our very own choices .

We also have the advantage that at any stage when we feel that a particular subject that we studied cannot be continued as a profession we can always fall back upon the other subjects we had studied and then adapt ourselves to our new career accordingly .
To know whats best for us we have to have knowledge about more than one subject .
Only if we study a subject will we know if we are mede for it or not or if we can apply it to our future or not .

And lastly i would like to mention that knowledge of every kind is useful .
The more you know the better equipped you are .
The variety of subjects you study the more aware you become and it hepls you improve and grow as a person .
If you stick to one particular subject it becomes monotonous and you tend to stagnate .
For a balanced overall development and approach toward life one needs to be oriented with a variety of subjects .
And therby i would like to end by saying that academic knowledge should always be welcome in variety and abundance and not restricted to a particular subject because the day the mind stops learning and gaining knowlegdge , it stops being alive .
