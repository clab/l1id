The statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do is a fairly debatable statement .
My opinion on the same is not in favour of the statement .
I am of the view that one cannot measure how much life can be enjoyed or life is being enjoyed by any one .
Some one appropriately said `` enjoyment is not a commodity , it is the excitement of life we all live for '' .
Enjoyment mean different things to different people , different peaople dirive enjoyment out of different things .
A younger person who is more outgoing enjoys by going partying or meeting people at social events .
A sports fan enjoys by watching his favourite team winning a championship .
A young girl enjoys shopping for hours with her friends , whereas an older person derives pleasure and enjoyment by wathcing his/her grandchildren playing in his/her lap or talking to his children about their successus or achievements .

Different people have different ways to enjoy life and everyone is entitled to this right .
So we cannot justify that older people do n't enjoy as much as younger people do .
Older people have their on ways to enjoy life equaly as much as younger people .
With age only the speed of ones life decreases but the spirit of life remains the same .
With age only the amount of activity decreases not the frequency of joyful moments .
This statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' in my opinion is a superstition .
One which should not be encouraged .

We should not forget that these very old people were once young themselves and enjoyed life the same way as younger people today .
The younger people of today will only realize that older people have different ways of enjoyment when they are in their shoes .
Untill we do n't experience the otherside ourselves we are cannot make a fair judgement .
