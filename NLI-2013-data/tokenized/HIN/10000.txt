I agree with the statement that successful people try new things instead of doing what they already know how to do well .
In today 's changing and competitive world , people who are not willing to try new innovative things will get left behind .
I cite the example of Microsoft Corporation as a company that has thrived because they were willing to take risks .
They took a contract to develop an operating system for IBM even when they had no product in hand .
After signing the contract , they found the appropriate piece of software called DOS , and developed it sufficiently to meet all the contract requrements of IBM .
If they had not taken that risk , who knows where that company would have been today .
They contrinued to take enormous monetary and other risks to develop all their subsequent products , especially MS Word , even when other word processing products like Word Perfect were more popular at the time .
By showing a desire to change and try new methods , Microsoft has reached the pinnacle of its glory in the PC business .
My personal experience in the field of engineering has led me to similar conclusions .
Our company stayed around 60 employees and grew at a 2-3 % growth rate for the 1st 35 years of existence .
However , the advent of another CEO changed the fortunes of the company .
After about 10 years since he took over , we now have about 400 employees and have more than quadrupled our revenue .
This happened because the new CEO expanded the business into other areas deemed risky like telecommunication , water resources and control solutions .
He even opened a `` build '' component to the original `` design '' organization , which was very risky because of many unknowns .
The `` build '' component of the company proved to be the biggest revenue grosser at the company .
Hence , because of the two examples provided above , I am convinced that most successful people try new things instead of just doing things they already know .
They may not always succeed , but as the saying goes , bigger the risk , bigger the benefit .
