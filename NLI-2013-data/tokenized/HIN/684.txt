The statement `` It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects thn to specialize in one specific subject '' is a debatable one .
On one hand , specialization in one subject makes individuals an authority over the subject .
Their expertise make them a trusted name in that field , gives them a great career and lead them towards great inventions or discoveries benefiting the humankind .
On the other hand , having broad knowledge on many subjects will make individuals develop wholesome appraoch towards a problem .
I will go with the first view , that is , it is better for an individual to have specialized knowledge .

Specialization leads to complete mastery over the subject .
It makes the efforts of the individuals completely focused which is very fundamental towards doing high quality research .
For example a student of history doing a research on the 19th century situation which led to industralization of a particular country will knwo doubt benefit from having a bit of knowleged about the way the machines work .
But in order to create a historical work he has to work in accordance to the principles of research in field of social sciences and not get diverted by going deep into unnecessary study of the technique of manufacturing a particualr product .
Thsi way he will not do jsutice to the historical problem which forms the bsis of the research .

It is specialization and not broad based studies of a variety of subjects that have led to great inventions and discoveries .
If Galileo was much botheres about the social , economic or political aspects of his research he would not have revolutionised the world of science with his celebrated inventiona nd exceptional discoveries .
If If adventurer Magellan would have gotten busy in studying the society and culture of each place that his ship landed to , he woudl not have achieved soem of the greatest landmarks in geographical discoveries .

Lastly , specialization improves the job prospects of an individual .
Most hig paying jobs require specialists and not the `` Jack of all trades and master of none '' . even in the business world one would trust a person who is a seasoned trader rather than a perosn who is a part trader .
part time artist and a part time journalist .
He would not be able to do justice to either of the professions mentiones in the previous sentence .

To conclude , a person with specialization is what the world needs .
It makes a person consistent and explre all aspects of the given specialization whihc will not be achieved by having broad based knowledge about various subjects .
