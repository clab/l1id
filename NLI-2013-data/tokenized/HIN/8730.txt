For students what is important ?
question which is echoing globally , its not just the matter of any country or a continent .
This issue is a global concern for parents , teachers , policy makersand almost all of us .

I , Personally feel that understanding ideas and concept should be the primary task of the student .
once you are able to get the idea and concept behind a event or a issue or a problem , you can easily correlate all the facts , as facts are always the derivative of concepts lying behind .

For example , if newton would have also thought in the way of learning facts only , then he would n't have worked on gravitation , instead he would have ate that apple that day and could have slept under that tree .
But his jest for understanding ideas and concepts , and gave us laws of gravitation , and many more discoverieswhich in turn led to the growth of technology , it has increased in turnthe horizon of thinking capability of the human brain , which led us to more discoveries .

Understanding the basics , makes one clear about the topic and help you better understand the facts and one can easily understand the problem and and with its help can develop further solutions to some other problem .
What , if we had not studied about the atmosphere , would we have been able to protect ourselves from nature 's fury .

had we able to fight hte diseases ?
the answer is big NO .
what is required for that is indepth knowledge of the subject not the surface reading .

So , this is , what the attitude of the students must be , instead of just mugging up the facts , they should think more about developing that fact further .
how a new fact can be generated form that ? .
This not only will merely lead to the their growth and successbut will be the source for the success of society and infact world as a whole and will be future inspirations for the generations to come
