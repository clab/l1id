I think an old saying of `` Jack of all and master of none '' , in my opinion doesnot have much standing as times are changing fast and your considered fit in the circles you move when you can comprehend and also contribute .
Therefore , I agree with the concept of being aware of a lot of disciplines than mastering either a few or only one of them .

The requirements of this fast paced society , require you to be in touch with the latest developments in various fields .
The reasons that I would like to report relate to my field of work , communication of agricultural innovations to the peasant community .
Firstly , the situations under which the farmers till their lands in the developing countries are full of challenges both natural and man-made .
A knowledge of the latest technologies in remote sensing is an essential pre-requisite if I have to give weather based advisory on the kinds of crops to grow and the appropriate sowing times .
This expertise could also be used in mapping those areas for the farmers which have great potential for growth .

Another of an important learning area could be the crop survelliance techniques which could be utilised to fore-warn the farmers about the outbreak of crop epidemics so that preventive measures are taken and farmers donot lose their hard raised crops and avoid huge annual losses to pest attack .

Marketing intelligence , is one such field which has a direct relevence to what every one of us desire for , higher profits .
If Iam aware of the national and international market trends , the same kinds of commodities may be recommended to the farmers to make avail of the growing markets .
Consumer preferences and standards for organic foods are to be one of the knowledge areas .

To summarise and conclude a varied knowledge is always better than a limited or restricred one .
Therefore , keeping abreast of many fields is highly benificial in my opinion .
