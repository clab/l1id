I disagree with the very idea that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use then there are today .
Instaed of decrease it is better to expect that as the standard of life is getting fairer and fairer by the pasage of time one should expect tremendous increase in uses of cars .

At the begining of this century when the cars were a symbol of status a few percentage of the global population has financial condition to bear the costs of cars .
Out of these few percentage majority were from North America and European countries .
However as the more number of nation started gatting independence and as the globalisation magnified , the scenario took a complet u turn .
Take the example of China and India which have population two thirds of the world population .
With ther booming economy one can easily guess the gigantic increse the use of cars in these two nations alone .
If other poor asian and african countries also join the league of these two nation , an with ever lasting western countries , one can just imagine what will be the scenario Take the number of car manufacturing companies that have increased hundreds fold over the past century .
Now to survive in this battle of fierce competition and outway other one , one can expect the prices of car to be down to such a point that one would not have ever imagined in his or her wildest dreams .
The prices of car would be in the domain of common man pockets .
Cars which were once considered to be the priveleges of richer section of society will be common day entity to common people .

With the ever incresing technological advances one could also expect greater incresrse in use of cars .
Say besides providing other common facilities that a car , which is made for common people provides , if the averages of the cars are increased many times from the current value and if the life time efficiency of cars are incresed more , one can surely say a huge increase in the use of cars .

So going by all the norms one can safely say more cars to be in use then ever in the next twenty years .
