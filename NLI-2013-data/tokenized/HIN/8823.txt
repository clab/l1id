IMPORTANCE OF UNDERSTANDING IDEAS AND CONCEPTS TO LEARNING THE FACTS

Yes , I do agree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more to be stressed upon than learning the facts .

The `` ideas '' are ones individual 's .
And `` concepts '' are formed on the basis of the depth of research on a topic or a statement .
Concepts are the basic and easiest way to approach any diversity of topics .
It helps to comprehend the subtle nuances conveyed in the text .
Once formed they cannot be shifted into a new frame unless otherwise proved through years of regular study .
As an example Newton gave three theories of motion after proved and approved by other scientists also .
Einstein thought why an apple falls on the Earth downwards from the top of a tree .
He did not accept this as a fact but worked on it and improvised a mathematical approach to it .
It was an idea that was hitting his mind and at last he came over with a genuine proof for it . ''
Ideas give birth to new inventions '' .
It is best said by some body .
It is just important that how seriously we study on the topic and how far we prove them to be correct in a more logical way .

Learning facts is least important .
It is simply getting the things into your heads without giving a thought to it .
It is called `` cramming '' .
Yes , one must be aware of the facts but reasoning is equally important .
One must not learn but abserve them , analyse them and reason them so hat the same previously learnt concep can be applied without any panick .

Ideas and concepts are the basis to learning the newer and inventing the newer technologies .
Facts can be created as many times as we desire from its basic root .
The beautiful boulevard of life is full of new experiences that further forms the learning or a concept .
Just enjoy the new experiences giving a logical thought to it .
