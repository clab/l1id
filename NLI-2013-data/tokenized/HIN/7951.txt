The best way to travel is in a group that is led by a Tour guide .
I feel that it is more enjoyable to tavel in a group led by a tour guide beause it more fun and exciting .

There are many advantages , when you hire a tour guide .
A tour guide will help you to plan your trip , save time , and plan it in an organised way .
He will also make your trip more pleasant , exciting and organised .
He will take care of all your needs .
He will explain to you in detail about the palces you visit .
He will provide you with information that a local person may not know .
Thus , he will provide you a lot of information about a particular place you visit .

If a tourist wants to have some information about where to stay , or about the culture or tradition about the palce he is vistis , then the tour guide will be able to help a lot .

I remember those memorable days when I went to visit the Taj Mahal , last year .
Those days were filled with fun .
I went there with my family and also hired a tour guide .
The tour guide was friendly , gave us a lot of information about the history of Taj Mahal .
The tour guide also helped me to take pictures of my family .
He was very friendly .
He took great interest in showing us around the Taj Mahal .
He made sure to expalin in detail about the history of Taj Mahal .
The tour guide took great care of everybody .
It was fun .
I am glad that I hired a tour guide , without him my trip to the Taj Mahal would be incomplete .

However , I think that it is always a good idea to hire a tour guide when you go to visit places in agroup .
It makes the trip more enjoyable and worth while .
