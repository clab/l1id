Automobile industry is growing at afast rate .
every day we are coming to know that new car is launched and the cars of different brands are introdused .
even the older ones are relaunched with new features .
so this is out of the question that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today , cars are really important in todays world .
there are so many reasons behind this but the most important one is the basic need of car in our daily life .
we are so much busy in our routine work .
one has to go to office , attending meetings etc , \ .
and the cars are the easiest way of to and fro .
they help us to reach on time .
if there will be no cars , life will be really impossible .

secondly , the other reason which support the idea is the new technological devlopments .
new techniology is really helpful in the devlopments and the launch of new cars .
it would directly effect the automobile industry .
and may lead to unemployment .
the future will be at stake and the resukt will be disastrous .

thirdly and the importantis the love and passion the people have with the different types of cars .
ther are so many fast cars or right to say sports cars are now availabel .
and all these cars are having big brand names .
so many people are now making it as their carrer .
they are known or we can say that their identity is related to the cars Micheal schumaker is an example for this .
and he is also a role model for so many .
so many young people are fascinated with the idea of driving fast cars .

to conclude , we can say that it is impossible that the cars wiill be less seen on the roads after twenty years .
infact there will be more cars and after twenty years every one will be driving the cars because of the tough competition between the companies .
every one would afford and will have the pleasure of driving it .

love for the cars will never be less or eliminated especially among the young generation .
people are fond of cars with good features .
in coming years thare will
