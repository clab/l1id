I truely agree with the statement that best way to trave is in group lead by tour guide .
This is because of following benefits stated below .
First reasons is that when we visit a unfamilier place we waist too much of time finding the place which we want to visit because we are new in the place .
Hiring a tour guide is best .
A tour guide knows the perfect route and the place which we want to visit and so that we waist a lot less time and we can stay at a place for longer which we would have waisted for finding that place by our selves .
Other reasons is that sometimes we visit such places where laungages are different from what we speak and so we have diffcuilty in understanding the laungage of that particular area .
So a tour guide who can understand both the laungages properly can help in communicating with the people there .
Also the tour guide who had stayed in a particular area of tourism can better explain the culture and traditional belief more clearly than it were if we had to find it our selves and it would have been a hard job .
So we can save lots of money which we would have waisted if we were by ourseleves on a tour .

The main reason i agree with the statment is that this thing can also help the tour guide economically .
As we are all that intelligent to see that tours giudes are not well educated and so they do such kinds of jobs .
Therefore by giving some money to tour guide we can make him earn livelihood .
This can benifit their childrens and their families .
As we can see in this process both , the tour guide and the group are benefited .
Instead of waisting the money by finding places our selves we can give that money to the tour guide and as a result he gets his livelihood and we save our time .
So we should not be thrifty in spending money on tour guides , because one should see that because of this another person is benefited .

So this are the reason i give my opinion that it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide , because it has many benefits on both the sides .
