In todays maket of fittest to survive it is just like a ` RAMS FIGHT ' .
The two rams , the competitors , have to collide very carefully .
One wrong move may result in the death of the other .
Yes you guessed it right .
Understanding the ideas more than the facts or vice versa can give an edge to the other competitor or probably lack of satisfaction .

In an age of managers , who are generalists , who need specialists .
Why would a company for example hire an employee with a specific knowldge of sales when he can get a person with a knowldge of all sectors viz a viz sales , marketing , finance etc. for the same job , for the same money .
Now a days every place we go or any person we meet tend impress us only if it is closer to perfect .
As i said earlier i small error , destroys the emperor .

Leave about how the worlds takes you , think about your personal self .
Would it not feel unsatisfied with what you have if you can or should have had when wanted .
Its a little complex .
Let us take it this ways , you have to go through the annual report of your company .
Your colleague also gets it and at the presentation he outshines you in just knowing the facts by heart or take it the other ways round .
Would you not feel sorry for yourself for not learning the facts or probably not understanding the ideas and concepts of the report when you could have done that .
YES absolutely .

So here we are .
Now we can really conclude that having the basic ideas and concepts are as much importance as knowing the facts and facets .
Afterall its not just about completing the task it about compleating it perfectly
