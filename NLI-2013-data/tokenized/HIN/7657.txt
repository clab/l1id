Travelng is going to a place that is very famous or one that is your favorite .
Some like to travel alone while others love being in a group I had the experience of traveling singely as well as traveling in a group with a tour guide .
I found a remarkeble difference in both .
Though travelling alone gave me the experience of being on myselfI I enjoyed travelling with a big group and a guide

I very well remmember my trip to Tajmahal with my friends .
The trip was full of fun .
I was taken care of and even I got the oppurtunity to take care of others .
Earlier when I went alone I cannot forget how hard it was for me continnue my trip despite of the morning sickness .
and high fever .

While travelling with friends I also realised how I can learn the Joy of Togetherness .
I never felt lonely like my initial trip .
With my friend I could share laugh , sing and dance too .
which i was unable to do as a single When I i went alone its hard to forget how boring it was to see the Castel .
I dint hire a guide .
I just glanced around and came out .
But this trip with the guide helped me to understand the importence of the place .
I could even go back to the History .
of that times The guide was a very witty person with lot of humor .
So any information he used to give he , first he used to make us many gusses , which really made the site and subject very intresting .

Though the advatages of going alone are solitude and ..
decesion making I enjoy to travel with freinds and if i am going to a very new place i will always preffer to take a guide along .
