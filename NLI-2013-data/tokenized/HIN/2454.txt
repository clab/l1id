I agree that Young people enjoy life more than older people do .

A prime reason for this being that young people like students or young graduates have much less to worry about as compared to older people .
People who have recently joined the workforce and who expeirence financial freedom for the first time in thier life 's tend to spend more on items of leisure like buying a vacation or a brand new car rather than thinking of retirement and buying various investments or saving options .
Young people are more care free because they dont have to think about providing for other family members , like the college costs of thier children , medical expenses for older people etc and thus live life more rather than worrying about making thier future 's secure .

Young people also tend to have healthier , fitter and disease free bodies which permit them to pursue various hobbies like wildlife trekking , paragliding , dancing , various water sports and other such activites that require a lot of samina , enthusiasm for such things and most importantly TIME .
Older people seem to have a derth of all these things , being too busy in work or not having a body which would permit them to follow their intrests .
Students for example , both school and college going have a lot of free time on thier hands to participate in extra curricular activites and follow thier intrests like sports , dance , art activites etc .

Older people on the other hand , are busy with thier work life and dont have any other leisure time apart from weekends , which too tend to get very hectic because of regular chores like shopping , cleaning the home , cooking food etc .
They dont spend a large chunk of thier disposable income on activities which provide fun and entertainment but on investment options which would give them a safe retirement option , insurance policies etc .

Thus , because young people are more care free , are experiencing new high 's of financial freedom and are healthier with a lot of spare time on hand , do enjoy life more than older people usually do .
