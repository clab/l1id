I agree that the means and ways of helping in a community has changed , but I totally disagree that young people do not give enough time in helping the community and society in general .
A group of people coming together on a shared idea or opinion is called a community .
Before the advent of the internet persons had to be physically present to be in the community , now is not so .
I think that with the expoentational increase by which young users are releasing the benefits of the internet , there is a lot of time to create , expand and cherish the communities .

Information age has given us more communities then there were any previously .
If you just browse yahoo .
com and orkut .
com , you will find a community already present in which you are intersted .
Be it on music , software , movies , entertainment , fund rasing and so on .
Young people not only create these communities but also make sure that they take activate part in it by updating the latest and removing the rest .
with the increasing number of users help is assured to be given to the needed .

Also , In todays world where people are living in high-rise building , I am sure every member from each of the house in the apartment wil come together to form a commitee , to atleast make sure that they know each other .
when they come together they also find ways in which to solve each others problems .
Youngsters who care for the society will make sure that community festivals are held with their utmost diginity .
for example the Ganesh chaturiti festival in India , there are more young people than old ones and the festival is celebrated with full vigor and enthusiasm .

In a typical college environment , there are many communities formed by young people who make sure that many weaker students get the necessary additional help that is needed .

Communities can only exists if there is a shared interst , but now a days there are so many choices and as young minds changes every now and then we think that they are not helping the community in which they had taken part .
