Different people can have different opinion about this topic .
some will go for understanding the ideas by keeing their point of view as - learning can be made easier by understanding the ideas .
But some consider learning facts are more important then understanding the ideas .

Considering from my point of view - I totally concede with the statement `` it is more important for student to understand the ideas and concepts then it is for them to learn the facts '' .

I endorse my view by saying that `` learnig in depth can result in more innovations '' .
It is very important for a student to understand the basic fundamental of the problem .
suppose if a student is solving the problem related to mathmatics and he is doing calculus , then it would be quite difficult for the student to solve the problem by just remembering the facts there , instead if he knows the basic formulas and method use those formulas according to the question it would be easier to solve the problem .

In the second place `` to be practical '' it is necessary to have full fleged knowledge about the subject and the concepts behind that. , And scientist have proved that .
They may not be able to find new innovations by just learnig facts .
If we will run only after facts and learn them how we will be able to grow our mind To create mental agility , to explore ourselves , to think beyond other 's point of view , it is very important to have greater and deep knowledge of the concepts .
By knowing the ideas afer the situtation it becomes easier to have a command over that .

So i would say that students should learn the fundamentals behiend every problem , because it will help in creating their mind , power of thinking , abilty to take quick decision , flexiblity to adapt to different situtations , because the are the backbone of the nation and in their hand lies the fate of the nation
