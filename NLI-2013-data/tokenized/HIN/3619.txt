This is a controversial topic since the conditions are different for different countries .
Firstly in todays world of development and technology , there are many distractions like the video games , movies , computers and gadgets like the ipod .
Some people feel that community work like visiting oldage homes is a waste of time .
They feel that they can do things which are more useful fot the person than the community during that period of time .
It is sometimes this casual attitude due to which people lose interest in their community .

There are other factors which have led to the decrease in participation in the commuinty .
Youth over the ages have felt that the commuinity in some is demoralizing them .
For example in India , due to the poor conditions of the country , a child feels that why should he or she give something to the community if the community has n't done enough for him or her .
If this trends goes on increasing then lesser number of children will not try to help their community .
Sometimes it depends how the child has been brought up .
If the family never did anything for the community then it is bound that the child might do the same .
With this negetive attitude i do n't feel that it will ever help anyone , neither the youth nor the community .

However I think its not the same everywhere .
I tend to do a lot for my community .
As a family tradition every year my mother and I visit the local old age home and spend hours talking to them .
During festive seasons , we get clothes and food for the old people and even try to bring in more activities for them .
This has helped me to understand elders better and respect them .
This year I participated in a progam of ` EACH ONE TEACH ONE ' where we got a chance to teach little children from slum areas .
This was one of my most gainful experience and it helped me to be more optimistic .
I take part in several projects related to saving and planting more trees , cleaning the school campus , taking care of school animals for which i have recieved an award .
Every year we collect old clothes for the poor in our school and neighbourhood .

In conclusion , it seems that the negetive attitude of the younger generation is declining its intrest in the community .
It is not right because one cannot expect the community for us .
We as a member of the community have to lend a helping hand in small areas like helping in oldage homes , teaching children who do not have proper means of education .
According to me its a give and take relationship .
This means in order to recieve something from the community we need to put in our part of the effort and have a positive outlook towards all this and only then will our community will give something in return .
But i think someone has to start this cycle and only the younger youth can .
