YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE

It is convercial to say that young people are more happy than older people .
But I would say that when people are young , they enjoy their lives by being with boyfriends and girlfriends .
They like travel all over the world and get a chance see the tourist place .
If they have their wives with them , they enjoy their lives sexually .
Some people young people are homosexual and some young people prefer to have a sex with young girls .
They are really happy to enjoy doining sex .

But it is not always true that young people enjoy their life .
Because in this age stage , young people have a responsibilty to look for their families , so they have to work more in their young stage .

In another side , older people are also happy in the older age .
Because they do not have to work much more in this age .
Their life is happy .
They do not spend much more time on work because already have gone through their working stage .
In some countries , government also suppot to the older peope financially .
So in this age , most of the older people spend their time to eat in hotels and restaurants .
In villages , older people like to spend their time with their grand childrens , and sitting together with older people and making comedies and jokes .
In this age age older people also spend their lives by sharing their ideas and opinion with their older frineds .

But there are also some other bad experiences with older people in this age .
Even if older people have worked enough in their younger stage and earned a lot of money , sometime their young childrens do not accept them to stay together .
They are also not able to enjoy their life sexually in this stage .

To sum up , both sides are equivalents in the daily life of the young and older people .
