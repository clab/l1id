I am agree with this fact that it is very important to undersatnd the idea and concepts .
what you are going to do and what are the options .
If you know the idea it will be lot easier to follow them .

You can follow those consepts .
you can go step by step by following them .
you are studing in college and every day you learn some thing new .
you can learn it only if you understand that .
If you do not understand you can not learn that .
It depends on how smart you are .
If you are very smart you will do it very soon .
If you are not very smart it takes time to learn .
It totaly depends on how fast you understand .
To understand something you want to learn .
You have to pay attention on it .

Even in your normal life you have plan to do something or make a plan for something .
Even for that you have to understand the situation .
how will you manage on time .

In the class if you have to do some assignement first you have to understant that then you can work further .
Facts always come later when you do some thing .
Facts are learned by experinces .
You can not learn it all of a sudden .
Even to learn the facts you have to understand that .

In your regular day when you go to college to attend the class understanding is very important .
If you do not understand what professor is saying what are his concepts .
it is not possible to work on that subject .
it is a kind of impossible to do something that you do not understand .

They main idea of the topic is understand the thing you are doing follow the concepts and you will get the results those are facts .
