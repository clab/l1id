I dont agree with the statement that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in any one subject .
I feel both approaches have their own pros and cons .
Let us analyze the issue with some specific examples .

Students are asked to take up many diverse subjects so as to have a basic knowledge of all the disciplines .
This is very important because no field works in isolation .
The subject of geology or art is incomplete without the study of history .
In fact the knowledge of one field is often required to solve problems in others .

Now imagine a scenario if the specialists doesnt have any knowledge of the other fields .
How is a physics specialist going to solve his complex problem invoving mathematics if he doesnt have a broad knowledge maths as well .
Can he afford to go to the the mathematician every time he has some doubt with his maths ?
That is not a feasible option .
He has to develop an understanding of maths as a discipline so as to arrive at a comprehensive solution .

We see many masters students majoring in more than one field .
This is because their interdisciplinary knowledge will give them a comprehensive understanding of the problem .

Todays world is increasingly putting up problems which often require inter-disciplinary knowledge .
The teams that work in the field of technology have a diverse compostion .
They have specialists of technolonogy working in tandem with people who have a broad knowledge of different techonologies .
As a specific example in software technology , many applications now require user interface in a technology different from the one used to do back end transactions .
To make this work you need more than just two specialists of the two technologies involved .

It is not going to work if each of them is totally unaware of the other technology .
It will certainly help if they can get another member who knows a little bit of both .

Thus both approaches are required for a comprehensive understanding .
