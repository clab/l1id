It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects .
because if have knowledge in all the subjects we have lots of sope in the future .
we can go for any job .
if we are good in only one subjects we can not do things in our life .

It is better for the future to have the knoeledge in all the subjects .
for example if we have bussiness management we cant do chemistry .
so its better for us to have knowlege in all the subjects .
if u go for the job also we have to be good in all the subjects .
only one specific subjects cannot help us in the future because in certain areas we should have to think what is good and what is bad .

one subjects give lots of confusions in certain areas .
but if you have broad knowledge you can do better in your life .
kowledge is like a god .
because how much you study it will benifit you .
so it is better for us to have knowledge in all the subjects rather in one .
so in my opion its better to have broad knoeledge in comparitively to one subject .

If we want to do something in our life so we have to learn every subject .
without doing it we are the falilures .
so we have to give the importance to all the subjects .
without dont knowing the subjects we cannot do any thing .
we cant progreess in any field .
so its better us to study all the subjects so it may help us in the future .

Therefore in all i have to say that its better to have knowledge of all the subject than to specialize in one specific subjects .
one knowlede cant do any thing .
but broad knowledge of many subjects may help you doning things in your life .
most of the richest man on the earth are educated in all the subjects .
so its better to eduacte in all the subjects .
