A community is an organisation that indulges in selfless activities which will indeed be benefitial for the society as a whole .
The communities do not operate for money or commercial purposes .
The only kind of ` fuel ' a community needs to perform its functions is the continous support from the people which surround it .

The support from the young is very vital in this case as they have the zeal to accomplish tasks with great proficiency .
Young brains are very innovative and would always help the community in various aspects .
However , in my opinion , nowadays the young do not give enough time to these communities .
They have adopted an ignorant attitude towards them and fail to realise that the community is indeed making their life easier .

Let us take an example of a community that works for the old aged , the community 's basic operations are to help the old in living their remaining lives cheerfully and without troubles .
The community helps them by doing a part of their daily chores and by spending time with them to give them some company .
Now the young fail to realise that if the community flourishes , it is they who will indeed be benefitted , the life of their grandparents will become easier and not only this , they would get the same kind of love and affection from other when they grow old .

The young are however unconcerned , and would prefer spending their free time watching television , playing computer games or merely wasting time with friends .
They do not realise that involvment in these communities has many hidden benefits too .
One gets a feeling of self satisfaction and responsibility as he would be contributing to the development of the society , he would also attract apppreciation from other members of the neighbourhood and they would value his actions .

One can also learn a lot many virtues by working for selfless causes , he is exposed to various elements of the society , he has a chance to study their behaviour and characteristics and since young people are keen observers , he would be able to imbibe a lot of practical knowledge .

Sadly though the new generation has not been able to think beyond selfish causes and they seem to have forgotten the wise old saying that true happiness lies in the happiness of others .
