I agree with the statement that it is important for the students to understand the concepts and ideas well and not just learn the facts .
The main reasons for my view are given below .

First reason for my veiw is that we need to implement the ideas and concepts in real life and just learned facts will not help our cause .
What we learn in school or college is of importance in real life and we need to implement it in real life scenarios , so just by learning the facts we wo n't be able to implement them .
Concepts of Physics or chemistry , which are essential in our day to day life , will never be clear to us .
We can learn that earth rotates around the sun , but we will never understant the reason for the same until we understand the concepts and ideas behind the factors like rotation and gravity .
So just learning facts we limit our knowledge and understanding of the small small things which we have to deal in daily life and from time to time .

Second reason for my view is that the learned facts are easily forgotten as compared to ideas and concepts which we understand well .
We do n't forget the concepts which we understand well and are able to remember them a long time .
The students who just learn for exams have less knowledge and forget the subject early as compared to those who understand the concepts .

However , it is also sometmes neccessary to just learn the facts and not understand .
Like the case of History subject .
We are not required to understand the concepts just learn and know the facts .

In conclusion , it is important to understant the concepst and ideas as we need to implement them in our daily life and also we tend to remember the concepts which are well understood as compared to just learning them .
But there are situations where just learning is required like the case of knowing the History subject .
