Life has various stages , each stage has there advantages and disadvantages , The topic of the essay is to write about `` Do young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
I disagree to this statement .

One of the several point to put across to justifiy my disagreement is `` survival of the fittest '' .
Today 's world is so fast and full of compatition that to survive young people have to be a in this race due to which they left with no time for themself , for there family , and his own enjoyment .

Secondly , at this stage of life in young people , there are a lot reposibility for example if a person is just graduated from the school he has a to take care of his further career , like what job to take or which city to choose .
Furthermore , if the person of lets say mid 30th , he has this own type of commitment such paying rent , daliy expense , buying a house , saving for retairement , settlement of children , Where as the old people has got over with all these responsibility They have save money of themself there children are settled .
They can have there own time .

Thirdly , Working person can not make long luxuray vaction program very offen has he has to manage his office , money , family as well as his time .
Money , has a great importance these days .
Everythings is so expensive that even a person want to buy something for his entainment he has to think twice .
Not all people can afford to do such expense .

For young people this is the time to work and to make the future secure so that they can live a easy and wealthy life in there old days .
Working hard in the young age is also possible as our body also allow as to do so where as in the old age spending long office hours , and doing vigrous work would not be possible .

So at the end I would like to conclude the essay by mentioning that , being young is that point of time where you can work hard live hard , and save for future by all mean .
All the missing enyoying can be achived later during the old age when there will a lot of time to spend .
mental piece .
