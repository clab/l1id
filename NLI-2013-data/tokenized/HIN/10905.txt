I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because successful people are full of confident that what ever field or work thier choose in that they can do well .
what i belive is the confident of being succesful is the half success and after that half path is left to success .
For example my father is a succesful busineesman and for increasing his businees he try out new thing and he did well because he know how to do well in new business .
For being successfull a person should hardworking and he must be devotational and obidient to his work .
I thing if a person is hard working a succes is not far away from him .
But sometime a some successful person afraid of doing new thing because of being unsuccessful .
the most success full person for example a famous industrialist of my country `` ambani '' he is the sucessfull industrialist of his time every one know him because he try to do new things and he know trying new things is not so easy a factar of risk is always exist .
As a success personality he pleased in doing new thing , that make him more poplar .
sucessful persons already know the key of success is hard work and their are mentally prepaired what can happen to them if their are not sucessfull but still their never afraid in doing new thing .
Ambani is actually a gold merchant after his success in this field he try out new thing put a oil refinary industry by selling all his gold business shop and finally he became sucessful and he did not stop here he is still trying new this , so in my veiw a succesful person try new thing rather than only doing what they already did .
