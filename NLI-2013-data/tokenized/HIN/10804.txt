I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
As we all know , that innovation is one of the key factors that leads to the growth of economy of a particular nation .
Similarly , for a person to be successful he has to come up with something creative , a new concept , a new idea that will generate him wealth and and hence growth in life .

Another thing is that its a human tendency to go for a change , try something new , something different , and as rightly said , `` variety is the spice of life '' .
For example , back in old days , women in India did not work and most of them were house wives , with all the time they have with them to cook the food using traditonal gas .
But , when women in India started working they didnt have enough time to cook .
Somebody thought of introducing a concept of microwave , an instant cooking machine , and it was a hit conept .
Same is with the introduction of washing machines than washing the clothes with hands .
With this human tendency in mind , definitely a entrepenuer should take full advantage of it and he will be successful .

But , at the same time it very important for a person to know whats the new thing he is going to try .
He cannot just come up with the idea which may not be liked by the people or or may not be a hit in a particular market .
He should really do a good study of the market he is targetting , otherwise the risk is not worth it .

To sum up , in order for the person to be successful its a good idea to try new things and take risks , but the risk should be a well evaluated risk , with all the factors considered properly .
