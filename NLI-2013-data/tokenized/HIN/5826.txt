Well in my view i dont think there will be a reduction in the usage of cars in the near future .
firstly , since many new cars are been coming into the present market .
one can surely expect that many people in the near future will be buying those .
moreover by using latest mechanisms these days the cars are been manufactured at a lower cost than before .
so this may even lead to a reason for buying a car as they are very cheap .

secondly , since technology is been developing day by day and also humans showing a lot of interest in leading a luxorios life .
some people consider that without having a car it may affect their status .
each an every individual will be interested to buy a car .
even the students in colleges also using the cars these days .
so i dont think there will be a decline in the usage of cars in the upcoming years .

thirdly , when coming to population , as there been a massive increase in almost all countries no surprising the car users also certainly will increase .
And also when safety is been considered many people prefer a four wheeler such as car rather than a two wheeler such as bikes .
since two wheelers are more likely to be dangerous as there are no proper safety measures done in its design .

Finally the only point i can see about declining the usage a cars in the near 20 years is because of increase in number of deseases due to pollution .
majority of the car exhaust smokes will generally contain cabon content which may combine with oxygen and form carboxyhaemaglobin .
Due to the consumption of such gases many may suffer with different kinds of diseases like breathing problems , asthma etc .. , so if the people become aware of such dangerous diseases then they might stop using the cars .
But still , i stick to the fact that this may not happen so soon .
