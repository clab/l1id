I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Nowadays many advanced technologies are invented .
And specially the advertisement or attract people or describe how it is useful , etc .
In this world nobody has time to go every time for each items and find out which is best with the quality wise and money wise .
Sometimes is helpful that it descibes in the better way .

In most of the areas we dont know that how many companies are involved for which specific product and from the advertisement we would able to know that products belongs to which company , how much rate , it is cheaper or not , etc .
Sometime we dont know that how to use `` ROTI MAKER '' , so from the advertisement we would able to know that how it use effectively .
We would able to know that for the fun , which movies or which album are created and by whom .

Becaues for the movies and just for album we dont have time to go everytime to cinema and find out .
Most of the products are useful and human needs in the advertisement .
It is true that sometimes advertisements describes that products are not really .

For example that we would like to go for the great and fun tour .
And the advertisement is coming that describe cheap and good package for the tour and cheapest rate as well .
So we will just pick this oppurtunity and enjoy .
So here some other example advertisement describe the location for the new development .
So we can able to use this opportunities .
From the advertisement we can judge need and judge that how to fulfill the needs .
Sometimes in the advertisement some location are described for the food , rent room .
So from that we can easily find out needs .
But if advertisements not help us then we have to go every place for fullfill the needs .
And after choosing some specific place we have to find out that which one is the best .
But from the advertisements we will find easily .
So advertisements help us in the saving time and fullfil the needs effectively .
But in the case of cosmetics and some types of food , just attract people .
Some cosmetics are not good for the skin then also some good characters advertise it then its good .
So finally its useful in some area
