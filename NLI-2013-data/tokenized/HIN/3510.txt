In the fast and frenetic lifestyle that we face today , it is quite difficult to take out time all the activities that we want to perform .
Our youth driven by enormous worlk load , information overload and lack of tome is one of them .
Still many of them are taking out precious time out of thier hectic schedules and helping their communities .
Hence though some may argure that the youth today is not lending enough time to his/her community , I would assert that youth are really spending enough time directly or indirectly for helping their communities .

To support this view , I would state an example of my colleague who is in the same project as mine .
She really works a lot all the week but still after a hectic schedule , she is able to take out time for helping the handicapped people which a trust of her church community supports .
The last month , she was able to collect sufficient amount of funds for helping them get artificial limbs .
Her persistent effort for weeks and the determination were able to help the needy and poor handicapped people who could have faced lots of difficulties without the same .

Another point that can be considered regarding the same is that some of the smart work enabled by technology has helped the youjng people devote more time effecvtively .
For example , if earlier one were to search for the hospitals and the trusts that suppported cancer treatment , it would have taken a long time collecting information regarding the saem .
However with the power of internet which has become part-n-parcel of youth 's lives and help groups available online , they can really put efforts that is equivalent to spnding hours without the technology available .
It can definitely be argued that the time thatt the youth spent on mastering the internet tools and teh time spent in becoming aware of teh same has been indirectly utilised for helping the community .

Thus , the above example and passage help come to conclusion that youth are helping thier communities .
