The question being asked is that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is good or bad .
This topic is very interesting because i like travelling very much .
In my opinion , it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide and i am agree with this topic .

The first reason , why i prefer this is because if you are travelling in a group along with the the tour guide , you are very much in secure hand .
I think this because in a group , there are lots of peoples around you .
They are always there to take care of one another .
But , when you are travelling alone , it might be hard for someone .

Another reason is that you get more knowledge about the specific place .
Tour guide is there to explain the history of some specific place that are important for the sight seeing point of view .
Others group members are there to give their ideas about the place .

The reason is that , which is very important in my point of view is you enjoyed very much in group rather than individual .
For example .
if you are going for the long tour in group for like 1-2 month , that group become like a family and you have not to worry for the unusual situation .
The tour guide explains everything so well that you can get more information about thet particular things .
when you are travelling along , sometimes you missed very important places to visit especially when you are going to new place .

In the conclusion , i think i am correct in choosing that topic .
