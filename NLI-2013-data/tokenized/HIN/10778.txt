`` Do anything as if it were your last and up to the point of perfection . ''
I firmly beleive in the statement but I do n't really beleive that only by trying new things and taking risks a person can be successful .
You can reach the zenith even if you are doing what you know how to do well with sheer hardwork and perserverence .
Behind every spectacular event lies unspectacular preparations .

I would rather like to work hard on my assets and plans to excel them other than trying something new and exciting which has the probability that I might not like it .
The roots of success lies in the will to exceed in life and a continuacy to a purpose .
I loved helping people , dealing with the children so pursued teaching .
I think if I continue my same profession of teaching I would be more successful other than trying a new thing all together like nursing .
If I continue to teach , I have an enriched experience in the field of teaching and later on I can also apply for the position of a Principal .
But if I change my field to nursing I have to learn all about medicines and have to start from the very scratch .

Secondly I think a person gets a lot of satisfaction if he or she is doing something they already know .
It gives a sense of self content and hapiness after that hardwork .
If I offer to cook anything for my friend but I do n't really know how to cook , I might have an unpleasing experience after that chore because that dish might not be very tasty .
So instead of taking any risk I would rather do something I enjoy and know how to do well .
And I do n't think if I wo n't try that I am unsucessful .
Instead I know how how to avoid ruining my day and how to get the most of it .

When you are doing something you already know you develop the sense of perfection and there are more chances to excel in that field .
Well in the end life is a tin of sardines and we are all looking for thye key .
So sometimes we might have to try new things but my main chore would always be what i like doing the best .
