the current era is the era of developing and ever growing information .
the amount of knowledge available in almost every field is increasing .
i think it is important that a person is specialized and has all the required skills and knowledge of one particular discipline .

as the old saying goes , `` jack of all trades and master of none '' somebody who knows too many subjects may not be able to master any particular subject this is the age of specialization .
specialization requires constant efforts in one direction .
so if a person wants to specialize in a particular subject , they will be required to regard that particular subject as priority and other subjects as subsidiary

also to be able to contribute in a particular fireld , one needs to put in more efforts and time in knowing that particualr field , leaving less or little time to gain knowledge about other subjects .

specializing in particular subject would help in complete knowledge of that paricular matter .
there would be less of confusion and more scope for exprimenting with the details and existing knowledge .
this is extremely imporatnt for scientists or other professionals involved in the field of advancment of knowldge

in the current time of cut throat knowledge , complete information of particular subject is required to gain an edge over others in the same field

i dont intend to say that having information about other fierlds would do any harm .
on the other hand , the information from other subjects but related subjects might prove useful .
for instance a politician would benefit greatly from knowing the history of the region or teh technological aspects of a particular powerplant in his region is working .
however he does not need detailed and technical knowledge .
he needs to know enough that would help him with his role as a politician .

i think specializing in one specific subject is more imporatnt than trying to learn too many subjects .
but once the person has specialized in his or her field , they can always look at enhancing their information about other subject matters also .
