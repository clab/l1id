The question is very tricky as people across all walks of life and across all age groups like to enjoy and it is rather tough to quantify and compare their levels of enjoyment .
Besides there could be people who could derive a tremnendous sense of enjoyment by the most trivial of acts such as the sight of smiling infant .
While there could be some who are never happy with the state of affairs in their lives despite having the best comforts in the world .

In comparing youngsters and adults on the mentioned statement , I personally feel that as youngsters we try to live life to the fullest .
Though we realise the importance of making a career for ourselves we also make it a point to have a ball as and when time permits .
Older people generally tend to be more spiritually inclined and prefer to spend their time doing community work that brings them a sense of satisifaction more than the thrill of enjoyment .
Besides there might also be the feeling that they are beyong the ` age ' to enjoy life in a way as extravagent as we youngters can .

Also the fact that compounds this belief is that as today 's youngsters we have more modes and sources of entertainment and enjoyment at our disposal than did the elders when they were in their prime .
Take for example Computers and Televsion , two of the commonest modes of entertainment today that were not even invented when our grandads and grand nannies were our age .
This sheer availability of resources to us affects our ability to enjoy more .

Then again it is more a matter of personal choice or opinion as every person has his own definition of enjoymnent .
As per the way I percieve it I believe that yongsters today enjoy life on a larger scale that older people do .
