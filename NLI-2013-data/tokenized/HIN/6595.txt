According to statement , which says that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I disagree with this statement because cars is the basic means of travel , no matter how many wheel they are , there can be two .
three , four wheeled cars .

The cars are the basic means of transportation , travel , for certian emergencies and to many more things and i think so in the coming years we can say that their can be more sophisticated cars , because the science and technology has been improving day-by-day .
Before driving a car one should know the signals and precautions so that their can be no harm to the person .

We can get many developed cars like there can be many things like reducing the size of the cars and giving more spacious cars and comfort for the passengers to seat .

May be in the coming years we can get cars that are automatic like we do not need to have `` key '' to it can be started by and simple button .
In the coming years , the companies can make the cars which are more conveneint for parking and the types of colours and the differences in the quality .

Now-a-days , because of increase in the cars we can see many traffic jams and which causes to different types of pollution like sound , smoke .
These causes can be very hazardious to the human being and even can kill a man .
So science may find ways to make these solved .

In the coming years we can see that the companies can change the fuels used by the cars and the technology can discover many useful gas which has many advantages and can save the uncontrolled levels of pollution to a decreased levels .

So i think that cars can improve better way and can make the life of the human in a good ways
