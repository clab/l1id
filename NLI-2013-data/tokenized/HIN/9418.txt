I agree with this argument , and i think it is very important not just for students but for all of us to first of all understand the basic ideas and concepts and then to learn facts .
A good comprehension of the basics is important because the ideas and concepts actually make up the facts .
Therefore for anyone to learn the facts it is imperative they have a proper grasp of all the factors that go in it 's making .

It is a fact that physical exercise is very important for the human body .
Now if the student just learns that , it will not have much relevance and will not really contribute to anything that is productive .
On the other hand when the student understands why it is important --- the ideas behind that particular philosophy it will be much more relevant and thus more meaningful .
The student can understand how physical exercise releases stress , how it increases a persons well being by altering chemicals in the brain etc .
Physical exercise in the form of a team sport teaches people to be able to interact and cooperate and work together .
Thus the fact will make much more relevance .

Another example is the fact that it is much more difficult to breathe at higher elevations .
It is very important to understand why it is so .
If i were planning to be a mountaineer for example , i would be able to deal with the whole situation much better if i understood that air pressure is much more at higher elevation
