The statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is a very interesting one & at the same time a really controversial one to say .
It is interesting because this is a statement about two different age groups & controversial because enjoying life may be different for a old person compared to a young person .

I disagree to this statement because I think enjoyment is different for different people .
It is a personal feeling which does not only vary with age but also varies with each indivisual .
Maybe for someone partying will seem enjoyment and for someone else camping will be good enough to feel happy .

There are a lot of people whom we come across , who are old but still enjoy life as much as a young person .
It may seem that for a grown up person life becomes very complex , but it is no different for a young person as he/she also get to know about the complexities of life while they are growing up .
It is not easy for them to face the challenges that life presents them everyday .
Life has never been easy for anyone and never will be .
Everyone has their own issues .
No one in this world is perfect .

I feel different people have different yardsticks to measure happiness .
Enjoyment comes to you when you feel happy and satisfied and are not regretting any decision you have made .
Even if you have done something regretfull you should try to make up for it and be upto the task of facing the consequences .
This gives immense satisfaction to the mind .

To conclude I would say that it is not your age which determines enjoyment but you yourself and how possitive you are about life .
So just be possitive , work hard and enjoyment will follow you .
