I totally disagree with the statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . ''
I strongly feel that this statement is being made by a novice person who actually do n't refers to the weekly reports and tabloids as published by the bussiness sector regularly .

Now a days a car signifies much more things than to be a mere vehicle to carry out the routine transportation .
It has become an indespensible commodity like television and telephones .

As compared to the primitive era , now a days people keep more than one car at their disposal marked seperately for their well defined purpose .
Because of the rapid expansion in bussiness sector , the increasing distances do n't actually matter any more for the working class .
There are majority of people who are working at the companies located at quite a large distance .
In that case , they prefer taking their private vehicles such as cars , for commuting .
It makes them feel more comfortable and save their time as well .

As recently being concluded through a survey , most of the people feel that owing a car is always a better deal than owing a two wheeler as the former is more safe and secure .
According to few , cars are always faster than any other two wheeler and comfortable also .
One can drive them in almost any climatic conditions .
They are also less subjected to the unconditional accidents such as slippage and skidding .
It also helps them to avoid irritating pollution on the way .
Some people also considers car as their status symbol .
The larger the car , the higher recoginition they can manage to beg in the society .

In my own society i could see that there were merely 20 cars five years back .
But now the situation has come up to the extent that the parking place can be seen always flooding , with cars of almost all types being parked all over .

The recent boom in the manufacturing sector has blessed us with the advancement of the technology .
The spare parts are now available at much cheaper rates than ever .
The car manufacturing companies are also devising many ways to produce economical cars which can be afforded by almost every sector of the society .
Such cars consumes less fuel and are specially desingned keeping in mind the general ergonomics for people driving every day .

With all such efforts in place , i really do n't feel that the number of cars in use will going to decline in the years to come .
Rather we would be able to see some really sophisticated and less resource intensive models on the roads in the coming years .
Last but not the least , i feel that the statement is simply based on the subjective knowledge and lacks the pragmatic approach considerably .
