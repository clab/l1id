I donnot agree to this statement becuse according to me having broad knowledge of many academic subject to specialize in one subject is just like jack of all and master of none .

I think if you are specialize in one subject , you will have more job oppurtunities , you will be preferred than other people who have knowledge of many subjects .
firstly , it is seen in many institutions , they prefer masters for the higher post in their institutions becuse they have knowledge in depth by having lot of expossure and experience in same subject .

As seen in medical field also , that people prefer to go to a doctor who has the masters degree than a simple M.B.B.S. doctor .
As you become specialized in one subject , you have the knowledge in depth and in a proper way .

These are the reasons why i feel that having specialized in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
