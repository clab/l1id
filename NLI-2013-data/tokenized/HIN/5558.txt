I agree with the statement that advertisements make the product seem much better than they really are .

In today 's world media plays a very important role .
And this age of media is widely governed by advertisements .
Adverisement has become very important medium between consumer and producer .
So people are greatly influenced by advertisements .
Each producer tries to impress people by its own tactics .
In this bid to influence people they generally show many false points about their products .
And people get in the trap of the companies .

With the development of commercialization advertisements are also gaining their importance .
Now people are becoming more convinced by advertisements they see on televisions and newspapers .
These companies are spending great deal of money in advertisements .
They rarely think of spending the money in improving the quality of their products .
As these companies are also aware that advertisements are becoming very crucial in the sale of their products .

Today their is great competition in the market .
We can see number of products for same purpose .
Whenever a new product is lauched it is made familiar to people through advertisements .
Initially company offers some discounts to their product to encourage people to buy their product .
And each advertisement tries to show that is the best available product in the market .
People are greatly attracted by these advertisements .

Advertisements are generally false image of the product that companies try to bring before people .
Due to increased competition and to get maximum sale of their products companies show the points in their product whch are not true .

At end I will like to conclude that advertisements make product seem much better than they really are .
