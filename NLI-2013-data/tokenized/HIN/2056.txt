Enjoyment is not age or time bounded .
Its way of living joyfully , giving our best effort to life and extract whatever possible we can draw from life to make everyone around us happy .
In different age everyone has his own way to enjoy life , so i disagree with topic that young people enjoy life more than old people do How we define enjoyment , for young people riding bike at high speed , late night parties , rock climbing and other adventur sports , movies , drinks can be way to enjoy life , on other extreme of life basking at the beach , holding hand oh life partener and walking on send , memmorising the old days with photo albums can be way to enjoy life .

The ways used by young people to enjoy life can be abhor by old people , and the path adopted by old people to enjoy life can be dull and monotonus for young guys .

A young guy may enjoy to see a person sliped on wet ground , a old person may enjoy giving hand to guy on fell the road .
Enjoyment of young people are mostly extravagent show , full of materialism , lewdfullness , levish parties that all show the adrenaline running in their vessels , it also lighten the impatince bound with the age concern , on other side enjoyment of geriatric person solemnly starts and and in spiritualism .

so i conclude my words by saying that both extreme of life has there own way to enjoy the life and that cant be compare with the age .
