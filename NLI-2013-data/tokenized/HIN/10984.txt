Successful people I believe do n't stick to one thing , they try to explore new things since `` variety is the spice of life '' .
If a person keeps on doing one thing all the time it becomes boring .

There are some people who are never happy even though they may have a good lifestyle .
Some people thrive on the rush they get from working , the excitement .
My father is one such man .
Then there are some people who kust wanna earn more money because they are not happy with there current lifestyle , they want more , a better and more expensive lifestyle , these people are never content , they always aspire for more .
One such person was a character in the book by ` John Ghrisam ' ` The king of torts'

My father is an successful man he has an amazing real estate buissness which alows us to live very comfortibly but my dad was not satisfied he wanted to something new , something challenging , something he has never done before .
Therfore my father decided to start a new buissness concerning exporting .
In the beggining we had loosses but still my dad would not give up eventualy the buissness picked up and it became quite profitable .
But my father now wanted to open a new buissness , and the cycle continues .

In the book we see a simple man who has nothing but get 's a excellent deal and makes millions .
He gets to live a lifestyle he never dreamt of .
A lifestyle with mansions and fast cars .
But he was not content he wanted more .
He was becoming greedy his friends pulled out of the bussiness early so they already had made there money .
In the end he lost everyting he lost his house , his job .
He took a risk and paid for it in a big way .

Sometimes successrul people takes risks because of the thrill like my father others take risk because they are greedy like the character from ` The King Of Torts ' .
I agree we should take risks even though we are successful because a pridictable life style is never good .
Sometimes we are lucky like my father and sometimes unlucky like the character .
