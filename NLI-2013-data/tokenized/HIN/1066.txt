`` A specialist is a person who knows more and more about less and less '' .
I remember coming across this statement when considering whether I should go for doctoral studies and then dropping my plans .
I decided I wanted to be a generalist rather than a specialist .

I believe that it is more important to have a broad knowledge of many subjects rather than specialize in just one subject .
There are many reasons why I think so .
Let me discuss them one by one .

The purpose of education is not just to learn about specific topics , but to learn the process of learning .
Let me take technology as an example to illustrate my point .
Technology changes so swiftly that what we learn in college soon becomes outdated .
So , how does knowing everything about one particular technology benefit a person ?
Instead , students should concentrate on learning a breadth of technologies so that they can quickly adapt tp new technologies .

Broad knowledge of a number of subjects also broadens the students ' perspective .
They learn to appreciate a larger variety of things .
Think about hypothetical students who never studied American History .
Would they be able to enjoy the comic historical references in the movie `` Forrest Gump '' ?
Think of how children would appreciate and remember the names of planets if they knew that these were derived from Roman mythology .
Would it not be interesting for students to know that Jupiter is the the king of Roman gods and that is probably the reason the largest planet in the solar system is given the name ?
These examples might be trivial , but they indicate that broad knowledge increases the ability of students by broadening their point of view .

Another reason to study many different subjects is that real-life situations require an inter-disciplinary approach .
We need to know about a lot of things to be able to solve real life problems .
For example , for people to figure out how information technology can help in business , they need to have some understanding of both information technology and business .
While it might be argued that a team approach to such problems need not require people to know more than one subject , I disagree .
An interdisciplinary team will only be effective when each specialist is learning from others and in effect , becoming more and more generalist .

Finally , once a foundation of a broad academic experience is laid , it is understandable that some people may want to specialize .
Doctors often specialize in heart , brain or the bones .
But each one already has a foundation of learning about the whole body and how it functions .
Ever saw a doctor who knows only about heart attacks and does not know what body temperatures imply fever ?

So , in conclusion , a foundation of broad knowledge of a number of academic subjects needs to be laid for the reasons of mastering the learning process , broadening world view and being able to solve real world interdisciplinary problems .
Once the foundation has been layed , it is upto the individual to decide whether to go for more specialization in his or her field of interest .
