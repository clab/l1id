I think older people can also enjoy like young people enjoy .
so i am totally disagree with that young people enjoy their life more then that older people .
its not mandatory for old people to live their life as young people do .
they can live their life in their own way to make it beautiful .
its totally depend on people to people .

Firstally i want to say that older people can do any thing like young people like if they want to go for a party they can go .
if they want to do dance in party they can do .
i had seen one old person in someones party .
these old age person dance like young ones .
he was so active .

secondly , if young people thought that they are active than old person .
so they are wrong .
old person can do anything like marathon etc. it shows that they can work like young people they can do anything which young people cant

thirdly its impoosible to say that young people are more enjoy because young people always take decision instantly which will be not beneficial to them because by doing that can put themslves in danger but for the case of old people they take their their decision after thinking very deeply .
take the example of our poltician they are totally old and take decision very politely which makes them happy .

so i believe that old peolpe can also enjoy like young people not in the same manner just like young one do but in different manner so its ridiculos to say that young can enjoy the life more than that old people .
