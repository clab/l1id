Young people are the fundamental building blocks of any community .
They are its foundation , whether it be culturally , politically or even socially .
I believe that young people contribute precious time to helping their communities as they are well sensitised to the problems that it faces .

The youth of any country is an essential ingredient in the larger matrix of a well-knit community .
Young people , through various media and other fora , like television , the internet , are exposed to the grond realities in their community .
Education also informs them about the problems plaguing their community , and modes and methods of resolving these problems .
For example , by the constructive use of demonstrations and petitions , students in India have been at the vanguard of a silent yet sturdy movement seeking to transform the current status quo of lethargy and sloth in politics into one of efficiency and nimbleness .

With the advent of the internet , the young people have found an articulate mouthpiece .
They are frequently expressing their opinions through blogs and what have you may .
Owing to their adaptive and dynamic nature , the youth has its finger firmly on the community 's pulse .
With the rapid pace with which the different forms of communication emerge , the youth are sure to become major shareholders in the future from being mere stakeholders as of now .

However , such fervour on part of the youth should be guided by experienced and responsible members of the community .
At times , unregulated action by the youth has led to catastrophies .
For example , during the Cutlural Revolution in China , the Red Guards , as the youth was referred to , at the behest of Chairman Mao Zedong , without any inkling as to how to improve their society , lead to the killing and slaughter of intellectuals , the very intellectuals who were agents of change in the community .

In conclusion , the youth has done its fair share of community service .
In fact , they have been welcome agents of change amidst a sea of senility and inaction by previous generations .
The role essayed by them will only increase in size and stature as time progresses .
