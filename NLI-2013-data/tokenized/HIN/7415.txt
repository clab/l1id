I completely agrees with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide .
In today 's world where advancements are taking place in every field , tourism industry is also marching ahead with great speed .
Now you can easily get the group packages at cheap prices with a tour guide who will show you all the famous places and will take care of your food and luggage while on tour .
Travelling in a group provides you the advantage of guide 's experience and group security , provide you cheap packages and lot of fun than travelling alone or with family .

While travelling in a group led by guide , you can benefit from the guide 's experience because he can guide you which places are the best to go .
He can tell you about some famous temples , churches and beaches etc. , while travelling alone you may miss these things .
Another advantage of group travelling is the security , there will be no fear of getting lost or attacked by somebody at outside place because there will always be somebody with you to help you .

Travelling in a group is cheaper too , because you can easily bargain with travelling agency over the ticket fares , hotel charges etc. because travelling agency will always prefer the group travel .
On the other hand , if you are travelling alone you have no options and buy the tickets at higher prices , and pay more for hotel room .

Travelling in a group means lot of fun .
You can never get bored while travelling in group , because you can crack jokes , play cards , and can have singing competitions too .
While if you are alone you will be devoid of all this fun .

While travelling alone has its own advantages of privacy and being with the family but i will still prefer travelling in group .
I think group travel can convert a good trip into great one .
