The issue is a controvertial one .
On one hand the issue states that there are young people who contributes to their communities .
On the other hand , the issue claims that young people are not helping their communities at all .
However in my final analysis , I would support that young people are giving enough time to help their communities .

The first instance in support of my view are the Non-Residential Indians .
They are young people who work outside India .
Inspite of there busy schedule , they come back to the home country and conduct lot of sessions .
They also help financial institutions in India by providing them financial aid .
They actively participate in the events and promotions done by the Government of India .

My second example are the young politians those are coming up in various countries .
People like Tony Blair of United Kingdon is a fascinating example of a young person helping his community and country .
Politics has now become one of the means by which young people are contributing .

Another example would be people like Michael Johnson from Basketball and Mark Waugh from Cricket .
These sports person have taken time out for child welfare .
They have also setup various sports academy , to help nourish young talent in their respective fields .

These people always make it a point to visit their respective academy .

Finally , the musicians like Yanni have conducted charitable shows .
Many other young musicians also conduct charitable shows to generate reveneues .
Singers like Michael Jakson is known for conducting such charitable shows .
This money is used for the development for their community .

In conclusion , I feel that young people of this era are actively participating for the cause to help their communities grow .
The above examples are just a few to quote .
