I aree only partially with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they do well .
Although , trying newer things keeps up the growth graph and helps a person to rise above the rest but equally true is the fact that one can be equally successful in some thing in which he or she has both , experience and expertise .

To excel in any field , its extemely crucial to know ones job correctly and efficiently .
This excellence can be achieved by hard work and spending more time on the job at hand .
In other words , experience and diligence is the key to success .
For this reason , I belive that those people who do the same thing over a long period of time or do it well , do become successful .
For example , a mechanic specializing in repairing electronic gadgets can achieve enough success even if he sticks to that very job forever .
People shall always trust him more than the neophytes in the profession .
However , if he changes his job or tries to multitask in more number of jobs , he might end up spoiling his established work and not even getting the customer 's support in the new area in which he will now become a beginner .

However , trying out different things in life cannot be seen with any contempt .
It is always said that if you stop growing , you would soon start declining .
Staying in just one thing and doing nothing else can easily stagnate a person and stagnant water is worth nothing more than a breeding place for mosquitoes and deadly diseases .
Therefore , it is as proper to keep experimenting in life .
One should always learn newer and better stuff and become adroit in them .
At the same time , one must never forget to keep in touch with the original talent and maintain it .

Conclusively , Whether you decide to stay in your discipline , or diversify , success can be all yours , provided , you do it with sincerity and hardwork .
