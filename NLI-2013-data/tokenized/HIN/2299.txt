Young people are more energetic and they might therefore appear to enjoy life more than older people .
However , in my opinion , happiness and enjoyment are closely related to a human being 's state of mind , no matter what the biological age of that person is .
Therefore , I do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

One can reason that young people have lesser responsibilities and therefore more reason to enjoy life .
Again , this might not always be the case .

I would like to give the example my friend who was financially supporting his family when we were still in school .
He had taken on responsibilites early in life , however , that did not keep him from enjoying it .
He seemed to be the happiest person in my class .
I think his happness had to do with how satisfied he was with life .

On the other hand some older people do not loose their sense of adventure .
They keep their bodies fit through exercise and use their strength to travel and enjoy the vacations they could not afford when they were younger , due to time or money constraints .

Some older people enjoy hobbies they otherwise never had time for .
I know of a gentleman who started writing poetry after he retired from work .
His poems were greatly appreciated and he soon published a book .

At the same time there are young people who get disillusoned and resort to self destructive or illeagle acts in the pursuit of enjoyment .

In conclusion , it does not matter what the age of the person is .
If a person has a healthy state of mind , he / she will always manage to enjoy , no matter what his / her age .
