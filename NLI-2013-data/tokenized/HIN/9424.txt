The need for understanding ideas , concepts and learning fact of the topic is necessary for a student .
The concepts and ideas in a genetic engineering class will help the student to solve the unknow problems or analysing the results of observation during a research in human evolutation .
Therefore , without understanding concepts a technical education ca n't be completed .
Whereas , learning facts about the same topic is also important but without concepts it ca n't be applied to a subject .
Learning fact are essential during history class .
So , both understanding concepts and learning facts are very important to a student .

As I am a technical student , I would need to understand the concepts of my subject prior to the facts already present .
Therefore , I completely agree with the statement that understanding of ideas and concepts are more important for a student as compared to learning facts .
The doubt between knowing concepts or facts can be cleared from the history of science .
Earlier , scientist who discovered new things never knew any facts about it , they just understood ideas and concept behind an incident before introducing their theories .
For example , observing an apple fall from a tree and understanding the theory of gravity .
Many of the scientist belived in concepts rather than facts .

Facts can be important in learning history , arts and many be sometimes sciences like engineering and medical .
But the importance of the concepts and ideas is manadatory for development of mankind .
When we consider science behind the growth of world , we ca n't forget the importance of concept and ideas which lead to the sciences of particular kind .

Therefore , understanding ideas and concepts is important for a student than learning facts .
For the science and technology to grow exponentialy , we need through concepts of subjects and understanding of ideas behind it .
Computers , wireless technologies , fighter planes , new medicines are the fruit of excellent concepts and innovative ideas of the researchers only .
