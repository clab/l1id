I feel that its always better to understand things and not just mug them up .
Understanding ideas and concepts can lead to a better understanding of the topic .
Also if you get to understand it completely it can help you better in understanding of its related topics .
You would also be benefited at the time of the examination .
Understanding helps you a lot for future .
If you go for research work later in your life then this understanding of topic would help you to take your research easily .

Secondly when you understand a idea then you dont commit mistakes on that particular topic .
For example , if a doctor dont care to understand concepts about the human body , then in future he would be prone towards doing errors .
Also he wont become a successfull doctor in future .
And by destroying a case he would end himself in prison .
So , the example clearly shows how important it is to understand things .
We can also take an example of a computer engineer , where every fact and concept about the machine counts a lot .
And if he is unable to understand ideas then he would just end up in choas .
He would just damage the machine , and we all know how costly these computer machine are .

Thirdly understanding of ideas in a younger age help you a lot when you go and pursue your higher education .
For example , the understanding of concepts at bachelor level help you a lot in understanding of the concepts in your masters .

However , when it comes to the examinations , when you dont have time to understand concepts its always advisable to learn the facts .
At time crises it always better to learn than wasting time in understanding it , because you are never sure that after spending so much time in understanding it , will you really be able to understand it .
Also at the time of quizzes only learned facts help you win the game , and not the understanding of it .
Because there are so many things in the world to know about , and you dont have time to understand there concepts , and only option is to learn it .
As reinstated in my answer understanding is important , it cannot be compared with learning .
Both have there own standing .
