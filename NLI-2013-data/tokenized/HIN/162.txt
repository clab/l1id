` Modernization and Globalization ' accompined with uncontrolled developments lead to energy crisis and lack of resources in coming twenty century .
I agree with the statement as definitely this rapid growth would results in adverse effects on cars availability in coming twenty years .
Though somemay disagree to hold numbers will increase as big boom in market and rapid industralization .

The most important concept of holding the statement as it population is increasing tremendousaly day by day and demand is also high compare to production .
There is concern about to fulfill their demands lead to more cars but also lead to traffic , noice problem .

As today everyone believe in comfort life , good standard of living by using cars .
Nobody is concerning about the result of these would lead to ENERGY CRISIS .
The pertroleum resources are vanishing day by day , and one there would be cars but no oil , which is life of engine .

Similarly , As the cost of crude oil we purchasing from gulf countries increasing rapidly .
This means that in near future it is not affordable to country to rely on it , so automatically it is warn signals to automobile industries like , Tata motors , Bajaa , Honda to think and to take appropriate action .

However , some believe the fact is wrong .
They holds the opinion that nothing will happen as we have technology , talent to find alternative energy sources like Bio-diesel , bio-cells , CNG .
Therefore i strongly believe that the numbers of cars will reduce drastically in coming tweenty years because of modernization , rapid growth , population and pollution and energy crisis .
But i suggest that we should develop some alternatives to maintain growth , to focus on Biodiesel to run cars .
