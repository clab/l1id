I agree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
When we travel to some new place for ex pushkar which is in India , this place is totally new to me and I have no idea on what exactly I should be seeing and look for .
The significance of this place is known to me but other then that I have no clue what exactly it stands for .
Tour guides are those people who will know the in and out of this place and they will have wide range of knowledge about this place and its tourist points .
So once when we reach this place and visit places like Brahma temple which is one of its kind in the whole world , from these tour guides we will get to know more about the temple , the history , other significance etc .
Apart from the temple they will take us to all the other places which is famous or has some other historic standing .
And being in a group its always fun because we can have lot of interactions and have loads of fun .

Apart from this if these tour guides are travelling with us from our starting point ( the place where we departed from ) they will take care of all the hotel bookings , our lunch / dinner , the number of days we need to stay , the amount of time we need to spend at each place and etc .
So we tend to benefit more from them and the extra cost we will have to pay for this will be negligible .

When the tour guide is taking care of all the above things we as tourist can just relax and enjoy the trip .
The whole travel is organised in a proper way and it becomes a wonderful experience to be remembered for life long .
