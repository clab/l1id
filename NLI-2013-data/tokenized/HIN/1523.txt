According to my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject than having a broad knowledge of many subjects because of the following reasons .

Firstly , a person is exposed to different kind of subjects in the elementary school to help him understand his interests .
For example , i liked biology in my high school .
so i chose to become a doctor .
So , i concentrated more on biology so that it helped me when i started my graduate course in medicine .
So , i had good knowledge about ` cells ' and ` reproduction ' than algebra or Geometry .
Even though i had to study other subjects , my idea about them was just to improve my general knowledge and not to go in depth .

Secondly , i would like to mention that if a person speacializes in one particular subject , their is more room for growth and improvement .
Such a person will not be lost in the bundle of different varieties of subject , he will not be confused in his approach to the subject .
He might aswell do good research on the particular subject and write several books and conduct many seminars to share his knowledge .

If a person is not a specialist in a particular subject , he may not be in a position to explore and invent new things in any subject , as the saying goes `` Jack of all trades but master of none '' .
Eminent people world over are being recognised for thier meritorious work in a particular field and not for their works in different fields .
We all study to contribute something to the society God has gifted every indivdual with some hidden talent in a psrticular field and we need to reconise them before its too late .

Concluding , i would like to say that `` its always better to be a Lion in the Jungle than an ant in a colony '' . i will always choose to specialize in one subject than have a braod knowledge of many academic subjects .
