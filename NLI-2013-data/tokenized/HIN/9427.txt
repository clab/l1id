I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

The purpose of education in a particular field is to provide the student with a generic framework of ideas and concepts .
The student understands these ideas and concepts and applies them to complex real world scenarios to provide solutions to problems or to contribute effectively in an industry .
Mere knowledge of facts does not enable the student to solve problems .

Let us consider education in the field of fluid mechanics as an example .
A student learning concepts and ideas of fluid flow can utilize his knowledge to simulate flow of oil in wells and reservoirs and thus contribute to the oil and gas industry .
If he does not have facts and figures he can easily procure them from a library or even the internet .
On the other hand a student who merely memoizes facts and figures may not be in a position to undersatnd their significance in real world scenarios and hence of no value to the industry .

It is human nature to remember and appreciate complex forms of information if they are logical .
Concepts and ideas help the student to visualize the problem in a logical way as compared to mere facts and figures .
Consider for example the study of ecosystems for extinction of certain species .
A student who understands the ideas and concepts of an ecosystem and how a generic eco system works can clearly analyze why a particular species in an ecosystem is becoming extinct at a faster rate than in another ecosystem .
On the other hand a student who has learnt just facts and figures of ecosystems finds it difficult to apply his knowledge extensively to analyze solve complex problems in his field .

Thus we see that by having a good understanding of concepts and ideas enables us to solve real world problems in a more effective manner .
Thus we conclude that the purpose of education can be best achieved by giving more importance to understanding of concepts and ideas then just facts .
