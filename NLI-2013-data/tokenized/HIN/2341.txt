Although it looks that young people tend to enjoy more than older people as the are young , full of energy and free from any kind of ailments .
but on the basis of my personal experience i think if a person plans his life properly his going to enjooy more his oldage than his youth .
he according to me his ` own ' life only when he reaches the fag end of his life and enjoy thye life in its real terms .

let us take an example of a person who has recently retired from his job and a person who has recently joined his job .
As i have said earlier if he is financially strong than he has virtually no worry at all .
since he has no tension of going to office , catching bus etc he can start his day as per his wish .
while the young fellow cannot allow his such wish as he has to attend the office .
By the time a person reaches that age his as suuficed his thurst for achiving new positions , and hence is completly free of mind having no tension of acheving new targets or proposing new project .
On the other hand the young fellow will struggle a lot to make his reputation in the company and also to make his future secure in the company .

mostly old age people by this time are free from their family liabilities , there children are well settled and they have not worry about them , they can spend there money completely accoring to there wish and do every thing that they once wanted to do in their l on the other hand the of so called energetic young person is loses a lot of his energy fighting and keeping himself up in the cutting age competition .
more over many things he cannot do for himself because he has a family dependent on him , he cannot buy his dream car because he has to educate his kid and for that he needs money .

As far health is concern physcially he ( the young man ) may look fit but mentallly his more troubled .
