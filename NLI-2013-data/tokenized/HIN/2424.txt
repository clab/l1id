Young people are usually full of life , and need that extra bit of excitement in life to make the life more meaningful and rewarding .
But , seeing today 's changing corporate habits , one can certainly notice that having fun and enjoying life is now more of a global attitude , whether that be somebody old or young .
But , the people driving this changing mindset , are certainly the younger minds in the business .

If one considers example of one of the major software companies in India and the world , Infosys , one can get a clear idea of how the corporate mindset and behavious is changing with time .
People , young or old , working day and night for the company are continuously looking to get a change in their life , may be by taking a break during the day to play table-tennis with one of the colleagues , or may be by organizing weekend parties at the nearby resort .
This drastic change , in fact is happening across all businesses and societies .
But the changing mindset is certainly coming because of the incoming of the new generation of people in these fields .

The young crowd is certainly the one which like to enjoy life the most , and in fact do so .
One look at any of the city 's most happening clubs and parties , and we can notice the number of young people frolicking those places .
This has brought a sea of change among the mindest of the whole society , and is now even entering the coporate boardrooms .

But , the fact also remains that life is not just about parties and get togethers .
Some people also get the enjoyment of their lives by being engaged in their work .
These people who have the passion for their work , and the drive to excel in the field , see their enjoyments in the work itself .
This can be proved from the example of Sir Richard Branson , who has continuously tried to develop his passion into his work and is hence reaping the rewards of the hard work done all this time .
Such people redefine the age related dilemma about enjoying life , as it brings into the picture more older than younger people who seem to be enjoying their life .

In conclusion , I believe that enjoyment of life is not a factor of someone 's age but instead a factor of the activity which defines ` Enjoyment ' to a particular person .
But , since the change is brought forward in today 's society by the young generation only , there is a majority of younger people who enjoy their life more than their older counterparts .
