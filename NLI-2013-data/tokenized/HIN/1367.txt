An old saying `` A Jack of all trades and a master of nothing '' suggests us that a person should not try to have more of the broad knowledge of each and every subject but should be focussed on a single subject .
So many other sayings were developed in the past related to this thing only like `` Little knowledge is a dangerous thing '' but they were the ones which were stated long years back and are not valid today .

Talking about the present scenario where success has become every man 's need , a person who is just having a knowledge on one subject cannot climb the stairs of a ladder that could lead him to a successfull path .
Its not bad to be focussed but not saluburious in the current era .
Focussing on one subject can have many diverse effects .
Having knowledge on one subject the job areas to which the person can apply will be restricted .
He will be able to apply for some of the jobs only , that could lead to more of frustration and more of tension as he will not be able to apply for jobs that may be could lead to fulfill his major dream .

The present man should try to have as many knowledge on each and every subject as he can .
As in big industries its the sphere of knowledge that matters and not the perfection on one subject .
And once you have got the platform then success is just few steps ahead .
Taking examples from our outside world as that of Miss Aishwarya Rai , former Miss World and a successful bollywood actress .
It was not just her beauty that carried her through such a tough path but her intelligence .
She became Miss World , which is not an easy job , and then got an easy way to enter the film industry .
So as she was perfect in fields including intelligence and beauty , she could reach the doors of success early as compared to the ones who entered the industry at the same time .

So in a nutshell it can be said that a man living in the present day world should try to change the saying stated above to the one `` Jack of all trades and master of Everything '' then only he can survive .
