Johnson & Johnson , a successful organization with lots of patented formulas is inventing still more combinations everyday .
Some of the projects are a big success and some find the way in trashcans .
I believe successful people try different things and involve in a lots of risk than just running behind what they have already achieved .

Life is a series of good and unfavorable things .
No one can stop trying just because it has risk involved in it .
When individuals endavor a task with lots of deligence some times they make it beyond axpected and some time fail .
When people stand up to their life and give everythings they are more likely to become successful .

Successful people have the greed for success .
They willput numerous efforts and try out different methods to make the things happen .
Once someone becomes successful they also go through undetermined pressure to keep their work and give something extra to the community .
Brad Pitti is a successful filmstar but he just can not stop at action movies such as `` Ocean Eleven '' he felt the need to show his art and success by proving his performance in `` Babble '' ( A kind of offshore and intense film ) .

Though people are successful they try to jump further high and take risk and become more successful .
Astronauts have reached on moon but they di not stop there they invented the satelites which can remain in the vicinity and be usefull for ages .

`` Newton '' successfully established his first law but he continued his contribution and work to the community by establishing two more laws of totally different phenomenons .
Success is an addiction .
In stock excahnge market people often engaged in different short term and long term baits and investments .
Once they are successful in one bait they explore the market more and tempted to take more risk for more monetary benifits .

Also when you get success to tend to think more positive about youself and try out many more things which would prove beneficial .
Risk is imporatnt part of every task .
Evene if we start walking on road there is a risk of accident but world simply doesnt stop because life has risk of death .

Moral of the story is successful people try out different trial and errors for the sake of maintaning their success , and sometimes also to offer something new to the community .
