I am in complete agreement with the point of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I feel that is is better to have some knowledge of all the subjects than to have a lot of knowledge in one specific subject only .
Tommorow , if some one appraoches me and asks some question which is related to some very bizzare topic , I may not able to give him or her the exact explanation .
However , I am sure I will be very happy and satisfied with the fact that I will be able to atleast give him or her some basic information about the topic and get the work started .
I think this point of atleast providing some basic info and guiding the start of the topic is far more better than completely being blank about the topic as the topic may not fall under your subject .

We have all heard about the popular proverb `` Jack of all trades but master of none '' .
I prefer to be the Jack and not the Master .
Sometimes it is the demand of the situation or the job profile of the person .
You never know what will your own kid ask you when he or she sees something for the first time .
Not only in terms of family and educating your near and dear ones but also in a competitive atmosphere at work if one shows his abilities and knowledge in a humble way , he or she is bound to be appreciated and promoted .

The best example can be the competitive examinations in India which are conducted to fill up government posts .
These jobs are so demanding that they cover almost each and every subject from the scratch to right till the graduate level .
That again tells us how demanding the job must be because you never know in which department or discipline you will be posted .
So it is always preferable and expected of you to have a prior and basic knowledge of all the major subjects that will be put in practice .

So basically I feel that if one is asked to talk on a bizzare topic or an unknown topic then he or she should be able to talk about atleast some basic points than just going blank .
It is nothing wrong in not having any idea of an unknown topic but it is always at your advantage to know different subjects .
You never know when and where will you need the information .
And then you will be thanked not only by other peole but also by your ownself .
I dont think there is any better definition to the word `` self satisfaction '' than this .
