To make a statement , that in twenty years there will be fewer cars then are today , a person would need to be completely unaware of the current scenario in automobile develoment .
Hence , I strongly disagree with the above statement .

The modern automotive story is one that is spending a lot of money on research and development of various new technologies that will ensure the minimum use of petroleum as their energy source .
Although the current notion about the future of automobiles is that once the supply of crude oil / petroleum is exhausted in the next 50 years , all these cars will have to be taken off the roads .

The above reasoning may be true only if the current level of development is stopped right now .
There are considerable number of newer strategies that have already been developed like ` Fuel cells ' , ` Battery Powered vehicles ' to counter the loss of petroleum run vehicles .
These technologies are already in their testing phase of development , and prototypes have already been run efficiently .
Due to the eco-friendly nature of these cars , it is recieving considerable amount of support from various organizations .
This support has contributed highly to the development of such alternate/hybrid technology vehicles .

Further more , looking at the growth of world population , number of people that will use any kind of conveyance to travel daily , easily surpasses all imaginations .
The growth of new world economies like Brazil , India , China , is producing more number of rich people by the day .
The average global spending power of people have increased over the years and one can easily consider that this growth will continue for the years to come .
This spending power gives people the advantage of choosing their own lifestyle - and an automobile is one of the most important part of a comfortable lifestlye .

Hence , i believe that the assumption , that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from now than there are today , is not justifiable .
According to me , we may assume that the older cars , technologies will be surely be phased out by better alternatives in the coming years .
The number of cars in use should definately go up than the current number as the number of people commuting daily and their needs keep rising .
