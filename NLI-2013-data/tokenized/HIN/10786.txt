Most of the people are happy with the knowledge they have or say they are unconcerned about new topics , while some other type of people , have an appetite to do new things that is try out new things .
My type of category is the second one , So i would go with and agree to the statement - `` Succesfull people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well. '' for their insatiable curiosity , always active and open , risk involved .

Unquenchable curiosity is the driving force behind all the successfull people .
It is this force which keeps them engaged in their work .
As for example , let us consider an scientist .
He is a person always wanting to know how thing work , what will happen next , what would be the response if i do it that way - are some of the question arousing in minds of these mens .
Thomas alva edison is one of the most succesfull scientist & a men with these virtues .
He experimented with around 1200 ideas , and finally invented the electric bulb .
It was this appetite for inventing , rather say doing things differently from rest of the mass made him a successfull person .

Always active and open to ideas is an another attribute of the wise .
They clasp or hug new ideas with open arms .
Isaac newton can be a considered to be a part of this species .
Everyone saw apple falling but only newton was the one to cast doubts by thinking `` why that apple fell . ''

By taking calculated risk they take their bussiness , principles to peak or pass off as an forlorn entity .
A whole lot of people get success by trying out new things differently and innovating an already active idea .
Some of the ingredients of these kind of people is their curiosity towards their work , their open mind and the ability to take risk .
To be successful in life , a person has to be : keen towards his work , open to different views by different peoples and the ability to take some good risk ...
atleast once .
