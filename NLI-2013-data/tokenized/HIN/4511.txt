The saying is true that most advestisments make products seem more efficient or much better than they really are .
I have reached my conclusion due to the following reasons .
Firstly , like the product YOKO height increaser .
Secondly , the advertisements of different chips firms .

Most importantly , The product about which their is alot of comotion in cannada .
Recently , when i was in Calgerry in Cannada their was and adverting that said the only thing that will increase one 's height was this product .
That was all false as when my friend told me about the the same product he used , he told me that the made false claims .
He had being using that very product for an year and still their were no increase in his height .
This shows how different firms in the world make false claims about their products .

Also , at the back of every chips packet their are the names of the ingerdients used of which some are harmful .
But in a promotion , the promoter when asked about the quality of the chips being sold claims that the he/she is selling is the best in terms of health .
Whereas when one consumes the chips finds out that the chips actulaay have some harmul chemical , which would harm the health of the individual .
From a recent incidence in my life , that wa ssince I had consumed a certain kind of chips , which was claimed to be advantages to health had actually caused me cancer .
It didi so due to the pesence of an extremely hazardous chemical .

The above examples explained show how an advertisement display it 's product in abtter smatter and more reliable way than the product really is .
