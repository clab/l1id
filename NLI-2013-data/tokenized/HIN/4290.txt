Youngsters are the very basis of a society .
It is them who are energetic and capable enough to manage a nation and move it on the lines of development .
It is them , who form the very backbone of a community .

According to me , i dont think that it would be appropriate to blame all the youngsters for not helping their communities .
Well , we have every type of individual in every walk and every sphere of life and it would be inappropriate on our part to blame the complete lot of youngsters for a few irresponsible youth .

The youngsters do actively participate in cultural , social as well as technological events in a community .
For example ; as in my country India , economy boost is going on all because of efforts of the youngsters engaged in private sector management as well as technical tasks which is a help to the nation .

Then , we can also consider that many social activists are youngsters who take initiatives to wipe off the evils from the society .
Social refom projects are mainly running in collages and schools now-a-days .
The youth of today is more aware of the right and wrong and at times , is even ready to teach their elders about it .
Also as we all know that the prominent literary artists , sports personell etc are the youth who , by their good work , bring name and fame to their community and society all across the world .

Although , i wont deny that certain youths do not participate at all in their community development , rather spoil their future by getting engaged in useless types of works or in antinational activities .
Or , such people would get addicted to drugs or so .

In the end , i would like to conclude that youth now-a-days is pretty responsible and aware of its duties as a lot and should not be underrated or underjudged .
I would say they are spending almost whole of their time for their community development .
