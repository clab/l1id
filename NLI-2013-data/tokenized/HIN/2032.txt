I believe older people enjoy their life better than the young people .
They have lived their life .
The amount of experience they have is vast .
They know the art of handling various situations .
They live their life among friends .

Old people know the art of enjoying their life better than the young people .
When they were young they amount of opportunities they had were more and the competition was less .
They had fewer universities the amount of research that was happening in the field of science was limited .
No matter the ground roots of scince and technology were kept during their time .
The amount of tensions and the pressure they had to deal was less .
I can say this because of the numerous old people that I have spoken to including my own grand parents .
Whenever I talk to them I gather so much of information that I have to say yes `` The world is not enough '' .
They use to have some problems here and there but during their time the community use to stand as one .
They laugh they share the life time achievements .
Like my grandfather talks about the worldwar II .
How my grand mother waited for him , and use to pray in church everyday for his well being .

Young people on the other hand are more complex of a nature I would say .
They amount of competition that they have to face every day .
Somebody or the other is trying to proove himself better than the other .
These factors lead to tensions , enormous pressure at times and frustration as well .
Generally younger generation is least conecrned of getting involved in community activities , other then once in a while .
Some times we never who is our next door neighbour .
As we the younger generation is more concerned with the privacy .
We are not ready to accept somebody 's help .
We want to remain confined within ourselves .
The young generation might be seen speaking once in a while in community here and there .
They generally are forgetting the natural art of enjoying .
Enjoyment could be going to clubs and bars have some drinks and have fun and come back .

Therefore in my opinion it is the old people who know the real art of enjoyment .
Young generation should take sometime off their busy schedule and spend time with the old people .
We might share love and affection with them and in return gain a lot out of them .
