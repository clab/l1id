I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
History is full of examples of those people who met their goals and realized their dreams by going beyond the ordinary and by taking risks .
To my mind , success and complacence do not go together .
One has to be continually motivated to seek new horizons in life to succeed .

An example of a person who took risks rather than doing what he already knew how to do well is Bill Gates , the chairman and founder of Microsoft .
He left a top ranking University to pursue his dreams of being an entrepreneur .
He could have stayed back and pursued a conventional career but his risk taking endeavours revolutionized the way the world works now .

Richard Branson is another successful business magnate who likes to take risks and try new things .
He learned to dream of the impossible at an early age and his business and life are glaring examples of a successful life , well lived .

Mahatma Gandhi was a lawyer in South Africa and could have stayed in that position his entire life but he decided to change the course of his destiny by being honest to himself .
He was deeply hurt by the colonial treatment and took the biggest risk of his life by dedicating himself to the cause of non violent freedom struggle .

The people who like doing what they already know how to do well will never have the opportunity to expand their horizons in life .
Most of the successful people I have known are the ones who take risks and try different things in their lives .
How can a business expand if they lmit their markets , how can a student get good grades if he is content with his lot , how can a country advance if it is closed to new ideas and change ?
Thus I agree with the above statement and think that successful people take risks and try new things because it is these two qualities that helped them attain success in the first place .
