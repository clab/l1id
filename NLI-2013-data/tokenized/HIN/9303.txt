It often happens in schools and colleges that students do not understand some topic and so cram it up and often forget it during the exam time .
I believe it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

Ofcourse it is sometimes much easier to just learn pre-stated ideas or established facts then to do reseach on a topic .
Take for example , Einstein 's equation of mass and enegy relation : E = m ( c ) 2 .

We might just want to learn it as it is in school , rather than try to prove it like Einstien did , because we neither have the time nor the intelligence to prove it at that level .

However lack of time or `` Einstein 's brain '' is no excuse to just learn every fact as it is .
It is easier to remember information if we try to understand the concept involved in that particular phenomenon .
for example , teaching a 5th grade student that `` sun rises in the east '' is okay , but the student should also understand that it rises in the east because earth rotates from west to east in an anti-clockwise manner .
When a person tries to understand the ideas and concepts , he questions common beliefs and tries to find answers to questions that pop into his mind thus strengthening his inquisitiveness and improving his knowledge .
Understanding a topic , makes it more interesting and make learning easier .
it also makes recalling an idea during exams easier .

Other than just improving one 's own knowledge , while trying to understand ideas by questioning the common beliefs , one might even make new discoveries .
It might make a person curious about a topic or a phenomenon .
Besides , craming makes studying boring and monotonous .
It reduces our concentration level and thus reduces our efficiency .
Thus it is always better to understand ideas and concepts than just learn facts .
