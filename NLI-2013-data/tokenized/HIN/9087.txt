I agree that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts .
The most important part of learning is its application .
Just the knowledge of facts wont take an indivisual to summit of success .
It is when someone can throughly get hold of the idea and concepts , he can create , understand , and anallize things better .

One cannot limit ideas and concepts they can be extended to any dimenssions but on the other hand facts can be concidered just a summarization of the ideas and concepts .
Facts are important as they provide the basic fundamental thinking but they are not the most important one .
If a student just limit himself with the facts he stops thinking , thinking in a new dimenssion .
One stops reasoning himself and try wheather there could be another theory which could support the idea , is a theory fulproof .
All these questions are not asked .
The person cajole oneself to belive it without questioning .

The basis of human existence is to think and work on ideas and concept .
If the fact that earth is flat as initialy propossed was relied on , then we would have never known the truth .
But it is this understanding of idea and concept that the atom contain smaller elements inside we have discovered protons , nutrons and even smaller than that .
Nature is too complex to understand and whatever is not natural can be wrong .

Facts about anything can be printed in textbooks , narrated by teachers but understanding of ideas and concept depends upon ones own perception , once own logical reasoning and that is what real education is about , to think to reason and then to act .
