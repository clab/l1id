A striking feature of the modern world is the explosive growth of information .
We witness a surfeit of information for a wide spectrum of topics .
These topics are disparate and miscellaneous in nature .

Such a scenario offers ample scope for super specialization in any field .
Because of the vast amont of information that exists in every topic , specialists who are the masters of that one topic are in great demand .

Let me explain that statement by drawing an analaogy with a software company .
The massive demand for specialized engineers in the company can justify the statement that super specialists are in great demand .

However , I believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic fields would still be a more favourable proposition than specialising in any one field .

Let me justify this belief .
Consider an investor who must invest his capital in a company .
Having a broad overview of many issues would enable him to invest wisely .
On the other hand , a specialist would be bound by his limitation of knowledge in only domain .

Also , let us consider that software company which was previously discussed .
Sure , it employs specialised engineers but the employee may actually be a manager who has a broad understandingof various facets of his company and not a deep knowledge of any one .
And yet , his post is superior to that of the hired engineer .

Also , anyone who is equipped with knowledge of a variety of fields has the potential to try his hand elsewhere if any one venture does not work out for him .
That gives him the versatility to explore several fields .
The specialist may not have that option .

Today , we see several top companies being led and managed by individuals who may not be specialised in any one field .
This is because these individuals with their broader perspective offer a multi-dimensional approach which is very helpful for any company 's growth .

The final decision depends on every individual 's personal viewpoint .
He might derive greater pleasure from complete mastery of any one subject and may prefer being an unchallenged authority on the same .
I , however , see myself as the manager who ultimately deploys tasks to these specialised engineers .
To me , the manager 's job which involves being involved with sveral aspects and taking an integrated approach towards decision-making seems more exciting .

That parallel explains why I believe having a broad knowledge of several domains is better than specialising in any one domain .
