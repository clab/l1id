Life is a jorney !
To measure enjoyment , one really must look deeper into the lives of people and determine what actually enjoyment to people .

I do not believe in the statement , ` Young people enjoy life more than older people ' , as different people have different ways of enjoying life .
Just because one is old and does not have the strength and energy levels as those of young people does not mean that enjoyment in their life is over .
My grandfather was a very happy man untill I knew him .
He had lived life to its fullest and always wore a smile .
He always enjoyed sitting reading a book on that old antique arm chair of his .
I do not believe that is much of a way to enjoy oneself but it was for him .
He may be deprived of hearing but that did not stop him from watching the television .
He simply looked at the moving pictures , drew his own conclusions and had a good time .
He took enormous pride in smoking the best cigars and tobacco pipes available in his era and enjoyed the fact that he could afford to do so .
What is there in it to be so happy about ?
But that made him happy and he appreciated it .

Young people may well be able to do a lot of sporting activities such as rafting , trecking among other thrilling tasks .
They may be able to attend disco-techs all night and play sports they enjoy at higher levels but that does not mean all the happiness and enjoyment in the world .
Old folks may listen to old classics and enjoy themselves more than being at a disco even in their prime age .

They may enjoy the extra relaxation time they get after retirement and do a lot of things they had in mind that could not have been done while they were young .
They may be able to enjoy their family life more than ever before , especially playing with their grandchildren and seeing them grow up .
One does not get to do all this in his younger age .
Imagine all the excitement and memories they are missing out on .
This does not mean that all of a sudden older people enjoy themselves more .

Old people may look bored and weary but they according to me are enjoying life the most .
My grandfather actually told me of all his childhood experiences and was so happy in doing so .
Even the little things mean so much to them and its these litlle things , that we fail to notice , that bring unimaginable joy to them !

At the end of the day it all comes down to , ` different people , different lives and different ways of enjoyment ' !
