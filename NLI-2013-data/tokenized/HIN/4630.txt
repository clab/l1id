I completaly agree with the point that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and to elplain my point here are some examples which we see in our daily life .

Advertisements are to promote the products and to make the consumer feel that this is something really big for example there is a advertisement for hidden vally ranch salad dressing and it goes like this , there is a girl sitting in her dining room and she takes a bite from her salad boul .
the moment she takes a bite the backgroung of her dining room change and she is presented as sitting in a garden under the tree and all is so nice and green and the weather had change after eating that salad and she is in new land and happy .
The point is can any one really get transfered from a busy and stressfull life of city to a nice and pleasent life of country side ranch by just eating a salad dressing this is not true and they really make product seem better than it really is .

Another example is of the the crest toothpaste in the advertisement it tell that it if u start useing the crest whiteing tooth paste ur teeths will be white as pearl in few days .
But theortically it has been proven that every human being have a different color of there teeth based on the mineralization that took place during the formation of teeth , there surroundings , there genetics some tribe have whiter teeth than the other , there eating habbits etc .
simply brushing the teeth will not make them pearl white .

Another example is of a nutrigrain bar .
In the advertisements it says that just haveing the bar will fill u with energy and u will feel really good and strong .
The actor in the advertisement starts jumping and make u feel like u will be all muscular and strong by just eating one bar .

Conclusion is most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and i totally agree with the point .
