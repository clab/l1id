Cars are an effective and convinient means of transport that can be owned by the individual person .
In future , although the cars may become totally different from what they are right now but in no way there number is going to decrease surely not in the time frame of the coming twenty years .

Cars are not only the means of transport they are passion of an individual .
They also give a sense of independence and a feeling of increased social status to the people .
Also no one wants to depend on the public transport systems beacuse it is not so reliable , it may improve over the time period of 20 years to a great extent but still the problem of waiting for the bus or train and going to the station to catch them will still remain .
Having an own car gives the person the freedom to go anywhere at anytime , while such a facility is unlikely to be introduced in the public transportation system even after twenty years .

Another reason as to why the number would n't decrease is because the price of the cars are reducing rapidly and such a decrease in price may open the new customer bases the so called ` middle class ' who are not able to buy it earlier and thus the number of cars may actually increase to a large extent .
The increase in standard of living of the people will also contribute to this effect .

The main reason that people predict the downfall of cars is because they use petrol and since petrol is limited and it 's prices are soaring a new high all the time , people predict that the running costs will eventually be so high that they will prohibit the buying of the cars .
But the new technological advances in the field of car designing negates all such views .
The car makers are rapidly progressing in designing new cars that burn less fuel per litre .
Also cars that can run on alternate energy sources like electricity , hydrogen and solar power are being developed .
The amount of efforts that are put in this research makes us to believe that we will definitely overcome these problems in the coming years .

In sum , the number of cars in the coming years may actually witness a large increase because of the new technological advances .
The current form of the cars may change , there might be more hybrid cars , cars runnig on elctricity and solar energy , but the passion of cars and the sense of freedom it provides will continue to encourage more and more people to buy cars .
