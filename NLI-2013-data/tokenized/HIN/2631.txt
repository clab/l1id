I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than old people do .
Both these are the stages of life and people enjoy at every stage .
But , I feel that people get more enjoyment at old age .

In young stage , people strive to earn their lives for themselves , for their children and for their parents .
They always work and work to earn more money , more status etc to earn living at that point of time and to save money or invest money for later part of life , which is older age .
Real enjoyment starts when they use the money earned for enjoyment as they are having more free time for enjoyment .

Secondly , old age is the last stage of life when people have seen all the wordly pleasure of life during their various stages of life .
But , in my viewpoint , people gets more satisfaction when they are with complete family including their grand children .
That is the stage when people feel more enjoyment to be with .
People earn money for getting this phase of life with good times .

Thirdly , I feel that in old age , people can do any work according to their liking because they are under no pressure to earn their life .
But , in young age , people remains under pressure to fulfill their dreams and always running after life .
In old age , life comes to a stand still and people enjoy the fruits of the trees what they have planted in young age .
Because of this reason , old age people gets more satisfaction during that time as compared to young age .

Lastly , in old age , people gets more respect in the society which in turn gives more enjoyment towards life .
People at this stage can indulge in activities like temple work , which helps them in soothing their soul .
Beyond this there is no enjoyment on earth which humans can get .

I would like to retierate that people enjoy more in old age as compared to young age .
