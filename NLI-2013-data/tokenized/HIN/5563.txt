I would like to agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .

First of all , advertisements tend to provide a superficial facade to the actual product .
The experience of using a product is subjective in nature and varies from individual to individual .
It cannot be generalised .
The users themselves are the best judges about the quality of a product .
However , advertisements mislead people by generically classifying products as good or useful .

Advertisements rely on the brand value of superstars to convey the message that a particular product is worth buying .
In most cases , superstars themselves dont use products that they advertise .
Public sentiment is manipulated in an unethical manner .
Filmstars who advertise for a particular brand of bicycle would have never pedalled even a few metres .

The sparkling white colour that we see on our television screens after a single wash of a particular detergent is probably because the shirt is new .
Such kind of experiments are not conducted in full public view .
Instead they are carefully framed behind closed doors to convey a particular message .
The authenticity of the claims being made are inconsequential .

The increasing number of complaints being filed by consumers in various consumer forums across the world suggest that someone somewhere is being taken for a ride .
Mineral water is advertised as being pure , only to discover that the pesticide content in the water is beyond permissible levels .
Slimming pills will promise weight reduction in a few weeks time , the fact that the side effects of consuming the pill could also lead to hair loss and fatigue is a well concealed fact .

Advertisements never really tell the full story .
They talk about the brighter side of things but tend to run away from hard facts which go against them .

In conclusion I would like to state that advertisements have become an indispensable part of our lives in the modern world .
However as well informed citizens we should understand that the tall claims being made in those jazzy advertisements need to be substantiated by hard facts .
