I would agree that the best way to travel would be to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
It is very necessary to have a good tour guide who takes the group to all the places in the city , which we are visiting .
There are various advantages of taking a good tour guide .

Firstly , if group is accompanied by a good tour guide then we will be able to see all places of the city which we visit and it would be awesome to visit each and every place of that region beacuse one does not plan trip to the same place again and again .
So it would be a good idea to see all the places in on trip .
If i went alone i might not be able to see all the places due to lack of knowledge of that area .

Secondly , a tour guide will provide me lot of knowledge regarding the art and architecture as well history related to monuments and palaces .
Without a tour guide it would be really difficult to find all this information about any place .
Sometimes we might have difficulty in following local language of people but if we have a tour guide he / she can easliy undertstand the local language and we can enjoy the local flavour of the place we visit .
In today 's fast paced world people dont have much time .
In this case a tour guide can be helpful to complete the trip in very less time as compared to what one might end up spending if one decides to explore the place himself/herself .

To summarize , It will definitely be a very good idea to take a tour guide , who can tell about the place in much more detail and show the place in less time as compared to self exploration of the place .
