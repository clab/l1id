I strongly disagree with the idea that it is more important for students to understant ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .
There are three below mentioned reasons for the same .

First , if a student has a vague idea of a contructive plan this cannot be put to action without taking facts into considerations .
For example , if a student wants to invent a chemical formula or wants to experiment with chemicals to derive some solution but the fact is that the provided chemistry lab is not having enough facility to do it then its a clear waste of time and his contructive thought is in vain .

Secondly , Ideas are hypothetical and facts are real .
For example , many years ago people used to think that sun revolves round the earth but its just not the fact its vice-versa .
If this was taught to everyone of us till date then it would have been like beleiving on a concept or an idea but the facts were reaveled later .
Hence , hypothetical things may be totally wrong and cannot be taught to students but facts are real and should be taught .

Lastly , Importance of learning the facts makes a student more knowledgable and leads him to better acedemic performances .
For example , If one dose n't know why does the earth rotates round the sun or why day-night occur ?
he would be considered a dumb and illeterate and would not be given any value in this industrialised and competative world .
To be a strong competitor we should be striving for knowledge which is based on facts and not ideas .

Understaing the facts and bringing them into practice with all the knowledge is the key to a bright future .
Ideas and concept understading is secondary to learning the facts .
