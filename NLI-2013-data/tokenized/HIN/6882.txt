I totally disagree with the statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . ''
Its was seen that in last twenty years their was big change in the world of automobiles and in the manufacturing industries of automobiles .
People are got edicted to the most sufficient and more easy way of transport to reach their respective destinations .

In todays fast tracking ( moving ) life every one is used of his own way of transport .
People want to reach their offices , colleges etc in short period of time .
Now seeing this rapid growth of population and technology in every part of the world everyone is least concernd about money .

In todays life everyone is fond of the most convienient way of transport to go to their destination and in this competitive world every one is doing their best to get satisfied with what they do and what they get .

Seeing to all these options every one trys to have a vehcile of their own and which can be comfortable for ones family .
Since their is huge competition in this world of bussiness every company are giving their best in their source .
Everyone wants to go out and have some fun with his family members , so to go out for a picnic with family the most easy way is to have a car of own so that one can enjoy his time with his family .

In this generation and in this competition the price of the car has come down and today an ordinary man can buy a car .
By seeing the competition in the market each company is giving their best in the least price which they can and having much profit also .
Even some banks are providing 0 % interest on car loans .

So by seeing this competition and rapid growth of technology cars are becoming much affordable now .
Therefore i can say that in the coming twenty years there will be more numbers of cars as they are in present but not fewer from todays number of cars because people choose the most easy and simple way of transport for their sake and the number of cars will increse in coming future but will not come down .
