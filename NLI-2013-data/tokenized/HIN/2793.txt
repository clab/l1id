I completely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
There are many reasons for this agreement .

Firstly , young people take more rescue than older people .
They can start any new venture , they can get into any new adventure .
While older people being experienced and having lack of energy are not ready to take rescue .
I belive to enjoy a life one needs to be ready to take new paths which will require rescue taking abilities which generally youngsters are fully equipped with .

Secondly , young people are very immature as compared to older people .
Being immature they can take fun in small activities , gossips , hangouts with friends .
They have not seen the hard parts of life so they tend to believe everything and try to take things light heartedly and enjoy whatever they are involved in .

Thirdly , older people have fewer friends as compared to youngsters .
Friends are the most important means to achieve happiness and to enjoy life .
Having few friends make older people feel lonely since they have few people to share their joy and happiness .
On the other hand , youngsters are always busy with friends .
Youngsters have too many people around them to share their achievements and happiness .

Fourthy , older people are misers .
To enjoy life I believe one needs to spend money on his comforts and luxuries .
Money can bring the means to enjoy life .
For example one can go for a world tour if he can afford to do so .
Older people do not prefer to spend money on unncessary things , while youngsters enjoy spending money on friends , parties , travel .
Because of being misers older people prefer to spend time at home .
They do not believe in parties and always try to save every penny .

In sum , I believe young people have more fun in life than do older people have .
