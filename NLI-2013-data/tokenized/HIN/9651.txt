There is no direct answer to this question it all depends upon the situation .
i do agree witht he statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' but on the other hand i also diagree with this statement .
peolpe should try new things too and take risks but on the other hand they should also try to do things that they did wrong .
not all but most of the successful take risks and try new thing because doing that they get new ideas and they come to know different thing and people .
this risks taking quality help them to rise from their expectations but also throws them down beyound their expectations .
poeple who try doing things which they already know help them to become professionals and perfect in thier field .
this help them to stay where they are and does not help them to rise and if they want to rise they have to risks which are important .
there is a famous saying that : `` practice makes a man perfect '' so this is suitable for the people who are not risk taker but tryies to do things what they already know and by doing that they are trying to make themselves perfect .
all this is also dependent upon much knowledge a person as about the particular thing or topic and also on person 's luck .
for example my father and his friend studied in the same school and they both graduated at the same time from the university .
both are successful person in their fields my father is lawyer and his friend is an engineer .
on day both stood against each other my father was arisk taker while his friend was n't .
both were fighting for the same contract at the court but due to my father 's luck and ability of taking risks at that time his whole carrer was at stake but finally he won and his friend who di n't take the risk lose .
this tells us that taking risk is not useful all of the times it can lead you to faliure and on the other hand it can also help in the victory of a person like in my father 's case .
in the i would say that it all depends upon the situation , your personal experience , knowledge and most important the luck .
