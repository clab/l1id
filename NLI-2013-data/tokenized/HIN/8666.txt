I am in complete agreement of the statement that its more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , due to several reasons .

First , understanding of any concept or idea or one can say the concept behind the idea will ultimately lead to the `` fact '' .
At this stage students will be able to figure out the underlying principles behind the fact .
In other words they will be able to understand the principle governing a fact .
For example , if you throw anything upwards it will come down , this is a fact .
Now in other words we can define this phenomenon by first introducing the concept of Gravitational Force .
Moreover if add a little detail to the concept that if something is thrown at its certain velocity will not return to earth , it becomes more interesting .
Now at this stage the student has understanding of the concept fo gravitaion .
He will be able to understand the rules guiding the fact and he would move one step further to understand that critical `` velocity '' .
This makes learning more fun and open doors for exploring ideas .

Secondly , learning only facts without their understanding will invoke sense of mugging .
The students will not bother about the hidden principles and this will restrict their scope of education .
In the general situation also we hardly bother about other routs to a destination if we have a shortcut , if it fullfils your requirement , even though its congested and polluted .
So its a general human tendency .

Finally , if we limit our scope of knowledge then what would happen to the billions of books in the liberary ?
Isnt it worth thinking of ?
Access to the knowledge is a fundamental rite , limiting learning to facts only will definetely hamper in one or the other way of a persons fundamental rite .
