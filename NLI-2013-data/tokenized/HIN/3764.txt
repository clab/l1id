I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Being young myself , i can mirror my experiences and provide reasons why young people are not giving enough time to help their communities .

First of all , its a competitive world these days .
The day the child is born , the parents of the child start preparing a road map for their child and before the child can understand anything about life he is on his way to reach that perfect goal .
In the run for that ultimate achievement , he gets so occupied in his own struggle that he forgets that there 's a community also which needs his service .
As he struggles harder he gets more and more self centered .
In the fast pace of todays world , when everything is getting nucleated , people are loosing touch with each other and that is one big reason the young people are finding less and less time to help their communities .

Another similar reason is that as the world is becoming smaller and globalised , people are moving from their native places to newer destinations for jobs or personal reasons .
This shift makes them loose touch with their communities as they struggle to get absorbed in the new place .
With successive generations , they get farther and farther from their native culture and community and at the same time they do not feel one with the new community they become a part of and because of this reason they are not able to contribute fully to the new community also .

Furthermore , there has been a degradation in morals these days .
The spirit of community over oneself has given way to more selfish aspirations .
One factor that I would ascribe to this degradation is lack of interest on the part of parents to teach their children properly and give them lessons in community work .
As the parents themselves are occupied in their life they forget to teach their children a lesson or two about community service .

Finally , there has been a growing tendency among youngsters to look at the government for welfare work .
They feel it is the government 's duty to help in the development of communities .
They do not actively participate because of their expectations from the government .
What is required rather is a more active role from young people in helping their communities and realising their duty towards the community .
