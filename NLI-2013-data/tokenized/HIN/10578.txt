I think that new things in life can be discovered only if there is a perfect observation .
If it wo n't be there then it 's not possible to discover new things .
Some belive that taking risks in life you may go ahead but others think that it 's better to do what we know .
But i think that successful people try new things and take risks .
I have several reasons for holding my opinion .

If a person is working in a factory and his boss has alloted a particular work and he is confused then it will be difficult for him to do that work .
But if he takes risk and try to solve that problem then it would be very easy to help his boss .
Even , scientists are inventing more things by taking risk .
For an example , while inventing a computer it was difficult for them to select what was necessary for inventing it .
But , at that time if they would not have taking risk then it would be difficult for them to invent a computer .
I would like to give an example of an everyday 's life .
Some people spend there money in buying lottery tickets by taking risks .
But if they will get double money then it would be useful for them .
And as such they will be beniffited by taking risk .
if a person is shy or is not ready to take risk then he might miss an opportunity in getting scholarship .
if he thinks taht his score is very low then he is unable to apply his result in different universities .
and probaly he will have to waste his future .
As a result of risk our country is progressing economically .
if we would n't have taken risk then we would be still standing at that same placewere our ancesstors were .
So , i think that taking risks in life successful people try new things .
