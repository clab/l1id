I would definetly disagree with the statement .
I say this because i am of the opinion that nobody is good at everything .
Students cannot cope up with the pressure of learning and handling such vastly diverse knowledge .

To have such a general base of knowledge with many subjects at once can bring in the effect of a student not being good at any of them .
I agree that there are cases where some exceptional students might be good at many subjects , but thats not the general case .
The general student can take only so much amount of knowledge .

I believe that one must learn aleast one thing perfectly rather than half-learn a hundred things .
In today 's world of highly advanced technologies there is too much information and knowledge to learn and it becomes hard for student to master even one subject perfectly .
Such being the case , a broad array of subjects will only increase the strain on the student , which may lead for him to get confused about the actual subject that he is really interested in .

For example , what good does a math student get from learning chemistry ?
It will only put him through a lot of strain to learn a thing which he really is n't interested in .

And i think it is really bad for students who have a focus in their life and have set goals to excel in a particular field , to have many academic subjects .
It will only bring down their enthusiam and zeal to learn more about their favourite subject .
And in events like when they fail to clear a subject which they dont like , they have to end up studying it all over again .
This only adds to their stress and delay in trying to study what they actually want to study .

Also , people who get the oppurtunity to learn what they rally like will definetly excel in it .
Their brains will work better for the subject they like .
And it will unfair to judge everyone by the same yardstick if we have many subjects .
I mean to say that while some people will be good at one subject they might fare really bad at the rest .
So u cannot have a common benchmark as such , to judge their talents .

And so i totally disagree with the statement that `` it is better to have a broad knowledge of academic subjects rather than specialize in one subject '' .
