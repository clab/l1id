jack of all trades but a master of none .
what would be the position of a person in todays ' world who has a broad knowledge in many academic subjects instead of specializing in one or being an expect in one .

i believe that a person should specialize in a specific field and then excel in that specific field .
as today it is the time for professionals and so each and every sector in the world is looking for experts in that particular field .

for exmple a person who is not specialized in the field of computers , but has a vast knowledge of everything where would he be standing in the world of computers , no where , as he wont be able to have the integreity of and wont be having the complete knowledge of computers .

if one has to succees in life he should get in a particular field he/she is interested in and should excel in that only .
now days every person has knowledge about most of the things in the world , but can that person be a successful person in particular .
it is also stated in english literature , in the famous greek play Dr. Faustus .
though he had the knowledge of each and everything he was fooled to give up his soul just to know the knowledge of black magic .

i even support the counter point that a person should not restrict his/her knowledge but even the a person should be a master of one and then of course become a jack of all trades .

a person can always move forward , but i believe with something in his hand on which he can fall back on .
at least that specialization is there with him .
now days surverys have proved that a practical person i preferred to a doctrinaire. a person who is totally based in theories if does not think about the praticallities of life , how will people consider him over the other .

thus , in the same way i believe that a person should be the master of one and then the jack of all other trades .
