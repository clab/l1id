It has been said that knowledge and free thinking form the basis of any successful society .
The maxim completely describes todays world which has seen a tremendous desire to achieve milestones previously unimaginable .

For any society to grow we require an understanding of previous knowledge and also an account of our past achievements .
But would it not cause stagnation if the sole purpose of learners was to be aware of these facts and learn them ?
Progress can only be made if we analize our past and learn from them .
Analizing can only come through a proper understanding of ideas and concepts .
Luckily throughout history we have seen mavericks , be it Galileo or Newton or even someone as recent as Einstein , who went against the tide to come up with ideas that allowed the next generations to flourish .

Were it not for our unending thirst for knowledge we would still be living in the stone age .
This is self evident fron the way kids grow and learn from their surroundings .
A baby may never learn how to walk or talk if its brain did not possess the ability to grasps the required steps involved in this complex process .
In this case it may be understanding subconsciously but if we want a robot to simulate the actions of a child we would first require a complete understanding of the involved steps .
Only after this can we put newer ideas into making machine emulate man .

As students it is much more important to understand ideas and concepts during our college years .
This is the time when we not only learn new things but also contribute to the society as a whole .
Be it in any field ; even activities like dancing and singing have evolved over time due to our constantly changing approaches .
Our world today is a technological world and needs constant changes owing to the ever increasing demands .
Computers are becoming increasingly comlpex and faster at the same time .
The computer was invented because of someones tremendous visions but little would he have realized its sinificance in todays world .

We students are the new work force of the future and are aware of the needs of todays world .
Despite all the progress we have made we suffer from difficulties in all countries rich or poor .
Our understanding of the world , its people and the interrelations have just evloved .
Yes we do require facts to account for the details and observations we have made .
But it would serve no purpose if it is not backed up with proper interpretaion and newer ideas to better our future .
Our future , thus , depends on how well we understand ideas and concepts and come out with newer ones .
