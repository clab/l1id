I believe that in the next twenty years there will be decline in the number of cars used today .
There are a few reasons why i think so Firstly with the immense growth in the population and scarcity of space available to live and commute would decrease the number of cars .
This is because travelling on the public transport would be much more convenient than standing in the long traffic jams .

Second reason would be coming up of highly safe and convenient public transport systems .
The government is working on such issues and by the end of twenty years would have excellent transportation system like public buses , trains , trams and metros which can take the person to his destination in much less time than the individual cars .
e.g in capital of India i.e. Delhi , with the coming up of metros a lot of time is saved by the people working and commuting through cars .

Third reason i believe is spiralling prices of gas and petrol because of huge demand .
This high cost of driving cars would discourage their use in coming years and will lead to fewer cars in use than there are today .

The non-renewable sources of energy used to drive cars are getting finished up slowly and slowly and fifty years from now would be a time when we would have no fuel left .
So switching to public transport will also solve the problem and slow the process of depletion of these resources .

Also with the increase in inflation in Indian economy , the common man is looking for alternate means to cut down the costs .
So if a much viable and convenient solution is available then he would surely switch over to the use of cheap and better modes of transport .
All these reasons combined would make the common man to willingly come out of his luxury of cars and use cheap and time - effective means of transport like buses , trains etc .
