I do n't think that it 's important for students to understand ideas and concepts as compared to learn facts .
I think ideas and concepts help the students in learning in their intial classes only .
In my opinion , the facts are more important to learn as they are used in long run .

For example , I was a student of the physics class .
As part of our course structure we have numerous derivations to understand the idea behind a particular fact .
At that time I used to cram all the derivations in order to get good marks .
But now at this point of my age I can just able to remember what was the fact not the idea or the concept behind it .
Like I remember that what is the density of water but I do n't know how to calculate it .

So , I belive that students should more concentrate on facts than understanding ides and concepts .
