The statement given here is a little tricky .

It is difficult to state agreement or disgreement becose it varies from person to person .

Let us take an example for this one of my friend did his bachelor in mathematics which has no relation with architecture , or as such like interior design , than he took addmission in to electronics where he speciallised in Light products .

Now after doing this two totally different courses today he is the leading personality and expert in lighting .

He has great knowledge of arranging liting in a perticular space wether it is a garden or planetorium or may be an art gallery .
One day he opened up the reason behiend his success he told that mathamatic helped him in the electronics to making and understanding the perticular lighting products for implication at perticular space .

And that is the way how multiple academic subjects helped him to achieve in his life .

Where in the another case the other friend since he was 10 he was preety intrested in temple architecture - influnced by his father who is an architect - he kept working on the same topic and he took specialization in temple archtiecture , later on he join a research programe in the University , and he togetherly found a new kind of construction method to construct the temples .

After having a kind of two different examples in my life I personally feel that if a person is keen intrested in a perticular direction or topic they definately achieve in it ; and give something very special to the society .

where as if a person is not decided or confirmed about his intrest of field but he is genuine in what he/she studies , thay may also generate something very special after having multideciplinary acadamic subjects .

Both the way the important thing is what we , must do the best .

But i personally more favouring of many academic subjects , becose that knowledge may affect a lot in taking decission at later time of carrier selection .
