Cars have been considered to be one of the most important inventions of mankind , which went a long way in enhancing his mobility .
Today they have been transformed from the status of a luxury to that of a necessity .
It is for this reason that there has been a noticeable surge in the number of cars .
However , twenty years hence , the scenario would be quite different , and I firmly believe that the present day volume of cars is just the tip of an inverted ` U ' and would defnitely go down in the time to come .

The foremost reason why I believe that the number of cars would be less two decades later is based on the present day status of fuels .
The utilization of petroleum resources is already at a considerably high level and their cost has seen a high increase in the last one decade .
The exorbitant price of the fuel would definitely deter the consumers to go for cars .
Adjunct to this , this premise is based on the their very availability ; given the fact that petroleum is a non-renewable sources of energy , it might just become extinct in two decades .
One might resort to other fuels like hydrogen and fuel-cell based cars , but they are yet to go a long way in terms of their popularity among the general public .

Secondly , with rising pollution levels , the government might resort to taking preventive measures by putting a ceiling on the number of cars owned by an individual .
It might even consider to discourage the buyers simply by raising the tax slabs .
An average consumer , thus , might look for alternate means to commute .

Emanating from the same argument , the government might also take some positive steps , like making public transport more efficient .
A meticulously designed and managed chain of public transportation systems likes buses and local trains would certainly encourage even the car owners to opt for them .

I also presume that two decades later most offices would switch from the time-consuming ` manual ' mode of functioning to an ` electronic ' way .
With excellent internet based working environment , one might not need to commute at all ; added to that everybody would be highly accessible .
Hence , such a work environment would also imply a lessening of the reliance on cars .

The preceding assertions have been put forward in context of the supply side of the story ; on the consumers ' side too there would be some changes in their perception .
Cars would no longer remain a status-symbol .
People would become increasingly aware of the ill-effects of pollution and would surely like to contribute their share in reducing it by decreasing the use of car as their prerferred mode of trasnportation .
In general , an overall increase in the level of awareness of the users would in itself lead to a decline in the number of cars .

Taking all these points into consideration , I can say with a good degree of confidence , that the number of cars would definitely decline in the future .
Afterall , all of us want to make this Earth a better place to live in .
