I disagree with the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I disagree with this because of the several reasons .

The first reason why I disagree that there will be fewer cars is that the main cost associated with the maintenace of the car is Petrol .
Many people do n't want to buy a car because of this cost .
With the growing technologies people might come up with substitute of Petrol .
And then it would be easier for many people to maintain the cars at low cost .
So they will tend to buy more cars .

The second reason why I disagree that there will be fewer cars is that it could be more cheaper in future .
There are many people who wants to buy cars but they are not able to afford it becasue they do n't have the sufficient money or the car loan interest rate is too high .
So in future if the new cars with low cost will be introduced it will be easily accessable by each class of the society .
Or it is possible that with the growth of economy people can avail loans at low rates , that will again help them in buying cars .

Third reason for expectation of more cars in future is that people are now leaving in the joint families .
One car can be used by the whole family .
As these days these ideas of joint families are not liked by many people , there is a consistent growth in nuclear families .
In such case each nuclear family will need a seperate car .
So that will increase the number of cars in use .

After considering all these factors I would like to conclude that I disagree with the statement that in future there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
With the expectation of growth in each field wether it 's technology or economy or any other field we can surely expect that more cars will be used in future .
