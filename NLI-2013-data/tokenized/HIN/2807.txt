I whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people .

Enjoyment is a feeling which is felt by people in all age groups .
There are certain times when each age group enjoys more than the other , all depending upon the problems faced by the age groups which are different in magnitude and time of occurence .
Both younger as well as older people have problems to face in life .
Each age group 's enjoyment is curbed because of these problems , but the enjoyment is never far away .
Lets take the example of a young boy .
He does not enjoy when he has to give exams , study , or go to school .
However , he enjoys when he goes to play , or when he watches television .
In the same way an adult ( middle aged ) does not enjoy going to work , or working around his or her hosehold .
But they do enjoy when they come back from work , when they are on a holiday , or when they go to a party .
In case of old people as well , they enjoy as they do not have much work to do and live comfortably on their pension funds .
But they face problems regarding their health .
So this way every age group has its own share of enjoyment and problems .
We cannot draw a fine line comparing who enjoys more or less as there are various factors such as time and society which decide that .

Along with this there is also the fact that one 's enjoyment can be another 's problem .
In case of children , they enjoy playing more and studying less .
The adults ( parents ) have problems with that , which curbs their enjoyment to see their child study .
When the child is forcefully made of study , then the parents enjoyment becomes the child 's problem .
In case of old people , their enjoyment is that they do not need to work .
But this is a problem for the adults ( middle aged ) as they become a burden on them .
Due to this the old people are sent to shelter homes where it is a problem for them , but enjoyment for the adults .
This way everyone 's enjoyment is interlinked , because of which we cannot state who constantly enjoys more and who constantly enjoys less .

Therefore , using these two reasons , I support my stand that it is a false statement that young people enjoy more than old people .
