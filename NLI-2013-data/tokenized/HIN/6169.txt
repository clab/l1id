The topic of usage of cars in the coming years is quite controversial .
on one hand the reducing fuels and correspondingly increasing prices are a threatening forecast about the reducing usage of cars in the coming years .
while on the other hand the ever increasing craze for new and powerful cars in perpetual .
but after a comprehensive analysis i come to a conclusion that the in the next twenty years their will be a certain incrimination in usage of cars .

The relish that one enjoys while driving is not easy to interpret in words .
i mean increasing interest in cars had led to some popular personalities like michael shumacher and kimi raikkonen .
they are being idealised not because they world champions and have too much money to count but because of the driving craze among youngsters .
the improved cars are more powerful then one would have imagined some decades ago .
well , this is what teenagers look for isnt it , they have fun driving swiftly and i dont think their interest in going to abate .

Not just the youngsters but every age group enjoys a ride .
its certainly the most comfortable way of commuting .
everyone enjoys freedom of a ride which obviously will not be realized in a bus or a tram .
and of course the safety reason is what we expect while driving , as the new technology keeps an affirmitive of safety of passengers ( air bags ) .
well , pretty blatantly more safer then bikes if one is going to consider that option .

But the reducing fuel resources and considerable increase in prices cannot be overlooked .
the reducing oil resources which wont last for more than a couple of centuries are certainly a predicament .
but here is the the modern scientists `` even they cannot imagine a world without cars '' have discovered new technologies as a source of fuel for cars .
firstly the electric car was invented but since the power output could not queer the society , the scientists did not finish their quest .
they further devised hydrogen run cars .
and today the hybrid cars with even better performance then the typical that are being used foe decades ( oil run cars ) .

So , all the discussion held above infers to the very pleasing fact that cars are perpetual not just for next twenty years but many yeasr to come .
and even if we come through some obstruction , our resourceful scientists will provide it with perputation .
