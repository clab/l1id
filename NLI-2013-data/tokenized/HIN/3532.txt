I do not agree with the statement that the young poeple nowadays do not pay much attention to helping their communities .
In times of urgent need , the young people are always on the forefront in helping others .

It is true that the young people are nowadays are much more carefree than the previous generations .
However , this does not mean that they are apathetic to the isssues concerning their communities .
Take children for example .
With the help of their school and parents , students are always known to conduct cleanliness and health awareness drives .
Recently the children near my block were collecting donations from everyone in the suburb to help the old people of the country .
The schools are playing a very vital role in encouraging the children to take such initiatives .
Children as a part of their extra activities tend to go door-to-door creating awarensess about issues like proper usage of plastic , health and sanity , spread of diseases etc .

The younger generation is also actively help their communities in case of emergencies .
Due to increased use of technology , the younger generation is much more aware about the incidents all over the world .
Youngsters tend to motivate people to act against unjust decision and rules through active responses .
Recently my country was plagued by a huge earthquake rendering thousands starving and homeless .
The help that the youngsters offered was tremendous .
Thousands of young volunteers with foods and supplies arrived overnight to help those in need .
All the student bodies in colleges and universities collected cash and kind to help the disaster stricken population .
I know many friends who regularly volunteer to feed and cook for the poor .

It is true that present generation has some flaws .
It has become much more indifferent to political issues and developments .
But taking into account all the factors , it would be unfair to generalise their behaviour as negligence .
