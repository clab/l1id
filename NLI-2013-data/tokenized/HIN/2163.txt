Younger people enjoys life more than the older people do .
I will go with this , although it is said that one should be younger at heart rather than by your age .
Another saying says that you should be younger at heart to enjoy the life to the fullest .

Young people are always envied by the olders that they are having more fun .
It is true since younger people has all the time , enthusiasm as well as the energy to enjoy the life till maximum .
The younger generation involves themselves into lot of extra-curricular activities .
The younger generation have all the time for all the enjoyments .
After their studies they do not have great responsibilities to take care of .
Thus they are free to do all the stuff what they want .
The younger lot has got all the companions in the form of friends to enjoy the time they are having .
Enjoying or having fun becomes more when you are having a friend .
Moreover the younger people are a lot energetic to carry out the adventurous stufs of camping or touring .
While youger lot are able to get away with anythiny they do .
They are not responsible to any of the action or to say they are not bothered what others have to say .

As the person grows older he is bond into varuious social rituals .
He is now married and having family .
The life of a older person is distributed into various phases like private life , family life , professional life etc .
Now the man is carrying various family , professional and social responsiblities .
After all these things he is left with a very limited time or resources to enjoy the life .
Although its much needed to say here that they meaning of enjoyment changes here .

But keeping the fact that younger people enjoys the life more , it should be taken care that they do not run on to the rough patches .
The younger lot is very much vulnerable to get spoilt , so its becomes duty of the younger people that they should \ take care of these things and thsy also should be the part of the enjoyment along with the younger generation .
