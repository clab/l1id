It is well said that the first 20 years or the time till college is the golden time in a person 's life .
I fully agree with the point that the young people enjoy life more than the older people do .
Some of the reasons to it are that the youngster has less responsibility on his shoulders , youngsters are innocent and which helps them to enjoy each moment and moreover youngsters have more zeal to learn new things .

Firstly I would say that the youngsters have very less responsibility on their shoulders and are supportd by the parents having said so it helps them to enjoy every moment of life without thinking of tomorrow .
Eg a youngster will not have to think how to earn a livelihood for him or how to support his family behind at home but for a older person all these are a big task .

Secondly , I would say that the youngsters are innocent and have a lot of people behind him to explain the pros and cons of a situation on the other hand a old person will think on his own .
Eg a youngster has a lot of guys to guide him if he has to make a career move on the other hand if an old guy has to take a business decision he will have to do on his own .

Thirdly , youngsters have a zeal to learn new things and explore them on the other hand an old person may have apprehensions on doing that .
For eg a young person will be very entusiastic visit new places explore new things which a old person will not be able to do may be sometimes because of the time constraint and sometimes because of physical constraint .

Thus we can conclude that a youngster can enjoy life much better with no strings attached to the family in terms of earning the livelihood as well as physical constraints and time restrictions .
