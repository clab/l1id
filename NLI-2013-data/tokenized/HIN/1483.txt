The issue over having broad knowledge over the specific knowleadge according to me would depend on the level of education and general to specific is the right hierrarchy .
If the person is at the undergradulate level , it would be wiser and more beneficial for his rest of the life to take a broder knowledge than just in specific feild .
For insatnce If s/he has taken admission into general medical science then person will get to learn all possible subjects such as paediatric , or neurology or say ENT , then once he get exposure , he can actually decide in which area he more inclines to , then accordingly s/he can major into any of the subject .
But if he doesnt get exposure to all these how wil s/he decide which is his aea of interest .
Person can keep studying or doing research in his rest of life if he is really make decision of his area of interest , which is possible only after taking general knowlege then specififying to a certain knowledge .
Just imposing studying will never make the person reach the the higest goel .

In addition to that if everyone for that matter gets chance to know their area of interest in other word get specific knowledge their feild will be of great help to society since they will be contributing lot in inventing things thereby helping to solve the problems which are yeat be digged .

Following general o specific pattern would also means taking or sharing knowledge from one feild to another feild .
For example if somebody has taken few subjects in electronics and few in audiology , and later they find that audiology is thier area in which they want the have indepth knowlwdge .
But in that felid implemening principles of electronics may lead some new discovery , which in any case wouls be impossible if person has knowleadge in onw area only .

Bringing one field knowlwdge to other feild can make the person more thouhtful , imaginative , and more inventive .
There are other adavantages too for a person from general to specific knowleadge , such as he can upgrade his knowlwdge as and when he feel if he has general orientation to it .
Also general to specific will lead to attend different classes , interaction with different speciality of professor and making frinds with different area of interest , who may be helpful in future if you need any assisatnce when you are trying to get combine two or more feilds and get rid of many social problems .
One exapmple of this kind is twchnology of cochlear implant for hearing disables people , it took years for deaf person to speak , socilaise like anyother talking child .
This was possible due to implant , which not a just contribution of one feild but knowlwdge sharded from eletronics , computronics , audiologist , surgeon , speech pathologist .
If you want to have help from all these different faculty and really create wonder like cochlear implant you must have general to specific approach in studies .
