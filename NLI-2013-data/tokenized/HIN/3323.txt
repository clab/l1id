The prase quoted `` YOUNG PEOPLE NOWADAYS DO NOT GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO HELPING THEIR COMMUNITIES '' is a factor that lots of adults think may be true .
But , I totally disagree to this .

Youth of today is very enthusiastic of their given responsibility , there job & their concerns regarding the work that they need to put forth .
In this fast paced life of today , with severe competition that comes along from every corner of there life , this makes it imposible for the youth to dedicate much time toward there community or to say any social cause they wanna do .

They are so engulfed into the work , they already have very less time to just be by themself .
Well one may consider that these are the reasons for a youth to not do the helpage required .
But , I would like to say that inspite of the hardlife they have developed these youth never forget where they are & what they stand for .

Many youth take time out of there busy schedule to dedicate time for the community they live in .
These youth have actualy even started making there voices be heard .
For example , the recent Medical Quota that the government had proposed for the beneficiery of the so called lower class of the community at the expense of merit was greatly put forward by the Medical student .
Not because they did not want the upliftment of the community , that was socially biased by are ansestors , but for the the fact that they just wanted these seats to be given to the more deserving student who may be in a very economically challenged & brilliant student .

Todays youth are more about general development than a development in a particullar area .
They just love experimenting in life .
The youth of today has gone ahead of voice their opinion , to stand for themself in the purest of all the heart that is need .
Inspite of the on going corruption thats eating our nation from every corner they stant to eradicate them for the better future .

There lives in the fast-lane showns that they want to be quick in the decision making to solving problems .
Todays youth is about Practical approach towards life that theoritical approach .
So , according to me today the youth is there & they are giving enough time to the community for a better future .
They will always be there .
