i totally agree with this staement .
there are so many items i have bought seeing there advertisements but most of the time it is not as good as it was shown on the tv .
for example once i bought a face wash.according to the advertisement it makes the skin very soft and a shade lighter .
forget making the skin lighter , i even got skin rashes .
i beleive its all business tricks .
in this world of competition where all the companies are fighting to prove there product the best .
advertisements are very important medium .
all the companies want to make profit and do well in the field .
but i beleive they should not do this ...
because indirectly they are cheating there customers .
ok say , once you can buy the product by seeing its good advertisement , but as soon as use it , you know the quality of it .
i feel that they should focus more on the quality of the product then the advertising the product .
if the quality of the product is good and it is worth using customer will definetly buy it .
i do agree that good advertisement forces the customer to buy the item the first time so it also very important to have good advertisements .
