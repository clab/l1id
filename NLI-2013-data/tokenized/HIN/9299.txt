Earlier people used to study and by-heart their topics in order to gain high grades in exams .
Those who scored high were praised for their hard work and effort.a student gaining the highest was considered to be more knowledgeable and the most brilliant of all .
Those ones who devoted lesstime in studying and more time in thinking wre thought to be less sincere .
Gradually the trends changed .
Hence a drastic change occured and more attention began to be paid to research tasks and the pace of understanding the conceptual factors related to a particular topic .
This opened the minds of many creative people .
This sense of understanding slowly began to establish even among school going children so as to ponder about what topics had they learnt , how and why a respective phenomena occured etc .
It is not always necessary that learning a specific chapter will help an individual to enhance the skills required .
A particular memorised lesson ca n't prve to be the boon to answer the questions during exams unless we posess the thorough concept of the related subject .
Dedicated hard work in creating a conceptual underatanding pays a lot as compared to the mugged-up tasks learnt in aless period of time .

Albert Einstein is a brilliant example in this regard .
He had been punished by his history teacher during his childhood because he had never been interested in studying the past unless knowing the proofs to certify the previous events .
He shared the same feeling with that teacher as he was not interested in learning the gone istead of innovating new and apt ideas .
Hence his strong capability to think made if fa famous scientists of the time .
So inculcating profound thoughts into our minds in place of memorising can help us to attain better knowledge and create a global and broad approach in any sphere of knowledge .
