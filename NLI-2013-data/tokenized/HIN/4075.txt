Party going , loud , naughty , nasty fast drivers , rule breakers ...
these are some qualities that people accross nations , countires and communities associate youngsters with .
They always think that it is them , who are the black sheep .
They never look at the other side , this energetic group has to offer .
Agreed that they take a lot of things lightly , but when it comes to extending a helping hand towards community work , I strongly feel that they are the first ones to pitch in .
There are many examples where young people have worked together in harmony to achieve results that were surprising .
Craig Keilburger , Matt Johnson are two vivid and huge examples .

`` Kids can help the children '' , thats what Craig Keilburger thought .
He started campaigning in the United States at an early age of 15 .
He wanted young people to come together , to share ideas and resources to reach one goal , that they all shared - ` make the children strong , for tomorrow they make the world strong ' .
His work started from his neighborhood in a small town in New York .
He and his friends started by collecting old clothes , toys , books and even saved a part of their pocket money .
Once the collection was sufficient they would go out and distribute it among the needy and the desperate .
He gained recognition and funds started to pour in , helping him expand his work from his neighborhood to the nation and finally to the entire globe .
His foundation now consists of thousands of `` young '' members who constantly work together .
Thanks to them , thousands of children accross the globe now have food to eat and schools to attend .

Craig is an example to big to believe ?
Wait until you hear about Matt Johnson .
The Johnsons lived in a slum in a Chicago suburb that was famous for its notorious crack dealing .
The policemen , the fire department , and even the medical emergency staff kept away from it .
It all started when Daphne , Matt 's friend got hit by a baseball during play .
The ball hit her eye and was bleeding badly .
They called 911 , but no help arrived and eventually she lost her eye .
This angered Matt to the limit .
The next day onwards he started from the basic things like cleaning up his neghborhood , his friends joined him and they worked until they cleared all the bad notions that people had about their community .

To sum it up , I think it would be very unfair on anyone 's part to say that youngsters do not help in community work .
I think that people must recognize their effort and appreciate it .
