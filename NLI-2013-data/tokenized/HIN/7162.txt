This is an era of technology , of innovation , of invention and above all speed .
Twenty years from now there would be a drastic change in the technology scenario .
As there has been a tremendous increase in the use cars during the past few decades there would be a change in future too .

I agree to the point that there would be decrease in the number of cars in the coming twenty years but not in the number of people driving cars or the reduction in car manufacturing , there would be the decrease in the type of cars driven today , more technology oriented cars would be launched giving a marked competetion to the cars of today .

As in earlier times the fuel engines were replaced by better working diesel engines , in a similar way we have the broadest vision to produce more swift , reliable and the more faster models .

With such a growth in the modern technology , we are sure to achieve our goal to lesser the cars and increase the technology cars of the future .
with these cars in the market we would be able to solve various problems faced now .
Though we have very good cars today but we could build a stronger engine or the solar cars or the cars working on cells would be a greater idea in this field , letting the general public drive them at a lesser effective cost .
This would also make our environment more cleaner to live and breathe in .
This would too ehnance the country 's economy due to lesser consumption of the fuels automatically preserving our oil deposits and the fossil fuels .

Thus in the coming years we would have a world of fewer cars of today but more better cars of the future .
