Given a choice to choose between a self organized tour and a tour where are tour guide leeds a group of people , I would choose the first one .
I would like to have my tour focus on my interests rather than the general interest of people and so having a tour guide will prevent me from doing it to some extent .
Tour guide may make things easier but reduces the fun of exploring on your own .

In a tour various people would want to spend varying amounts of times on different parts of the tour .
I prefer spending more time in more parts of the tour , less in some and even skip a part that is covered under the tour led by a guide .
In a guided tour I am restricted to follow the schedule and plan decided by the tour guide .
Since now there is plenty of information available at different sources ( e.g. television , internet , magazines ) , I can use that to plan my tour based on my own preferences .

Other than that , I prefer to explore places to a much more extent than a specialized tour guide would keep it restricted to appeal the majority .
I would rather learn about the places I am supposed to visit and wo n't restrict myself on the main tourist attractions .
I would rather be a part of each and every minor thing that is around that place .

In the trip I plan , I prefer to visit lesser places but spend more time on each place .
I think that in guided tours , it is more like glimpse of what all is there to explore .

Some people may have lack of information or time to plan tours properly and tour guides make their jobs easier .
But just for the sake of taking out the effort from planning and managing my trip , I would not give away the main interests that I look for in a trip , as I have already discussed above .

Considering all the factors , I personally do n't think that to travel in a group led by tour guides is the best way to travel .
