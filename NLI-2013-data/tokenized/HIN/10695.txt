I agree to the statement that successful people try news things and take risks rather than doing what they already know .
Taking risks is a trait I consider most necessary for success .
And successful people are masters of this trait .

One can not discover new shores without willing to lose sight of the shore .
Taking risks is the first step to innovation .
Progress is marked by innovation .
And innovations occur only when people take risks and try to bring about something new .
The key element for an individual to succeed is to innovate and bring about new ideas .
If one keeps doing what he is good at , there is no learning and no progress .

Consider an example of one of the business greats in the world , Bill Gates .
He came up with a product Microsoft which was totally new when it began .
But now it has captured the world market in computers .
He is the richest and the most successful man professionally .
To bring about anything new in business , taking risks is the first step .
There is a risk of the product failing miserably in the market .
But at the same time , you can never know the true potential of your product until you take that risk and bring it into the market .

I have known a sportsman more closer to home who chose sports over academics despite his parents and peers wanting him to go to college and get a degree .
Now he is a sports star that his parents are proud of .
Had he not taken the risk of going against his parents and following his heart , he would not be as successful as he is today .

I also know of a friend in my field who quit a lucrative job bringing him a fat salary to pursue wild life photography .
Not many people would have taken that huge a risk of putting their already established career into jeopardy .
But this friend is now well recognized and contirbutes to the National Geographic channel on television .
He is a very well recognized wild life photographer .

If one would just go about doing what he knows well all his life , then he would never get a chance to realized what his other potentials are .
There could be a lot of talents in him .
Unless he takes risks and explores them , they would remain hidden .
If the Wright Brothers had not taken that first risk of flight , there would be no aeroplanes today .

Sticking to norms and doing what you know the best all along would stunt growth .
Hence , I believe that taking risks and venturing to do something new is the key to success .
