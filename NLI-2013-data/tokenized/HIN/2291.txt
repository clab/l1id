According to me young people enjoy less than older people .
in todays world we see that compitition is increasing day by day .
in older days people where having less mental burden as compared to know .
today we see that education is more valued as it was before .
at present people pay more attention to give education to their children .

parents are much worried about their chid .
thus at early age children start their education .
from the next day day their life become busy .
after they have reach upto graduation they are frustrated now they are insisted by their parents to persue a higher degree in particular field .
after they have completed their studies they to search for job .
they have to face problems when they get started with job .
their daily routene is same except sundays .
now at this stage they dont have any extra time .
they have many responsibilties to maintain .
whereas if we compare this busy life with older people life we come to know that they have enough time .
they are thinking how to utilised their time .
older people have enough time to have chat with friends whact telivison read books .

I have seen various programs been held for senior citizens in our society .
they had a program once in a week .
if we compare this with young people than it is seen that young people programs are held twice in a year .
its not of programmers falt but our world is become too busy .
also on another aspect older people have enough time to meditate and do prayers .
while young people are rather busy in material life fighting for better standard of living , better education etc.older people have done struggle in their life and might getting pension through goverment or from the company they have work
