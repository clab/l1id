I agree to the statment that young people are not giving enough time to help their communities and I have my reasons for such belief .

In the following paragraph , I shall bring forth my rationality for taking the particular stance .

First we need to analyze what has changed over the time .
Is the communities expecting more out of young people or is young people are facing crunch of time to devote to their community .

I feel that the expectations of communities has not increased over the period of time but it is due to the change in mindset of young people .

Due to advent of new sources of entertainment , people have less time to spend for other activities .
Earlier , the general idea of an entertainment was to meet people , go out play with children in park etc .
This way people interact with each other and can understand problems if any faced by community member .
Now entertainment is taken over by play stations and other electronic items which keep people occupied during their leisure time .
The defination of entertainment has changed over the period .
It is more of an indoor event than of an outdoor event , which has made life more dull and led to less interaction with other people .

These days , life is more fast paced and which has changed the attitude of young generation .
They want to achieve as much as possible in short span of time using the shortest route .
Due to this rush , people are becomming more materialisitic and they started less giving less importance to old values .
This is another grave reason which has significantly curtailed the participation of young people in community .

Nuclear family is another thing which have contributed to change in the people 's attitude .
Earlier people use to stay together as a joint family .
This way grand parents were able to inculcate the good moral values in young ones and they were able to use them as a pillar in their life .
Now families are growing smaller and parents have less time to spend with their children .
Due to which they are not able to impart those moral values into their children .

In the end , I would like to summarize that people 's mind set has changed over the period and if the trend continues then we will see less and less participation of young people in community exercises .
