Whether it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
According to me , for a student to understand or to know about any subject , both understanding of ideas and concepts , and , learning facts are the vital parts .
But in my view or opinion I would give more weightage to the learning of facts instead of understanding ideas and concepts beacuse of following reasons .

Firstly , as for any student , studying in school and university for his first 15-25 years of life would basically teach him to understand various ideas and concepts through various books and through various teachers but he would certainly gains or expands his knowledge from his practical experience or by learning facts only .
Like for any medical subject student , who from his textbooks and through his teachers learn various aspects and ideas for medical practise but his basic and important learning would based on how he works in the hospitals , by checking the original disease affected bodies .

Another reason for my favouring of learning facts as against understanding of ideas and concepts would be that by only learning ideas and concepts of any subject the student would not be successfull in his life or career because without any practical experience or going through with facts he cannot able to show his talent or performance on the field or practise area .
Like only by studing various concepts of music like its history .
about various types of singing the student or person would not become a good singer , so it is by learning facts in practical experience the aspiring singer would able to know whether he should continue with this music classes or not .

So , by adding all above reasons , in my opinion learning facts is more important then learning ideas and concepts of any particular subject .
Though learning ideas concepts which our textbooks and teachers teach us are not the things which one should not do but gaining practical experience or understanding or learning facts is like expanding the knowledge of particular subject which one should not afford to skip in his life in order to be successfull person or entity in life .
