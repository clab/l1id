I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Travel to an unknown destination can be challenging and maybe even intimidating to some .
But I personally believe that exploring and discovering the unknown is the real thrill in travel .

A tour guide would take his group to all the popular tourist destinations , following a set schedule and give them a brief history of each place .
When you travel on your own , you are on your own schedule .
People are most likely to travel when on vacation , and you certainly do n't need to abide by a schedule when on vacation and away from work .
When you are travellling on your own , you can get a map , scout places , get recommendations from locals and visit all the places that seem intruiging and appealing to you .
You can read up and learn about the history in ways that you would like and not have some guide rattle it out to you .
If safety is of concern , you could always travel with a group of friends and still set your own pace .
Memories of places visited would have more excitement , as it would not be just the history of the place that you would take with you but also all your efforts in getting to the place and other such experiences .
On your own , it is more likely that you would visit a place that is not a common tourist destination but one that definitely meets your tastes and expectations .
When travelling or visitng New York , a tour guide would definitely take you to see the Empire State Buidling , Times Square and the Statue of Liberty but for a complete expereince of a New Yorker , you would need a lot more than that .

To summarize , I would like to say that travel on your own is definitely more rewarding than travelling in a group with a tour guide .
I seriously doubt that a tour guide showed Columbus the way .
And what a loss it would have been for America not to have been discovered !
