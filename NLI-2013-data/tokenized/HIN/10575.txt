I feel that it is true that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing things they already know how to do well .

If it were n't for people ready and eager to try new things , or ways to do things , they would never discover that there were better ways to do them .
Some ways may be time consuming and a waste of energy , but successful people find a way to bypass the waste , and get to their goals in a shorter , more efficient way .
Imagine someone plodding along the old path going around a mountain overtaking someone who has risked going over the mountain , or perhaps even going through the mountain !
It seems highly unlikely !

Risks and new things lead to better production and better outcomes .
If we had n't had people willing to risk a new method of crop raising , or use of pesticides , we would n't have the increased quantities of grains that we do today .
Their success in trying something new has led to an outcome beneficial not only to themselves , but to all of mankind .

This thirst for new ways in successful people has resulted in the discovery of new medicines , test tube babies , forays into space .
It has resulted in the creation of industrial giants .
A famous company in India , Reliance Industries Limited , has its roots in a tea stall .
The late owner used to run a tea stall in a small town .
Due to his vision and his dare to dream big and try a new way of refining petroleum to create useful by products , Dhirubhai Ambani ( the late owner of Reliance ) was extermely influential and rich and famous by the time he passed awy two years earlier .
It is because of his very will to do new things that the company is now one of the most formidable in present times , so much so that it can topple or raise the stock market by the way it moves in the day 's trade .

If it were n't for the dare of successful people to be different , to try something new , they would n't be where they are today .
I hardly imagine that Dhirubhai Ambani would have been anything but a tea stall owner if he had n't dared to try his hand at something new .
