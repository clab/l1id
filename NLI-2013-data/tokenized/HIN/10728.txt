In my opinion this statement is true that successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well .
Any new invention start with new thoughts , new creativity , planing and hard work towards the goal .
For example Newton , he was a scientist he gave us a lot of new principle on science but before him no body was thinking in that direction .
After his , people fallows his principles and doing further more for new creation and inventions .
That is thue trying new thing is better becouse if you sucssed in any concept you will become famous very fast , with new concept you can earn more money and can lead a good succesful life .

For that you must be creative for new ideas and concepts .
We can take a example of Macdonalds , initialy it was a simple food chain but due to do right efferts in right directions , and trying some thing new , made them a gaint food chain .

So in my opinion succcesful people trys new things , altough there are lot of hard work , passions , time and money required towards the goal .
In conclusion i will say that if u want to be successfull person , you have to keep trying new things rether than only doing what they already know how to do well .
