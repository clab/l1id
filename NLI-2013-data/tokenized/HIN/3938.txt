I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It is very important for young people to help their communities , because the society is not made of individuals rather a group of people .

Today , the most of the young people have neglecting attitudes towards their communities .
They dont care what is happening in their communities and what is being done is correct or not .

There are several reasons for such an attitude among young people towards their communities .
First of all , they are not motivated enough to help their community .
Their parents and other family members do not tell them about their duties towards their communities .
They dont encourage them to help their communities .
This may be because of the several reasons like the family dont have enough time to spend time with their children and talk about all these .

Secondly , now a days young people dont get enough time to help their communities .
Now young people have more responsibilites , more competition to face .
The studies have become more tougher .
Students have to take lot of examinations to get admission into schools and colleges .
So they spend most of time thinking and preparing about their studies .
This stops them from thinking about their communities .
For example , a student who is preparing for an entrance to get admission into a graduate school will have limited time to think about his responsibilities towards his community .

Also young people think that its not their duty alone to help their community .
They have a wrong notion in their mind that why only they should help their communities , and not the others belonging to the same community should come forward and help .
So they keep waiting for the others only to take the initiative and finally nobody makes a positive move .

But the young people should realize that even they are part of the community .
They should think that if they help now , they will get the help when they require it .
So they should understand their responsibities and try to find some time to helping their communities .
