I strongly disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I maintain this stance on this issue since I have various examples that prove that young people give the same , if not more , time to help their communities .

Firstly , I would like to draw attention to a recent happening in India .
The government was on the verge of passing a bill in the parliament that ensured a reservation for the so called `` lower casts '' in esteemed institutions of higher studies .
There was a hue and cry from all sections of the society but no one actually stepped forward to oppose this move of the government .
Looking at the views of the majority of the society ( which included minorities ) that reservations divide people , the students of AIIMS ( a reputed medical college in New Delhi ) joined hands to oppose this `` socially detrimental '' step .
Later , this movement culminated into a nation wide student rally that had positive effects with the government finally relenting .
The point is that these days the younger generation is more aware of its rights and has a keener sense of what is right and what is wrong than the younger generation ofthe past .

Secondly , there was a case where some students from the Indian Institutes of Technology who despite having an assured future in the technological fields , shunned their highly paid jobs only to lay the foundations of a political party aimed at the elimination of corruption from the society in India .
Do such cases show that the younger generation do not care for their communities ?
Conversely , do they not show an extreme love towards their community ?
I say they surely do .

Besides all these specific cases I have one example from my own life where the children of our city joined hands to prevent the pollution of natural resources .
All these children abstain from using motor bikes ( preferring cycles ) and refrain from celebrating Indian festivals with crackers since they pollute a lot .
They are also involved in spreading an awareness program to protect the lakes of our city ( Bhopal , Madhya Pradesh .
India ) .
uch acts depict that the younger generation is mature enough to think and feel for the community .

If we look around , we have various instances all over the world where the younger generation has really overtaken the ` adult ' world in trying to improve our communities .
From spreading awareness against diseases to providing free tuition classes and community services in free for all schools , the younger generation has really opened its eyes and is surely aiming at making the earth a better `` community '' to live in .
