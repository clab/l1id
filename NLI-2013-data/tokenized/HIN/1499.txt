In my opinion it is good to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specializing in one specific subject because it is said that `` to have a good and useful knowledge do not have it on one topic have it many topic as it enlighten your mind , since knowledge increase on reading more and giving more '' .
Now the question arises why it is good to have knowledge on many academic subject it is because that life is full of diversity and result of this is we have to face many faces of life , which is not possible by simply knowing one subject .
Take an example like you have knowledge of only computer science and the situation arises where you have to apply knowledge of chemistry but since you have specialize in only one subject and do not know anything about chemistry so you face the problem .

Whenever there is a problem there is a way out and for this reason only our education system is designed in such a way that we study each and every subject and atleast attain a knowledgeble position in each and every subject .
There always question arises in education system why a history student have to study chemistry and other subjects , the answer is very simple no body can gurantee what is going to happen in coming future .
So in order to prepare for every situation he or she must be prepare for any aspect of life and the key indegridient for this is ` KNOWLEDGE DIVERSITY ' that is an individual should not confined his or her study to one field but try to learn in a diverse envoirnment .
Now take a real life problem you are a father of small child and you only know literature since you have specialize in it .
Now one night your child become ill and you do not find any doctor nearby so what you will do in that case .
There the diverse knowledge plays a important role since we study biology upto some level so we can trace out symptoms and can give some primary aid to child which we have learn otherwise simply wait and watch .

So these all examples above shows the importance of broad knowledge in many academic subject not in one so since it is proved that `` knowledge is never wasted '' , and this have been realised by our forefather 's and our education system is result of that policy only .
