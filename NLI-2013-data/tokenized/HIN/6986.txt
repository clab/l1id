To have a look in the future and say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than now , according to me is a wrong judgement .
Over a period of time technology will improve and so will the population while people getting more and more engrossed in this practical world .

History has shown us that as time increases civilization also improves and with it the population .
In developing countries like India and Pakistan the population is ought to increase by a tremendous amount in the near future and this prediction can be globally applied .
With the increase in population the movement in and out will increase proportionaly and as a result cars which are faster medium of trasnsport on road are bound to take a huge leap in their numbers .

Moreover with the advancement in the living style of people more will be able to afford a car and also with considerable increase in work , schedules are starting to get bussier which will demand faster movement and hence more number of cars .
Agreed that technology increases with time but one cant find any means by which technology will take a leap to develop airplanes for faster movement on a large scale and replacing cars in such a short period of two decades and will not be affordable for common man either .

Moreover scientists have developed alternate fuels for cars like CNG , LPG , electricity and so on .
These advancements in fuels clearly reveal that in the near future one will see more of cars and that too working on a variety of fuels .
Further these fuels being cheaper than their petroleum counterpart , will attract more customers and will rule the market for roadways transportation .

The only other means of roadway transport are motor bikes , buses and bicycle but with the increase in population people will prefer more of cars than of two wheelers and since with the increase in work schedule there will be increase in number of buses but not as much as compared to cars which is convinient way of faster transportation .

Thus given a period of time population , advacement in living , alternate fuels , busy schedules of people all going in hand will contribute to increase in number of cars in use .
