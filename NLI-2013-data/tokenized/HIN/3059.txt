The statement mentioned here is quite an interesting one and it holds considerable importance in this modern era .
At first glance majority of people will feel that the young people do n't enjoy life more than older people but if the matter is taken more seriously then people will realise that that 's not the case .

Young people have the advantage of being young .
Age is one thing that 's in their favor .
Even the older people in their younger days would have enjoyed life more then what they are enjoying now .
I feel that health is an issue to be taken into consideration .
Most of the young people maintain better health then the older people and hence they can enjoy more .
I say this because I feel that it 's not possible to worry about health issues and enjoy life at the same time .

I feel that young people enjoy more then older people because with age comes responsibility .
As compared to the older people young people do n't have much responsibility .
Young people do n't have to think of family and jobs whereas older people have to do that .

Stress is another factor that should be taken into consideration .
According to me older people are more stressed then younger people and that affects their overall outlook of life .
I feel that a person without stress tends to enjoy life more then a person under stress .

I also feel that young people have more options to enjoy .
I say this because I feel that health does n't really permit old people to take part in various activities like sports .

So looking at the points mentioned above I am confident to say that young people enjoy life more then older people and among the various points mentioned above I feel that 's health is something thatreally against the older people is their heath .
