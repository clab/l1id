Most advertisments makes product much better when you see the actual product , because when you see in the add you dont see the actull thing .
They only show you the best of it .

When you deside to buy it hten you fids that it is not as best it was said in the add , It is all a small game to make the coustomer buy the product .
By making a coustomer buy the product , he/she most of the time forgets to return it back or desides to return it back after 30 days , it helps the marchant to sell the product by all means .

The product which is mostly shown in commercial is not the best , I always thing the the product which you go to the shop and purchase is the best option .

I have purchased several items from the advertisements , but most of dont look the same sa shown in tv , so all the time i have to make it a point to return in time so that i can get my money return .

I thing the best way to buy any thing you should go and see the produt by your naked eyes and then deside you need to buy it or not .
I thing that is the only best way to buy any things in life .
The TV add things some of them are really good too , like i have purchased a Boss wave music it is the best , i like very much .
Thaat was the only thing that i have purchased by add and turned out to be good .

So i sugest that to buy mostly only by going to the shop and seeing the things by yourself , It is very important to see the things and then you can deside to buy or not .
