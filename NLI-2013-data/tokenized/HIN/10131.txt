I am very much helpful by this topic that successful people try new things and try to take risks .
In my view success is not a one word game , it is defined by many ways at different level of life .
A man got success simply is a dull man in every sence .
Taking new thigs at level at different part of life is a interesting phenomena of life , i8n which a man need of interest can increase level by level .
A person of a good deed always crazy about good feed .

In life everybody should have position on which a person can be incharge by its own .
Taking risk is not showing a stupidity of a person it shows that how much you careful about your life .
In life there are so many situation occur where we find nothing exept blankness around ourself at that time we have no time to think on other environmet , so at time we take risk at any cost .
Some get feared by taking risk , but at that time they forget that daythey have to do same activity at any level of our life .
Many people try risk for there name and many person for reasonable activity .

Foe example , if a person starts a business then he or she may taking risk at that program , this person has nothig to gain at initial level of there activty , so at that time only hard work and determination proceed him up .
Likewise they get up wiyh new confidence at every step of there life .

So we can now mention that successful person trying new thing and taking risk for there better tomorrow and there better life .
If a person do well alone without trying not too much is not learn so much from there life , and that was not include there profile at high level .

Thats why people need trying new thnigs .
