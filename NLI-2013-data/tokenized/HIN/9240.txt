The students must understand the ideas and concepts .
Students are the future of the world , they are the one who will change the world .
They must take things seriously and must intent to do that .
Understanding the ideas and concepts behind , does matter alot and makes difference too .

The concepts and ideas which is understood by any student will make him or her take decision on that topic more efficiently .
Example , A student understood the concepts and ideas clearly and become a succesful doctor .
When he or she operate any human being , the patient , his life at risk the decision and the solution which comes out of the concepts and ideas understood by the doctor during his or her class .
Any failure would lead the patient their life at risk or may be to death as well .
A man put his life in doctors hand with trust and hopes .
The student must do justice to it .

While the critics says , learning the facts are also important by the students .
Example , imagine a doctor has learned the facts and does not have the ideas and concepts in his mind .
He or she would put some person 's life at risk .
If the person died he would be responsible for the death .
The patient could survive and could recover but due to lack of knowledge the patient has to suffer .
Which i would say is not fair at all .

Furthermore , the student with the good concept and knowledge about the idea would be more effective and appropriate than compare to the student with learning facts .
Sometimes learning fact are necessary but mostly the concept and the proper knowledge is taken into account .

In the end , the knowledge of the subject should be by understanding the concept and ideas .
The better knowledge the better effect could be seen .
The understanding of the concept and ideas are always works and gives good output .
