In the era of scientific development .
with invention of newer technique world become like global village .
Where people started using more and more modern technique and with the help of media , technology or traditional technique to sell their product to the consumer or they made every efford to reach to their cusotmer .
So manufacture always try to attract their customer by advertisement where they try to highlight their product as the best product , few manufacture gives misleading information which will attract many consumer to bye or use the product .

I disagree with the statement it has been describe below woth few explanation and example .
Likewise if one go for medical or over the counter product , many time manufacter try to indirectly attract their customer bye use of different tectique where they use to claim superiority of their product .
But it not the true the case medical faternity always rely of authentic study of drug or response of particule medicine in relavant condition .
Where always the better molecule always the win the race .

It true with case of selling cosmetic to the consumer , likewise manufacture many time take help of celebrity of filmstars to attract the consumer , but consumer always use the product they trust they trust the product with their experience of their past use of many time media paly vital role where they discuss many ongoing topic where they help consumer to make best choices through available option .

It can be explain with car indusrty where if car manufacure of family car try to advertise their car as like racing car performance no customer is not going to beleive .
because family car needs to meet the needs of one family as car should be like to perform well over longer time where speed of racing car is not essential .

So their will be every effort made by manufacure always try to attract their customer to use their product .
It might possible soem of them try to mislead and try attract the consumer for product many it happen we might go for the wrong product which of not per expectation when we see the advertisement by manufacure .
But it would happen limited , where we learn from our experince that what it seen might not be ther true , one always rely on their trust and past experince .
Where on long term always the best will win the race .
