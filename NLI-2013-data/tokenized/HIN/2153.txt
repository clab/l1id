The life of an individual passes through different phases and all explore these different phases of life in there own way .
These phases includes the young phase when an individual is in young life and an old phase when an individual grows old .
some people enjoy ther life the most in young age while other in there old age .

As contended in the above written statement that yong people enjoy there life more than older people do I completely agree with the statement that when a individual is young one has a clear ambition in life to achive the goal which one has set for himself .
Young age is the right age to explore new potentials to learn new things .
the desire within the individual to learn more is the realization that one is enjoing these stages of life .
some movments of life which can only be enjoyed by an individual when one is young , when one is in his college years like skipping the classes , going on a first date , participating in different sports or academic events .
One also enjoys goin for a late night movie with friends , lesser responsibilities .
lesser tensions in life .
the young age the person has strong urge to explore the world that state is equal as compaerd as if sombody is the king of the world , a person is not bounded my the number of questions occuring witthin him whether to do or not any thing in this world ...

Secondly when a person is young one is more physically fit .
One can take care of himself without depending on any body and one cherishes the different flavours of life which leaves an indeliable remarks on ones identiy .
As the person has lesser of the liabilities , one also have less burden and thats the situation where the person when is young enjoys the life to the fullest .
