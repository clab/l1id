if one would not jump in to the water one could not learn how to swim .
yes i agree with the statement that to be a successful person ane should be willing to take risks in life and try new things rather than just do what he has been doing .

many of our ancients has gone unorthodox way and had been maverick .
this is the reason we hav seen the new ages arising with better lifes .
ability of human to think and do new things make him different from animals and there makes him to achieve new milestones in life .

if a person would just follow a same routine or the same fashion what his ancestors has been doing there would be no progress .
people would not be able to find solutions to the problems they are facing and therefore could not be able to make there life more comfortable .

scientists , architectures , doctors , engineers are few of those people who contribute a lot to the development of the society and if these people just keep doing waht they know and been taught , i fear we could not see any further advancement in our present age and the progress could only happen if the worldmakers try new things in life and take risks .

taking risks in life and therefore try new things probably help human to learn and gain experience .
might be that he may hav to face the faliures and dissapointment in initial stages but sooner the success will kiss the feet .
no one is born perfect it is the practise and the determination to try new things makes the person a better one .

if manny of the great freedom fighters had not taken the risk and had faught for the freedom of there country we would not hav seen manny of the great nations .
also if the faomous astrologer has not stood against the religious beliefs and hav said that its the sun which is in center and not earth we would hav been unknown about the mystries of universal .

if man had not taken the risk to step on the moon there would hav been no neil armstrong .
