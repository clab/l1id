Pleasure taking the honour in analysing the given statement , i would like to stand aganist the topic that the students should be relaying more on facts than on concepts and ideas .

A student gets most of the concepts from the class room lectures thus he creates a basic idea about a topic ( mostly outdated ) , but he gains knowledge about facts from the outer world through various sources like media , friends , articles ...
etc

If we stress on the Definition `` A FACT can be defined as a statement given after a through observation and consicutive proven reasults with experments '' it is always be demonistarble , but in contrast a `` concept '' is always derived from a `` fact '' which has been defined earlier thus leading to a new idea !

Concepts and Ideas are brainchilds of facts , and they do vary on a consistent basis with the technology advancements , as the consistency of an old fact is pretty less with the advanced technology there are all chances that the concepts and ideas do change .

To name few the old scientific theories are no longer good in the morden era , the present day science formuate the concepts based on fatcs and observations reliving the importance of facts .
To name few .

1. Gallelio `` theory of gravitation '' . - gravitation laws and earth 's orbit
2. Darwin `` theory of natural selection '' .
3. `` Theories of genetics '' .
4 Arthametics `` law of boyency ''
5. Newton Laws .

A fact under prolonged expermental condition becomes a concept and a law would if refered by future generations , and there are even some concepts which are discarded as the facts were proved to be genune that the old concepts to name few

1. Old concepts of churches where they used to say a. earth formed in seven days , b.Earth is Round .
c. Traits are inherited from generation to generation .

few concepts are often challenged if they do not have enough support of facts , to name few some of the modern scientists say that there is global warming but other do challenge them , as there is no physical evidence showing that the phenomen is relivent and do exisist

So as a student it was the age where he pumps in knowledge to become intallectual it is important for him to know the facts and learning them than allocation more time on the concepts and reinforcing them thus making himself almost uncompetent with the present day world
