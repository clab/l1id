I will totally agree that it is really it is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn fact .
Understanding ideas and concepts has led to new inventions in the modern life .

It is really important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
For example Newton 's law of motion which is the basis of physics .
Newton 's law of motion can only be understood when the person actually understand the logic behind .
One of his law states that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction .
This concept can only be understood when you do it practically .
Just by learning the fact does not pays .
When this concept is used in practical labs , the concepts become more clear .
The person will never forget these concept throughout his lifetime when implied practically .

Another perfect example which tells that understanding ideas and concepts are really important .
Everyone of us know about , the value of accerlation due to gravity .
This value was established by Sir Newton .
Everybody knows that value because it is a learned fact .

He found this value while putting his ideas and concepts .
He was sitting under an apple tree .
The apple fell from the tree and newton started thinking about the speed at which might the apple have felled .
He conducted many practical experiments which lead to the value .
Hence it shows how important is to understand ideas and concept .

Another example will be that of Telesa , one of the best electrical engineers .
It was his concepts and ideas that developed the principle of Alternating currents .
Because of this , power can be transmitted to long places .
So it is really important to have stress on understanding ideas and concepts .

In the end , i think it is really important for the student to give stress on understanding ideas .
They should put stress on the concepts that developed those facts .
By stressing on concepts and ideas , new modern technologies will be developed and that will be an advantage for human life .
