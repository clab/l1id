I would agree with this statement .
I feel that young people nowadays are negligent towards their own community as a whole , a community that has helped them become what they are .

There are many places where we see this happening .
Young people are more career oriented now and tend to leave their homes and communities in pursuit of higher edcation and better job opportunities in foreign lands .
Although they may get what they seek but their communities are getting neglected .
Young people are adverse to becoming a part of the social community gatherings and therefore are not exposed to the problems being faced by them .

In my native city in North India I have seen that my community has gone from bad to worse in terms of their social standing and the economic condition .
The community school that I studied in is now in a state of utter disarray .
The older people are trying to do what they can but the onus is on the younger ones to take on the responsibilty .

Local community welfare societies for redressing the problems of people have increasingly seen decline in youth participation .
The young people fail to identify with the problems of people they once lived with .
These socities are for most of the time non-government affiliated organisations and are usually not profitable .
This is why people shy away from them .
They are against spending time on things which are not a source of income .

Young people also feel that whatever time they get at home from the fast paced life they lead should be utilized in spending time with the family rather than worrying about their community .
Lucrative jobs in multinational companies where there are tough working hours as opposed to just a 9 yo 5 job have only worsened this problem .
Attending parties at night and being seen in high places have become more important because of peer pressures and forming profitable social circles .

Another reason for this to happen is that in many places there isnt a common forn for poeple to raise issues concerning them .
Even if they are talked about in very localised areas they are mostly kept away from the reach of younger people based on the notion that their young and immature minds will not understand the problem or be able to provide solutions .
In most gatherings in my native city young poeple are not allowed to express their opinions freely .
This is more so because the old people running the system are against novel ideas .
This also gives the young people a reason to stay away .

Until the people identify with the problems or face them first hand it is highly unlikely that they will ever start worrying about the betterment of their communities .
Steps will need to be taken by both young and the old in developing more practical ideas based on changing society and living standards .
