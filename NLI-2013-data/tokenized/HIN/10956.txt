I agree with the statement .
i would rather say the advancement of civilization is the result of people who took risks .
when I say taking risks it would mean not only doing things or acts personaly which could be dangerous , example going to the deep seas in search of new lands but that would also mean going against established ideas , which were wrong .

Had Galileo and the earlier astronomers not challenged the idea of earth being flat we would never have known the facts .
For going against the established beleifs , Galileo and others had to face anger and punishments .

Had it not been the efforts of Clombus we would have never seen America .
He failed more than one time , was even improsined for failing to prove his theory , but in the end we owe him a lot .

How is techonolgy advancing at such a great pace , we talk of Nano technology today .
It is because there are scientist who always challenge the established frontiers .
This requires taking lot of risks .
Failure would mean wasting resources that are so costly .
And also involve persona stigma , but than they dare it and succeed .

The stories of scientist such as Thomas Alva Edision , Voltaaire are known to all .
they were the people who tried out new things , even at the cost of people doubting them .

Wright brothers tried something new and brought a huge change in the world of transport , Stevenson thought on a small issue and invented the steam engine .
so the degree of risk might vary , but risks do result in some positive results .

One thing I will like to add , the risks should not be blind , they should be calculated to some extent .
this is applicable mostly for the purpose of trying out new business .
Infact all the people I have mentioned above had done some or the other study to be sure that they were not doing something that was completely not required .

Bill gates the richest man today , ventured into an unkown area and we see the result today .
but it is not always that successful people have tried new things and they have succeeded .
Many example are there which tell that if you leave something which is your `` core compitency '' you may fail .

So the idea of `` core competency '' is very relevent .
So try new things but keep in mind your core competency also .
