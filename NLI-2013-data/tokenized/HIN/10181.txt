I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
If this statement was false then there would be no new fast cars .
People would have not reached the moon .
Some people like scientists do not keep on doing the same thing , they try new things which are dangerous .
If the scientists would not have researched on different diseases then we would have not got the cure of different diseases which are present now .
The death rate would have increased .

Even in sports people donot use the same tactics in all the games .
They use different tactics in different games which helps them to win their game .
If they use the same tactics then the opponents would take advantage & they will win .
Suppose Pistons uses the same tactics against all the teams they might win for some games but after some games all the teams will come to know that they are using the same tactics and take benefit of that and win from Pistons .
For this reason they use different strategies in different game .
They might loose sometime but as it is said people must learn from their mistakes .
Try new things .

In the beginning of the race of satellites if U.S would have stoped trying after they lost of many space ships then they would had not reached the moon .
U.S is the first country to send their peope on moon .
In the beginning many space ships got blast before going in space .
Many people died to help their country in achieving great heights but they later on used new technology new ideas & they did it .

After working hard using different methods in making cars , today we have various types of fast cars .
If people would have stop trying or would had keep on making same cars there would have been no new fast cars , like there would have been no Cadillac , no ferrari fast cars .
If after building railroads people would have never tried making planes then today people would not have reached one place to another in less time .
It was hard but after the invention of planes today we can go where ever we want on the earth in less time .

What if people would have kept on making telephones and would had not tried to making wireless phones which we call cell phone , then today we could not have called any emergency number like ambulance if we werer outside our homes .
If there were no cell phones at that time then we would have waisted our time to search a phone booth & then call ambulance but till that time there would have been more loss , many people would have died .

For the above reasons I think people must not stop trying new things , they must not get scared from the consequences but they must try .
There are many other things which would have not been invented if people would have not tried new thing .
Try & try until u suceed ...
