I agree with that student should understand the ideas and concept than learn fact .
To know and understand any thing you shuold have clear the ideas and concept of that thing or theme than only u can judge what is true and false .

Foremost , Ideas improve your imagination , It gives u a fantacy felling , improve your concentration , It gives good exercise to your mind , you may improove the thinking abilities .
For example , you refer the history of ancient era , The scientist was found the fossiles or some historical monuments .
From all those evidence they might got idea abuot the culture , tradition and life style of the people of that era .

Moreover , By those evidence and ideas the scientist made concept of the life style , the attitude , the agriculture , the education , the food habit many more details about the people of the encient era .
Then they did reaserch on it and tried to find out the fact out of these .
This fact gives u a clear picture of the events of the history .

Finally , It is true that for learning any fact of life , you must understand the ideas and concept about it so you will not get any difficulties to understand the realities of the past .
present , future of life or any person or any thing .
lerning fact
