Going by the spiralling rates of fuel prices , there definitely would be fewer cars in use twenty years from now , than there are today .
When , I say cars , I mean vehicles running on petroleum products and not the alternative fuels like solid fuel , solar cells and other alternatives .

Some twenty years ago , owning a car was a middle class dream , but today it 's a nightmare , because of the steep price that one has to shell out to keep the engine running .

Buying a car is easier today with greater competition in the auto industry leading to affordable prices but alas , no such competition exists in the fuel industry and prices are going only one way .
Installment schemes can lure people to buy their fancied machine but how long they can keep it on the road is a tougher question to answer .
And then when there are the alternatemethods of travelling that are available today , they make atleast day to day travelling much easier .

Traffic jams and congestions are a common feature on most roads around the world .
So that your travelling time is unnecessarily multiplied by a not very small number .
Whereas , a public transport system like local trains , subways , metro etc provide a very punctual and time effective way of travelling .
Be it travelling to office , college , school , movie , stadium , you know exactly how much time the train will take you .
So it gives people time for other activities , including relaxation at home or otherwise .
But you definitely are n't honking your horn at the car in front of you or scowling at the one next to you in a traffic jam .

One has trains and buses plying at most hours of the day .
Even for the other emergency hours one may hire a cab .

Also there 's much greater awareness today for our environment , so as more and more people get educated about our eco system , the deadly exhalation of toxic gases can be reduced .
Many cities in the world like Tokyo , Amsterdam have a cycling culture where it is very normal for people to commute to their workplace on cycles .
In fact , most new road projects around the world have a cycling lane as part of the road .
So this should also take some heavy load of our roads .
Also , cycling is an excellent exercise for our bodies .

Yes , there definitely are occasions when one needs a personal car .
like weekend outings , family functions etc .
but they are sporadic events and do n't put as much pressure on the roads and the environment as a slow crawl in traffic everyday does .

Therefore , when it comes to ` cars in use ' , for all the economic , environmental and health reasons cited above , and given a general common sensical point of view prevailing , there should be fewer ` cars in use ' twenty years from now than there are today .
