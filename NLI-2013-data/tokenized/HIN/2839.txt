Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This statement makes us wonder how can one define enjoyment .
Being subjective not only from person to person but also from time to time , enjoyement in totality refers to satisfaction of ones expectations and desires .

In the case of older people , who have `` enjoyed '' the best of their youth , old age brings about a sudden restriction in terms of what they are capable of doing and what they must learn to live without .
No one welcomes this change but some find a way to remain satisfied and happy in there restricted lives .
These older people continue to enjoy life .
But we find that they form a minority .

In the case of young people , faced with limitless possibilities , aspirations and expectations are soaring high .
These youngsters are willing to do whatever it takes to have a good time .
They defy rules , and set new boundaries for themselves to try and cross .
Life for them is like a window .
Their expecations represented by the horizon and their desires by the distance from the window to the horizon .
They can only do so much while their youth lasts .

Comparing the two , we notice that while the youth end up enjoying more than most older people ; in comparison with the limit to which they could have enjoyed , the older people have a higher sense of satisfaction .
They know their boundaries and make the most of their lives eachday .

Almost everyone enjoys their youth , but people who can learn to enjoy their old age aswell are the people who have truely enjoyed `` life '' .
So in conclusion , i would like to say that young people enjoy `` youth '' but older people enjoy `` life '' .
