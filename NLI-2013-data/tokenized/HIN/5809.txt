In the present day situation , cars are not a `` luxury '' item , they 're a necessity .
Every place , whether it be household , or in factories , etc. transportation is incomplete without fourwheelers .

Looking specifically to cars , or technically `` light motorised , four wheeled vehicle '' , one cant really expect there numbers to sink , at least for sure within 20 years .
One of the practical reason is that the roads that carry the current capacity of cars , are already there and functional .
If the number of cars will reduce , then the traffic levels will go down , and one of the biggest disincentive that prevents a person to buy cars ( the congestion on road ) will also die down .
So if the car numbers will go down , it will in itself , motivate people to buy new cars .

A nice alternative to using cars is using the subway system , or the railroad , or airways , or bus .
But still , one cant make a subway station everywhere in the city , or a run separate trains between every two pair of stations .
Although for long distances , people might opt for subways or rails , but the `` number of cars '' will not decrease , because some time you may need to do extensive shopping , receive your kins from different point in city , move to various locations in the city or out the city where there is no rail connectivity , or no station , the travel plans can change suddenly , with no prior notice .
All mass transit systems have a schedule , they arrive and depart in fixed manner , but urgent situations dont .
So people might prefer to use mass transport facilities in daily life , the density of traffic may reduce , but the `` number of cars in use '' wont decrease .
Neither can one expect such a huge development in mass transport system to come within 20 years , and continue thereon .

One may say that fuel used in cars can get changed .
It is said that petroleum reserves will get over within 100 years ( too long !! ) .
However , hydrogen powered cells to run cars on electricity is a concept that wont let cars stagnate due to nonavailability of petroleum based fuels .

They can be said to be not secure owing to road accidents , but accidents , to point out , is drivers fault and not the vehicle 's .
Also , accidents can happen in any vehicle , but in cars you can have seat belts , air bags and all sort of safety devices not possible in other vehicles .

If earning is said to give financial independence , then cars can be said to give transit independence .
You need not ask anyone , you need not worry where to go , when to go , how long to stop at any place , and your driving safely confirms the safe transit of other persons in the car .
Although bike can be an alternative as a transportation medium , but its mainly a 2 seater ...
and no more , and you cant afford to carry various luggage .
