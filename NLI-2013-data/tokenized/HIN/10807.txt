I do agree to the fact that successful people do try new things and take risks than only doing what they already know .
I do believe so because of the fact that options in life shouldnt be ruled down to only a few .
People should try exploring new avenues and try out new things so as to master the very aspect called `` life '' .
Evolution , adaptation focus is the name of the game .

When a person who is ambitious and an optimist tries doing something innovative he usually strikes or achieves a place where in not many people have achieved in life .
Today we thank people like Thomas Addison and James watt for their inventions .
Such things never came to their mind in second or two .
It took them loads of restless work and patience and teh ability to cope with failure again and again to give us what we relish or enjoy in todays world a telephone or a steam engine .

A mans horizon of thinkin should be very wide open .
He should be well versed with his idea and should carry the potential for acheivin what he thought of doin .
he should have a vision in short .
A strong vision is half victory .

People like Bill Gates never hesitated to put their vision on paper and his hard work , dedication , aim has given us a beautiful product called microsoft which is used by every one .
His job never ended after he gave us `` windows '' there were many other things that microsft had to give us and is still giving till date .

U should try to be innovative in life trying to explore what all nature has to give us .
Risks are usually involved but i believe in the saying `` no pain no gain '' everything comes at a price and u should be willing to pay a price .

For example in India companies like reliance which practically run india where just a man 's vision .
Ambani never ended his thirst for achieving till the time he passed away .
They are till date trying to lay their hands on what all they can from clothes to elctricity to fuels to power the list is endless .

According to me everybody lives in this world but if u want to create a mark or achieve something or have that satisfaction within , that '' I am different '' and want to be remembered u need to try out all what u can rather than just sticking on to one thing and try to make something out of it. '' winners are not quitters '' .
Life has kept a lot hidden there just needs to be a thirst for exploring new avenues and tryin out different things which can be only achieved by a good vision , aim and a very optimistic attitude .
( go getter ) attitude
