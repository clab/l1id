The issue at hand is whether successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
This issue is important because it discusses the mentality of successful people and what they did to earn their success .
I agree that successful people try new things rather than doing what they already know because that is the basic theme of sucess .

According to me succes many a times means to be just different-a class apart .
Many scientists would have not succeded if they would have not thought differently than others .
Many businessmen would have not succeded had they adopted the same production and marketing policies .
Because of the above mentioned point I think successful people do new things .

Secondly doing new things also helps different other people who were not helped before , making the initiator succesful .
For example , Mahatma Gandhi tried a new thing called satyagraha and and non-voilence and helped Indians to come out of the clucthes of the British regime .
He became successful because he tried a new practice in the history of indian independeence instead of watching in silence , a thing which an ordinary person would have done .
Hence at times helping people in a new way also makes a person successful .

Lastly a person who takes risks and tries new things gets an immense sense of fulfilment .
In this way he becomes successful in his own eyes .
Doing things which already one knows makes him bored and the job monotonous .
Sometimes one tends to lose interests in everyday routine work , so trying new things or new methods would often make even a lay man successful in his own small way .

In conclusion I would again assert that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
This is because only doing new and better things help them become succesful and different from others .
