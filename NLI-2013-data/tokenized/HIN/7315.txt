I dis-agree to the statement `` The Best way to travel is in a group led by a Tour Guide ''

I believe that when one travels , one needs to explore the place to the fullest .
Travelling is a passion which teaches you to explore , learn and experience .
Although i agree to the fact that Tour Guide have a first hand experience about the places and they have been time and again experiencing the place , i believe they are doing their Job .

But the actual thrill which i believe about travelling is the experience of finding it urself .
When with a tour guide , one does not necessarly make an effort to find about the details of a place or the zest of it .
One just goes by the tour guide and assumes that he has covered everything .
Tour guide is like a book , i agree , who opens out the entire picture to the travellers whom he is guiding , but the benifits of a research which one gets by meeting the local people , their food , culture and place and the rest through books or guides is phenominal .

The tours led by guides ristricts the intensities of exploring a place .
One has to go with the pace of the rest of the group led by the guide .
This prohibits not only the learning or exploring pace but also the freedom of other decisions you want to take during the travelling experience .

I as a person love to meet people , learn culture and customs of others by being around them and by interacting with them .
For that reason , i totally would like to be on my own or in a comfortable group who has similar thinking and love travelling .

I believe that when one is spoon fed , one does not make an effort to learn beyond the paradigm .
Similarly when one intends to explore a place and its people , a group led by a tour guide does not do justice to the place .
The hidden facts that the tour guide conveys can also be inferred from a book or a tour guide .

Travelling is a form of freedom in my eyes , and i believe the best result and the knowlege of a place is when one makes an adventourous effort to explore it .
