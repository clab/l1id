I am now 23 years old and if you notice I am from an economy that has held itself even after the national fabric threatens to break down every second day .
Something or the other just keeps happening in this nation of millions .

What has given birth to this never say die attitude ?
the normal conclusion will be that its the new generation that holds in its hands the reigns of a powerful and majectic nation .
The pertinent answer to that will be yes the youngsters are responsible for its community .
I totally disagree to the statement ` that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ' .

I am of the same genre that we talk about here .
I would ask how have I not served my community ?
I have taught in blind school that exists just beyond my college , who had forced me to do it ? , nobody .
The reason why I did it is the fact that I think I am responsible to keep everybody priveledged or underpriveledged at the same level .
Infact I felt that this is the least I could do to help those who are less fortunate than me .

As a rule I do n't believe in giving alms , I feel strongly against the notion that any able bodied person should beg and not work .
That is what I do , I work , I contribute to the economy , I work , I pay my taxes on time , I have the will to see that my abilities are used to the fullest so that I grow , in turn my agency grows and that will in turn make my economy grow .

If somebody feels that I stiil have not contributed enough to my community then I must add that my community holds adults and children .
I love and respect both .
Not only do I spend time with them , I stimulate others to spend time with them too .

As an onset I would finish with the statement that I do contribute to my community and I am still counted amongst ` young people ' .
I will continue doing this because I do n't have a point to prove but the fact that my conscience asks this out me and this is the minimum I can do to make people who matter to me more special .
