I completely agree with the statement that `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .

Now-a-days the compitition is so high that the people really pay a good amount of money to these advertisements company in order to sell their products .
For Example in tele shopping advertisements , they give all the benificial details but never tell about the illeffects they have on us .

As these days United States is faceing `` Obeasity and Stress '' as major problems , the focus of the pharmacutical companies is to develop the sliming pills as well as the stress relieving pills which act instantly after egestion .
And later on these drugs are commercialised in order to make large group of population aware of them .
And its then when the advertising companies comes into picture .
The advertising companies provides evidences of all most all the possiable benifits which the population will have after consumming these drugs .
Now-a-days even they provide the population with the evidances of the medical professionals who clame that using these will really benifit the people .
But these companies never bring into picture the long term ill effects which these drugs have on humans .
And thus we , the general population , gets the impression of the product as the best product which is certainly not if long term effects are taken into concideration .

On ethical grounds , i do not support this because i believe that no body has right to play with the health and money of the population and if the product is to be sold to the population , probably the population should be told all the possiable effects that product will have , whether positive or negative .
This way atleast the advertising companies will not be doing injustice to the population in order to be competitive or make more money .

Let the people decide whether the product is benificial for them or not .
Every body knows that nothin is 100 % pure n correct so why to hide the negatives .
Thus ll these advertising companies should focus on is keeping all the aspects of the product in front of the population which actually they are supposed to do and let the people make the final decision .
