I am agree that Successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well .
Because i belive that if we want to be Successful in life then we have to take risks in our life .
We need to learn to take risks and also need to learn that how we can get success in that .

If we just spend our whole life doing just one thing , then at the some stage of your life you will get bored of it .
And i think its make lot of differenc that if we do something from our bottam of hart , and we do something because we have to do it and we dont have any other opation .
For example in my backhome which is India .
we have a one very well known personalty called Mr.Ambani .
He started his bisness with one small factory of washing powder , then he expend his biness and in Ten years he was the owner of the biggest powder factory in India .
He did not stop there then he invest his money in cloth factory .
eventhough there is very tuff compition in indian cloth market he took a risk and in after seven year of his hard work he was the owner of the biggrst indian cloth compny .
He still didnt stop and again he took risk by investing his money in indian petrolium market .

and belive me or not after his and his compnys hard work he is owing biggest pertolium compny in india .
At the present time he is owing corporation which include six indias biggest compny .
In his 30 years of crrier he face lot of problems and tons of diffuclty but he never fear from that and look back .
He always took a risk and as result today he is covering most of the indian market and gaining profits in trilons .
His achivement help him and india a lot to make his identety in world .
If he though that one factory is enfough then the seen today is something different , but he do n't .

Thats why I belive that you will get success only if you put your money , your life in risk .
and if ypu do know that how to get out of it and how start making profit from anything .
Always remember when there is a will there is a way .
You just have to find it .
