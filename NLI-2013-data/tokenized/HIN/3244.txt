In todays era of exponentially evolving technology everybody seems to be entangled in the race to outcompete the rest , to overshadow others in terms of accomplishment , success , fame , power and superiority .
Technology is meant to make life simpler but are we really achieving that .

Todays youth , in the process of mastering the expertise of desiging a robot , which can perform any task you ask it to , have them selves beocome like one - A ROBOT .
We work only towards are selfish goals and gains .
Our life revolves aroud words like I , me , mine .
Gradually we are becoming detached to our families , society and community .

Our perspective has narrowed down .
We do not see beyond our selves .
We do not think about our society and nation .
Nobody takes responsibilty or authority to improve the system .
Everybody dreams about landing on the surface of Moon and Mars but nobody really has the time to see what is happening to our earth , to our people .

Pests like terrorism , global warming , racialism , poverty , economic disparity , nuclaer arms race have crippled us and need to be seriously considered and eradicatd before they cause complete decimation of mankind from the face of the earth .

Many of our natural resources are nearing extinction due to reckless overuse and lack of repletion .
Who shall take the inititative to replenish them ?
natural resouces are gifts of nature to us which are to be judiciously used and passed on to our next generations .

Technology and education should not only be aimed at exploring new areas but also to attend to prevailing problems of todays world order .
Who else has to take this inititative if not the youth of the world .
They are the pioneers of tommorrow .
The buds which shall bloom and become the architects of our future .
Even if each individual youth , in his modest capacity , decide to make some contribtution towards restructuring and refurbishment of the society , solution to a lot of problems will emerge .
Afterall the purpose of education is not just to cram books , make warships , look through a microscope but to make this earth a better place to leave .

It is the moral responsibiltity of the youth to unite against and fight social predators .
