From the topic given , I would like to view it from a different perspective than just agreeing or disagreeing to it .
Education life starts from Class 1 till about class 12 ( This is the ideal situation here in India ) .
From classes 1 to 10 students are given an overview of subjects from diverse fields such as Science , history , geography , literature , languages , and offcourse humanities .
I believe this is a favourable situation for children who are in their growing phase .
This is because , since the children are educated about different fields , they have a better understanding of the world they live in .
I believe just as knowing Newton 's laws of motion are essential , in the same way knowing the History of Indian freedom struggle is as important .
The child broadens his horizon , and becomes a better informed person .
Knowing diverse fields is also beneficial because we live in a society .
We arent isolated people and we need to interact with people and systems from all walks of life .
Would it be justifiable to have limited knowledge in this situation ?

When children live in a society they should have general knowledge of the various aspects of life and society .
However taking this stance , I do not refute the question of specializing in one single field .
As a child grows up , becomes an adult , he decides the kind of proffesion he wants to take .
For example I wanted to become an Accountant .
So after my junior school , that is after my class 10 , I took up commerce as my speciality subject .
This way after my initial years of learning about the world in general , I could concentrate on the subject , I wanted to make a career on .
Isnt that justified ?
Let me give a funny example .
Suppose I just specialized in commerce throughout junior school , extending to senior school and beyond , and finally became a successful accountant .
One day when my child grows up and asks me a simple question about the solar system , and the number of planets in it , do you think I would be confident of my answer ?
I would be fumbling , and searching the encyclopedia for possible answers .
The thought in itself is not very encouraging .
So I believe initial knowlegde of diverse fields in junior school , there after specialization in college would serve our requirments better .

Since the topic mentiones `` academic subjects '' I presumed the subjects taught in an academic environment .
So such subjects and such a practice of general study or specialization can only happen in a school .
Therefore in the above stated opinion I concentrated on children to illustrate my argument in a better fashion .
