I do agree with the opinion that the student s should understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts because every time itis not possible for one to go through certain facts to understand a particular problem and finding out a solution to the problem .

For example to understand the logic behind the an object coming towards earth has to have certain fact behind that or a theory behind that .
At the same time to understand this theory of gravitational pool a student must understand the concept of gravity and then the theory of it .

Every thing has a cause-effect relationship .
According to which a student must understand the cause behind a particular thing happend and for which students must understand the concept or idea of that paricular thing first .

For example .
A tree like mango which is seen tobe so huge has small fruits like mangos which the tree can easily carry .
Why it is not carrying a heavy fruit like pumpkin ...
have you ever thought of that ...
God has created this world with greater care ..
considering each and every aspect in life ..
he might have thought that if any fruit hanging on the huge tree like mago falls down on a person resting under the tree then what will happen ?

For every problem solution a student must understand the ideas and concepts about the particular thing which will enable them to reach depth and objective of a particular thing .
It can not be denied the the fact the facts are to be learnt by the students tounderstand a paricular problem and finding out a solution to it .

Concluding the above opinion students must adapt themselves according to the nature of a particular thing to understand .
