what is it that differentiates a successful person from an unsuccessful one ?
well successful people dont do much different things but do the same things in a different way .
i disagree with the notion that you have to always do some thing out of the way to be successful .

sucess in todays world is always determined by the amount of money you earn but then suceess is a combination of factors like good relationship with family friends or the community you are living in. unless you have these basic things in life in order you cannot expect to be successful just moving in a single dimension .

i am not saying that a person should not follow his or her dreams or should not try new things in life but before doing that you have to be rooted firmly on the ground .
only from a secured territory you should go for exploring unknown ones .
people usually take risks which comes under the category of recklessness not worrying about others or ignoring their resposibilities .

i believe in the law of karma which says that whatever work we find ourselves in , the kind of people we are sorrounded with are all a function of who we are and a function of our past doings .
to do the work we are assigned to the best of our ability is our duty .
only when we follow this we will find new opportunities as we go along .

to do new things and take risks we have to do it from a position of strength and for that we have to focus on the basics of life .
we should try new rhings only if comes from our heart and not just for the sake of adventure .
thats all i have to say
