I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I think this is a misconception arising due to the outdated views on how a community is defined and also the ways to help the community .

The complaint seems to be that the youth are so self-indulgent and selfish in pursuing their own career goals and ambitions that they do not devote enough time to community .
But we must recognize that the individual is the basic unit of society .
So if the individual does something to improve his or her quality of life , the overall average quality of life of the community increarses .
In turn such people also inspire other people to better their lives and start a progressive trend .
It is a situation similar to say a scientist isolating himself from society to excel in his inventions , but then the fruits of innovation are shared by all .

A more serious aspect of this complaint can be the supposed indifference of the youth towards their community .
This complaint also has roots in how do we define the community traditionally .
In today 's ever shrinking world where more and more people of different communities come together and work , the youth seem to be embracing a larger community , and their commitments to this emerging but broader community might seem to affect their contribution towards their local community .
Again , I would argue that if the youth are working towards some greater common good then that is bound to benefit all in the long run .

Another point I would like to make is that if the young people devote relatively more time towards their self development , they will be more stable and more capable of helping back the community .
Basically they would be able to help the community ina better way and even in more impactful way .
For example , many institutions benefit from the funds and projects that their alumni bring back to their alma-mater .

The real problem can be when the young people are not doing something constructive and productive .
We definitely need to guard against such apathy towards oneself and hence the society .
But this malady does not restrict itself to young people only and hence it would be wrong to blame only the young for such behavior .
In fact , I think that young people are more enthusiastic and less cynical than most of the older generation .

In summary , I would assert that an individual is the basic unit of society .
As long the individual is involved in something that is constructive or beneficial to at least the person himself , the overall community is bound to get the benefits sooner or later , not neccesarily in explicit terms but in more subtle and impactful ways .
