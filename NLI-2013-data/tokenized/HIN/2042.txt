Enjoyment has nothing to do with the age but has lot more to do with heart , ability and more importantly with the conditions that a person is in .
And for that reason I think that even the older people get to enjoy their life maybe in different ways but they do enjoy their life .

Young people get to enjoy on the dance floors or in the college cafetaria .
Similary the older generation get to enjoy and spend their time in their own thougful and entertaning ways .
One and easily see lots of older people in the parks , enjoying walking , chit-chatting or enjoying various other activites their such as gardening , laughing clubs etc cetera .
The park next to our society is one such living example .
One can easily find lots of older people lottering either alone or in company of their friends or grandchildrens .

Again older people are free from most of the tensions and duties such as money matters , family matters and thus lead more carefree life with ample amount of free time to spent as they please and in fullfilling their wishes and inventing new hobbies .
For example their is an old couple staying next to my house who have taking clay modeling as their new hobbie .
Lot of others prefer either reading , writing , travelling or enjoy spending time in various social activites , at religious places or playing around with their grandchildrens .

Some people argue that older generation are weak and lack enough energy to enjoy life .
Yes old age do comes with its own proplems such as health problems and low enery levels but this is old time story .
One can easily find out the number of older people enjoying and living their life to fullest .
For example the Prime Minister of India , the President of United States of America along with lots of other national and internation examples are openly challanging this view .

For the above stated reasons I feel that even older people gets to enjoy their life maybe in their own way and not as the yong generation but their do enjoy their life ,
