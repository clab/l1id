People specialize in certain subjects because of many reasons , few of them may be person 's personal interest in that field , some times requirements are such that people have to specialize in certain subjects for good of other people for example specialization in heart surgery .
But its not always necessary to specialize in subjects .
People can learn and read many academic subjects as they like , but it has its own positive and negative sides .
But still according to me people should choose variety of subjects due to many possible reasons .

Firstly , many academic subjects provide people with broader way of thinking .
By choosing various academic subjects people can actually enhance and diversify their think tank .
They can use experiences of one subject to understand the other .
Variety of subjects can increase thier level of understanding in other areas also .
For example while studying for mechanical engines , students should also understand the chemical reactions taking place inside the engines and how they affect the working of engines .
This can only happen if they have enough information regarding chemical reactions inside the engine .

Secondly , by opting variety of subjects to study , students can become versatile .
They can view this world with wider range of options and with wider prospective .
For instance students may not face problems while applying for different types of jobs .
They can opt from variety of jobs available in the market in different fields .
Additionaly they can switch their careers later , if they want to , to try different jobs if they get bored from the previous one .

Admittedly certain jobs do require specialization in some fields , for instance technical jobs requiring surgery of particular body parts .
However people with diverse experience in various subjects are well respected and are very highly valued by the companies in the society .

Therefore i conclude that by studying various academic subjects people can really enhance their knowledge and can be a great value and asset to a company in which they are working .
