I disagree to the statement that young people enjoy their life more , as the older people were also young at some point of their life and hence they have gone through what a younger generation is going through , but time plays an important role in the enjoyment of life and also what an individual has the image of enjoyment of life in his mind .

Firstly , it is correct that young generation is enjoying the life more than the older at that time but as the time passes the young generation has to enter the older generation and that same young generation now again takes some pleasures in enjoying life in older age also thus if we calculate the enjoyment by comparing the older person to young one then we will find that older ones has enjoyed more on the scale of time .

Secondly , every person has its own defination of enjoyment in life , some might feel like their are enjoying life if the go for long drive or spend time in travelling and exploring the huge world , while some might feel that they are enjoying thier life by just chilling around their loved ones and spending time in chatting , emailing playing games etc. now this type of enjyoment are not defined for some particular age any one can get this enjoyment at anytime of thier life .
Thus the older and younger genration can enjoy to the same type of enjoyment .

Thirdly , every person has his own set of thinking of enjoyment and as the young generation is unaware of enjoyment he is going to get in his future life , he is more excited and ready to enjoy the life at every part of his life , which was the same feeling that an old generation has gone through .

Moreover now all the enjoyment that a young genration does are aslo tried and enjoyed by the older people , thus they have present life of enjoyment in old age and also had the enjoyment during thier young age , but the current younger genration ca n't go back in time and enjoy the moments that the older generation has experienced , but will have some different experiences of enjoyment of life for their coming younger generations .

Also , even if the young generation is young and can do many things that older ca n't but there are some things that younger genration does not have is the experience of the enjoyment which had been to the older generation , for young generation the enjoyment has just begin but for the older one it is coming to its end and thus they have far more enjoyed than the current younger generation .

Thus altogether the younger generation also enjoyes the life but the enjoyment that he has experienced has also been experieced by the older genration and the defination of enjoyment changes from person to person .
