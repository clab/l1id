I do agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
This I concluded from my own personal experience , and the personal experiences of my relatives and friends .

I have , on several occassion , actually purchased , a whole range of products , like lipstick , soaps , detergents , clothes , etc , after having seen them being advertised on TV .
But on most occasions , I was not happy with the product in hand , they simply did not match the quality that they claimed in the advertisement .
In a leading brand shampoo advertisement , for example , It was claimed , that the regular use of the shampoo for a months time , would lead to the complete dissapearance of dandruff .
Believing this claim , I bought the shampoo for my self , and used it as advised .
But the results , were very un satisfactory , after its use not only did the dandruff problem continue to persist , it had in fact much worse than what it was before it 's use .
Similarly , a leading health drink brand , in its advertisement claimed that , this was , by far the best health drink availble in the market , and it tastes much better than any other brand .
Falling pray to their claim , I changed my brand of health drink .
I purchased this , Instead of the one that I had been using for a long time .
To my surprise , I found almost no differece between the two brands , not only this , there was no added health advantage I recieved form the usage of this brand , which I did not recieve from the usage of the earlier one .

My relatives , friends , and many of you as well will have similar experiences to recount .
Indeed advertisements make tall claims about the products , and they have ways to make their products look much better than they actually are .
For example , let us talk about a leading brand energy bar advertisement .
In this add they show a well built athlete , on the race track , sand claim that we can be like him we use the energy bar .
But some thinking will tell us , that there is nio way of guessing how the athlete got his health .
A sneak into the athleats personal life will tell us that .
Not the add

Advertisement , should not be belived , they are there to sell products , and to do that they can go to any extent to make thir product look better than those of their competitors .
As a result of which most end up making tall claims about the product and make the consumer buy these .
After susequent use the consumer realises the product is not as good as it was claimed in the advert
