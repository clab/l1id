I completely agree to the statement that adversitements really make the product look different and much better than it acually is .
This is just a mode of increasing the sale of that product .
Advertisements do highlight the advantages of the products but every coin has two sides and all that looks beautiful from outside is not always not so .
They just exagerrate and present everything .
Lets not forget that people do beilieve these advertisements and end up loosening many times .
Some time back there was an advertisement about some new hair product on TV and i it seemed so attractive that i could n't help getting it .
The results were n't very impressive .
I ended up with falling of my hair and dandruff problem which i never had .
One shoud n't just beleive in what is presented externally , it is n't what it is actually .
Yesterday only i saw that advertisement about the quiznos sub stating that what they offer is much more , not only this but they also degraded the products of another competent .
i do n't think that any one has a right to do that .
advertising your own product is acceptable but not degrading others .
In my country the rules are different , people ca n't really do that .
Sometimes i really think that advertisement are just a mode for fooling people and nothing more , before buying anything at all one should find out the advantages and disadvantages both and than decide .
Dont just blindly believe in what is being presented .
All that glitters is not gold .
Similarly all that lookes good is not always so .
It is very easy to spend money but very diificult to earn .
So dont just spend your hard money on these useless advertisement but think logically before you take a step .
Advertisements are helpful but not always .
