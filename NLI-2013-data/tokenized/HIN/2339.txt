I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Instead , I feel its the other way round .
Its the old peole who have an opportunity to enjoy their lives rather than the young ones .
There are various reasons which justify my position .

First , a young guy would always have a lot to think .
He would be worried about his career .
He knows its a crucial time for him which shall shape his future .
He spends most of his time planning and thinking .
A lot of his effort goes into this .
Since , an old person would be through with this phase of his life , he will not have any tensions related to career as such .
He has achieved what he wanted to and could now enjoy his success .

Secondly , when a person is young he 's knows that he has to take care of his family .
He knows he is the bread earner .
This fact of life does n't allow him to savor his youth .
He spends his time working in offices or runninng businesses to cater to his familiy 's needs .
On the other hand older people donot have to work .
They have retired and free to enjoy their lives .

Third , a young person is still learning to survive in the world .
He does n't have all the wisdom and exerience to deal with the difficult situations which an older person would have .
From childhood to youth , he learns how to adjust , deal with relationships and handle pressures .
For the young , the life is full of hardships and he 's learing to find his way through .

Forth , its a time when a person gets married .
It 's said , a right marriage can make you and a wrong one can destroy .
The person need to develop that level of maturity and understanding to deal with his spouse .
He does compromises , making it a not so easy life for him .
On the other hand , having lived so many years together , older people have developed that understanding .
This leaves them with a good partner to enjoy their lives with .

Undoubtely , according to me , when a person is young he 's building a platform for his older life .
A platform on which when he grows old , he can live and relish life and can enjoy things which he missed when he was young .
