Young people nowadays show very little or in some cases no time towards helping their communities .
Young people are more and more concerned with money , fame and publicity .
They do not want to spend time helping out their communities as they are not going to gain anything by doing this .

To begin with , nowadays young people are more interested in oneself rather than the people around it .
Young people are more self centered and are excessively concerned about oneself .
Hence they do not care about what other people are going through .
Nowaday 's you can see that most of the young students are looking forward to becoming doctors , engineers , sportsperson but very few are interested in helping their nation to progress or else helping their communities .

Also , young people today are least interested in communties and social service and give very little significance to it .
For example , lets talk about Mother Teresa .
She was such a great helper to society and devoted all her time to social service .
She had no greed for money or publicity .
But , because of the lack of concern towards communities by the young generation you will see very few people taking the path of Mother Teresa .

However , there are a few exceptions who do give their time to communties and social service .
Sometimes people who have made a some money in their life do contribute in some way or the other to communities .
They do not have the time to spend but they do have the money and hence they donate some amout of money to communities and hence play their role towards helping it .

Nevertheless , young people nowadays do have a tendency to forget what communities have done for them and that it is their duty to give back something to the community by helping them out .
Helping out ones communtiy , and in this way doing some social service must be made mandatory in schools .
