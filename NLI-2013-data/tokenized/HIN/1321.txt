In my opinion it is better to have specialized knowledge in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academec subjects .
A person having a broad and superficial knowledge of many academic subjects is like a jack of all trades but master of none .
Such a person cannot do justice to any of the academic subjects .

Like for example no patient will like his brain to be operated upon by a general physician rather than by a neuro-surgeon .
Similarly a teacher teaching a variety of subjects cannot do justice to students of a specific stream .
He might be aware of all the subjects he is teaching but he might not be well equipped to satisfy the queries of a student regarding the specifications of a topic .

It is advised to have an overall knowledge of various subjects and be aware of all the things which is why we as a student study a variety of subjects at school level .
But then it is even more important to give a direction to the course of our studies by pursuing further education in a field of our interest so that we do proper justice to our studies .
A student might not be as interested in studying literature as he might be in engineering sciences or vice-versa .
So it is kind of unfair to make him study subjects that do not interest him which ultimately leads to his securing poor grades in those subjects .

One may very well argue that a student may be interested in more than one subject and may want to pursue his further studies in both .
In that case , now-a-days there are many combinations of subjects available which help us in understanding the inter relationship of different subjects with each other .
For instance , the application of engineering sciences in medical stream is one of the most studied combination .

By the time a student completes his schooling he is in a condition to make up his mind and decide his areas of interest .
So giving him a choice then to choose his preferred stream will help him perform well and hence will lead to his motivation and satisfaction .
Moreover , there are numerous fields which require exhaustive research and study for their proper understanding and appreciation .
A student whose faculty are being used in a variety of subjects will not be able to find enough time and resources to utilise in all the fields .
Hence he might not be able to appreciate the nuances of a subject as well as he could have when studying that subject in detail .

In view of the above arguments i believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
