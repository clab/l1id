`` Work is the way of life '' this is what i think for any young man / women .
Yes I agree with the opinion that young people enjoy their life more than older one .
Life is a big experience , we encounter various situations both pleasent and unpleasent one , but they help us in maturing our qualities to tackles various hurdles in life .
In my opinion youth are the one who enjoy their life more than any older person .

I always rememeber the days when my grandfather told me to enjoy every part of this young life with full enthusiasm and cheerfulness .
He also said me that `` Life is not the bed of roses , often there are thorns '' so enjoy your every part of this life may be you get number of problem .
you are young , this is the time which will develop the fruitful experience in you and shapened your abilities to see your professional life , married life .

I think that only a young person firstly enjoy his college life , where he get true friend there , he will enjoy every moment in college functions , parties , late night outs .
after completing your college life now you enter the world of Professionalism , it does n't matter you are in which post as a manager or a Engineer .
A young person will definately enjoy the responsibilities to complete a project , risk taking nature and willingness to succeed than other .
Then comes your married life , you can share you every moment of love , sorrow , you get a partner for whole of the life time .
what all you enjoy with your partner at the begening of married life is always plays a important role in anybody life .
This is the time when you get the responsibilities of your children and family .
you have to manage all the thing job and family simultaneously .

Lastly i would like to say that life will show you different stages , childhood , younger , then older age .
It depend on how you enjoy the life .
Life will always tend you to face various situations .
but it is only the true experience and you inner emotions how you want to enjoy your life .
