There is an old saying that ' if u wanna be big you got to think big ' .
that means that if you want to be sucessful in life you have to think for new ideas and new ideas always come with great risks .
I completly agree with this statement .

Most of the most sucessful people in this world have suceeded by taking new ideas rather than going with the same traditional ones .
If you already know about the things you are doing your chances of bringing a change are minimised as you have a path and the only thing you have to do is just walk on it .

Once a great man said ' if i have to walk on a path shown to me like a dumb ill rather walk alone blinded ' .
one such example is of the richest man in the world ie Bill Gates .
Broke at the age of 20 been told to handle the family business by his father this boy had no choice left but the boy had one thing with him and that was an idea and a will to do something to be something in life and that was when he discovered his dream .
But as then say u might fall as you walk alone but the person who is not affected by the fall is the person who suceeds in life as a result of it he became one of the most sucessful persons walking on this earth .

There are thousands of other examples in this world but my point is that there are always ups in dows in a persons life but if you have the will you will suceed ` as god walks with them who try ' .
