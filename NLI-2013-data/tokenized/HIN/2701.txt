i totally disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than the older people '' . as there is a famous saying `` still young at heart '' . the above statement suggests that there is no limitation of age to enjoy life .
it 's your life and one should enjoy it 's each and every single moment he lives , because life is precious and the time which has gone by will never return .
it is certainly old fashioned to think that once you get old , you have lost the authority to enjoy .
but in this stage of life one should enjoy life to the fullest as you have spend your whole life trying to make both ends meet both personally and professionally at several circumstances .
now when your children are grown up and you no longer hold their responsibility , one can spend this important part of his/her life by living upto each and every moment that passes by .

as when a person is young and full of energy , he gets into the grind of life facing this harsh world .
once he comes out of his college and start earning money , he is ultimately engaged with the chores of the family life and faces day to day problems .
and now in todays senario , where the world follows the express lifestyle , one has no time to spend with his/her family memebers neither get time for himself so that he can enjoy the variety of things that this life has to offer .
he works day and night to earn money just to buy that extra comfort for his retirement .
so that he can spend those last days in peace and enjoy rest of the days .

the very which shows us that we work hard all our lives to improve our retirement , then how can one say that young people enjoy more than older people do .
each person does this for himsel , for a secured life later .
he adds up mone so that one can enjoy lidfe with ones partner without hassels and problems of daily life .
