I disagree with the concept of having a general knowledge of a broad variety of subjects compared to specialization in one field .
In my opinion it is better to focus on one academic subject because it achieves more and the achievement is more thorough .

In todays competitive world , I understand the importanceof having knowledge , regarding various subjects , but i think , such knowledge should be pursued at lower levels of education , such as college or high school , to develop the overall personality of the student .
However , in higher education specialization is a must , since , it provides greater opportunities for the future and experience during the period of training .
For example , If you look around , those doctors who do not pursue a specialty course ( general practioners ) tend to do well in their practice , but those who do specialize , run a spectacular practice .
This is relevant to both the nature of cases treated and the salary earned .
The specialist sees rare cases , reffered to him by the general practioner , increasing his knowledge in his chosen field .
He is better able to treat the condition and naturally earns more , as well .
Another example - on comparing the jobs allotted to postgraduates with those allotted to the graduates , one can see the preference is given to the former .
A Law student is more likely to be recruited with a prestigious firm than the average High school pass-out .
Experience plays an important role here , because there is channelisation of forces acting to achieve the higher goal .

Also , if one wants a broad knowledge of subjects , the number of goals naturally increases .
This requires time , effort and money .
Consequently , efficiency is greatly reduced and complete knowledge of each subject can be easily compromised .
In my experience as a student i realised i did well in the years when i had thre subjects to cover in undergraduate school as compared to when I had four subjects .
In all fairness , subjects in each year required intensive reading .
Similarly , i have noticed that the class valedictorian , usually , excels in one or two subjects and not each subject , clearly showing how difficult it is to master each .

`` The Jack of all trades , the master of none . ''
I would not llike to be associated with that phrase because i think it undermines the motivation to succeed .
Success , for me is the attainment of a goal , which requires focus .
If there are numerous paths to follow then success cannot be gained beacuse of loss of focus .
I believe in a firm foundation of knowledge of many topics upon which i can build my expertise ,, just like a plane wih a braod middle and a pointed tip , which is in conformity with the principles of aerodynamics .
