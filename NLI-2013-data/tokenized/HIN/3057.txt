It is commonly said that , even if you get old remain young at heart .
This is because young enjoys every bit of life , when they are working , playing , partying or even when they are wasting their time .
Youth represents eneregy , flow , ability to work hard and party harder .
Therefore , I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

At young age , people have dreams , aims , hopes and ability to fulfill their dream .
This encourage them continously to work hard and acheive their goal .
At young age , they enjoy this hard work .
while older people do it for its sake .
For them , it is routine and nothing inspiring is left in doing those thing .
They are just cutting the time .

At the time of party , youth enjoys it even harder , as it is the outcome of their hard work .
They tend to flirt , dance , drive , eat and drink .
This gives them an complete experience , which the old can never enjoy .
Being old , you cannot flirt or dance , and limitations come on eating and drinking due to health problems .
Also , they are in continous tensions , for variety of reasons .
This make their life boring .

At young age , you have friends of various interests .
This helps you to take part in each and every game .
You can go for rock climbing , sea diving , underwater swimming , Formula racing and even to various other sporting events .
But as you grow old , your stamina decreases , you are sorrounded by various illness , energy level has decreased a lot .
All this factors lead you to keep out of such sporting events .

In my country , people are always thinking of other 's view and opinion .
This inhibits their desire to break all the rules and become young once again .
Wheras young do n't give a penny to such things .
They enjoy life in full stretch .
They do not care for other 's opinion and do as they want , which is also a prerequisite of enjoyment .

There is also othet part of coin .
Young people want to live life happily , without a break .
So , if something unwanted happen , they get depressed very easily .
At this stage , youth require experience of older people to fight this depression .
If the young learn to avoid depression and understands thats up and downs are part of life they can easily come over any situation and enjoy life non stop .

Thus , it can be easily concluded that , if you want to enjoy life you have to become young again .
It is not that older people do n't enjoy but when they enjoy we seldom says that they had return to their young age .

This is enough to say that young people enjoy a lot .
