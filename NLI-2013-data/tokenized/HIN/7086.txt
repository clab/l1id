The given statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' is a disputable topic .
But I would like to disagree with the statement .
This is because I believe that in twenty years from now , there will be an increase in the number of cars used as compared to what we see today .

The most important factor which supports my view is the kind of advancement in technology that we have .
I am sure that with developments in the above feild we will soon have better and improved versions of car models .
With the growing concern in terms of environmental pollution caused by cars , we will have better fuel saving , nature friendly models which will be welcomed by all .
Also it will attract more an more number of people to buy such eco friendly cars .

Another reason why I disagree with the statement is that , I feel cars are much more convinient than other public transport facilities available .
And therefore they serve as a better option for conveyance .
Hence , as man is more convinence oriented , in the future more and more people will be encouraged to buy cars .

Also , now a days people are becoming more and more aware of their status and respect in the society .
And in order to match up with the norms of the society dominated by rich people , they follow what others do .
So this attraction will to buy cars for themselves and therefore contribute to increase in the number .

Finally , i also believe that people are becoming richer day by day .
The class i am discussing is upper middlecalss an d the rich people .
Middle class and otherwise poor people can anyways not afford such a luxury .
So with more and more population having extra money will drive them into looking onto for previliges and luxury .
It is very much possible that different members of the same family will own different cars for their own convenience .

So to sum up , i think that newer ans improved models of cars , their convenience , their status value and extra money with the rich people will ultimately lead to a society with a greater number of cars in use in the coming years .
