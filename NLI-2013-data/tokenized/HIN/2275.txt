Young people tend to enjoy more than the elder people do because they are more energetic than them and are physically stronger .
They got a large list of activities of enjoyment than the list of elder people .

Usually old people enjoy in home relaxing themselves or to the maximum extent of going out for a dinner .
Youngsters have a lot to enjoy themselves in there life .
Since they are physically strong they can indulge into many activities .
I usually enjoy myself by indulging in physical activities like sports example cricket .
I enjoy playing cricket with my friends and I like and enyoy the game immensely .
The game involves lot of concentration and physical challenges with lots of ups and downs which generates great excitement between us during the game .
Older people cannot experience the same feeling as we do .
There are many other activities in which youngsters can enjoy themselves in contrast to the activities of adults .

Another experience which I remember is my school trip to the mountains .
It was a great experience for me and I enjoyed enormous number of activities some of which includes mountain trekking , rock climbing , river rafting and horse riding to be mentioned .
Our teachers also came with us in the school trips .
Observing them one could easily recognise the difference between yhe level of enjoyment between youngsters and adults .
While adults could only enjoy themselves with the scenic beauty of the mountains and the cusine offered at the place or a long walk , we had a wide range of activities to indulge in as mentioned above .
It was impossible for our teachers to involve in the similar activities as we did .

Thus young people enjoy themselves greatly indulging in wide variety of activities and face the world with enthusiasm and excitement with their inexperienced mind without cosidering the thoughts of other people , which the elder people cannot experience .
Hence , the above points support my opinion that young people enjoy life filled with excitement more than the older people .
