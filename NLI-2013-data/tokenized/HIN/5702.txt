I whole heartedly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisements are the source for the companies to reach the customers and sell their product .
Advertisements play an important role in forming an opinion about any product .
If the advertisement is convincing enough , the customer will go and enquire about the product or will try the product .
So , to leave a mark on the customer 's mind , the advertisement is made very catchy and most of the times the advertisements become very misleading .
The products are advertised to have so many features but when you actually see the product or use it , you come to know the real features .

When you see an advertisement , you tend to get fascinated by the features mentioned in the advertisement but when you actually see the product , it leads to disappointment .
But the advertisement actually help the company to bring customers to their products ...
For example , I read in a newspaper about a life time free credit card from a leading bank and I actually signed all the documents to get one .
I got my credit card but later I came to know that some money was deducted from my account as the charges for a magazine subscription .
When i asked the officer of the bank , he said it comes as a package with the card .
That instance drove me to frustration .

Another instance is when i bought a shirt of a top brand .
The company advertise the shirt as wrinkle free but when i actually washed the shirt , it was just a normal shrt with lots of wrinkles on it .
Instances like these happened many times .
Advertisements are mostly misleading but these at least help to bring customer to the shop or to sell the product .

Advertisement is a way by which the companies can reach the customers , tell the customers about the products and finally make their market .
So , the advertisements should tell only the real and true qualities of the product .
The misleading advertisements have led to the decline in the number of people watch or pay attention to the advertisements .
In this way , the advertisements will lose their charm and importance soon .
