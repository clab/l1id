Success in life is determined by the work you do and the amount of time you put toward that work .
Everyone has a dream of becoming successful one day and achieving all their goals in life .
Sucessful people do n't just become sucessful overnight , they work hard and have strategies which they follow very closely .
According to me , it is important for successful people to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

People who have the courage and the will to become successful will take risks .
Life never works the same way all the time .
What one has learned might not be useful in the real world setting .
They might have to change themselves or modify their ideas to make themselves eligible for the real work setting .
For example , as successful chef that person must have taken all kinds of risks .
If the chef is a vegetarian chef , he/she would have taken the risk to work with non-vegetarian food .
If the chef had only been working on vegetarian dishes and never tried cooking non-vegetarian dishes he/she might not be a competitve chef .
Taking risks and trying out new things makes people look and stand out as better and more knowing candidates .

Trying new things might not always result in a success but it is worth an experience .
It is this experience that teaches people great lessons in life .
For example , the most famous Thomas Edison was asked a question when he applied for a loan to a bank one more time for his experiments which were failing .
He was asked , what is the guarantee that this time your experiment will succeed .
Mr. Edison replied that he has 228 reasons why they will not succeed .
This reply shows that successful people take risks and fail but still take risks because they know exactly what they are doing and are confident enought to justify everything .
If successful people like Mr. Edison never took risks we would n't have bene able to see these innovative inventions around us .

Success is marked by one 's efforts and hard work .
In order for those efforts and hard work to work a person must be willing to take risks to become a better and a competitve candidate in his/her field of expertise .
Also , to gain an experience and achieve more in life .
