The above statement mentions that `` Most Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .
In my opinion this statement is true and valid reasons can be given for the same .

Advertisement has been a mode of communication to the people worldwide .
These days there are various ways in which a product can be advertised .
It can be print , television , radio stations or even websites .
Print media includes newspapers , fliers , leafltes , hoardings on the road etc .

Firstly , consider the product wherein there is a huge competetive market , for instance beer .
When there are so many brands available and when a person is already used to a certain brand what would make him change that brand ?
Nothing but the way it is advertised .
These days we see large hoardings which say that the beer named Budlight has `` no carbs and no calories '' .
So this directs the people who are calorie conscious to drink that beer .
We just believe in the advertisement and go ahead to buy the product .
But does anyone really know if this is true and the other thing even if the beer is not good at taste people will drink only because of the way it has been advertised .

Secondly , in India there was a product called `` Fair n Lovely '' which is a fairness cream and when applied on the skin makes a person fair in 21 days .
How far can we agree to this ?
Even if this does not actually happen to all people they still want to try .
All the people want to apply and see the result and psycologically they feel that there is a change in them .

Thirdly , there are certain products which have established a brand name in the market , so these sellers dont need to make their product look more better .
To illustrate the food chain namely `` Subway '' has already created their brand name so they dont need to advertise thier product in a way which seems to be good whereas the food chains like Jack in the Box , Dairy Queen who are making a stand in the market have to advertise in such a way that their products look tempting and can be sold easily .

Thus , it can be said that Advertisement is the reason to make a product seem much better .
No doubt some products are good in reality but the other products which cannot survive in competition make their product look like the best one .
Therefore without Advertisement no product can be sold or made noticeble to the people locally or globally .
Advertisement forms a part or a neccesity of every organisation but the methods used for advertising should be straight and not misleading to the consumers .
