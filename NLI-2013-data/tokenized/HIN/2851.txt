Indeed , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
The passion and inexperience of youth allows people to embrace new challenges and experiment freely with circumstances and situations .
For instance , while the cares of home and hearth may not allow an older person to retire early and travel the earth , a younger person , who is not similarly attached , has the freedom to back-pack around the planet , without worrying about a wife , a child , an income , the rent , or the various other mundanities of everyday life .

Real world experience informs us that as most people get older , their lives tend to follow a pattern .
The natural cycle of birth , life and death , is interspersed by the human cycle of education , work , marriage , family , retirement and old age .
While in the early stages , we seem to be writing our own destiny , the concerns of a spouse , children and work ( while they may be enjoyable in their own right ) , tend to limit our freedom , and establish a time worn pattern of life that each human being replicates in his/her own fashion .

Youngsters are not only bereft of responsibility , they also have the singular advantage of being healthier , having more energy , vitality and vigour than older people .
This allows them to stretch their limits and accept demanding challeges , both physical and mental , that allow them to enjoy life to the fullest .
While on the one hand , this could translate into a bungee-jumping thrill , or a rigorous race , on the other , it could mean the ability to balance a college education with an extra-curricular pursuit , such as dance , music or art .

The most fascinating aspect of youth is the tremendous hope and opportunity that lies ahead .
While in college , we may dare to dream about conquering the world , and single-mindedly pursue our goals , as we get older , barring a prodigious few , we are restricted by the knowledge of our own limitations .
While experience and maturity have their merit , nothing can rival the optimism and endurance of youth .
