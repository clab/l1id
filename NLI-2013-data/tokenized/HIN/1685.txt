I agree to have a speicalized knowledge on a specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
According to me , when a child is brought in a school and later to higher secondary school , he is taught all academic subjects which will lead him to a better understanding of this world .

After attending the school , a student has a broad perspect of different subject knowledge with him .
Now a student is capable of using his knowledge which leads to exploration of new ideas in his mind and setting a specific goal of his life .
The student thinks of a particular subject as his interest .
He develops a penchant for a particular subject .
It is in the interest of a student that he works for a specific subject because he will be a adroit and astute student of that subject .
A student therefore plans for his Masters in that subject .
He turns out to be a appropriate person for that specialized subject .
He later on joins research on that subject and he achieve his goal .
According to me , nobody in this world has capability to master every subject in this world .
Even scientists like Galileo , Einstein , Newton , etc. had their own interest and specialization which led to different discoveries in this world .
It implies that if everybody in this world have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects then world would be a boring place to stay .
There would be no innovation around and it would be tasteless .
The versatility of this world would end at its very early age .

There a so many living examples who has supported the idea of having a specialized knowledge on a specific subject .
From Sports to politics , Businessman to Adventurers , there so many people who lives their life for their dreams and their goals .
One of the best living example of my time is Mr. Amitabh Bachchan .
Amitabh bachchan is an actor of Bollywood Industry .
He has did his Bachelor in Arts and joined Bollywood Industry .
Recently , he has been awarded with the Bachelors of Performing Arts .
The ectasy which Amitabh bachchan would be having after achieving this degree would be immeasurable .
I support specialization on specific subject because its brings you immense happiness when you fulfill your goal of that subject .
Considering sports on the other hand , football legends like ronaldo , pele , ronaldinho have specialised in their skills and therefore they are at the peak of their career .

I would conclude by writing that specialization on a specific subject needs high interest in it and hard work to achieve the goals .
A person would achieve more fruitful if he is specialized in a specific subject than a person have a mere broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
