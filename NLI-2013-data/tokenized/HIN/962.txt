yes .
I think so it is not fine that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in on specific subject .
Because people having different ideas of their subject .
Some people go for different subject like social and some people go for science .
It depends apon how they study .
Some people having broad knowledge of their academy subject .
And other dont .
their should be information abot the academic what is the matter and what it matters .
it all depends upon them .
I prefer to go with broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Because iy helps us to have more knowledge about the subject and we can easily understand the subject .
Broad knowledge helps us to discuss and share our opinion about a particular subject which mainly we choose .
It is easy to specify the subject with a broad knowlede helps to get good scores in particular subject .
So broad knowledge specialize and specify the subject easily .
So gaining extra knowledge of subject is good .
We know about the topic correctly and perfectly they we can futher proceed to next subjects .
This is what advantage to us that we have many information about the subject and how it helps us in studting .
ex ; a person who has a little knowledge of subject gets less marks .
Where as the other student have a good or broad knowledge about the subject will get more mareks because it is better for the student to have broad thinking .
So this is only why the broad helps us to allow us to collect more information u can knowledge helps us ti have broad knowledge of many subjects .
it ok to choose a subject .

I prefer it is better to have broad knowledge of many subject than one specific subject .
