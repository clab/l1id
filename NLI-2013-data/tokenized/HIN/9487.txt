I do not subscribe to the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
Students should be more focussed on getting the facts right as facts hold them are unalterable and are bound to hold them good in long stead .
What may seem a great idea to one person may be perceived as unfeasible and dismissed by another idea from person who has taken a different approach .

Ideas can be whimsical and outlandish .
They can even range from bizzare to plain absurd .
It is here that facts stop whimsical ideas to take flight and cause unnecessary wastage of time and effort by a team of creators .

Let me quote a recent example .
Donald Trump , the real estate mogul from New York , mooted the idea of the new season of hit TV series , The Apprentice on racial lines .
The contest was previously held between university graduates and non degree holders .
For the latest season he came up with the idea of the contest taking place between colored and white people .
The idea , before it could shape up further , drew huge criticism and widespread uproar among the society as to how come racism form the basis of a tv show that is essentially a recruitment process which is broadcast all over the country and abroad forcing Trump to abandon the idea and issue an apology .

This idea would never have been come up , if Donald Trump had acquainted himself with the fact , that anything remotely racist would be condemned widespread as racism in any form is still a sensitive issue .

This is not to say that ideas and concepts should be trashed away completely .
They should be allowed to prosper only after the facts have been taken into account .
Facts form the basis of ideas and concepts and unless a student has got his facts in place , he will not be able to come up with original and progressive ideas .
A building cannot be stable when the very foundation of it is weak and infirm .
