I am inclined to agree with the statement that the people who take risks and try something new rather then doing what they know make them successful .
I have certains reasons to agress with this statement which I would discuss later in my essays .
I would also like to highlight the fact that taking such risks might not get the success in1st attempt , sometimes people need to attempt multiple times .

The main reason for this my view is that I believe in `` More risk , More gain '' philosophy .
If I decide to get into some new business/idea , which nobody has tried , I need compartively more resources in terms of money , time and effort to purse this new venture .
There is a chance that this new venure could fail , but on the positive note if that business/idea succeds , I would have a tremendous potentail to make money in this new business as I will not have much competition .
I will give an example of John Chambers , CEO of a networking company .
This company was traditionally in the business of selling networking devices .
As its buinsess became more matured and competition increased , John decided to take some risk and expanded into telephony business and became successful in this new business .
This company ranks as number one in telephony buinsess .

The 2nd reason for my view is that unless I venture into unknown terrotories I will not know what lies there .
As a human , we always have this comfort zone which we do not want to leave but there is no guarntee that there is no risk in what we are doing today .
My brother has a gift business and he was very comfortable in that buinsess .
I insisted him to try export business , though he was initially reluctant but he tried and became successful .

In conclusion , I believe that risk taking is a shirt cut to scuccess which we should try .
