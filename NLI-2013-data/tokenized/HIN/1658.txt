Having a broader knowlege of a many subjects is not a very good thing to achieve .
A person who defines this will be called a `` jack of all trades and a master of none '' .
I think being an expert in one specific field is a better choice .

Having a knowledege of too many subjects at once will make a person feel undeducated since they have not gone into enough depth of anything in order to achieve a living out of it .
Also whatevr kind of work they do will be never be done to full perfection due to the gaps in their knowledge .
An example of that would be a normal mechanic doin odd jobs around my neighbourhood fixing televisions or computers or diswashers .
When he fixed my television set once it proved to be fatal for it .
Instead of getting better , the picture quality worsened and therefore i had to send my television set to the professional company mechanic who specialized in engineering .
After that my set started working and i do not have any more problems regarding it .

In economics we have a specific term for people who have a broad knowlege of many subjects , it is like a household-type society when all the people dab their hands in almost everything , `` a doer of all , but a master of none '' , this has several problems like low efficency , due to nobody knowing to how to actually carry out a task with full efficiency , the rate at which good work is being done is very low and damage is more .
On the other hand if people in a society are specialized in different areas , it is called a specialized society .
In a society like this , the efficiency levels will be extremely high , and also the time taken to carry out tasks will be less .
Therefore this kind of society will generate more money through the high quality goods and services they produce .
this also proves the fact that being specialized in a particular field is a wise thing .

If we leave the people to decide , will people prefer their housemaid stiching clothes for them or a specialized tailor .
Most probably people will opt for the tailor .
People who choose the opposite will hemselves see the diffrence in quality of the stitchig of the clothes by the housemaid and the tailor .
The tailor can only stitch and therefore he wll do his job with the most amount of sincerity and wil put in a lot of hard-work in that , since that is how he earns a living .
Whereas a housemaid also knows to to cook and clean and therefore will not pay attention to the sitchin as much because he has other means of earning .

As a conclusion i would like to say that people who specialize in an area or field of study will prosper in their lives .
Being a jack of all trades may seem impressive but there are many drawbacks to it and people like them will never have advantages over specialized people in anything .
