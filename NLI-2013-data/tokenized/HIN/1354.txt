Generally people belive that the students should specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many subjects , because they think that a person will not be taking all subjects in there future .
`` There are particular future for particular subjaects '' this means that though there are many scopes in our future be we can not afford to take every thing in our future .
Hence that is why we should concentrate in one subjects for one particular future .

According to me , we the children till class eight should take all the subjects because it very neccessary to have a general knowledge of each subject but once we have reached to class nine then it is time to think about our future so it will be good if we concentrate in just one particular subject .
Hence from my point of view it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
Will specialisation in one particular subject help ?
yes very much because then it means that we are focussing in our future. , lets say for example if a persons dream is to study international relations then he/she has to specialise in political science , but if he/she is taking other subjects to then that might distract their concentration in one subject that is very important for the person .
That is why i think that we being children should concentrate in just one subject that is very important to us and will make a lot of difference in our life .

lastly i would like to conclude by saying that `` precautions are better than cure '' so it is better that we take just one subject and concentrate in it to make our future better .
But it every ones point of view that matters and i belive in listning to what our heart says and move accordingly .

thank you .
