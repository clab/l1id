Enjoyment means entertainment , satisfaction of one 's soul and containment with the happenings in life .
I would like to disagree with this statement .
This is because entertainment would mean differently to different people .
Entertainment depends on various factors like the person 's attitude and his notion or perspective on entertainment .

The younger generation tends to enjoy themselves by going to parties , meeting new people , making new friends and going for long drives .
The way a youngster enjoys himself or herself depends on the attitude and nature of the individual .
Some people might like to go to parties for entertainment while others might like to watch a movie .

On the other hand the older people might also do the same things that youngsters do or they may engage in activities considered as dull and boring by the youngsters .
I would like to take examples of two famous personalities here who despite their age never complained of boredom .
Firstly , I would like to take the example of Mother Teresa who despite her old age found enjoyment in playing with children and serving the needy .
Secondly , I would like to take the example of the famous painter , M.F. Hussain .
M.F. Hussain is more than eighty years old but finds enjoyment in his paintings .
He likes to draw and finds his entertainment in his drawings .

We can find people both among younsters and aged who remain depressed and do not tend to enjoy themselves .
They lead the life of a loner and stay in recluse .
The youngsters have a pressure to make their life which may in turn have an effect on the way they tend to enjoy themselves .
But this might not be the case with the older people .
They have a life , they have attained their goals and can live a peaceful life which in itself is an enjoyment .
The old people also tend to enjoy themselves by talking to others of their age and about their life 's experiences .

Thus we see that the entire concept of enjoyment differs from one person to other .
We can never say with surity that youngsters tend to enjoy more than the old people .
Everything depends on the nature and the attitude of people .
If somebody wants to enjoy age is never a deciding factor .
It 's the perspective and the likes and dislikes of a person which tends to decide how well the person is enjoying his life .
