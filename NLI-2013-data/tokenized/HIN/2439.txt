I totally agree with the above statement that says `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' because younger people can be much more active than older people .
Young people can enjoy all the entertainment in the world whereas the older people would have to think twice before doing anything .
Young people can play sports such as soccer , tennis , baseball and the list goes on whereas the body of older people dont permit them to take part in these activities .

Young people can travel around the world and see ther different cultures of different countries whereas older people dont have the stamina and will to travel so much .
Young people can try and find ways to increase their standard of living by working and doing jobs whereas older people have no choice but to live the rest of their lives in the same way .
The young people go to clubs and bars and make new friends whereas old people just sit at home and probably watch television .

The social life for the young people is much more than that of the old people .
Young people can do all sorts of adventures like rock climbing , sky diving or bungy jumping .
These things are totally restricted for the old people .
The young people are much more excited and energetic than old people .
The young ones look forward to the upcoming days and events whereas old people just gaze around at their homes lazily and have no future plans .
The young people have future aims and goals in life but the older ones have already lived thier goals and dont look forward to anything in the future .
Young people have all the time in the world to gain fame or earn money whereas the older ones are almost through with thier lives and dont bother about fame or money .

Finally , I would like to conclude by saying that the young people can dream big and then take steps to achieve their dream but as for the old people go , they might have dreamt of something big and some of them might have even converted those dreams into reality , but now they can only dream about thier past and recall thier beautiful moments of the early times .
