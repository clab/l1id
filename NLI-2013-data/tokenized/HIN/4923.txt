I think that in today 's world even if a product is of excellent quality and is very useful , it still needs to be advertised in order to reach its sales potential .
Having said this I completely agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are couple of main points I want to state here in support of my conclusion .

First , there is no way for the consumers to validate the claims being made about a product in advertisement .
The only way to figure out if the claims are right is by actually using the product or talking to others who have used the product .
The advertiser of the products exploit the dificulty faced by consumers in validation the product related claims , by making claims which have no suppoting evidence .

The best example of this is the claims made by many of the weight reduction pills on the market .
The advertisements claim that the pills will reduce weight by 50 to 100 ponds in couple of weeks .

Second point is the fact that the advertisers use well know celebrities to advertise and market bad quality products .
Just because a is acting in an advertisement for a product does not mean the product is good .
Most of us know this fact .
But association of the celebrity with the product does seem to influence peoples buying decisions .
This tells us that even though the product is not of the best quality , the advertisement made it seem good just because it has a celebrity cast .
For example in India the superstar actor Amitabh Bachhan acts in so many advertisements for products which are bad in quality , but just because he is part of the advertisements the products are baught by many people .
