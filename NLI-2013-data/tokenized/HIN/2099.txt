I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people .
This is very evident when we go to see some sports or carnivals or even a club .
More often we find very active and enthusiastic participation of the youth .
Old people generally do not get interested in new things as easily .
New things do not invibe the same level of excitement in old people as it does to the youth .
Many reason can be given for this difference in the way of looking at life between old people and youth .
Young people at their stage are still exploring new things in their life .
Every thing excites them .
Nothing is usual for them .
A base ball match may be just another match for an old man but for a youth it may be very important .
He gets involved into it much more and hence enjoys it more too .

After a certain age life becomes mundane , every thing seems to be routine .
People get used to a very fixed kind of life .
Small events which ones full filled them with joy seem to be just another thing .
One reason could be the coming of stagnation in one 's life after a certain age .
We get bound by a lot of things after getting old .
We refuse to being dynamic .
Relationships become stagnant , we stop thinking of growth even in our jobs and all these things reduces the interest towards life .
Wherease someone who is young , say a fresh graduate there is so much unstability in his life which inturn gives his life more dynamism .
This keeps his life more interesting and hence he enjoys life more .

Health aspects can be another reason why young people have more fun .
Young people are more healthy and spirited .
For an enjoyable and fullfilling life good health is very important .
In old age , people generally become weak and lose their health too .

This prevents them from enjoying their life fully .
All the above reasons results in youth people being able to enjoy life more than the older ones .
