I agree with the staement that , most advertisements make prodcuts seem much better than they really are .

I feel that most of the advertisements either in electronic or in print or any other media is nowadays , concentrate more on look rather than the usability or features of the product .
For example a clothing company tries to spend a lot on the models and presnetation rather than the comfort while wearing its product .
Creating the hype and fuss is the only motive of such advertisements , although public may not like the product at all after few uses of it , e.g. a big multistarrer movie might be opened with a big lavish event , but after few days of show only , public comes to know whether it 's a hit or a flop .
This is one case where extra hype is created for a product by advertisements .

In other cases , the side effects of the product are tried to make hidden behind the attractive advertisement .
For example , aerated drinks , cosmetics etc , which are not good for health .
In few cases , cosmetics have been proved very dangerous , when used frequently .

Cases have been found that after using cosmetics from a reputed company , the customers have generated allergic and skin problems due to toxic material present in it .
Although the advertisemnt doesnt mention any appropriate frequency of usage , it effect is visible after long usage only .
In such cases it is all upto the public which has to find out the consequence after sometime .

Another example is alcoholic dinks and tobacco products , which are pretty much dangerous to health are advertised in such a way that it appeals to the mass population .

As we can see , in most of the advertisements , which come out newadays focus more on packaging and making the product more attractive , rather than projecting there attributes related to general use .
