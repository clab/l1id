Look around you , there are so many successful people .
They come in various `` shapes and forms '' .
The shapes and forms being , the circumstance ( let 's face it , luck plays a `` minor '' role ) , the personality of the person and what the individual is successful in .
However , there is one common thing among all them successful folks , they are absolutely focused .
They know what they want , and when they want it .
They also take risks , something not all of us have the capability to do .
They are no doubt good at what they do , however the risk is the key factor .

People who are successful are inded very clever .
They know what they want , they know how to get what they want .
What makes them different from unseccessful people is the latter ; how they get what they want .
Risk taking is one of them .
They are no doubt very good at what they do , this is what gives them the confidence to go ahead and take that risk .

For instance , I play Badminton , and the best player on our school team is successful at badminton .
He is alos arrogant in his beliefs , however , it is his beliefs that have gotten him so far with the game .
He takes risks while playing a match that is very hard core and intense .
Plaing with him is a very scary prospect because his stratergies to win are such .
He let 's the opponets gain a couple points , so that they become over confident and then systematically goes about gaining back point and eventually beating them .
Now , for an amateaur like me , this is anything but comforting .
What if they become so confident that they actually are better than you are ?
This question he never answers because he is convinced his theory will will work , no matter what .

He is successful , i consider him so .
He knows the game so well and he watches his oppensts so well that he can manipulate the attitude of his opponents .
This could be an example of a successful person .
It 's his risks that make him part of what he is .
