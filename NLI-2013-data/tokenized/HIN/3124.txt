People percieve enjoyment in different ways .
Enjoyment for me may mean playing soccer but at the same time enjoyment for my grandpa may mean meditating or reading .
I may endorse enjoyment in a different sense .
Enjoyment is a personal view and not a general one .

I would refute the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .
Enjoyment is associated with very phase of life in its own way , carrying a special meaning .
Before the teenage , playing with friends for long hours may be the ulimate source of enjoyment for kids .
During the teenage however , chatting with friends on the phone , talking to the opposite sex may be thrillling & enjoying .
Typical pangs of adolosence as we call it .
Post teenage , i.e college life , we may like to hang out with our friends for parties , movies , festivals etcetra .
It would certainly mean enjoyment .

Pre-marriage Job life would add some other kind of dimension to the definition of enjoyment of life like going out for shopping .
Post-marriage enjoyment may mean bringing up kids , playing with them , making them study .
My parents say that my birth was the best moment of their lives .

Old age may seek enjoyment in morning walks , playing with grandchildren , meditation .
It could be the time when one introspect and see how well have they lead their lives and how can they make it even better .
That would certainly make life more enjoyable .

We may enjoy life doing things alone or we enjoy life in comany of friends .
Its basically the way we see enjoyment .
Enjoyment has different faces to it which show up at the right time or the right phase of life .
Branding enjoyment of life to only a particular segment of age may not justify the essence of enjoyment .

Living every moment to the fullest and the best one can is the is thrust of enjoyment .
