The youngster have always been watched upon .
Their activities and nature have always been watched and analysed .
Same is the case nowadays .
I do support the topic these days it has been analysed young people do not give enough time in helping there communities .
There are several reasons for such a behaviour .

Firstly , these days the youngsters are more busy in their routine work as compared to that in prior days .
Let us take the example of schools .
The course curriculum is becoming more vast and harder day by day .
To cover all this and to attain good scores students are forced to devote extra time in their studies that earlier could be used in helping communities .
As a personal example , my younger sister who is 5 years younger to me , studied java in 9th standard which i studied in 12th standard .
Thus a ninth standard student was suppose to do something which was earlier fit for 12th satndard student .
So a student had to give extra time to learn something earlier considered of higher standard .

Secondly , with the passage of time interest of youngsters have changed .
It is a clean observation that earlier youngster were interested in helping and social work .
On contrary , younsters today are more fun-loving .
They pay weightage to moving out with friends , enjoying etc. rather than helping others .
As an example , my grandfather was a social worker as well as a student when he was 18 , while at the same age I am just a student .
This is also an cosequence of first point .
As youngsters have less time to enjoy , they use it to its full extent .

Finally , the youngsters are reluctant to help a community due to the following reason .
As the man has developed since past , it has become more selfish .
A very violent example is of the wars that we see all through time .
This selfishness has been embeeded in man since ages and can be said to passed on genetically .
So youngsters today are more selfish and therefore prefer to help themselves rather than others .
That is the reason why a social worker outshines in this world where selfish people are widespread .

Thus it can be clearly proved on the basis of points mentioned above that youngsters do not to give enough time to helping communities .
