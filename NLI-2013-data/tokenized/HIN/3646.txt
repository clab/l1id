Unfortunately , it is true that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Nowadays life has become very complicated and exhaustive , not only for adults but also for young people .
There is a lot of competition in every field .
The young generation is so occupied by their own lives that they hardly have any time for community services .

Students have to work much harder compared to our parents in order to be successful in their life .
A lot of the time has to be devoted for studying .
A good education is given much more importance than earlier .

Secondly there are many more recreational activities nowadays .
With the invention of high-tech video games , computer games like the Sony playstations and X-box the level of entertainment has reached a whole new level .
Then there is television and Internet on which you can view an unlimited amount of things twenty four hours a day .
For sports fans there are various sorts channels like ESPN and Star Sports on which a large number of sports are covered ranging form cricket to baseball .
The young people spend a lot of time on the Internet chating , E-mailing etc .

People would rather spend time enjoying and entertaining themselves instead of helping others .

The young generation is selfish and ignores the needs of the community .
They are more concerned about there future and do not care about the community 's future .
They do not understand the importance of a good community .
Therefore I agree with the statement .
