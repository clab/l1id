In my opinion , young people today do not dedicate enough time to helping their communities .
There are a few reasons for this , which have come about as a result of the changes in society and the outlooks that these young people have !
Most reasons centre around the issue of time that is available to perform such activities , while there are some that pertain to the psychological outlook of the person .

Today 's youth are too caught up in simply achieving things for their selfish needs .
A strong assertion , no doubt , but parental pressure , peer pressure and hence the need to deliver results in an ever-so widenening world with large numbers of competitors puts a strain on the individual .
He/she is simply left with no time to cope with mundane things , leave alone the community he/she lives in !
Additionally , lives lead by some of the youth today are too fast paced for them to be worried about the community they reside in .
Any free time available at their disposal will go to satisfying their personal needs .
The community , unfortunately , thus ranks very low in terms of priority !
A personal example can help throw some light in this matter ; Being a full time student leaves me very little time to allow myself to indulge in my music , which is a favourite hobby .
Why would I spend it unselfishly on the community ?

This leaves us with the system of education in the scheme of public service .
A good , if not decent , education would inculcate certain values that would result in the develpoment of a complete individual , who is part of , and thus sees himself/herself to be responsible for the community they live in .
This does not seem to happen as effectively as it is expected to be .
Many students go through their school and ultimately entire lives blind to the help that their communities are crying out for !
Is it not the fundamental responsibilty of these schools to ensure that the youth be made aware and proactive in this regard ? !

To conclude , I would like to say that an awareness of the advantages a person who helps his community has over a person who does n't engage in such activities , needs to be brought , not mention certain changes in their hectic work schedules as well !!
