`` Understanding gives you a better clarity and vision rather than learning facts '' , i agree to the point that understanding ideas and concepts has a better results than simply learning it .
When you are learning the facts , what exactly happens is that if you are not repeating it again and again you tend to forget the concepts and ideas .
In learning you try to memorise the text without looking at it 's practical implemntation and after a period of time it gets vanished .
learning could be lucrative only when you have to swallow things Like .
In history , where you have to learn the time and series of events that has happened in past .
But in creative and intelectual subjects like .
Science , Arts , Mathematics it is not good to simply learn things because these areas need you to understnad the ideas and concepts .

In understanding the ideas and concepts yoy use the creative , active and imaginative part of your brain .
When you understand something you do n't have to push yourself to revise it again .
Taking `` Mathematics '' as example when you understand the concept geomatry , than only you will be able to use it properly and efficiently .
Understanding the ideas and concept opens your brain to see every part of the subject .
and after doing a brainstorm with urself you understands the fact which you never forget .
Understanding a concept is easier to do than learning it .
It is often seen that students focus more on learning things than understanding because they have their exams pressure on them .

At last i would suggest that the dynamcis of an educational course should emphasis more on giving a better understanding .
when an individual understand a concept it comes into his behaviour .
learning is like looking at the ocean from a distance and understanding is more about enjoying the depth of it .
