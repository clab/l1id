In the next twenty years there will be much more cars than there are today .
The rate of cars production is increasing drastically over time .
More and more companies in developing countries are venturing up in this field to make more and more fuel efficient cars .
According to current studies for the car market , it is estimated that after 15 years the cars in Asia will be 2 times of what they are today .

This is true that the demand for supply of fuel is also increasing leading to high oil prices .
But many researches are going on for the non-conventional sources of energy .
Many companies like General Motors have now started to produce cars which run on electricity and these cars are very efficient and small in size as well .

If we just look at the use of cars in the past 100 years , we will find that cars have become more and more useful with time , and today it has become a necessity for an average person .
About 70 years ago , one could rarely see a car and the cars belonged to only the highly priveleged rich people since only they had the money in order to buy and maintain cars .
But today one can see the even the college student interested in buying the latest models of cars .

As the world in changing its face over time , this is widely accepted that the pollution and global warming is affecting the environment and so the car makers are becoming more and more conscious for making cars that lead to lesser pollution and are more fuel efficient to agree for more and more stringent environmental norms defined by different governments .
So as the population and awareness is increasing the car production has to increase to meet its demand .

With more and more pace of development and population growth taking place in the developing countries like India and China , the demand for cars is increasing rapidly .
With the increase in the number to such vehicles , the governments are also spending more and more money for infrastructural development like making roads etc .

So in conclusion we can say that the number of cars is bound to increase in the next 20 years .
And with the pace the demand for cars is increasing every day , in future we will be having more and more developed and highly sophisticated cars .
