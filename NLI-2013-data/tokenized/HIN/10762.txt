Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know is very precise and exact on its part .
because a successful person is very ambitious and intrepid .
he is full of spirit and ready to face any type of struggle or danger in any face of his life .
they have a innate quality to invent new things and generate new ideas .
it does not that successful people dont face failure in their life .
but the fact is that they are not like other common people who lose their strength and determination in any part of difficulties .
but rather they are people who spend their life only to face challenges and dangers .
they follow on the principle `` failure is the stepping stone to success '' .doing only the things which you are confined to or which you know how to do well is very common and usual which can be done by anybody .
the point lies in doing something different from others .
there are certain examples showing how successful peoples are different from the common individuals .

Firstly , Issac Newton is the one who had invented the bulbs and due to his contribution we are now in this time are available with energy source else no source was available to us for lightening .

Secondly , there are many freedom fighters responsible for the freedom of india like Mahatama Gandhi , Rani Laxmi Bai , Subhash Chandra Bose and etc . , .
without their help and contribution it was very difficult to achieve the freedom .

Thirdly , scientists invent new things and provide us with innovative ideas so as to make us aware of the facts which are not known to us .
ofcourse they face many failure in this course but they continue to work hard so to achieve their goal .
if they will not work like this then we will be unaware of many facts which and will be left .

So , a successful person does not care of the negative impact on its finding or work but continue to sustain in fields of various irresistable crushing force to fullfil the demands they want to acquire and to reach the acme of any enigma .
