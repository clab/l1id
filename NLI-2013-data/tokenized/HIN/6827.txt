Twenty years from now the population of cars would be much lesser than today .
Due to many reasons like most of the fuels used as today would extinguish , and if resources available they might be used for other purpose etc .

well , when we compare the past and future we can expect both to be similar .
in past , there were fewer cars and even in future we could find few cars , due to many reasons .
in past when car was discoverd the making used to take much time and in future when making is easy and faster the presence of fuels is less .
as in present day we find different kinds of cars , each having its own uniqueness but all of them run with petrol or gas .
but twenty years from now these resources might be in scarce , or else used till the last drop .

as in present we find the population of cars comming in competetion with human beings we might expect that it in future it would cross us .
but once the the resources are gone all these cars go in to scrap useful for nothing instead increase the pollution and causing problem to mankind .
future is full of unexpected things any thing might happen , for example instead of fuel car there might be electric cars , [ no pollution car ] .
these might complletly replace them or else people might use cycle as in past for transport and become more evironment consious .

scientists are trying to develop a new kind of fuel which is made from plants known as bio-deisel , which also can be used in future as fuel .
but cars they will make there way some how or the other .
and so called cars in present day might be called with a different name .

so i say that twenty years from now we will find cars running with electricity or other means of fuel , but in minimal population camparitive to now .
