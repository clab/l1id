Attitudes towards the behaviour of young people of not having enough time nowadays for helping their communities vary from community to community .
I think that young people spend equally the same time as before except that their efforts are not highlighted as they get out-numbered .

Previously within every commuinity a small number of people used to be there offering services thereby substantiating that with the increase in population the number of youngsters have increased and their efforts are cnot realized lets take example of community service programmes which are organised by the schools and in some schools it becomes a mandatory part of the curriculum this proves a great part of the student body participating in the community service apart from this we see students collecting funds every month for the maintainance of the of the community .
Most of the members of the community center are young individuals Obviously we cannot expect every student to give in the same kind of effort in this area with the growing complexities in the student life the students eventually land up compromising on the time for the community work during exams but eventually compensate on this lost time by organising camps during their work therefore it would be wrong on our part to undermine their efforts as mentioned before the form in which help is being given by them varies .

Perhaps the students might not be channelized in their efforts to helping their communities they need to be more organized in their approach .
Help can again vary informs some people dont offer help unless they are asked for it others however are generally helpful and offer help if need be even when they are not asked for it .
For example an old lady crossing the road might be helped by an individual even without asking for it whereas others would normally wait for the lady to ask for help as they are hesitant in offering it as they think it might go unwelcomed fearing the senility of the lady I think todays youngsters are well aware of the responsiblities that are levied on them .
Its just the perspective of seeing things that creates the difference .
The young are aware that they are the presidents , doctors etc of toommorow and hence are actively participating in offering their services its just that we need to start appreciating their work .
