I certianly , disagree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts , As we know that we cannot creat a wall without a base .
Therefore learning the concept and theory behind it is very important .

Concepts will automatically show the facts in the future .
For instance , if I want to learn a new language then I will first learn alphabets .
I will learn them to pronunce and even to write .
Pronucing and writing letter will introduce me the facts of the language .
How hard it is to learn ?
and how easy it is ?

Implementing the ideas practically will show you the facts and results .
First we will learn what color will be produce when mixing it with the other color .
For instance , we will learn in book yellow plus blue turns green .
Now , in order to learn the fact of this idea we will do it practically and we will find it true .
This is how it is important to have an idea before implementing it .

After learning principles and theories from books and expertise , we find them in field whether they were true or not .
We learn facts through experience and it keeps changing .
However , concept does n't change .

Therefore , it is important for students to learn fundamental skills and basics then start learning fact .
