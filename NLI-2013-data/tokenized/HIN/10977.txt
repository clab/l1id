`` aim for the sky , and you will reach the mountain top '' this is a famous saying which in my knowledge , is indeed practiced by a number of successful people .
In order to be successful , it is mandatory for one to try the impossible , try new things and take risks .
only this attempt can direct you closer to your goal .

Buccess is a relative term .
i percieve success to be my goal , my aim in life .
the road to success is a never-ending one , much longer than you expect it to be .
There are numerous obstacle through your way to achieve your goal .
Being succussful is one of the biggest challenge in life .
and maintaining your success is another .

Every succussful person has taken unpredictable , steps which either turns out to be a disaster , or the biggest success of his career .
this step is immensely risk-prone .
For example , let there be a company in which there are two individuals working in the same level of priority , Mr.X and Mr.Y. they both work on similar subjects using the same method , and finish it in the same time frame .
if Mr.X wishes to succeed and reach the post of the highest priority in the company , he is required to try something new .
take a few risks , and work on the subject with a different approach .
this approach can turn out to be a complete waste , or he might have just discovered a faster method of execution .
in this process he also gained knowledge .

having a broader knowledge , helps you achieve success much faster and easily .
only by trying new things , can you stretch your capacity to excel .
you can never be successful if you feel complete .
if you conclude your knowledge to be the saturation point .

there is a saying `` try , try , till you succeed '' . this is the best prescribed method you can use to reach your goal .
every step , be it a successful or disastrous , makes you learn something. a bad one is just another hurdle in your race to success .
it makes you think methods to overcome it .
ideas to navigate your way past it .
these hurdles are pure sources of knowledge .
