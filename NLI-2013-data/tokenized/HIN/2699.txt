`` Where there is a will , there is way '' .
Also , generally the willingness is inversely proportional to the years one has lived for .
In other words with some reservations I agree with the statement that the desire to enjoy wanes as years pass by .

Young people are more full of zeal and enthusiam and possess the energy required to be applied to any entertainment activity .
These activities could be sports , dance parties , trekking , mountaineering , rafting , surfing so on and so forth .
As we reach senility perhaps the will to be the part of a group of happenning people fades off .

Another reason that may explain that aged people have limitations while they want to enjoy is the level of responsibilities they bear .
Even if they plan to go out for a movie that may not require physical exercise , various trivial things are always after their life .
Child wanting to have an ice cream when the ` Hero ' is just planning to elope with his lady ...
ooops .
Further , what if he wants to play with a car that is at home ...
unimaginable .
These may seem to be very minor things but when it comes to solve the problem enjoyment and entertainemnt are left far behind .

Take another contrasting example of children below 5 .
No school blues , no home works , no restriction , nobody to take care of .
Quite easily they get the permission to play with their friends .

As technology and science have progressed so have developed the ways to get an exhilirating body / mind work out .
Video games for example are accessibilities that children cherish .
As older people may not be well acquainted with more modern machines they may find it difficlut to enjoy in this way .

While I rewrite that where there is a will there is a way I am not just repetitive .
I now want to present the reservations I mentioned in the introduction .
However , old age may bring physical weakness , loss of agility , there are various methods in which they try and live their lives to fullest .
Golf , the game of old gentlemen is quite a challenging affair , which even I have n't ever been capable to win .
Chess is the next trump card they come up with when no body movement is desired .

Moreover , I have seen people who have their secret groups in which they organise personal parties , go for trips and enjoy life in the way they want .

After , all the examples and explanations I would like to conclude that fervor is the only requisite ingredient .
Age does't matter a lot ( but certainly to some levels it does ) .
