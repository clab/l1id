`` The ideas and concept tends to create an intellectual '' This proverb helds equally good when we talk about learing process involving proper understanding and concepts .
It is not only , holds good for the student alone , but also holds good for each and every individual who are in the process of learing .
though since the students are building blocks of the future generation , more emphasis should be given to them .
Besides , learing facts contributes very little in actual learning process .

The very first point why the students should learn by understanding ideas and concept is that because once the students understand the concept , he/she can easily apply the concept in any field to solve the probem .
No matter how difficult the problem is .
For instance , in the regular classes of maths and physics , where the subject is occupy with full of formula and facts , it is very difficult to memorise all the formulas and facts stated in the book .
But if student understands the ideas and concept then he can probably derive many formula by a single standard formula , then , in this case he / she does not need to remmember all difficult formulas which will be very exhaustive and time consuming .

Moreover , if the students only try to know the facts then there is a possibility that their knowledge will be narrow .
what i meen is that when the problem comes which he/she is not aware then it will be very difficult for them to solve the problem because they only know the use of facts in one particular place .
Whereas , if the student has understood the concept and ideas then he / she can solve any of the problem by virtue of the underlying concept involved in that problem .

On the other hand , learing facts also contributes in learing process upto certain extant .
for example , in chemistry , until and unless students learn the periodic table , it will be very difficult for them to understand the rest of the inorganic chemistry , Hence , in this case it is imperative for students to learn the facts also .

To sum up , in majority of the fields , learning ideas and concepts are more beneficial because it gives the solution of a problem all the time .
Nevertheless , facts are important in fewer condition when compared to learing concept .
But in general for the good knowledge and proper understanding combination of both would be better choice .
