As the famous wise thought goes , `` The biggest risk in life is not taking one '' .
In order to be successful one has to take that extra risk in today 's world .
We are currently in the era of globalization and the world is getting flat day by day due to technological advancements and improved communications .
Oppourtunities are enormous , we need to go out there and grab them .
Every oppourtunity brings with it its own advantages and risks .
In order to be successful one has to take that risk associated with the oppourtunity .

I would like to quote my own example for this topic .
I worked as a medical editor and transcriber for a company for three years .
I was happy with my job and doing fairly well .
But , my dream was bigger and i wanted to make my own business someday in the domain of medical technology .
At one point of time , I had an oppurtunity knocking my door wherein i had developed contacts with few clients with whom i could start up my independent business in medical technology .
In order to accomplish this dream , i dared to take a risk of leaving my job and going ahead and setting up a small firm arranging for the finances through a bank loan , and leasing premises for an office .
Not having a management background , i had a tough time setting up a business and meeting ends , but i reliazed that i learnt through my own experiences , i faced downfalls but learnt from it and didnt repeat the mistakes .
Careful planning , hard work , and delevering timely to the clients paid off .
Today , I have a succesfull running business in electronic medical record processing .

The risk that i took at one point of time in life has paid me back and I am doing much more better than i would have done if i continued to do what i could do well on my job .
