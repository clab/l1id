Learning should be based on ideas and concepts

Mastering the ideas and concepts are essential part of learning .
I completely believe that ideas and concepts is much more important for the students than just focusing on the facts .
There are several reasons for this .

First of all , understanding the ideas provides a stimulus to the brain and helps positive thinking , learning and mastering of the subject .
With the concept being understood , one can apply these ideas to any similar situation .
It is much easier to connect one idea to another and build a logical conclusion about a subject or theory .

Secondly , understanding the facts also needs some ideas to fully grasp the knowledge of the subject .
Without any idea or logical stream of thought behind , it will be very difficult even to understand why a fact actually happened .
Focusing only on the fact and not looking at the underlying concept is like building something without a solid foundation .

Understanding the concept behind a particular theory also allows to deal with unexpected situations in a better way .
For example , if somebody know the concept behind a mathematical theory , one can easliy solve any problem without memorizing the contents or facts of the problem .
Similarly understanding concepts of physics allows a person to apply the same principals to a variety of situations and provide useful explanations .

Understanding the ideas & concepts also promotes further learning .
It is easier to teach a subject to others if one has mastered the ideas and concepts behind it .

Lastly , understanding the ideas and concepts helps the development of the subject itself .
With the concepts fully understood , one can then build more useful ideas over them .
These ideas then become part of the subject or theory itself and make the application of the theory to real life more useful .
