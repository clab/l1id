I would agree on the point that most products advertised are not as good as they are portrayed in the advertisements .
The reason for my belief is that the advertising companies get a lot of money from the manufacturers to make their ad look better .
And due to this the make the product look very flash and attractive in the advertisements even if it is the most hideous product .

Advertisement is the best marketting stratergy that decides the sale of the products and the companies success .
In order to ahieve certain targets and to attract more customers the companies advertise their items in a manner that makes them more desirable to the viewers .
To do this they add certain features which the might not be able to provide .
They spend a lot of money on these ads .

For example , a cell phone company X adverstises its phone that has all the features except a very bright coloured handset that might attract people .
So the advertisers usually enhance the colour of the handset in the adds that people like to see .
They modify the product with the help of the computer techniques .
This might be misleading for the viewers of the ad if they order the handset just because of its colour .
Most people believe in what the see in the advertisements and order the products on the basis of the ads .
This can lead to viewers forming a wrong opinions about the products too .

Giving a personal example , i ordered an entertainment book which according to the advertisement had all the addresses of the tourist places in and around newyork but when i finally got the book in hand i discovered that the book had only a few selected place and it did not include all the important tourism spots for eg. the museum of modern arts or the radio city hall in manhattan .
How could any book miss that ?

On the basis of the reasons and examples citied above and on the basis of my experience I would finally conclude that the advertisemnets are often misleading and do not provide the exact information and the viewers should go into the details of the product before buying them .
