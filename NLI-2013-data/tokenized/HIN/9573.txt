In my opinion success in itself carries the element of `` desire , sacrifise and a strong will '' to drive one to the destination of choice .
Sum of such characteristics distinguishes how sucessful we will be .
As a human being every individual tries to be better than what he was and for this he improvises in the skill which he has and after a particular stage when he has internalised that , the person may become saturated in his desires and be satisfied by what he has achieved or he has the choice of expansion , which for a buissnesman will mean buisness expansion but for a research student will mean to know other areas to research upon and try to apply the acquired skills of one area to get fruitful results in the other .
There is always a satisfaction coming from ones achievments but to stop with a handful of achievments is not what people who succede and are respected do .

Take the example of Einstein , he was one of the most popular and successful theoretical physicscist , got a nobel prize in 1923 for photoelectric effect , after which he could have retired and spent rest of his life in comfort , but he chose to `` sacrifise '' it and worked to make a unified theory till he died .
Such characteristics make succes in true sense .
People who stop after a milestone are one of those who have doubts on their ability and fear of faliure , which is counter quality of a motivated person .
so given certain parameters which we can call elements of success in a person ; Their evolution with passage of life will lead us to the conclusion of sucessful people taking risks .
But those are calculated risks and not random crazy thoughts which distinguishes them from an egomanic !!
