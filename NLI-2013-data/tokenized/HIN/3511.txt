The issue at hand is whether the young people today devote ample time in helping their community or not .
The topic is very important because of it deals with the youth , who will decide , dominate and mould the future of the world .
I disagree with the statement .
I think that young people invest a lot of their time , energy and resourses in working for their respective communities .

The first and formost reasons for believing so comes from my personal expericeince .
I along with my friends regularly spend time in doing community service .
This was a habbit inculcated by my parents long ago but i am proud to mention the fact that even now i stick to it , though no parental check is present now .

Various surveys conducted by prominent NGO 's ( non government organizations ) have highlighted the fact that , that recent years have witnessed a steady increase in the number of young people and students who voluntarily come forward for doing community work .
Since any kind of community service would also require a lot of physical activity apart from the obvious financial investments , it is but obvious that the youth should take the onus of this task .

Springing up of a large number of bodies , organizations and other institutes which work in the area of community service bear testimony to the fact the youth today has not shunned it 's social responsibilities .
Infact coming across students who spent a mjor part of their summer breaks doing community service , has become more of a rule rather than an exception .
Infact to encourage this trend further , now almost every professional organization as well as educational institutes allow their respective employees and students to carry on with their community work apart from their designated assignments .

In the light of the above reasons i can confidently claim that young people today devote sufficent time in helping their respective communities
