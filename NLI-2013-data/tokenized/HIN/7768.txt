In my opinion , the appropriatness of traveling in a group led by a tour guide depends on the nature of the person and the place to be travelled .
For an enthusiast like me , the schedule of a group travel will be very binding and I wo n't be able to enjoy as much .
But for elderly people and people with kids , it will be more enjoyble if everything is taken care of by a tour guide .

But in some circumstances , tour group becomes very essential .
For example , if I am travelling in a foreign country and I do n't know their language , I will prefer travelling in a tour group .
By doing that , I will save the pain of ordering wrong things on the menu , and more importantly , I wo n't keep loosing my way because of sign boards written in a foreign language .

Also , if I am travelling to a place of historical importance , I would like to be led by a tour guide who can give me more information about that place .
In situations , when I have very little time on hand and there are lots of places to see , I think I will be better off as a part of a tour group .
Or else , I 'll waste most of my time , finding and reaching all the tourist spots on my own .

On the other hand , if I am going on an adventure trip for camping and trekking , tour groups will be the last thing on my mind .
Also , If I am on a spiritual or relaxing trip , to a calm place with not many things to explore , the tour group will not be very useful .

I feel tour groups led by tour guides are important , but it depends on travellers discreation to decide if it is the best way to travel .
As a conclusion , I would like to state that I do not agree with the given statement .
