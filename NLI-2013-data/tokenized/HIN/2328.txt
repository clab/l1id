This topic can be approached in various different manner because the term `` enjoying life '' can be measured in innumerable different ways for different people .
Enjoying life in my opinion may be very very different from someone else opinion .

First of all in my opinion enjoying life is not having momentary fun like going to a bar or a club on a Friday or a Saturday evening and drinking and dancing as for most young people of my age .
In my opinion enjoying life is having a happy and contented life with nothing to worry about .

To support this idea I take an example of old couple who will represent old people .
An old couple retired from work will have lots of money for themselves from the retirement fund and the gratuity fund .
To top it up they do not have any responsibility of their sons and daughters on their shoulder .
What do they do with the huge sum of money they have just got after retiring from office ?
These old couple use this money in such things which as per me is enjoying life like taking a round the world ticket and go round the world and see the beautiful nad exotic locations around the world or buy a convertible or buy a vacation home in the suburbs of a city to relax and have a peaceful time away form the hustel bustle of city life .
Sometimes they also choose to buy vacation homes with nearby lakes and they buy boats and go fishing and spend their time .
They have nothing to worry about !!!
Their life is relaxed !

Thought young people are more vibrant and have lots of energy they have time constraints the main one being time due to there studies or due to their work schedules .
Te only thing they can do is take a occasional vacation and vist palces or go visit their relatives but this too they have to finish by a cetain amount of time .
They aslos have financial constraints as they have children , their education and the finance of ther home to worrt abt .
so in my opinion ol
