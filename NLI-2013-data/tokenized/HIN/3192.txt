With the advent of the `` electronic era '' and other significant technological developments , it is true that there are many attractions which may divert the youth a little .
But it is not true to state that they are not devoting enough time to helping their communities .
The following reasons will substantiate this view .

Firstly , every young person grows up with an ambition .
Some would want to become doctors , some engineers and some even accountants .
Ultimately they get a job .
In effect , by being a doctor or an engineer or taking up any profession , they are providing services to their community .
Some may work abroad like the NRI 's and send money to support their family , thus raising the economic status of the society .
Thus , even if they are not aware , they are providing useful services for the community .

Secondly , the central theme of any religion ( or most of them ) is good works .
Thus any pious youth will definitely work towards the improvement of their community .
So one cannot make a vague statement that all the youth do not give enough time to helping their communities .

Thirdly , many colleges and universities have clubs that focuses on improvement of the community .
For example in the college where I studied , there is a club where some students decided to provide basic education to the under-priviledged .

Finally , one cannot deny that many hospitals would require their interns to go to some remote areas and provide free treatments .
Some countries like Germany makes it compulsory for the youth to commit to either social or military services .

In conclusion , it is true that modern gadgets , to some extend , have made people more selfish .
But one cannot deny ever that young people do take pains in helping a community as expounded above .
