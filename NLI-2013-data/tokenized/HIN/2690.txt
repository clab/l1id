The statements touches upon a very contraversial topic .
It is true that young people spend more time on parties and traveling than the old people .
However , I completely disagrees with the idea that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .
I have many reasons for my belief .

It is true that because of age a older person would not be able to enjoy the party life and traveling around the world .
But it is equally true that not only physical activities , but also other activities contribute to the definition of `` enjoying life to its fullest '' .
To give an example , I had a mathematics professor who helped me prepared for compitive exams and standadised tests out side the syllabus .
Although he was retiered , he had a true passion for maths and even at age of eighty he used to solve many challenging puzzles and do recreational mathematical work .
Apart from mathematics , he also had a group of friends , with whom he used to play cards and always participate in various district and national level compititions in chess .
He also kept visiting his two sons once every year and taught his grandsons the secretsof leading a successful life .
From all these and many more activities , he derived the immense pleasure of leading a healthy life .

On the otherhand , consider the yonger generation , where many people commit numerous crimes in the name of having fun in life .
These people suffer severely , when they have to face the punishments offered by the law for their arrogant attitude .
We can find numerous examples of young people commiting inexcusable crimes and facing the punishment for life .
On the contrary , in such cases the young people have to face more sorrows in life than the old people do .

I strongly believe , that to enjoy life , one must have the ability to give joy to other people and share thier sworrows , in whatever small ways possible .
On can achive the ultimate joy of life only if he is successful in creating a harmony in the community around himself .
And I strongly believe there is no age limit to do this , and hence there is no age limit to be happy in life .
