I agree that in the coming years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
With advancing technology and with more complex machines being developed , people are slowly realising the harm that this development is causing us .
With the Information technology boom today , outsourcing and communication has become so much more easier than before .
Gone are the days of the good old letters , its the era of electronic mails .
All these sophisticated gadgets and machines are a double edged sword , with both their positive and negative points .

People prefer to travel in cars , trains and buses rather than walking .
This has given us a lot of health problems .
Children prefer playing on video games rather than outside with friends and so we see the problem of obesity becoming very common among adolscents .

Thus , modernization has had a great deal of impact on our health .
I think , twenty years from now people will become more health conscious and so will strive to maintain a healthy environment and a healthy life .
So , there will be fewer cars on the roads and more people on the roads .

Another important reason , why there will be fewer cars on the roads is that , population explosion will be a major problem in many countries .
In twenty years , the earth is going to have very little place to accomodate all of us and hence will be teeming with humans .
So , there wont be any place for us to drive our cars that time .
Contemplating these problems in the future , using advancing technology , man will definately come up with newer designs of cars and other vehicles , which will not be required to be driven on roads .
Man will stretch his imagination and may come up with flying cars to tackle these problems .
Flying cars and cars that move vertically on buildings may not seem so uncommon twenty years in the future , Thus , twenty years in the future we will be seeing a change in the attitude of the people , who will have a mixture of the the psyche of the people of the past and also a contemporay way of thinking .

Thus , for different reasons , be it for health purposes or as a sign of advancing technology , we will definately see fewer cars in use than there are today .
