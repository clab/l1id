I believe , to be a successful person one should be capable of taking risks when it is asked for and should also be adept enough to continue doing the work which he does well .
A combination of both acts as a lethal weapon in this today 's world of excessive competion .

Person 's ability to learn new things and taking calculated risks always puts the person in a favorable position in the eyes of success .
Because success has and will favour all those who have taken risks .

For example : - consider Howard Hughes who was not only a inventor but also a imaginative thinker , who believed extensively in taking risks and also cultivating and moulding the abilities already possesed by him .
When he was shooting for the film , which when released ...
turned out to be a block buster , he had inculcated so many new things in movie which during his times were totally unthinkable off .
But not only were the risks accountable for his succes but his ability to be good at what he does and to keep on doing what he knows best helped him to direct a blockbuster .

He also took risk when he wanted to break the record for the fastest speed a plane could fly at .
This risk was not minute , but it was his lilfe which was at stake .
His expertize helped him to reduce any human errors that might increse he risk , and at last he won .
Another example is his endeavor of building the largest plane `` The Hercueles '' .
At that time he had vowed in front of an enquiring comission that if he is not capable to construct and fly such plane then he would leave the country and live in exile .
Such high were the risk involved in this task that he had to use all his expertize and he required to focus all of it into realising his goal .
That made him successful .

Therefore i totally believe that consisting of only one of the mentioned qualities might ultimately result in the person 's failure because large number of uncalculated risks would make him vulnerable as he would not be experiencing stability .
Whereas only doing the work that the person knows very well would lead to stagnation of mind and imaginative power of the person .
Thus a heathy mixture of both the qualities would be the right formula for a person to be successful .
