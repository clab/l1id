Enjoyment is an obscure term .
It is very relative in its meaning and varies from person to person .
But the final denoument of an enjoyment is joy , happiness , a time to forget our worries and to be cheerful and optimistic .
So a young guy possibly enjoys more in the company of his girlfriend than he does that at home .
Or an old man enjoys more with his grandchildren than in exploring new restaurents and tastes .
The reason to write prceeding lines is to construe that the term enjoyment does n't lessens with age but it redefines its meaning with age .
And that is why I disagree with what is implied in the issue - enjoying life declines with age .

For , most of the people who would be in consensus with this topic , will have a portrait of an old man in their mind , who 's very feeble and is on verge of collapse and for the young the 'll possibly think of a nocturnal creature who never leaves a chance to party .
But if we think in a different direction , and imagine that oldies are not always feeble .
The great politicians ruling our country , the businessmen , entreprenuers , critics , film directors , novelists and every person who 's having a very promnent place either in corporate world or society , very rarely we find a stint of young in them .
Dont these people enjoy their life ?
Dont they enjoy their life by giving a complete devotion to their work and benefiting millions of others - including youth .
At the end of the day , to make earnest decisions we need to rely on older ones , we need to seek their openion without which our work wont progrss .
And dont they enjoy giving their valuable openion to us ?
This means that enjoyment cannot be restricted only to regular partygoers and for the ones having a great friend circle .
One can derive enjoyment from his work , from his decisions , by spending time in company of those whom we love , by sporting , by entertainment .
And any of these terms are not restricted by age .
The only thing required is inclination towards doing things from which one derives pleasure .
And thus I conclude a negative assertion towards the authors topic .
