Successful people are those who have achieved their goal or near to goal .
Some peoples are agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know and some people are disagree with this statement .
I agree with these statement because of strong supporting points .

Successful peoples are having an habits to achieve goals .
When they achived one particular goal they proceeding for new goal rather than doing what they already know .
They always try to learned new things from which they are unaware .
If a succesful completed his ph .
D in particular field instead fo stoping with that degree he tries to go to research on another topic .
These gives him satisfaction about his new research and gives deep knowledge about that topic .

One of my friend Mr. Prakash , he is also a Civil engineer , he passed his Master in engineer from I.I.T. with me know I joined firm and contineud for job but he gone for phD , as he is scholar but now I said he also a successful person .
Successful people never things about results they only know I have to start and I will achive the goal .

I agree with these statement because instead of trying same things try to go for new things that will give us new knowledge .
Risk taking ability are always with thses successful people .
I am also also aware with risk taking ability and I am also taking risk in a particular topic to know about .
Because if I taken the risk in a particular field then I may passed or I may fail , but if I have not try or not taken risk , then surely I wont pass .
