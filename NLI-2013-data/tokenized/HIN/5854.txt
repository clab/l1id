Contrary as it might sound there are a number of reasons and phenomena that are happening around the world that may indicate the number of cars in use will drop in the next twenty years .
This may sound counterintutive as the automobile market is booming and car sales are higher than ever before .
However a closer look at the issue reveals a slightly different picture .

Firstly there is the global oil crisis that has affected almost every nook and cranny of the world .
In most countries it has become exorbitant to fuel a car that is being used regularly .
General environmental awareness levels are also going up .
Now more than ever before people world over are realising how much automobile exhaust is polluting the atmosphere .
This in addition to oil shortage will eventually discourage people from investing in cars .
Furthermore mineral resources and metal mines are not endless .
Very soon they will run out at the current rate of utilisation .
Once this happens the prizes of cars will sky rocket .
So far there have been very few cars that effectively run on non-polluting safe energy .
Even the few that have developed have not managed to capture the general market .

Secondly most countries are going to great lengths to develop efficient , and fast public transport systems .
In addition most cities are expanding .
As the city limits become larger and larger people have to commute greater distances to get to the destination of their choice .
Thus as public transport systems become better and more widespread people will soon realise that it is definitely more economical to switch to public transport rather than to use cars .

Lastly another global proble , seemingly mundane but actually crucial is the increase in incidence of road congestion and the lack of parking space .
Most cities now days suffer from terrible and atrocious traffic jams which uneccesarily waste time .
Even if you escape a traffic jam you may have to go to elaborate length to find a free parking spot .

In conclusion it can be seen that eventually all of the above factors , to varying extent will discourage people from buying more cars .
Thus as older cars slowly fall into disuse the number of cars totally in use will go down in the next twenty years .
