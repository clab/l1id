I agree on the statment that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I support this statment by giving reasons and examples in the following paragraphs .

firstly , students should understand ideas and concepts because it makes them to understand clearly and accurately .
Understanding ideas and concepts of a particular topic makes their work fast and perfectly .
For example suppose a student wants give a seminar on the topic spacecraft he or she must know the concept of the seminar clearly and throughly .
So that he or she can generate more ways of elaborating the topic which can be helpfull during the seminar .

Secondly , learning the concepts makes a person more perfect in the topic which he is about to work .
so that he can generate new ways and methods .
for example during the preparation of an experiment the scientist should know the concept of the experiment so the he can work well and aviod risks and harmfull effects .

Buy understanding the concepts and ideas clearly and correctly one devolop more knoweldge and data regarding the topic rather than learning facts .

Thirdly , facts are the material which have been devoloped already which can not be developed further .
but understanding an idea and concepts we can futher discover and invent new ideas from the idea we have .
for example using the water and its properties scientist have developed the steamengine .

Famous scientists who had devoloped the concept of numbersystem was clearly understood by aryabatta has discovered the algebra using the numbersystem .
students should understand main idea of the english reading passage so that they can answer the questions in the questionpaper .
facts may not develop and increase the student knowledge .
so one should understand concepts and ideas of the material and topics what they learn in the class .
quiz questions can be answered correctly by the students if they understand the given topic for the quiz to be conducted .

Lastly , i conclude that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
