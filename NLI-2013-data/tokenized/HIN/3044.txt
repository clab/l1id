`` You only live once , so live life to the fullest '' is a well known saying , echoed across cultures and countries all over the world .
People are probably tired of hearing it .
It basically means that everyone can enjoy life no matter how old or young they are .
And they should .
Because lost time wo n't be found again .

If someone were to say to me that young people enjoy life more than older people , I 'd have to completely disagree .
There are definitely big advantages being an older person .
For one , you 'd probably have your own money to spend and I 'm pretty sure there 's no better feeling than earning your own bread and butter and then going about spending it .
For example , there 's a strapping young 15 year old lad who likes nothing but to spend his day at the arcade and throw away all his allowance playing a pinball machine .
Allowance .
That 's all .
Now let 's take the example of a millionaire who has n't managed to let go of his childish ways .
He just bought an arcade ( and an amusement park ) and had a few pinball machines moved to his sprawling 12 bedroom , 14 bathroom mansion .
Seems like these oldies have all the fun .
Let 's take into account that in most countries you have be over 21 years of age to go bungee jumping .
Not that bungee jumping is something that every young person wants to do but even if he wanted to do it he probably would n't be able to .

Enter electronic media and technology .
Ever so often we 're subjected to watching millionaires and billionaires on television .
They always seem so happy .
Sure they ca n't really ride a skateboard or a bike but they 've managed to replace that with a more than adequate automatic scooter that they just have to stand on .
I can imagine them zipping around on their little scooter , looking at kids on skateboards and thinking that they 're having way more fun .
In fact to some extent , I even think that older people are `` allowed '' to have more fun .
Yes , it 's unfair .
But such is life .
It goes without saying that with age comes responsibility and I think a complete person is one who accepts his age and his responsibilities towards himself and the society he lives in .
But that does n't mean the fun comes to an end .
It almost never does .
Bad health , beer bellies and balding are a few deterrents from that life of fun , fun , fun .
But then again , you only live once and older people know that better than anyone .
They 're trying to get as much in while they can .

I ca n't wait for my days as an old man kicking back in a comfortable chair and watching soccer on the television .
The fun never stops .
Hey , look who just bought a yacht .
