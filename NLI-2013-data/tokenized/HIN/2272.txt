The question that who enjoys most ; an older person or a young lad , is debatable .
On one hand older person are said to be wise and experienced that they take everything seriously while on the other hand younger ones are called as the care free .
They are seen enjoying life as none other does .
In my view it the younger generation who enjoy their life .

There are difficulties in life which every one has to suffer and solve .
At the tender age the children are totally free from tensions and play within themselves unaware of the worldly problems .
Till the age of teens the main task to them is to study and make the building block of future life .
They enjoy their every moment while studying , interacting with new friends and preparing for their next school class .
Next stage is the time of earning and spending for themselves .
These people go to theaters and enjoy art .
They go to parties and keep them themselves aloof of the responsibilities .
Dancing to the tunes of Saturday NIght and Summer of 69 .
Riding bikes and cars and doing whatever they want .

While on other hand older people get workoholic .
They work most of the time and find it hard to spare time for them and for their family .
In run to earning the living to live and fulfill the needs .
Older people cover most of their life in similar fashion getting themselves engaged in monotonous routine of office to home and home to office .
After a certain age they have time and money to do whatever they like but what lacks is that they do not have the energy and company to do things of their choice .
Retirement life brings again a life of boring routine where they find no one to talk to .
Thus instead of enjoying thier life they become even more tensed .
Various disease and ailments also contribute to their tensions .

So from the above points discueed I believe that the best time to enjoy life is the young age .
Younger generation extraxt the enjoyment most from their life .
