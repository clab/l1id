I agree with the following statement .
I feel so because names like mother teresa , nelson mandela who devoted there whole life towards upliftment of the human fraternity , have now become only the characters in the history text books .
One could find young names engrossed in any kind of eugenic activity in only lilliputian amount .
The passion , the zeal towards one 's country , ones community or fraternity has effaced in the annals of history .

One of the paramount reason behind this is that world today has become much more relaxed than it was before .
I particularly feel that `` NEED '' is the root of all deeds .
Young generation does not see any `` need '' to practise such activities as the `` mileu '' around them is much more out of sufferrings as it was a few decades ago .
Another reason is the lack of appropriate moral teachings being given to them .
Attitude does not change overnight , right from childhood one has to inculcate these feelings in one 's persona .
Moral teachings are much more pedantic or limited to bookish knowledge , and hence they are not able to feel the suffering around the world .
They are not taken to rendevouz with the real world , like the world prevailing in the parts of africa .
Therefore youngsters remain in there own blues and hence are not aware of the present scenario .

To conclude , I think that media has a lot of role to play in arousing the blood in these people to flutter .
Media can be in any form , may it be television , newspaper or sophisticated internet tools .
Thinking of our young generation is largely influenced by the monster caled media , they think what media thinks .
Hence if media plays a vital role in changing the thinking of young people from , rather than being indifferent to their community to feel concern towards their community then it could have an comprehensive effect on the current scenario .
