I strongly agree with the idea that twenty years from now there will be fewer cars on road than there are now .

First of all , as the petroleum becomes expensive because of ever increasing demand , depletion of currently easily accessible and cheaply drilled wells not to mention the increasing costs associated with finding new source of petroleum , the people will become more reluctanct to spend huge money on gas and hence might feel motivated to use car-pools or public transit systems .

Secondly , such huge rise in prices will also motivate government to increase investments on public transit systems such as subways and metros .
Investment will also be made in reserach and development of faster means of conveyance with more security features than a car can provide .

If the cars on road grow on increasing at current rates , it is highly likely that so will accidents .
A safer and faster way of conveyance , if developed , is bound to attract people and hence fewer number of cars on roads .

Another consideration is the traffic jams if the number of cars keep on increasing .
The infrastructure is limited in any country and it can not match the pressure public is putting on it by bringing up new cars on road .
Eventually , there might be no room for infrastrcture improvments in most countries and hence one will not be able to avoid daily ritual of traffic congestion .
This situation is bound to make people give a second thought on using public transit or car-pools than traveling in one car all alone .

In fact , if any of the reasons I mentioned above - the price of gas , the accidents , the traffic congestion , no room to expand infrastructure - becomes very worse , the government of that country might have to regulate the production of cars or create special permits to buy cars .
Such regulations might seem to breach human rights in the first place , but they will do greater good to public at large in long run than harm .

To conclude , the fact that natural resource such as petroleum and the possiblity of infrastructure expansion are limited , it is certain that in twenty years from now , the number of cars in use will be fewer .
