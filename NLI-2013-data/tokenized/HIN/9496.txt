`` The ideas and concepts are based on the individual one .
No one can force to the other to follow her/his ideas . ''
- it is well known adage .
According to the statement it is important to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts .
I would also agree with this statement .

From my point of view it is very impotant to be a successfull person to understand clearfully about the concepts and ideas wheteher in whichever field she/he is .
We can take the example of the mathematics to support my thought .
In mathematics we see that , its just depend on the concepts .
If you have the concepts you can easily understood what the mathematics is all about .
There are a lot of theorems in it which are just derive from the concepts .
When the concepts of it are not clear to the student then he/she says oh my god how difficult it is .
Without knowing that how wonderful subject it is .

The second example for supporting my ideas is Computer languages .
The computer language is beautiful combination of the ideas and the concepts .
What you think is in the language bust conceptually structured .
Just take the example of Visual Basic language how nice and pliable language is this .

If a student just follow the facts without noticing the concepts and ideas then it would be difficult to him to understand many problems of day - to-day life .
Since day-to-day life is based indirectly on the mathematics and which is total depend on the concepts .

Since facts ca n't be changed so they are not flexible as the concepts and ideas are .
The student ca n't be a poetic one if he just depend on the facts since for the poetry the idea is very essential factor .

So facts are necessary but with ideas and concepts .
Because with ideas and concepts the student can get profound knowledge about the subject .
Concepts are fit directly into the mind without any confusion .
And this will help a student to achieve the goal and fulfill his dreams .
