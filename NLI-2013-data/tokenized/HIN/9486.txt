Yes , it is correct to say that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning them .
If a student learns a fact or a text then it wo n't last longer in his mind whereas if a student understand a fact through examples and reasons then the fact would last longer in his mind because things done practically has a greater impact then things done theoritically .

For example , if a chemistry book a procedure for making a soap is given then a student learn how to make a soap efficiently .
He would rather come to know the procedure to make a soap if he learns the process .
But on oter hand if a student make a soap practically then he would not need to learn the procedure .

Its just the understanding power of a person which works throughout his life , not the learning power .
Lets take an another example : if a student is being prepared for the interview for getting a scholarship and the teachers are preparing him for the interview by simply giving him the list of questions , which is expected to be asked from the student , with answers and the student memorises the answers to each and every question .
Incase the student selection commitee for the scholarship asks the student a question which is out of that list or may be from the list but with the different text , then a student wo n't be able to answer the question .
Whereas , if the student had undestood the questions and the manner how to answer the question then it would n't had create any problem for this student to answer .

Student life is the base of the whole life and if we are misguided at this point of life then it would surely create problems in future .
Learning a concept wo n't help a student to perform better .
If we take Maths as subject then the student with the habit of learning wo n't be able to crack the questions in maths as the subject needs the understanding power of the student to understand the concept .

Therefore in my opinion , a student should always understand the concepts rather than learning them .
