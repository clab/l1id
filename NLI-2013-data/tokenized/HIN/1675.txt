In the past few years we humans have made great advancements .
With the increase in adcancements , there is so much more to know and learn .
So much is happening every minute .
It is very difficult to keep tab on each and everything happening in the world .
Thus when i am faced with the question as to ` whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject ? ' , I would always choose to specialize in one specific subject .

I beleive that if one is specialized in one particular subject then he is better off in this ever so competitive world than a person who has broad knowledge on many areas , but lacks specialization in one .
Life has become so competitive .
In today 's scenario only the best can survive .
Even the highly qualified people are finding it difficlut to find a proper job .
Having specialized in a particular subject helps give direction to ones life .
Being specialized , one can really prosper in that subject area and do well for himself and his family .
But on the other hand , people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , are not particularly knowledgeable in one particular area .
Thus it is difficult for these people to find a good stable job .
Today most firms , businesses and agencies prefer specialized individuals who can handfle difficult and trying situations .

I am not trying to argue that people should not have any knowledge about other academic subjects .
I am a strong beleiver in the fact one should have some information of whats going on around him .
But accumulating broad knowledge on many subject areas is not possible if one decides to specialize in one subject .
Many argue that if once a person has obtained specialization in a particular subject then he can still go ahead and obtain broad knwoledge on other academic areas .
But if one feels that obtaining a doctorate or masters in a particular field is enough to be specialized then that person is mistaken .
Specialization means that a person have indepth knowledge about everything in a subject area and this includes keeping tab with current events in that subject area .
To be specialized and hence successful in one 's chosen field the person should keep learning in the subject .
I once asked my uncle who is a highly successful and respected doctor in India that what made him so good .
His answer was that I am not good I am still learning .
Once I have accumumaled all the knowledge there is to obtain in my field will i be good and that can never happen .

So when you are at the crossroads in your life and have to make a decision as to whether to obtain broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject , chose the specialization .
