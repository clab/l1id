Yes , I agrees with the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts in comparison with the learning of facts .
Ideas and concepts are very important for any student whether he is in initial stages of his life or whether he has grown up .
The formula of understanding the ideas and concepts will always helps the student in their future .

It is very good and effective when a student develops this technique in his initial stages .
It is very vital for a student to adopt this technique because this helps the student in developing various skills .

Idea and concepts lays down the foundation stone for the students to become a bright student in his life .
With this technique of understanding ideas and concepts he or she becomes very strong in their approach towards life and serves as the basis of knowledge .

This helps the students to become a good performer in schools in their intial stages and later in their life also .
Moreover they become very efficient in other activities .
This helps the students in acheiving results in life and infact developing the permanent habit of it .

Understanding ideas and concepts can prepare a student to face stiff and difficult competetions in his life and career not only a student becomes a good performer but just goes ahead of many students of his age group .
Students become acheiver in their life with very less chances of commiting mistakes .
Moreover it makes the student as a natural talent .

Facts on the other hand are less important for a student to understand and to learn because they are the very much truth which the students learns by themselves .
But in case of idea and concepts the student needs to develop it .
