I am in the agreement with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older eople do .
When young , every individual has the energy , zeal , passion and strength to enjoy the life .
Its the exuberance of youth that always motivates one towars more colorful side of life and thats what lack in the older people .
In the age of teen , every individual has a desire to experience the life to the fullest .
he aims high to achieve his goals .
He studies hard to get into a good university .
After getting enrolled , he plans well and again studies hard with great perseverance to get a good score and finally a degree that will provide him the platform to move further ahead in life .
After he gets a satisfactory job or starts some business , he wants to settle in life with a loving and caring spouse .
Taking responsibilities and standing by them gives him the immense pleasure of being successful .
So he is always in process of making life better .
When he is 30 to 35 , he plans for his kids , their schooling , their upbringing in a better environment .
And as the time passes he becomes weak and old , not strong enough to take care of his family .
Rather he becomes dependent on his children for his small needs .
Surrounded with health troublems , he rarely get anytime for enjoyment .
But not neglecting those special exceptional cases that justifies the quote `` your age is what you feel '' .
A well planned and organised life can definitely expircate the weekness of oldage .
Neglecting the negatives aspects of oldage , if one loks towards the postive facade , its the oldage that makes the life complete .
Older people do enjoy life with their grandkids , friends , betterhalves , livelyness of the gardens in which they stroll and many more .
