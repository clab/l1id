Yes i do agree that successful people always try out new things and take risk rather than doing the same thing what they already know how to do well .
Because people will with his own experinces not from other experinces .
If we try out the new things then only we will come to know what we have to do and how to do .
In starting we might may go wrong because that is the new thing for us .
But we have one prolong `` always keep trying unless u get success '' and one day surely u will be success .

There is one story of one king who fights for his kingdom .
He lost and hide in one cave , there he saw one small spiderman trying to clim the wall .
But he keep on falling donw , but he never loss his control and temper he keep trying it untill he get succes .
From this king understand that there is nothing impossible in this world only6 the thing is we need to give our total dedication towards our work .
He understand this thing and went back , gathered his army and faught again .
He keep on trying it and in last he won and got back his kingdom back .
So he learnt the lesson from a small spiderman that we should never give up .
always keep on trying .
So in the same way i feel that , if we have confidence upon ourself we can do anything on this earth and get success in that , though it might be from different field which we not deal with .
But what we need t o have is confidence and strenght in ourself that we can do this thing .
If we have this quality then no one can beat us .
We will always be successful in our life and in our work .
It might happen that being a experince person also he might fail .
Because anything is possible in this world .

so i conclude that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
only we need to have confidence on our self then we can do anything on this world .
