Looking at the rapid increase in the science and technology i feel that there would be certainly much more cars on roads than there are today .
Automobile industry forms a big part of the Gross Domestic Product for any country .
A reduction in the production of cars wich are the main component of the automobile industry means a dwindle in the Gross Domestic Product which can be a huge loss to the nation 's per capita income .
No country would ever risk upon its economy and living standards of its citizens .

Cars reduce the distances that seem to be far off by public transport .
With internet , telephones , radios and all other means of communications and facilties such as a small pantry and air conditioners being available in today 's cars travelling by a car is much more comfortable .

The multinational companies attract the unemployed by providing perks and facilities which include providing them with cars for transport .
Since most of the multinational companies are mass recruiters so a mass recruitment every session means a huge increase in the number of cars .

Cars are used to provude cab facilities to people who cannot own one and these cabs are particularly helpful to the tourists or people who are new to a place and are not aware about the means to commute .

Almost all the countries have specially assigned cars for their government officials .
With the increase in the population and the consequent increase in the government officials governing these people the increase in the number of cars is certain .

With the innovation and new scientific research being carried out everyday new cars are being developed that offer a higher mileage at much cheaper maintanance costs .
They are definitely better than relying on publictransport which is not really convenient at all times .
Owning a car means you can move to any place at anytime along with your family so people would definitely prefer going in for the better cars that are introduced into the market everyday .
Owning a car has become a standard for some people that consider it to reflect their lifestyle so they will definitely prefer buying cars .

The people todat are much more intelligent than ever before they are earning handsome amount of money and want to flaunt with the best of cars and the most modern ones with the latest technology .

Personally i would say that i would rather going by a car instead of the public transport .
Not only will it more convenient to reach my destinations on time it will simultaneously provide all the facilities on my toes .
