I agree that time for the community and help towards the community is not observed much these days by the younger generation .
Attaining independence at an early age is one of the reasons .
Personal ambitions also play a great role in the suffering of the community on the whole .
Migration is a reason that many people belive that a community gets diversified and thereby destroyed .
Young people also relate to a community in a way they remember being treated by the same community .

Young people nowadays do not give enough time towards helping their communities because they tend to gain independence at a much earlier age which translates into the fact that they gain many more responsibilities early on in life .
Infact in this day and age the trend is looked upto .
With the popularity of many young singers and actors succeeding at an early age , early independence is looked upto with respect .

Along with gaining personal and financial independence at an early age , personal ambitions come into the picture .
As compared to a couple of generations ago , when life was a lot simpler , the consumer choices have magnified .
Young people focus their life and work around many materialisitic goals that consume their time and focus , leaving them little for anything else .
Setting deadlines for being able to acquire an expensive car or a swiss watch is what the youth of today typically revolve their resolutions around .
Having preplanned the finances , charity which is an integral part of community support takes a back seat .

With the advent of fast and affordable communication and transport systems across the globe , migration is inevitable .
As members of a community migrate the wholeness of the community disappers , leaving a handful in the original settlement .
These few remaining members rarely get support from those who have moved out .

Young people also do not give enough time to help out their community simply because sometimes they do n't feel like the community was very nice or generous towards them when they were growing up .
For example a teen ager who may get criticised for sporting body tatoos by the community , is not very likely to feel nicely towards the very same community if he or she becomes rich and successful a decade later .

In conclusion I would like to state that the reasons for the youth of today not supporting their communities in terms of time and help are quite a few .
Some of them are reasonable while the others may not be , but the fact of the matter still remains that communities do not get the time or help or both from the young people of today like they used to a few generations ago .
