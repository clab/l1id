Successful people do things differently than a common man . ''
I agree to this `` maxim '' .
I believe succesful peopple have the ability to do same things differently and in different ways than a comman man can do or think of .

In my opinion , doing or trying new things makes a person more courageous , active and dynamic .
These are some of the things that make some of them enterpreneurs .
Entepreneures are the one who try out different things , they donot like to be tied down by the conventional norms of life , they are free spirited and generally follow what their heart says them to do .
These people enjoy thier work better than a person who does things he knows to do or is expected to do .
For instance , a clerk he does not do anything novel in his day to day life , he merely comes to office every morning , attends the customers , goes back home , collects his paycheck at the end of the month and thus leads a dull , monotous life .
Whereas a life of a research scinetist is different , he tries different ways that can lead him to a solution , his mind is more active or the life of an entrepreneur or a business man , who is thriving to satisfy his basic needs , his thirst for innovation .
Ofcourse these people can many times experience a lot of frustrations and ups and downs in their careers .
There may not be any monetary stability or the comfort that i m going to get a certian amount of money by the end of the month .
Thus , they can expect to have lot of fluctuations .
But their basic nture , their soul always searches for novelty .
These people also in their process of finding good things do a lot of god for the general public as well .

Some of the examples of people trying out new things and taking risk are scientist Einstein , Newton , Van Slyke etc. and many other business man like , Dhirubhai Ambani , Bill gates .
Mr S. Bhatia , the internet guy because of his risk taking ability and his search for new things , the world got introduced to the silicone valley .
So many times , the general public reaps the fruits sowed by these risk takers

In my opinion , it is important to try out new things in life , if you wish to have more creativity and nobility in life , that way one can keep onself from becoming a laid back and a laggard .
Keeping oneself amidst the modern technologies and trying out new things as they are introduced in the market can help a lot .
If one gets stuck to the age old things and technologies according to me , one is not moving with the world and is hindering ones progress .

I strongly believe , trying out new innovative things and taking a little bit of calculated risk would do no harm to a common man but would rather act as a stepping stone in his progress

Thus , the key to success is to adopt or try new things and to take calculated risk inorder to climb the ladder of success in one 's life .
