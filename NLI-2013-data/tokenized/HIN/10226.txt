Well , I agree with the following statement that successful people always would want to try new things taking all the risks involved in doing so .
It 's a common sense to understand the point cause people who are successful and well experienced in whichever field they are would want to try and explore new things for their benefit .

For example , successful businessman would n't hesitate to take the risks of establishing a new firm or company caused he already knows what 's involved to built a company .
And even if it turns out to be a failure , he would n't have much problem to start all over again with all the financial backing and the knowledge and expertise that he has .
Likewise , famous singers known for their songs and music quality try and incorporate new kind of sounds and technics to make it different and interseting for their fans .

So , yes Successful people al ways have better chnan .
