I feel that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to speacialize in one subject .
The current era is changing and developing fast .
It is growing at a rapid pace and in this changing world , one needs to have information about everything and almost every field .
I think that in this changing era , one has to have the knowledge of almost every topic and field .

Human being is a social animal .
He lives in a society where he meets several people from different streams .
If he doesnt have any idea about other fields he cant even to talk to the persons he meets .
He needs to have knowledge about the various streams .

For example MAHATAMA GANDHI , a lawyer by profession had a diverse knowledge about various subjects .
He was an excellent speaker , great dramatist and a great poet .
He used all these skills to guide India to indepence .
WIthout the knowledge of these subjects he could not have guidd India to indepence .

One must have a broad knowledge of almost every subject .
This is not only helpful in professional work , but also important for personal life .
For example knowledge of geography can help one plan a vacation to an exotic location .
Physics is used in our daily lives .
Chemistry can be really useful to one .
One can undersatnd the politics better .
One can understand politics better if he has a knowledge of it .

I support this opinion that knowledge of many academic subjects is better than knowledge of one specialized subject .
