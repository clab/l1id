I agree to the fact that there will be fewer cars in a twenty years time from now .

I support to this point because there has been an increasing amount of awareness about the rise in the number of cars in the city .
The streets and roads have become more crowded and there is more difficulty for the pedestrians to walk on .
There has been surprizing increase in the number of road accidents lately .
Not only this , more cars mean more pollution and more pollution means more global warming , which is a hottest issue in every country .
Becasue of the problem of global warming , people are favouring to the concept of travel through buses and trains .

People going to offices have resorted to going more than one in the same car rather than each one going in his/her own car .
This greatly reduces the pollution and expenses of a person , furthur leading to the decrease in the number of cars on road .
The railway network connecting cities and metro railway network with a city is supporting to the travel of many people throughout the day .
Being cheaper than the cost incurred upon using own vehicles , people are resorting to such options .

I oppose the argument of the increase in number of cars because of many of the reasons stated above .
Moreover , the increase in cars on the raod leads to havoc and doesnt give a good impression of the cleanliness of the city .
Recently , in New Delhi , there has been an increase in temperature in the summers than the earlier years owing to more pollution in the city .
After the starting of metro railway , many people use this reliable , safe and easy service making a commendable impression on other cities .
This has caused an acceleration in the making such decisions to lessen number of cars on the road in other cities .

Concluding , I feel optimistic in the decrease of number of cars in use in a twenty years time owing to its much awaited advantages and long lasting effects both for a safe city and for a better nature .
