It is rightly said that `` knowledge leads to Success '' But it is also said that `` Half knowledge is dangerous '' .
According to me one should have knowledge of all subjects when you are undergraduate level but when you go for masters degree or doctrate degree one have to specilize in a perticular subject .

Having broder knowledge is always useful .
One should have a broader perspective of all subjects at school level and college level .
This provides them with a carrier option who are really confuse what to choose as there future and what they are good at .
knowledge is helpful in every walk of life .

People here are really confused about distributng and how to utilize their knowledge .
One should understand that knowledge is never wasted .
If one is gaining masters degree for instance he cannot do masters in all subjects .
In that case he has to choose a specific subject .

But Imagine if there is a group of old school friends meeting after several years and if all are from different field .
Imagine a person sitting quite and cannot speak because he has no knowledge of what they are arguing on .
What a miserable situation that is .

Hence according to me every type of knowledge is useful in life but one has to make a choice in later part of his life have to go for a single subject .
