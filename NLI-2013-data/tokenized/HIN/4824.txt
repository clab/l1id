Advertisements have become an important part of our daily life .
We rely so much on the advertisements and bring the product to use it .
But , most of the advertisements make the products look much better that what they really are .
I totally agree to this .

I have heard lots from people about the superficial advertisements whose products are really bad and i have too experienced it .
There are lot of hair related products like shampoos , conditioners and hair styling products of different brands .
I have dry and weak hair .
I happened to see an add for shampoo for dry and weak hair .
There advertisement poised a model having silky and strong hair after using it .
So relying on the advertisement i bought that shampoo and used it but to my surprise i didnt get even okay results .
Basically they try to sell their products by making progandas about the product but actually it is not satisfying at all .

Lets consider the example of fitness intruments .
The advisements shows that if you will use this product you will loose so much pounds , if you will use that product you will loose some more pounds .
Since in US obesity is the major problem , so people rely on these adds and bring home the instruments .
They do loose some of pounds but it not the same pounds they show in adverstisements .
In most of the adverstisements , they will just show beautiful models and celebrities to make their add fancy than it actually is .

I want to tell one of my friends experience about the cell phone service .
She took one cellphone service watching its advertisement talking about the better quality of phone calls and best customer care services .
But she is repenting her decision of using that service because of bad voice quality and more worse is their customer support .

In my opinion , not all but most advertisements tend to make their product look better that what it really is .
So , in my view we should not blindly rely on these advertisements rather we should learn more about the product and should compare with other products .
