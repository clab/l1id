` Young people enjoy life more than older people do ' - I completely disagree with this statement .

I believe that one cannot generalise this concept based on a criteria like age .
One can definitely enjoy life irrespective of age .
It is all a matter of individual preferences , tastes and situations .
I have seen very gloomy young people with absolutely no spirits or enrgy to enjoy life .
At the same time I have met very energetic and joyful old people who ensure that they enjoy each and every moment of their life to the fullest .

One can enjoy life if he has a good company and good circumstances too .
Its not the youth or old age that decides this .
It may appear that young people enjoy more as they hang around with friends in big groups making noises , smoking , drinking and partying all night .
But I believe that the concept of enjoyment is different for different individuals .
For example - I do not need to go to a disotheque to enjoy life but I enjoy life as it is - I enjoy the first rain of the season , I enjoy the fragrance in the air after that first rain , I enjoy my morning cup of coffee with the newspaper , I enjoy sitting at night and chatting with my freinds - and all this I will even enjoy when I am old .

In fact I feel that old people have more to enjoy .
They have ample time especially if they are retired from their jobs .
They have the entire day with them to enjoy .
They do not have to worry about work pressure .
They have beautiful memories and experiences of life that to cherish and feel happy about .
At that age they have an entire life to look back upon and feel relaxed that they have achieved so much .
Whereas young people have so many worries with them always - first school then college then work then marriage then kids and so on and so forth .

In nutshell , it 's not the age that makes one enjoy life - rather it 's the spirit that makes you live life to the fullest enjoying each and every moment of it .
