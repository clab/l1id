I do agree with successful people try new thing and take risks rahter than only doing what they already know how to do well .
because the reason is like if people try new thing that means their mind working as like creating something in that perticular area .

if they are able to take the risk that mins they are creating something .
for example they are in research lab they are doing what thay already know how to do well it mins they are not creating something new in that field .
if they try new thing and take risk that look like they will be invent something in that perticular field .

if people try new things its look like they are using their mind and our mind has no limit so that we can use our mind like to thing new creation in the world .

furthermore , sometime we get intresting idea to learn a new thing thing .
such as puzzle or game .
we always try to solve puzzle or play a puzzle like game .
this thing seems like that I am trying new things .

similarly , if I try new thing in the life may be possible that some things getting me harder .
also it may be possible that I am not able to getting any new idea or unable to do the that perticular thing .

one most important thing is that if we try new thing and take risk that we can have more knowledge about whatevers is happning in the world .
we can get more succees in the world .
we can reeach at the top the world .
because trying somthing or takin risk
