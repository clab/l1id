I completely agree to the statement and I strongly believe that in order to succeed one should be willing to take chances/risks in life and try unexplored avenues .
I 'd like to support my statement by mentioning following points and examples :
Firstly , as we all know that we have to live once and as some people say that life is not a rehearsal , I think we have been given just one opportunity to explore different avenues of life .
Indeed life would become very monotonous and boring if risks/chances are not taken and novel things are not tried .
Having said that it should be taken into consideration that the chance taken should not harm oneself or others .
For instance , if we think of the big names of business world like Bill gates and Sushil Mittal , they could not have achieved their current status , if they would n't have taken risks in their lives .
These people were not well acquainted with computers and steel , respectively when they started but because of their willingness to explore and take chance they undoubteldy succeed and reached to the highest level .

Secondly , I believe that if risks/chances are not taken in most of the areas , it would definitely affect the rate at which we invent newer technologies today .
Most of the advances are based on assumptions that one would succeed while attempting a particular task .
For example , momentous discoveries like computer , internet , telescope , etc. would not have been possible without taking the risk and considering the possiblity of failures .

Thirdly , I feel that one should be concious of that fact while taking risks/chances that success is not always a surity becasue we always do not get what we aim for .
So it 's not essentially true that people who took chances earlier are only successful ones , but there are people who were unable to achieve what they desired despite of taking risks .

Finally , I conclude that though there is no harm in working on only doing something that a person knows well , but i think that would make life very stagnant and our advancement will be badly hampered .
So a person should always be willing to lookout for opportunites and take calculated risks in his life and sooner or later he would definitely taste success .
