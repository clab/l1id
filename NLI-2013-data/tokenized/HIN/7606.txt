` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' ...
I would certainly agree with the statement .
Travelling is a lot of fun and also a good learning experience .
If one wants to enjoy as well as learn the abouth the history , culture and habitat of the place a tour guide would certainly be helpful .
Educating oneself about the place prior to visiting it by books and the internet is very helpful too but having a guide who is local and has the knowledge is definately better .

I feel that in a group with a guide one can have a planned itineary and can organize the trip in a better fashion .
If i would be by myself i probably would get lazy most mornings and waste time getting around .
By being in a group i would probably use my time and money in a more efficient way .
For me even while Im travelling going by a schedule really helps .
Being by oneself I feel one wastes lot of time first collecting the information and then deciding where and when to go .
With a tour guide one is in better hands to travel and sight see comparing to ones own .
By having a tour guide one can learn more .
I feel that I remember more after seeing a thing / place and listening about it rather than just reading about it .
A local guide might have some stories to tell about the place which one may not find in any of the books .

Personally for me a group of people is more fun to go out with .
I strongly agree with the statement - ` more the merrier ' .
Travelling , singing , dancing and eating out could be more fun for me with more people around rather than being by myself .
Going to a new place might be intimidating at first but being in a group would just make me feel at home all the time .
I love making new friends and going out in a group also helps cultivating new relationships and friends .

Hence I would strongly recommend anyone to travel in a group rather than being on ones own .
