I am kind of disagree with this statement .
I agree that to understand ideas and concept are important , but to learn facts are also important .
By understanding ideas and concept student learn how facts take place .
It is not just once you understand ideas , you do need to worry about how facts happen .
For example , my professor explained the process of the earthquack .
She briefly described each and every detail about it .
Now i know how do earthquack happen , but what if i do not know the facts of it .
How can i prove my concept about the earth quack , if i do not have the specific example .
If i said that there are earthquack happen in indonesia , and explain these are the reasons this happen over there more often , then i support my statement .
My fact support my concept and ideas .
Happning of the earthquack in indonesia is a fact .
I need to know it to understand my concept better .

Facts are important in order to understand the concept .
You can not say that fact does not worth it .
Without fact no concept and no idea take place .
Facts are the life of the concepts .
One more example here is that countries in sourthern hemishphere have warmer climate and countries in northern hemisphere have cooler climete .
How can i proove this statement ?
I will give all my geographic reasons and explanation .
How can I proove all my geographic reasons ?
Now to have facts is important .
If i say that United States is in Northern Hemishphere and that is why it is having cloor climate , and Shri Lanka is in Southern Hemisphere and that is why it is having warmar climate .
This is the fact .
My fact support my argument .
Fact are important to proove your statement .
You can not just state something and agree with it without giving specific reasons and examples .

Basically , the facts are as important as concept and ideas .
They both are equal .
None of them is more important than the other .
