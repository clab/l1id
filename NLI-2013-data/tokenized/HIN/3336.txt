I disagree with the given statement , especailly in the context of the modern world .
The statement is probably inspired by the large number of career based people who may appear to be too selfish .
In a world of competition , this may partly be true - to get to the top , you must not let anyone else get past you .
However , taking a broader view , many of these people are very helpful , especially when they are needed the most .

Basically in every society , be it a contemporary one or of the past , there are people who are naturally more inclined to community service and related activities .
Many of these people have actually experienced or have been influenced by some touching social event .
Examples may be people who have been near a tornado struck place and have seen people 's houses and families getting decimated .
Such an event probably had a significant impact on their life and made them start helping people in need .

Something very ubiquitous about the modern world is the availability of communication .
Live footage of an earthquake in the Indian state of Kashmir is available throughout the country .
Call of a weeping mother for monetary help resounds on the ears of every person of the nation .
The plight of hundreds of dead children shakes the heart of even people who have religious and poilitical conflicts with the territory .
How then , one may ask , can someone remain poise in such a situation ?
The earthquake strikes not in a single state but in the heart of every citizen of the country .

It is in these times of tragedies that the young , so far busy in making their careers , suddenly come to rescue of others .
They fall upon their basic instincts - the need to help the needy .
The satisfaction they get from such service usually changes their life style for ever .
Successful and rich businessmen , who even find it hard to give time to their daughters , come out and provide the much needed monetary help .
This was something obviously not possible in the olden days .
It is thus the young who fuel the rescue work in these times .
