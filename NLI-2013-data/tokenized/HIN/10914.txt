`` Sucessful pepole try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' It might not be wrong if the above sentence is rephrased as pepole who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well are pepole who are the most successfull .
Innovation is always the need of the hour has always been the need of the hour .
A particular person will get stagnated if he continues doing the same thing which he is good at he has allready acheived whatever he can from doing well in one thingh .
He will have to move on the next thingh and try to improvise on that rather then doing only one thingh and try doing the best he can only then he might be succesful .
The best in any field have goneup only by exploring , we can take examples from any field be it sports buisness politics journalism .
For example let us take the great sporting legend SACHIN TENDULKAR who plays great cricket and is the best batsman of all times but just being that did'nt satisfy him he kept on improving himself by creating new shots of his own being unorthodox in his playing techniques others in the same field stuck only to the basics doing only what there are good at and not innovating themselves or exploring themselves .
These pepole are not as successful as SACHIN is .
This theorey is not only restricted to sports .
It extends to all fields the rags to riches stories of buisness syon DHIRUBHAI AMBANI once a textile czar reinvented himself and took risks and dared to do diferent and went into the petroleum buisness .
Today his company is the largest private petroleum company in a major country like india all this would not have been possible if dhirubhai wouldnt have taken the risk of going into petroleum which was new for him despite the fact that he would have comfertably be only in his textile buisness .
His company certainly would'nt have been so successful if it were n't for dhirubhais ability to take risks and do new things .
He and a majority of successfull pepole owe their sucess to a moderate risk taking attitude and the daring to do new things , which is very true .

Thus we can obviously say that the mantra to success is to try new things and take new risks rather then doing only what one is good at
