Nature , the greatest creator in this universe , and the most powerful force of God to exersice his powers on earth has allowed millions of species to flourish on this planet .
Homo Sapiens , now so called the rulers of this planet , do have a lot of dissimilarity among its own kind .
These dissimilar groups form communitites .

The biggest responsibility of a man born in a community during the ancient or medival ages was to work for the development of his community and try to show its superiority to others .
But with the advent of modern technologies and the world shrinking into a global village , the social structure and thinking of man changed .
Now he is no more confined to a particular region or to a particular community .
He moves out explores the whole world and tries to interact with other communities in the form of adapting their culture and even having marriage alliances .
The offsprings thus are not much attached to the communities of their parents but they have a stronger penchant to carry on the voyage of exploring and intermingling with other communites , which their ancistors started .

But the biggest community , a man belongs is mankind .
And contributing to its causes has been and will always be the biggest responsibility of each and every homo sapien dwelling on earth .
The race of earning more material resources has left today 's youth with less time to fulfill its own responsibility towards its community .
Its displays shear lack of courage and determination on the part of the youth .
Profession excellence to an individual means much more then investing his time and resources to attain communal excellence .

This is indeed not the only face of the coin .
We can always observe a lot of social service being offered to the needy and to some weaker communties .
The youth surely is not showing personal contribution for the causes of his community but they are indeed contributing as organisations .
Many organisations inspired by experienced personal have encouraged the youth for communal activities .
So , it is apparent that prefession involvement has surely shown the way to the youth to contribute to their community .
Yet , if few youngsters are not willing to take out time to serve the community , then they do not deserve the right to survive in the big communtiy called mankind .
