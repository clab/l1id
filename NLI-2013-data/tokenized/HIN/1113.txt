Knowledge about different subjects are important in this fast and devoloping world .
One should have knowledge of many topics to survive .
I agree with the fact that the broad knowledge of many different academic subject is better than in one subject .

To begin with , i would like to draw attenton towards the fact that less knowledge less opportunities .
A person with broad kwowledge of different subjects can perform well in any field .
Many fields are open for the person at the same time .
but person who has done specialization in any single subject will not be able do anything out of his field ..

Secondly , people with broad knoledgee leads to great achievement in life .
For example if a person from engineering feild enters into management of any big company and manages it well .
He will be promoted faster than a employee who is specialized only in engineering .
Another example if a students keeps on reading course books and scores well in each semester without good knowledge of computer .
He will face big problem in performing any job as computer has become a great need of the people nowadays .

Thirdly , if the person has knowledge ogf many streams , he can change his main stream whenever he want .
He might face difficulties in performing good in his stear and so ca n changer field whenever it is required .
For example if person have taken both medical and non medical subjects in junior colleges .
He or she always has chance to shift in the field in which he or she is performing well .

In conclusion i would only say that knowledge about the different fields is always a positive things
