Enjoyment in life is basically dependent upon the positive aspects of thinking and the strong base a person is related to .
It is not the outer showcase but it is ones innerself that provides an access to enjoy the situations coming to life As per me older people are more related to the positive aspects of life and they use to manage the phases of life in more balanced manner by provision of much needed charistmatic energy that flow in there life .
and that provides them an access to enjoy there life fully In todays society for the young people it is believed that it is money which let them to enjoy the life .
But it is not an actual souce to enjoy life Life is based on management of situations and that we get from an access of experience we had in past .
So as per me the two major factors that effects the life are
1. Strong base to values
2. Experience
So if we dont have a balance of values and experience we can manage a part of life but we cantlive our life truely and this will result on the way we enjoy .
These two aspects are missing in major way from the living manner of young people and so we can very well account the result .

The situation of life provide an inspiration to enjoy our life so it is not the external comfort that we can manage from fullfilling our lavish requirement .
That is generally thought by young people , So an inspiration to earn more and more and more money is the main reason that generally let the young people to focus upon that .
As a result the time slip from there hand and once they realise that , they suffer So in order to enjoy life young people have to provide time to their ownself and manage the situations in a manner that they can Forcast the results as like older people in a manner to positively deal with these situations .

So it is ones innerself that provides and directs a route to enjoy life As the older people generally stick to their way to enjoy life rather then getting dependent on and outside aspect ( money ) they are able to accoumplish the goals in a manner that provides a direct relation to enjoy their life in a better manner .
