I strongly agree that students should learn the ideas and concepts of anything rather than learning only the facts .

The points which i will cover are as below :
# Ideas and concepts reveals the actual knowledge of the student .
# Facts could be an illusionary knowhow about the subject .
# Conceptual knowledge makes a deep impact on the colleagues and professors and to attain more of the credits .
# Facts could be somewhat useful or maybe considered for timebeing but ideas generating the facts would be the ones every individual is interested to know .
# Importance of deep knowledge in today 's competitve world .
# Conclusion

As a saying goes on :

`` Half - Knowledge is dangerous '' .

The very friends of a man are always `` WHO '' , `` WHY '' , `` WHAT '' , `` WHERE '' .
And these all leads us to know the ideas and concepts behind every invention , every fact , every rule , every quote , every event that occurs or happens .
I would not be wrong if i say that i usually like to carry these four questions with me when ever i move to unkown place or to any interesting place .

Well , starting up with the essay i would like to stress on the point of `` Complete - Knowledge '' .
I suppose that this term is mentioned by me just to make my point self-explanatory .
Infact , i would say that a person with knowledge is the one appreciated everywhere .

And the matter is simply that a student will be able to get more of the grades and could get more attention if he has the collection of various innovative ideas accompanied with the facts told by him .

Now for example , a student preparing for any of the project presentation will have to elaborate and present his knowledge and research related to the topic of the project .
And in this case it would definitely be the best part for the student to collect the facts related to his project and to make them know how they were possible ?
Would n't that be a fantastic thing done by the student to make his classmates introduce with a new topic and in an educational way ?

Ofcourse it would be !
But i am not completely disagreeing with the point that knowhow of facts is also important sometimes .
`` As i believe something is better than nothing '' .
But usually facts turns out to be an illusionary concept with no basis to support .
This may lead a student to a condition of `` Nowhere '' .

But surely , a student will be able to get more of the accolades , extol , credits , grades on his complete and deep knowledge based on facts and figures .

Today 's competitive world demands knowledge with deep roots to sustain in the developing and fast - growing companies .
Every day new inventions and creations are forcing the companies to seek great minds to get in their company and in lieu to this great minds , always an acutal knowledge is required .

Still , a student should for sure attain as much knowledge as possible only to survive and to rise in this competitive world and prove his worth .
He should gain more and more facts and work out the ways through which thises facts have been developed .
His research probably would then be the most attractive part of his resume for a company to hire him .

Hence , knowledge is important and somehow with a basi and so ideas , concepts and facts together be the best part of having sound knowledge in a student life .
