I disagree with the given statement that in the coming twenty years the number of cars on road will actually decrease .
Many people may believe and support this because of the fact that petroluem resources are depleting and the sudden rise in prices of petrol and diesel have supported their point of view .

But what they actually fail to see is the facts .
As of today we have not even discovered ( leave alone taking out ) 50 % of the petroluem resources present on earth .
The theory or curve used for energy consumption is Logistic curve .
This curve shows that energy consumption reaches to a maximum value at exactly the mid point of the life span of the resource .
Till today we have not reached that mid point even .

Another point is that , the rate at which the automobile sector is growing today it is impossible to say that in the next twenty years it will be gone .
All the big industries can not be closed in just twenty years .

Coming back to the petroluem , it is true that the cost of oil will continue to increase and slowly it will not be affordable for the commom man to use it for transportation but other alternatives are coming up slowly .
They include Bio-fuel , coal gasification and coal liquification , etc ..

I have myself worked on Bio-fuels ( specifically bio-diesel ) .
In my project I used bio-diesel as fuel for a diesel engine and compared engine performance and emission characterstics with diesel on other hand as fuel .
The conclusion was that bio-diesel produces less pollutants and is cheaper as compared to diesel prices as of today .
Moreover it is bio-degredable .
The researchers are having lot of hopes with bio-fuels because of above mentioned advantages .
In my country government has taken several initiatives for mass-production of bio-diesel .

There are other alernatives for petroluem also .
eg. For the short term requirement of petrol/diesel and gas , coal liquification and coal gasification are best possible answers .
In these processes solid coal is converted to natural gas and liquid petrol .
As there is no scarcity or crisis for coal today , this will be a possible answer for some years .

Also much research is going on on electric cars .
Indian company REVA is producing an electric car called REVA II which is available for consumers .

Hence in all it is evident that the number of cars on road will only increase but the rate of increase may drop down .
And the problem of energy crisis will be solved because human civilization will survive as it has till date and whenever such problems come , alternatives have been found out and implemented .
