I do not agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
In fact , I believe that these days young people feel more responsible towards their communities and try to contribute towards them .

These days , because of the advent of faster and better means of communication and transport , young people stay well connected with the world around .
By means of TV channels , internet etc , young people are more informed about whats happening in their communities .
This awareness , has also made them more responsible .
For example , whenever some accident or a catastrophe occures somewhere then the news is spread very fast because of the faster means of communication .
And one can see that there are several young people who willingly provide help in such situations .
They provide services to the hospitals , are ready to donate blood and what not .
Clearly enough , in this case they are contributing a lot to their communities .

The current young generation has grown in an atmosphere which is more free and liberal than ever before .
They have always experienced this freedom of choosing what they want to do .
And so they also choose the kind of community which they want to belong to and also in what ways they want to connect to their community .
Obviously when a work is done by free will and not by force , it is done more willingly and in a more inspired way .
So in this case since whatever the young people do for their communities is done out of free will and not by force , so they do it in a more inspired and dedicated way .
And hence they spend more time helping out their communties .
For example , these days young people have opened up different kind of community centers or groups for helping their community or society in different ways , for example centers for animal rights , center for education for the poor and so on .
All these groups or centers are made out of interest and motivation , and so the young people who work in it work with great devotion and zeal which is clearly visible in the amount of work such centers do these days .

So clearly young people these days are more informed , free and motivated and it clearly reflects in the amount of time they devote to helping out their communities in their own way .
