In order to understand something student should have a basic ideas about it .
I agree with the statement that it is more significant for the student to understand ideas and conept because in order for having a vast knowledge about any thing we should have a idea or concept which can be applied later in the practical life .

One reason for my belief is that in order to have a overall knowledge about any equipment or any subject , it takes time therefore student should learn ideas and concept .
Suppose we take a case of a person who want to become a pilot , so inorder to become a pilot , he should have to understand ideas and concept about the various mechanism in the aeroplane instead of driving it .
He can drive it better if he can have a better understanding about the concept and ideas then he can apply these in driving the aeroplane .

Second reason for my belief is that inorder for the accurate knowledge for the subjects it is better for the student to have a clear understanding about ideas in their class room because i feel that for a flawless knowledge we should have our concept cleared in classroom .
Suppose a student want to work on a computer aided machine which is a very expensive machine and quite vulnerable to fault if not handled properly , then in these case without having a knowledge of concept and ideas to handle it , student can cause a problem to the machine resulting in failure .

Finally , I feel that in the student life there are too much concept which are to learn , they had less time to complete their subject syllabus , therefore they should firstly complete the course in their school otherwise less time will harm their academic career .

However for the proper study of the a subject , student should have a hand to hand knowledge of fact also these will help in acquiring profound knowlege of the subject .

In conclusion , I agree with the statement that the student should understand ideas and concept which will be more benefical for them .
