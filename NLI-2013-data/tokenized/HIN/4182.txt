I agree with the statement as these era people have comparitively less time as to the era which has passed by .
This era 's young people have more involvement in other tasks .
They generally have more of tasks to complete than the hours in a day .
In todays fast living life young people generally have lots to do as they have their social life to be maintained , as well as religious life to be handled , or lets say a peer group life .
Their a certain things which a community asks for , lets say their helping towards society uplifting or making a change in the community as the time changes .
As these young people need to handle their community and their outside world well enough to have a balance in thier life .
community as welll should be quiet adoptive to a young people manner .

As these community too should allow changes in them as the time changes or the era of people change as these factors can only attract young people to the community .
Young people have more to the places like pubs or disc or any other fast running places as these youngsters do generally copy the things which facinates them more .
As these things or places have a attractive outlook which makes the young or any age group follow them .
the fact to be considered here is how to bring these people 's intrest in community task , as it can be done by the parents as setting a good example in front of them and to teach them the right things or rituals from the begining so they follow accordingly and help to continue .
These young people are normaly ready to be molded as you mold them they will be moulded , the community has to be the one to moulding the people in their molds .
As i generally feel that the intrest among these youngsters is to be brought from within and not from saying or asking as this should from the soul and this can be done by building their community closer as these youngsters are the one to follow are community to the future gener and if they dont their will be an era where communities would be rare to find .
