I believe that successful people try new things & take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well .
If u keep doing same thing over & over again no one is going to impress what u did but if u do something new every one is going to surprise how u did this & they will become curious to know about it .
Without taking risks its not possible to do something new , ex.if u want to gain more knowledge u have to learn new things to learn it but u are not sure that that knowledge is going to help u somewhere in ur life .
but if do not take risk & do not start to learn new things u r never ever in ur life is going to find out that knowledge will be useful for you or not ?
It will be mystery for ur whole life u live .
So i think that if want to be succed in your life start learning new thing instead of following same old things that u already know .

The 1 reason i believe this becoz , Especially at this time world is booming , each & every second some one is investing something new that no one knows .
so to keep track with present world we have to try something new instead of sticking with same old thing u already know .
ex.each & every day cell phones company , computers company , actually all eloctronics companies introduce their totally different & brand new models .

The another reason i believe this becoz if u try something new u will make more money than with the same old thing .
ex.if u make new desing for cloth that no one invented yet , u r definateley going to make money.2nd ex.if u build the house , which is totally different than the usual houses arond u going to make more money & u going to be more popular too .

in other world its not limited for only electronic or builer buisness but it true for any thing u can imagine in ur mind , in today 's world every one want latest facilities , designs , equipments , etc .

So , in conclusion successful people try new things & take risks instead of sticking with same old things that some one already invented .
but remember 1 thing , success is not possible without taking risks .
