I agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than today .
There are many reasons to support this view .
Firstly , twenty year from now there will be very less space avilabe to drive due to sharp increase in populations and vechiles .
Thus traffics snarl and long waiting time at signals wiil be the scene .
Thus people will prefer other ways like walking , cycling to save time and to reach their work place safely on time .

As it is aptly clear from the present scene long wait will make people impatient and due to shortage of time one may drive fast thereby leading to more accidents .
Thus to avoid accidents peiople will prefer ultra modern public transport like metro trains etc. which will help the reachsafely on time there by leading to decreae in numbers of cars and other vechiles .

More over , technology will increase the production .
Thus , cars will be cheaper than today and no longer will be status symbol .
Moreover , their maintainence cost and high cost of fuel prices will drive the customer away as is clear from the present spirraling prices of fuel .

Furthermore , educated people will be definetly be more health concsious and will prefer cycling and walking etc. than car driving to keep illness at bay due to thier sedntary lifestyles when everything will be handy due to tehnological advancements .

Also people will try to reduce sound and noise pollution and what can be the best way than to not use cars unless one desperately need it like going with family to a family ocassions .

Goverment wiil also support such things and also comr uppolicies to reduce pollution and one them is their less usage .
Thus it can be safely conclude that thier wiil be less use of carstwenty years down the line than today .
