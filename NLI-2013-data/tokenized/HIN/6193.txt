I think that today , with the advancement in tecnology , anything is possible .
I agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today .
There can possibly be total minimisation in the number of cars too .

Since the beggining of time , man has survived through many ways .
Not only is he fighting to survive , but he is trying to improve the condiitions around him , so he may make his life more comfortable .
Cars started with travel through animals ; in early times , people would sit on horseback or on a donkeys back to reach his destination .
Then later came the bullock cart , where the animal pulled the cart which was on wheels .

Like this , many advances have been made in the means of travel such as bicycles , tricycles , motor cycles , trains , ship , planes and ofcourse the most convenient means of transport - the car .
Nowadays , that is , in the twenty first century , in many places , the metro is being built .
It is a development of the trains which are generally used to travel long distances .
The metro , is a faster mode of trains , it can be used to travel short distances - which may take the place of cars .

Cars , being a very useful vehicle , has a lot of disadvantages such as parking spaces - nowadays , almost every family owns three cars .
Parking is becoming a great problem , as there is no space at all .
Another problem is traffic .
Traffic is the worst problem of all - it causes people to get late for appointments , meetings or other important places .
Even the price of the cars are rising , which people cannot afford as there are other expenses to make too .

So , I think , that in the near future , many people might sell their cars and may travel by metro which is built in many countries such as India , U.K. , U.S.A. , and is being built in many other places too .
I think it will be much more convenient for those people who do wo n't use their car and for those who still have their cars , because there will be less traffic and less parking problems .
