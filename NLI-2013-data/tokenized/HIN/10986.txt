`` High risk promises sucess and high return ''
I will always agree with the point of taking risk and venturing out in new areas is always better than to remain stagnant in particluar position even if it involves risk .
There are many examples of people who were unsuccesful in their career , so they went out in open battle fields of this world and took risk and now they are sucessful , for example Dhirubhai Ambani and Ratan Tata .

Their are many advantages of taking risk , First , it opens up new areas to be explored like a person can even devlop a new sector himself .
Second , high risk is always followed by high return and great empires which can help easily diffrentiate the person from non-risk taking cowards .
Third , doing new always calls for learning process and entertainment .
A person can learn a lot more if he or she has a risk taking attitude .
Also through this process a new cycle of steps devlop like : first no competion in new area leading to more profit which inturn lead high sucess which in turn lead easy eastablishment .
Moreover , the risk attitude devlops a personal quality of sportsmanship and the ability to fight back .

As their are always two sides of coins , some people might think the risk taking attitude to careless attitude and unsophiticated thing but they have to agree that taking risk gives more then what it takes either in form of monetary benefits or learning process .

`` Higher the one succeds the higher risk he has taken . ''
In the future the buissness and people who have caliber and postive attitude will succed and the critics of risk will face an uncertain future , So to be succesfull one has to take qualities of succesful people and adopt them and the prominent one among them is risk .
