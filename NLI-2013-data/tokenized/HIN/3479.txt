Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This is undoubtedly true and i would absolutely agree with it .
Today 's generation have become more hardworking and sincere towards their carrer .
There is so much of competition that the young generation is just so busy preparing themselves for a better and more secure future .
There is so much of competition that one does not have the time and energy left to support their communities .
They find it very demanding to support their very own survival that they feel it will hamper their future if they invest time in supporting their communities .

One example i would like to mention here is that a friend of mine who use to be always busy supporting his community found that people started exploiting him and taking undue advatage of his goodness and kindness .
He felt that he was putting his future at stake if he would carry on helping his community and he was not even sure that if tomorrow he would be in a problem whether somebody would be there in times when he would be in crisis .

Infact one day while he was helping a member of his community , that member said this line `` God helps those who help themselves '' .
He told him son start helping yourself first by doing well in your academics and then help your community .
That day he realised how far his friends had gone in life and how much of effort he will have to make to shape a good future for himself now .

One really does n't know what life lie 's ahead of him or her and to secure their future they concentrate on their work .
That is why young people of today 's generation do not give enough time to helping their communities .
