The statement that to understand ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts is a contoversial one .
On one hand learning facts is important get into the researches made in the past On the other hand it is always saidthat thinking and understanding is the mother of all invention .
How ever in my opinion it is better to understand ideas and concepts rater to learn it .

The reason for my belief is , that if someone understand the topic and apply it the past experience helps to memorize the thing .
the best example i can think of is doctor it is the ideas and practise that makes him a good practioner , if he going to learn every thing he might be confused all the time .

The second reason for my belief is , it is always easy to underestand the thing rather to mug them up .
Concept formation started right when he was in school and it gradually build over the time and will not finish till the end of his life .
It is scientifically proved that what we learn each day we memorize only 30 % next day and it will keep on decreasing with time .
This happens to us during exams if a pereson is well active during lecture and do his home work regularly his performance is better than a person who worked last night of exam , the active learner can handle all type of questions asked effectively and efficiently and a problem can occur for a person who did learn the answer of the question asked .

Last reason for my belief is , that in the field of research the knowledge is more important than the learned facts .
The scholars always tested on this parametre , for facts there are books inthe libarary for reference , internet to search but no option for understanding . , it is his ideas and concepts which help him to succed in life .

Finally i strongly support the statement that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
