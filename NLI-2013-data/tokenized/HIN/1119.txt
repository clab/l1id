It is my personal opinion that one should have a broad knowledge of several academic subjects till he attains a certain level of maturity , after which it makes perfect sense to specialize in one specific subject .
For instance , at the school level , it is very important to ensure that students have a balanced development by gaining broad knowledge of all major academic disciplines .
At the university level , however , students can start specializing in their chosen area of interest .
This specialization can be further narrowed down to a specific niche area as one progresses with his studies .
A preliminary knowledge of all subjects will make an individual a balanced human being , with the capacity to appreciate and understand all fields of study .
eg. a knowledge of basic mathematics will ensure that an arts major develops the capacity for logical reasoning whereas taking a few courses in music will make a physics major more receptive to the beauty of the fine arts .
A basic knowledge of all subjects would also help an individual to ascertain where his interests lie and enable him to select the discipline he would like to specialize in .
After a certain level , however , it would become necessary to specialize in a specific area of study .
This would give an individual an opportunity to cultivate his personal interests and would also give him the depth of knowledge required to get down to research work .
This would ultimately add to the knowledge bank in that particular area of study .

To summarize , I believe that a broad knowledge of many subjects is important to begin with , but for any real value addition to one 's personal academic pursuits as well as the discipline he studies , it is necessary that he specializes in it and gains in depth knowledge in that specific subject .
