Cars are somethings which were earlier considered as an luxious mode of transport .
but now a days they more convienient and necessary mode .
As time is changing may be the automobile company would have would have new options for the buyers .

I partially agree with the statment that in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there are today .
because india is still a developing country .
those who have develped successfully might have options .
india has to raise its economy .
there are people still staying at foot path .
according me yes may be we wont be able to see small cars like santro , zen etc during that time definately indian economy would have raised n people instead of using small cars would prefer to use big cars like benz or posh .
nowa days we r seeing increasing rates of petrol and disel .
people find it dificult to tarvel by autorishaws and cabs mainly because of heavy traffic and mort important things the attitude of the driver they easily have the habit to say no .
but if one has its own conveince he/she may travel easily .
but yes as i said earlier that india will be developed in the near future .
where ther r possibilties of having ones om chatered plane or other facility .
now a days price fare for the airline tickets too have gone down .
its become cheaper and now a days ther are many flights going daily internationly as well as domestic .
like recently i visted madras my family prefered going by plane because it saves time and ther was hardly differance in the cost .
now a days only peole are not having time for their personal comitments and that mens are replaced by machinery .
may be twenty year down the line robberts and other machinery would replace man .

According to me there would be difinately a change in the society less trafic more development on different mode of tranport .
which would be easily accessable .
