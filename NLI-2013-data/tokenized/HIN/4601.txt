Advertisements have such an important place in our lives .
As soon as you switch on the TV or the radio , you are bombarded with a weatlh of information on products ranging from basic necessities like food and water to household comodities like utensils to the extent of luxuries like cars .

But , do advertisements always potray the right information ?
In my opinion , advertisements are all about the hype and they seem to inflate the use of the product to the extent that it can harm an individual both physically and psychologically .
This is because the makers of the commercials are expected to be perfect in portraying the good qualities of the product that can bring huge profits to the company .
The negative points of the product are entirely missed and ignored until the consumer falls into the trap of `` buying the product '' .

One example of physical harm can come from the advertisement of say , an anti-depressant drug .
People see the advertisement that potrays information about how good the medicine is and how well it will take away depression from your life and at the same time not cause any harm .
The individual absorbs the information and if he/she keeps on having the medicine , it can ultimately cause harm and severe dependancy .

Another example can be given from a simple situation .
A girl who has curly and frizzy hair sees an advertisement of a shampoo that shows how curly hair can be transformed into smooth and silky hair .
When she uses the product , it fails to deliver results .
This can have a psychological impact in that she is made to beleive that she has bad hair that cannot be changed no matter what .

Therefore , I fully agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are and one has to use both common sense and personal judgement in analyzing the utility of the product or as they say `` Take them with a grain of salt '' .
