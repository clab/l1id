Whether one enjoys or not , depends mostly on the individuals definition of enjoyment .
If a person finds one work interesting , he/she will drive immense enjoyment in doing it , even though the same job might appear extremely drab to another person .

In order to do justice to the statement made here , we need to understand how the preferences of young and old people differ in terms of their activities .
This statement seems to be written by a young person who feels that his/her present pursuits of vibrant physical activities , adventures and long vacations spent in travelling to exciting destinations are his sole source of enjoyment .
Because he feels that he might not be able to do these things in advanced age , older age might be boring in all respects .

However looking from the perspective of an old person , having lived his/her younger life in constant activity , lot more enjoyment is found in doing the other kind of things .
These can be small little things like reading books , soaking sun in the garden , gardening , playing with children and the like .
We need to understand here that it is not that they have to do this , but because they choose to do this which in turn is simply because they enjoy doing it .

I am not generalising all the elder people as dormant personalities who indulge in less physical activities .
There are cases that one comes across in which people in old age resolve to do something very demanding in physical terms just because they could not do it when they were younger , and they feel that doing it would bring them lot of satisfaction and enjoyment .
Thereby we have stories of some 60-70 year old trying their hands at trekking or a cross-country run .

I agree that there can be cases where a person might become physically unfit to take up an activity that he would really want to .
This might happen more often in old age , but we need not forget that young people are not completely excluded from that .
There can be cases where people in young age are incapacitated in various aspects as well .
But even in such cases one will surely engage oneself in some activity that he/she might eventually end up enjoying a lot .

It is apt to mention here that enjoyment emanates from an initial emotion of accomplishment .
When one feels having made an accomplishment in any field , he/she starts ` enjoying ' it .

To conclude , I wish to reiterate that enjoyment and happiness are a state of mind and matter of personal choice rather than absolute entities .
Hence to say that criterion of age , sex , education , opportunities and the like will bar someone from ` enjoying ' , is not correct .
