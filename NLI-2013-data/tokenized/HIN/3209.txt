I agree to the statement that nowadays young people do not give enough time to help their communities .
There are various reasons for this .

First and foremost , the cut-throat compitition prevailing in the market forces the young generation to devote most of their time developing their own career and they are left with no time to concentrate on helping out their communities .

In addition to it , with the development of technology , there has been a numerous number of distractions that have cropped up in the market which , many a time , astrays the young blood to an undesirable path taking them away from what they ought to do .

But why , do we think , has this chage been seen in the new generation .
Are they at fault ?
Well , from my point of view , I think the system , which we term as ` society ' has led to this downfall .
Young people are not made aware of the importance of the cultural ethics and its in-grown values .
They are not subjected to the happiness and have not felt the tranquilty that one enjoys helping their community .

Young bloods are supposed to the part of the society which has always brought revolutions .
They are the one who have given birth to a new systems of governance by eradicating the ailing societies .
They are the most enthusiastic crowd who has the zeal to turn the society the way it want to .
But if they are not able to bring about changes or help thier communities , it is not solely their fault .
We need to re-think if we are concluding this decision .

Now it is high time to rejig the way , the thinking of the society has become .
If the young people are not able to extract time for helping their communities we need to find the answer to a very relevant question .
And the question is -- ` why ? '
.
Why are they not able to do it ?
Is the light of community work fading ?
Are they not able to find value in performing this job ?

If day we have these answers and the moment they start getting implemented , I think , my point of view will change .
