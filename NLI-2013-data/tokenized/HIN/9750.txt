it is the basic tendency or nature of all human beings to explore things around them .
although the amount a person explore things and take risk may vary from person to person as it depends on the opportunity and situation of a person .
i strongly agree with the statement that successful people try out new things and take rsiks more frequently than doing what they already learned .
i feel this way due to several reasons .

i think , successful people have more resourses like capital , labour etc. to experiment with new things .
thay do not have the fear to loose .
plenty of resources encourage them to explore things more .
for instance , a famous businessman Mr. Anil Ambani , who is among the most affluent people of india , is frequently engaged in investing huge amount of capital in bringing new stratigies , products and ideas to the market .
i think that as he has enough money to experiment , he is ready to bear the risks involved in it .
eventhough if he looses even a part of it , will not make a big difference in him .
thus in my opinion , more resources means more opportunity to experiment and bear the risk .

furthermore , i believe that successful people are more intelligent and hard working .
they are successful as others have valued them for the hard work and intelligence .
so they can utilize their knowledge in a more constructive way .
they can apply knowledge wisely and reduce the amount of risk involved in it .
in this way such people can explore more things without loosing much .

i also believe in an adage that `` necessity is the mother of invention '' . many times it is found that a person discover things due to their need .
like the primitive men invented fire .
hence some successful people may try to discover thing which they need .
in additon to this , they believe less in doing the things they have already learned , as they will not be able to bring anything new to their country .

in the nutshell , the successful people experiment more as they have more knowledge and resouces to minimize the risk involved in carryout any work .
