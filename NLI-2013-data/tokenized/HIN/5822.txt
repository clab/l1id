The best and most popular mode of trivelling today is a car .
You can reach any where at your own time schedule with the help of a car .
It does overcome some of the disadvantages of other systems such as bus , Train etc .
To trivel by Train or Bus we have to go by their schedule , and they can be used to reach only specific locations .
But the future is not so good for the cars .

I agree with the statement that twenty years from now thier will be ferwer cars than today .
Cars require fuel to run .
Today the fuel used is mainly Petroleium or Natural Gas in the form of LPG or CNG .
These are fossile fuels and they are non renewable , so they will tend to decrease over the time .
The supply of these fuels will decrease over the time .
so they will become more expensive to afford by normal people .
As a result number of car owners will decrease .

Cars make lot of polution which is responsible for various health and environment related problems such as global worming or lung cancer .
The problems related to the cars are all related to the fuel they are using .
So if we can get the alternate energy souce to run a car then it may have the bright future and we can see more cars than ever in next 20 years .

The alternative energy souce for this fossile fuels is solar energy , or Fuel cells , which use hydrogen as their fuel .
The problem with use of Fuel cells is that it requires carring hidrogen along with the car .
Hidrogen is very explosive if it is exposed to atmosphere , so carring hidrogen along with the car is like sitting on a bomb .
As far as other option goes , there are very few cars which run on solar energy today , this is mainly because these cars are expensive .
But as the technology grows these cars may be affordable and can be available for use for resonable price .

The other point that we should note that world is going towards globalization .
It means increase in the competition .
So people will require faster routes to trivel .
Todays cars are limited in speed not only due to the car itself but due to over crowding of cars , remember the time we spent in trafic .
so in order to promote the car in future one need to see to these issues as well .
Answering all these questions will shape the future of cars .
So twenty years from now , if we see cars in musiums or on roads in day today life will depend on all these issues .
