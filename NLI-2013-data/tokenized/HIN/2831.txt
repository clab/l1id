`` youth is blunder , manhood is struggle , oldage an regent ''

This quatation do realy set out view towards essay .
I think older people can enjoy their life more then the youngs one .
For me age doesnt matter much when it come to the enjoyment of life .
Each thing that young man can do , so can old man too .
The following essay will clear out my point of view

Firstly , the experience the old person have , for me the experience is the mother of wisdom , so if your more wise more easily you can overcome the hindrance in your life .
Old people are more aware of the outcome of the life , the phases of their life which they have beenpass through .
yes i do agree that young person do have more agility , fitness then old man do , but if an old person have kept hin fit by various exercise then he can also be like current youth

Secondly , the way you consider the enjoyment .
If the young person thing the enjoyment in life is going to pubs , disco , then way could not the oldperson can go towards this place .
what majorly differ in young an old preson is their age limit and age effecting their ability , but I do not think age can be related to the enjoyment .
old person do enjoy their life by their own way a way which would never leads to no dilemma occur in their life .
Each step of the old person in the life would be an well calculated , well organized one

Lastly , `` old is better than gold '' and realy for me the gold is an ejoyment in the sense that money value of the gold , for me money is the main source of enjoyment and old is better then gold then way not the oldperson can enjoy more life then the young youths do .
