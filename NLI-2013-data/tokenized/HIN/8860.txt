Secondly , facts do provide better explanation but they cant reason the phenomen or the act they might have occured .
The ideas and concept provide a logical explation they have given many managemant theories which have lead to the drastic changes and many helpful jobs .

The strengths of the ideas and fact cannot be neglected but the facts do play a important role its the facts which enables those theories to go forward and to be more effective .
