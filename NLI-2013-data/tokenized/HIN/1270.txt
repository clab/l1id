I totally disagree with the given statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in many subject for many reasons .
Because in that case one loses his interest about one particular subject , loses his mastery skills , and worst of all he wo n't get a good position in his job .

To start with , one has to develop interest to get a good hold about a subject but when the student has to do mastery in all his subject than it puts extra demand on his mental as well as physical status .
This in turn consumes all his energy and then make him more lethargic towards his field .
Sooner he will lose interst and won , t concentrate in studies .
This can affect the grades .

Secondly I strongly believe that a student ca n't get mastery on all subjects .
Ther are some limitation on all human beings , in terms of cognitive abilities , the memory and learning part .
It will be very rude on our part to strain the student with so much of difficult task .
We can always adapt to something simpler and make life more beautiful .
Its fare enough to be master of one subject .

The third and the most important arguement is if a student has not done specialization in one particular subject then he may lose the oppurtunity of getting a good job because nowadays businesses look for skilled individual .
That will be a great loss on his monetary part which indeed is an important commodity .
After all we all study to earn good money for ourself and our family and make a bright future .

However , one cannot deny the good side of this issue , that is one may sound fool when a person don , t have a good background about a particular issue other than is special subject , especially in a friend circle or while teaching lessons to the student but I feel that The advantages of mastery outweighs the drawbacks .

So I believe its good to do mastery than gaining knowledge of everything as I don , t like to be jack of all and master of none .
I don , t want to lose interest and neither a good job .
