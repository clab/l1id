I disagree with the statement and believe that specializing in one specific subject and being a master of that area is much better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

In today 's complex world , each field or subject has become so complex that it requires more than a lifetime of dedicated effort to master that subject .
Unless one gives that effort , his knowledge about that field remains only superficial .

Specilization leads on to new frontiers .
Unless we have specialists in various fields , it will be very difficult to come up with new discoveries and inventions .
Each academic field has become so complex , it his highly improbable for a generalist today to come out with something new unless aided by chance or luck .

Specialization also leads to confidence in one 's personality .
If somebody is a specialist in his field , that person can be trusted to do that thing better than most people .
He can be expected to take responsibility related to that field , so that other people can focus on their own specialist fields .

Since a specialist is a master of his domain , he can pass on that information gained by investing time in one particular thing to the next generation .
A generalist wont have the depth and would not be appreciated by his audience when he talks about any of his various known topics .

There is no course in the world which gives degrees to students for having studied about 20 different fields .
All the degrees offered by colleges all over the world focus on one or two areas of specialization .
This itself proves the worth of specialization viz a viz general knowledge about various academic fields .

If one looks around , almost all the successful people are masters in their domain .
They know about one subject in detail and hence gain respect from their peers .
Even a generalist post like the President of India is occupied today by a scientist who helped the country further its satellite program .

There is a saying which goes like : `` Jack of all trades , and master of none '' .
Unless we change it to `` Master on one '' or `` Master of some '' , it will continue to remain derogatory in its usage .
