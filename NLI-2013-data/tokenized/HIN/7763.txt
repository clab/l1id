I certainly agree that travelling in a group with a tour guide is the best option .
Travelling outside of the place where you live is one of the most exiting and enjoyable things to do in most peoples lives .
People tend to take vacations to get away from the rigours of daily life .
Most people would certainly like to go alone or with an individual family if the choice existed .
However most places that people consider are far away and exotic in nature , not to ignore the fact that they could be dangerous too .
Take for example the Bali in Indonesia .
The recent terrorist strike in Bali killed a lot of people , mostly vacationeers .

Going in a group offers a lot of benifits to a traveller .
Most airlines and hotels offer group booking discounts as well as preferential service .
Travelling in a group also makes you feel secure rather than travelling alone .
Travelling in groups would be specially advantageous to people with kids as I believe kids are better behaved and more entertained when they are in a group .
Going in a group with a tour guide would also help people with disabilities .
Also , why do something when you can have someone do it for you ?
This is the type of question most people would ask when going out on a trip .
Instead of spending time and researching about a particular destination , it would be better to employ a local expert ( tour guide ) to guide you to the right places and explain the history and culture of that particular place .
A tour guide would also be helpful incase there is an emergency and you might need to contact the local authorities or need any kind of help .
Also with their experience most tour guides are able to guide us to the right spots and destinations , making the most of our vacation .
