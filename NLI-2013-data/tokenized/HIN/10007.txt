I agree with this statement .
Here is my explanation why and how I beleive so .
Successful people do not quantify their success by where they currently are in their lives .
They constantly strive to acheive more than what is normally possible .
They have a desire to constantly excel and acheive a higher level at anything they do .
Once the next level is reached that does not satisfy them , they continue to charge along to the next possible level .
Often times this involves taking risks in situation that has never been either tried or known .
These individually have a special knack of pushing the bar to the next level and changing ` status quo ' .
This does not mean they do not fail but they do not take failure to be the end .
They are quick learners and are able to adapt and identify new ways to approach a tough problem .

One key characterisitc of a successful person is that they are innovators .
There are world-wide examples of innovators like Thomas Edison , Bill Gates etc .
They are never afraids to venture in to the unknown or take risks .
And because they do so they are often goal-driven and do not give up until they get to a solution .
This allows them to develop and test new concepts by mastering the well known ones .
They understand the difference between doing things well versus exceptional .
Their ` out of the box ' ideas provides them the opportunities to create solutions that others would not think of .
But it is not just the thoughts of great ideas , it 's their ability to work dilegently and having the tenacity to survive all odds to execute on those ideas that helps them produce results .
This is what differentiates them from others .

Successful people do not think their current place in life defines their future .
They know being successful in life means staying in the game , never giving-up and treating it as a marathon not a race !
