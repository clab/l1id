There are more automobiles on the face of the planet today than any time in the history .
And the number is increasing at an alarming rate .
The growing economies of the Asian giants , China & India , are increasing with an average rate of 8 % per annum .
There are more white collar and blue collar jobs in these countries than ever .
THis is bringing more money than ever to the people of the continent , and a car is not an exclusive luxury , not as exclusive as it used to be anyway .
In India , since the almost full disposal of the red-tape , over 20 major car-manufacturors have set up producing plants all over the country .
In the past 13 years only , the number of cars in the country has rose by over 400 % to about 29 million .
According to certain researches , by 2025 , over 270 million Indians and 390 million chinese would be able to afford to have a car .

In the developed world , there are alternate modes of transport , both public and private , that whilst being energy efficient are also enviornment friendly .
In the Third World countries though such modes of transport are not readily available .
Also there is the lack of a viable transport infrastructure in these countries .
Maybe in a few decades , as the infrastructure improves , people will take to using public transport .
But on the other hand , it 's also possible that with the improving economies they 'd be able to afford a personal car too .

The rising price of oil and natural gas is driving the world towards finding and developing alternative fuel resources , but it is n't still discouraging people to give up the comfort of personal cars .
Corporations and businesses in America for instance advice their employees to ` Carpool ' .
Although this means that there are fewer number of cars on the roads during rush-hours , it does n't in anyway imply that those people donot have a car parked in their garage .

I strongly believe that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .
