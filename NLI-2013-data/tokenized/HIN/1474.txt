I disagree to the statement which promotes having better knowledge in many subjects than to specialize in a specific one .
The famous quote `` Jack of all trades and master on none '' very appropriately supports my opinion .
Yes , nature has made everone equal and their is no difference whatsoever in our capabilties .
What however distinguishes one man from another , are his qualities & deeds .
Although god has gifted us all with similar capabities , he has also blessed us with different interests & talents .

I believe that one must specialize in a specific subject to form his own identity .
Today 's soceity is appreciative of selectively skilled personelle , who add to the growing global economy .
A highly skilled person is welcomed to relocate in most developed countries .
This leads to upgradation of class & pay .

Such skilled perons take back to their country additional waetl What one person could achieve effortlessly could be another 's nightmare .
This difference may not be only attributed to skill .
Interest in a particular activity substantialy makes the person more keen & happier to do a job .
This keeps the pressure off him and makes his achieve to the best of abilty .

Imagine a world with no specialists .
Do we settle for opinions about a fracture from an orthopedic surgeon or would we take a general physician 's word as final for it ?
Would a plumber be as good if he fixed your electrical fittings as well ?
Am sure the answer would be `` no '' .

Being a doctor , I have read through vast syllabi of Human anatomy , Physiology & biochemistry , about the basis of pharmacology , pathology , medicine , surgery and gynecology .
Though a broad knowledge of all these subjects has helped me understand the basis of origins and functioning of various body systems & their anamolies , I would consider my education incomplete without the specializaton in a particular branch .
We all have unique interests and it is impertive to take up one in order to thrieve in the todays ' highly competetive work environment , where merely having a broad knwoledge is considered a basic skill and we compete with work force trained in specific tasks .

A person 's interest in a specific field keeps the drive to achieve higher & specialize in his subject of interest .
