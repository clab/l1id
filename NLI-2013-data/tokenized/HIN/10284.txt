no i do not agree bcoz when an man is sucessful he would be busy with his own duty .
he would try to go to higher heights in his own field rather than thinking of doing another things in his life for an example an normal software engineer with an salary of 10000 rs would ty to get an job which is higher than that , or else he would try to open an software company of is own .
he would never think of opening an bakery and sit in it .
it also depends on ones own mentality some people do multiple jobs in there life and fail in the race of life .
also an man doing multiple jobs in his life would suceed in his life within an short period of time but has to face many problems in life and taking to the person doing single job would suceed in life after an long time in an safe manner .
there would be no do 's and dont 's in his life if a man plans in an good manner then he would get the sucess in short period of time , so planing is the must
