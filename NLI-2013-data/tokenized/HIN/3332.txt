Youth is the power of a nation .
A nation 's progress rely majorly on the performance and contribution of its youth .
A youth , today , has multiple task to handle .
I believe , most of the young people are under the pressure of perfoming the best .
This pressure drives them away from their responsibilties .
They are more focussed on self advancement .
This focus takes them very far from their source .
Therefore , young people do not give enough time to help their communities .

I am a student and currently pursuing my engineering degree in biotechnology .
This course demands greater devotion and dedication towards the studies .
I have to attend college , do projects after college and also participate in various events taking place in my college .
All these responsibilties does not give me enough time as free .
Thus , I fail to give a helping hand to my community .

Youth is the time of life where one is brimming with energy and enthusiasm of moving ahead in life .
If this energy will not be manifested to work towards one 's goal then , one 's dream would never be fulfilled .
Helping and serving the community could happen at any time of life .
But this golden period of youth will never come back again .

A nation 's progress will uplift if it has youth who are contributing their best in every field .
Take the example of Sania Mirza who entered the field of lawn tennis in her teen-age .
Her devotion and dedication towards her game made her popular in the entire world of lawn tennis .
This also lead to the popularity of our country .
In other words , she was like an ambassador of India .

Sachin Tendulkar entered cricket when he was nearly 18 years old .
He made himself and his country proud by his hard work and dedication .
So , we see that in order to go ahead in life one has to harness energy in one 's field of interest .
This would eventually require one to give the maximum time to one 's work .
But this does not mean that one should not give time to help communities .
This can be done when one is settled in life .
Then the contribution would be much more and it would be more meaningful.i.e. one can help his community financially , in person or in any other way which is possible .
