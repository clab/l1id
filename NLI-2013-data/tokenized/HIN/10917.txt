The question being asked wheather successful people should try new things and take risks or they should keep on doing what they already know and what they already do .
This is an interesting topic since it is related with risk-taking by the people .
In my opinion , i believe that people should try new things and try to take risks if they can .

I think , If we do some thing for a long time than we would already improve that skills and we would get bore of doing one thing again and again .
And being a successful person there would be less chances of loss .
Or if there might any loss occured than it will not affect that person business much more .
And , if we would do some different things it can be good as far as change is concerned .
If we have capability to take risks and to improve ourself than there is nothing wrong in taking risks .

I am a pharmacist , So being a pharmacist i believe in research and development .
And in research and development i try to innovate more and more useful drugs which have low side effects and have high margin of safety .
And for that purpose i believe in taking risk in changing already existing formula of any perticular formulation or drug .
Which can help me to invent new drug which is more advantageous than the existing drug .
So , according to me , we should keep on trying to do new thing apart from what we do in our day to day curriculum .

Furthermore , i thing , during present time where each and every person try to gain more and more knowledge as compared to others .
And for this everyone has to take more chances to improve his skills and to become better than others .
For example , if some one would not have taken risk of developing Atomic bomb than we would not have been aware of that .

In conclusion , i have shown that successful person should try new things and take risks .
Since without risks , there will not be any development .
