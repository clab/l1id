Young people nowadays do not give anough time to helping their communities .
I agree with this statement in all totality .
The scenario is reflected in the world today .
How many people do you see picking up litter ?
How many people do you see helping the proverbial old lady across the street ?

A community comprises of like-minded people constantly interacting with each other .
It needs caring , grooming and regular maintainence which can only be achieved by devoting time to it .
Young people have to divert time to step out and help their community .

In today 's competitive world , everybody watches his own .
In the race to success , people have become too busy digging for gold in their own backyard than stepping out and helping a neighbour mow his lawn , or maybe participate in a neighbourhood charity .
In a study , it turns out that the number of students appearing for government positions are steadily decreasing .
This is a striking contrast to the yester-years when young people were proud joining the social service for the betterment of their community .

A community is a powerhouse of moral values and improvement of quality of life .
A considerable amount of time has to be invested in it to provide fruitfull results .
Young people have to nurture the community and make it a better place for children and future members .

Young people have to realize that their community is analogous to their family .
Just as spending time with family improves the quality of life at home , similarly spending time in your community improves the quality of life outside .
A place where we watch each other 's back and help out in times of need is the place we have to strive for .
There will be no transition when we step out of our doors and only young people can make it happen .
