A biggest characterstic of a sucessful person is tenasity , which means not to give up .
This characterstic plays a major roll in the time of troublesome situations to try out the new things and taking the risc for betterment .

Trying new things and taking risk makes person more strong and strength to face any situation .
And also helps to improve the knowldge in different fields .
Whereas doing the things what they already know can lead them to improve knowldge in same field .

I agree with the point that successful person try new things and take risks rather only doing the things they know .
In my life I have seen many examples of it .
One of it was - my friend who had a electonic shop in patnership with one of his friends , they earned nicely .
But once they had a big loss and saparated .
My friend didnt give up and tried to do bussiness in some other field and started new bussiness of transport and became successful in his carrier .

Same time his friend used same shop and still is in same condition .
The moral is not to give up and take risk and try new things which improves knowlde and gives an idea to start newly with intreast .

I believe doing the things already which we know makes us unaware of other fields and decereases the motivation level of work .
Trying and doing same attempts to improve in carrier can reducess the intrest to work .

I want to conclude stating that it depends on the person toperson and their choice what they want to do and what is best for them .
