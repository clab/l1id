I do agree with the statement but with a few reservations , regarding exeptions .
Young people these days are being more occupied with their priority , with this i mean , clearly , helping their communities is not their priority .

Why are the priority changing ?
A mother telling his ten year old child , not to let anybody use his geomatry box .
Their indeed is a need to think , where and whats going wrong .
achild who is being constantly tought to be selfish cannot be expected to grow upto a responcible citizen .
If not solely , the way the children are being brought up , is the responcible factor .

With the increasing compitition in every field of life , and a constant reminder to win the world , is exerting immence pressure on todays 's generation , this is leads to lack of time , for the child to think of waht should he be actually doing .

Exposure to the world through the advancements in the media and other sources , are giving a bigger picture of life to the children .
with this they are able to locate where do they stand .
There can be two ways a child takes it , eighter as a motivation or facination .
It is here that i justify my reservation in supporting the sentence .
There are children who are motivated to help their communities , by understanding their problems through comparision with what they have learnt from the advanced media .
on the other hand the youngsters who are facinated , which majority of them are , end up doing nothing for their community and the society at large .
They tend to run towars what is facinating and forget what they aught to do .

To conclude , i would say that the majority of youngsters do not have a strong eternal desire to do something for their community , nor do they feel responcible towards it .
May it be because of the way they are being brough up .
of the way they want to be .
But some are striving to man
