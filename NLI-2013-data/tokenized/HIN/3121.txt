The statement here states that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I believe this depends on how you percieve life as .
Everyone has his own opinion about life .
According to me young people enjoy life more than old people do .
We will discuss more on this in the following passages .

Firstly , young people have an advantage of their age to do a lot of things that old people are restricted to .
When you are young your body is more flexible and supportive to get moulded in any kind of conditions .
And you can work as hard as you can , you can go for night outs at college or at work , you can stretch your working schedule as much as you want but the same is not true with old people .
In old age your body becomes weak and unsupportive to harsh conditions .
A classic example would be life at college campus .
Young students are seen to be pro-active in studies as well as in extra-curricular activities .
They tend to enjoy a lot , do a lot of things in a lesser time and at a faster pace .
Old people cannot do this kind of work at their age .

Secondly , when you are young you have so many things unexplored in life which keeps you enthusiastic and interested in life .
So as young people work harder and achieve their goals and experiences in life they get a lot of satisfaction and hence a lot of enjoyment .
Apart from work the youngsters are also keen towards love and romance in life which plays a major role in enjoying life with a partner .
Even the body at young age is very good for romancing and enjoying .

Lastly , though old people are usually settled and have a quite good money to spend they can enjoy a lot of wealthy things .
They also have a lot of leisure time to spend and enjoy life .
But since body basics are not the same as young age and they do n't have much to do in life because of many restrictions such as health problems or some disease or problems like cannot exert body much and so they cannnot enjoy life much .

To sum it up , young people see and experience a lot many things in life than the old people at their stage , as old people had already went through these stages and does not have much to do .

Young people have a lot of freedom and interest in doing things .
So as per the views and examples expressed above I believe young people enjoy life more than old people do .
