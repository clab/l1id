Well , according to me it depends on the real time situation .
Sometimes its better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one subject .
For example to make a living a person should be able to adapt himself in any kind of working atmosphere .
Suppose , Mr.X has done his graduation in say , chemical engineering , it does'nt guarntee him a job in chemical or any related industry cause its hard to get a job in the chemical industry as the number of employees required are fewer compared to the It industry .
If Mr.X has learnt basics about computer , which is usually thought in undergraduation school , then his chance of getting a job in a IT industry is more compared to chemical .
IT industry do require chemical engineers to deal with the clients related to chemical background and he can do a great job in understanding the problems of the client .
So , his broad knowledge about all his academics subject can get him a job .

One more example , lets talk about a paediatrician , a person ( doctor ) specialized to treat children problems .
Well he is much more familiar to diseases of a child than a grown up .
Suppose , he is travelling in a train , and suddenly there 's some problem to an accompaning passenger who is a grown up/elder person .
As a doctor his duty is to look at the problem of the person rather than saying i 'm a child specialist .
At this instance of time a broad knowledge on his academic subjects could help give a immediate initial remedy to the person before he is taken to a hospital .

At times you need to have specialization in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge about all his academic subjects .
For example a person specialized in nuclear engineering and working in a nuclear power plant .
Well , its a must to have a specialization in that one subject subject rather than having a broad knowledge about his other academic subjects like sugar technology , petroleum engg .. , etc. , Because he is responsible for the processes going on in the plant , and any problem can cause great havoc .
At this situation its worth to have a specialization in one subject .

I , conclude by saying that it really depends on the job , the atmosphere one is working into have specialization in one subject or to have broad knowledge of many subjects .
