Communities builds future of the nation by nurturing youth of today .
I believe no human being would disagree with the above statement .
Whatever we are or whatever becomes of a person depends largely on the community that he belongs too .
Today 's youth is aware of the above fact and people always tend to make the reason of your survival better .
Thus , I do not agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

Young people of today are more responsible .
They understand the importance of community and thus consider its betterment their moral responsibility .
They are aware that communities are essential because man is a social animal and he needs support from his peers to survive .

They are more enthusiastic and work towards it .
The young people have much more caliber to plan and perform well as compared to elderly people in much less amount of time .
I work in a corporation where the maximum population is in their twenties .
We have so many groups that are functioning to helping the community .
These used to be an individual effort which turned into an organisation after recieving overwhelming response from the youngsters .
Now they consist not only people from our corporation but also from whole of the state .
The one i am with , works for the special care of mentally or physically challenged children named as DISHA .
Yes it consist of middle age people too but we are never short of young volunteers who like to help .

The NGO 's or non profit organisations are not the only way they are helping community .
Politics is a field where no youngster wants to end up ; specifically in a country like India .
But we have young MP 's ( member of parliament ) like Milind Deora and Sachin Pilot who at an tender age of 23-24 are helping people and trying to give a better future to our communites .

Young people are now diverted towards teaching too may it be part time .
Imparting education to the generations of tommorow is indeed a spendid way of helping the society .
Young people do whatever work they have to their full capacity which results in betterment of society .
Even investing in share market helps in betterment of the society because the money flows in the market resulting in more funds for government maybe for schools or even hospitals .

Yes i do agree today 's generation is more busy with their own life .
They do not find time for their families sometimes but i would rather say exceptions are always there .
But that does not mean that the young people are indifferent towards the community .
People in our organisation work on saturdays and sundays , sometimes during some function we even work late nights because we believe children who are yet to come need a better community as we got in our childhood .

Summing up i would state today 's youth is aware of its responsibilities towards the community .
They understand the importance of community and thus consider its betterment their moral responsibility .
Even if they do not have enough time some people would plan out and work actively in organizations for the betterment of the people .
And we would soon realize that today 's youth faces more responsibility than just being a fast forward generation .
