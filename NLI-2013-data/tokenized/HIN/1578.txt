The belief of having broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific one is incorrect I strongly believe that specializing one subject is more appropriate than knowing entire knowledge base .
If you want to sail in two boats you are sure to fall .
There many advantages to this belief .
such as a person has will remmember that easily ,, concentrate in it , he can manage it with ease .

Firstly he can remmember the specialized subject .
The other way to say this statement would be he would not forget easily .
As there is only subject to learn .
He can learn it more thouroghly in depth .
For example if a person is learning three classes for three languages i.e he is learning french , chineese , Spanish .
And a person learning only Spanish this person will be able learn spanish more rapidly and the other person will not only get confused with all three languages to learn he will also forget it very soon

Secondly He can concentrate on one single subject .
As there is only one subject to read he can concentrate on and gain expertise in it get a good job with a fat salaryhave ever heard of a person doing PHD in more than one suject at time i no you havent heard .

Thirdly if can management will be easier .
if forexample if campany like Micrsoft starts producing Shoes , grocery items they will have lots of difficulties in managing their productline this may causes huge losses .
This means that Microsoft should concentrate only in Software business which he is the leader .
This Will make their company to prosper m

Atlast i say Strong know how in one specific subject will be a boon for that person .
As we all know partial knowledge is always dangerous .
