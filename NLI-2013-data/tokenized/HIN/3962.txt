In this flat world , which has seen some great advancements made in the last decade , things have changed rapidly .
The world has gotten competetive and everyone is trying to outdo others and grow at a faster pace .
Work hours have gotten longer , and people have little or no time even for themselves and their families .
if you ca n't stand out , you are left behind , and no one wants to be left behind .
Things are very different today than they were , say , 50 years ago when people took up one job , and were happy to work for the same company for the rest of their lives .
It not like things were very easy back then , but they were nothing like what is going on in the world at the moment .

Today 's youngster knows that in this ever changing world , if he does n't outperform himself everytime , he will be outdated before he even knows about it .
This change in lifestyles and work enviroment has added lot of stress and pressure on todays youth .
However , I do not believe that this means that the young people today are not giving back enough to their comunity .
They may be short of time , but they try to make up for in different way .

There are NGOs where people like to donate part of their weekends , so that they can work with the poor and the deprived .
There are people who make up for this lack of time by donating money to efforts that they believe in .
Bill Gates , world 's richest man , is relatively young , and one of the biggest philanthrophists the world has seen .
He has pledged his wealth for various causes , and his wife runs a foundation that tries to help out with various problems in third world and developing countries .
A lot of Indian/Chinese expatriates , living in the US , are young and successful .
They probably have not been able to spend enough time for their comunities back home .
But does that mean , that their contribution to the society is nothing ?
Besides obvious things like sending money back to India/China ( which can be used for the welfare of the community ) , they have helped develop an image for the country , as that of a nation full of talented and hardworking people , which has played an important part in taking their country to the next level in this competitve world .
Thus even though they did not spend a lot of visible time helping their community , it was the fruit of their labor that the community and country bore .

To summarize , I would say that even if the generation of today does not have enough time on hands , however , they have done a lot for their communities .
Their contribution goes a long way in changing the shpe of the world we are currently living in .
