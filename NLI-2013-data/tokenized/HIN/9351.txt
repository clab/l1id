I am in complete agreement with the given statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .

Ideas and concepts are very important and they act the source of general conscience in human being .
I feel so because understanding ideas and concepts is far more important than just learning facts only .
If a student is clear about the concept and idea behind a phenomenon than it will hardly take a second to learn the fact .
It is concepts and ideas that give rise to facts or one can say that fact is denouement of ideas and concepts .
To clearly undersatnd take an example of `` falling of a hurling ball on the ground '' .
This falling of a ball on ground is a fact but the force of gravity and the phenomenon of gravitation comes under ideas and concepts behind this fact .
So just learning that a hurling ball falls on ground is trivial as compared to the concept of gravitation .

Also learning facts does not count to intelligentia , one shuld have logical thinking and innovative ideas to get success in any field .
Logical thinking is the path to success .
And logical thinking develops only when one think innovative ideas or mere ideas , So one should think newer and newer ideas to solve a problem .
Thinking innovative ideas leads to logical thinking and reasoning .
As everybody is familier with the milieu of competition , so to survive and compete in this competitive environment the students shoould be ancouraged

The students should be encouraged to go for understanding of ideas and concepts instead of learning of facts only .
If the students are good then the institute will also succeed and definitely the country too .
So to make future generations better and competitive the students should be encouraged to understand ideas and concepts rather than mere facts only .
