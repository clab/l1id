Chancing opon this issue reminds me of a literary character that we are all probably familiar with ; Private Quelch , in the short story ` The man who knew too much ' .
A characterer that epitomizes the issue at hand for Private Quelch was an over-knowledgeable army serviceman who found himself in dire situations because of his blatant exhibition of that knowledge .
The story potrayed to us what becomes of a man wih too much knowledge but hardly any concept of how to use it .
Quelch found that he always dragged himself too deep into unpleasant situations , pompously armed with just his knowledge .

It is of no doubt then that I completely agree with the idea that it is vital for us to understand ideas and concepts than it is to merely mug facts .
Being in the third year of engineering , I have millions of firm reasons to believe that plain bookish knowledge can only get us so far .
After that it is the clarity that we have in our concepts and our developed understanding that help us proceed .
And when it comes to students , boy , they sure need to have thier fundamentals clear and precise !

A student who just mugs up books , and merely ` vomits out ' all the stored information onto his papers , might do well in a few cases , but when it comes to higher learning , the student will need to adapt to understanding or his knowledge is simply wasted .
Questions of application can never be answered by such a student .

Learning facts is probably what would be beneficial to students in a general knowledge quiz , but it is defintely not something that should be completely overlooked .
After all , what good are concepts when one simply cannot remember the facts they were made to explain ?
Can a student ace his exams by just keeping his concepts crystal clear ?
Will he not need some facts hidden in the recesses of his brains o refer in different circumstances ?
Facts like formulae , values , constants and exceptions .
He will most certainly need those facts to help with his everyday studies .

Nowadays , even the internet provides students with an unlimited resource of information .
It is upto the students then , to properly sift through all that immeasurable amount of knowledge , and extract concepts and maerials that is actually practical for him or her to know .

So what a student should not do , is to mechanically rote subjects .
He 'll never reach too far if he does only that .
He should have an appropriate combination of facts and fundamentals , with ideas and fundamentals taking much higher priority .
Trivial facts can mostly be referred from ready-reckoners while others may need to be stored in our brains .

Hence , the adage ` Knowledge is Power ' is hardly true .
Wisdom of how to apply that knowledge correctly , is probably what power mostly comprises of .
We might all end up like Private Quelch otherwise !
