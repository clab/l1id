I agree with the statement that the number of cars in use will be reduced twenty years from now .
Automobiles definetely has brought a drastic change in the way people use to travel before .
The cars especialy have added a lot of comfort and pleasure to the people 's lives .
With cars available at a cost , affordable to most of the people the number has increased drastically & will even increase in future as well .

This increase in the number of cars tend to create traffic jams , which is the most common site especially in an over populated country like india .
So when the roads are blocked due to innumerable number of vehicles , it is obvious that it takes long time to reach your destination & if this becomes the daily routine it vexes the people , so they ultimately look for alternate modes of transport , like the trains or other means of public transport .
The trains & the other transport systems definetely reach earlier & also spare the driver from the stress he encouters while driving on his own on the busy streets .
These factors definetely encourage him to use trains more often & use his car less .

With increase in travelling time , people also tend to stay in houses closer to work place , so that they can walk over the distance rather than to fight the traffic with the cars .

With increasing awareness regarding the hazards of air pollution & the effect it has on health of humans , the people twenty years from now i think will be much more sensible and use less number of cars to keep the earth 's environment cleaner & safer for future generations to come .
