I disagree with the points made above that having knowledge of all the things is better compared to having the knowledge of one specific field .
As it is said it is better to be the master of one thing rather than jacks of all trades .

i have different resons for counteract it .
Take example for the following cases :

1. if the above fact would have been true then in university there would be no any specialization of any subjects and all the students would opt for all the subjects. but in the current sceniro this is not applicable in any part of the world which itself is a evidence of the effectiveness of the above logic .

2. take the example in the medicine field. as times goes on new and new diseases is affecting the mankind. in this situation only the person who has experienced in the corresponding field can go for the research for the curement for that disease by the means of biotechnology and will ultimately lands up with some specific kind of solution .

3. take the example of the engineering field. how can we suppose to think that a person who has no experince in civil and in construction will be able to make a dam for the society . if he will go for this perpose the govt. will itself not allow that person to build it. even if by any means he is able to penetrate through all the hurdles then in that situation he can not give the guarntee about the dam which he built .

So taking the above examples and facts one could easily conclude that for the betterment of society one has to undergo specialization which itself leads to the betterment for himself .
