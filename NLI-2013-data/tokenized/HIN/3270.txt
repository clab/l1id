The given statement is a cynical and skeptic comment which is thrown at every generation .
I can say with great pride that my generation can annul this cynicism in a number of different ways .

In my own university we have a number of different activities through which we can contribute to our communitity .
All these activities come under the banner of what is called the National Service Scheme or NSS for short .
I myself am a volunteer of this organisation and thus vehemently oppose the given statement .

There is a wide range of ways in which we volunteers contribute to our community .
Every six months we organize a blood donation camp in our university in which students , faculty as well as people living close to the university come in great numbers to donate their blood .
Recently , I was also part of a successful project to assist the gardeners in improving the condition of trees in our campus .
Every alternate day around thirty students would spend the evenings watering the existing trees , pruning them , removing weeds and also planting new trees .
We even managed to arrange for a water tanker to accompany us , thus saving the burden of carrying buckets all over the campus .
Our efforts over the past semester have paid off and the gardeners have now indicated that extra help is not required as the overall condition of trees has improved .

Other students who enjoy teaching have taken up a project in which they devote part of their time to interact with and teach blind children in a blind school in our city .

The people who lament the decrease in such social activities among the youth should make a closer examination which will reveal that the youth social organisations are alive and flourishing .
Some of the graduates from my university have taken this community service to the next level by adopting it as their profession .
This has manifested itself in the form of Non Governmental Organisations which are non-profit organisations whose aim is improving some aspect of society .
NGOs can work towards providing safe drinking water to villages to working for the betterment of the lives of the elderly .
Young people with a passion for changing their societies are forming such organisations and are doing great wonders for their communities .
