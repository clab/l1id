I completely agree with the statement that `` It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''
Having a broad knowlege of many subjects will give a lot of exposure , new subjects will create interests and also provide better career prospects for students .

Students will gain a lot of exposure by studying many different subjects .
This will also prepare them to take classes in different departments .
I personaly feel that this is a very good option as this will make them interact with other students coming from different backgrounds as well gain valuable knowledge .

Moreover , studying a wide variety of subjects will help students develop new interests that they might eventually take up and make a career of it .
Let me support this with an example .

While I was studying `` Architecture '' we were asked to take a wide variety of subjects like Interior Design , Lanscaping , Theory of Structures , Humanities and History of Architecture .
While studying these subjects i developed a lot of interest in the subject of `` History of Architecture '' which eventually i went on to make a career in it .
Today I am working with the `` National Heritage Conservation Committee '' as a architect guiding the govenment about the various teachniques and means to protect the heritage and historical monuments .

Lastly this also creates better career prospects for students as a lot of prospective employers and firms want to recruit people who have a broad knowledge about a lot of subjects in their respective field .
As their knowledge tremendeously helps them in a lot of projects where such inputs are required and turn it into success !
For example a student with a broad Knowledge of `` Sustainable Design '' and Project Management will definately have an edge over a student with knowlege only in `` Interior design '' .

Thus it is important for students to have a broad knowledge of amny academic subjects instead of specializing in one specific one and I completely agree with it .
