I agree with the saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
As in many cases i have seen products are generally low quality products , particulary in the case of eatables and face creams or hair gells .
The company simply makes fool of people by showing there product as the ultimate product you are looking for .
It makes false promises to people about its quality and its effectiveness .

I remember one instance what happened in India few years ago , a lot of pesticides were found in coca colas and pepsi drinks .
These drinks were found unsuitable and unfit for drinking purpose but still they were sold in indian market without controlling those pesticides in them .
I think they wereselling just because of there huge brand names Which i think is really unethical on part of bussiness .

I remember one more instance , i brought one fairness cream , its advertisement showed a person getting fairer and fairer day by day by using that product so i thaught of buying that and finally when i brought it and used it it caused some rashes on my skin so finally i had to consult doctor who reccomended not to use that cream anymore .

So this is how things worked .
In my opinion companies should not make any false promises or those promises which will not come true to there customers .
In that way they are decreasing there long run profits and peoples faith on them .
However advertising is the best way tointoduce and launch new products in the market and make people aware of different substitutes available for the product in the market .
Thus creating healthy competition in the market for the companiesand allowing new entries in market .
