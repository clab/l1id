I cannont agree with the given statement that there would be lesser number of cars , twenty years down the line .
infact according to my insight the number of cars in use would increase considerably in the course of the naxt two decades .

The possible arguements that i put forth would give the reasons as to why i think so .
firstly , talking about the economic choices that we make nowadays indicate that we spend a huge chunk of what we earn on the mordern gadgets which obviously makes our lives more easier .
and talking about a car ..
well that has become one obvious neccesity .
members who are from the same family would prefer a personal car than one being shared among many .
even students who tarvel far prefer thaown cars .
and why not , it increases convinience .

second factor is that its much easier to buy a car now than in the past .
the varoius loans available from banks , facility of paying in installments with small interest rates saves people from investing a lumpsum amount of money all at once .
people with smaller pay scales can afford to buy cars .

this indicates that there could be an increase in the number cars than the predicted decline .
the facrors that could lead to the decline dont seem like a big hurdle to me in the near future .
talking about the hiking price of petroleum which makes one think about the burden on expenditure by owning a car .
well that is hardly a concern to worry about because it can be dealt with prioritising the list of your expenditure .
running a personal car is more important to the present generation than perhaps spending on say ..
subscribing a costly book or buying a painting or even hanging out at expensive places with friends .
the advantage that owing a vehicle offers outweighs the cost of petrol .

the next possible concern which come come into the picture is that of environmental pollution that the fuel could cause. a major concern to all the environmentalists of the world .
well to see the broader picture no government law could prohibit people from buying a car !!
its a personal choice after all and how many of us actually think about this aspect , there are many other issues that the environmentalists could deal with-like defforestations , emmisions from factories contructions , nuclear wars ..
the list could go on .

and moreover the discovery of biofuels , solar powered cars , natural gases which are less hazardous options are now a real possibility .
this could perhaps lead to the manufacture of more cars , cheaper rates that would only lead to the number of cars increasing on the streets .
the increase in number of cars could also lead to heavy traffic jams , congestion , but do we actually mind getting stuck in a traffic jam for maybe a minute more ?
with the building of broader roads , highways , flyovers , multilaned roads would offer a solution .

thus it could be concluded , that by measuring all the issues concerned with the increase in the number of cars , there seems to be a more likely possibilty of increase in their number .
