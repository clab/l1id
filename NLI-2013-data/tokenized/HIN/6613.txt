in the next few years the technology will develop more than today .
so i agree with this point of view that in twenty years therr will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because in future because of development of science and technology the trains will develop more than present days .
and it is to travel by train than by cars .
because trains are much more faster than cars and it will develop more .
we can take the examples of metro trains of present days .
these are much more faster than the old time trains .
we can reach in few minutes to same place on which it will take many ours by reaching with cars .

also in cars there is a pressure of driving .
if our family is going on a place then one has to drive .
if we are going on night then also some one has to drive which is very dangerous .
also the person who is driving cannot enjoy like other people .
in trains there is no pressure of driving and all of the family members can enjoy equally , because of the development it will become easier to afford the plains also .
so everyone prefer plains rather than cars .
as we all know that it takes only few minutes .

also in cars there is a very conjusted space which makes it uncomfortable .
it is very difficult to travel long distances in cars .
it is very expensive to travel in cars .
because of the rising prices of the fuel .
i think this is the big reason to the decrease in use of cars .
we all know very well the fossil fuels are declining day by day .
there is a big decerase in the natural resources from the last few years .
so everyone must tried to control this .
and we can do this by controling the use of fossil fuels .

another reason for decrease in the use of cars is that it increases the pollution in the atmosphere .
which is a very serious problem .
as pollution create many kind of problems like many kind of diseases like skin diseases and also breathing problems .
many children are suffering from these diseases in there young ages .
so this problem can be solved by controllling the use of pollution creating vehicles .

there is a lot of traffic on the roads also .
which is very irritating .
so we can avoid this by using trains and plains .
so in next some years people will prefer less use of cars than today to all of these problems like pollution , traffic , longer time duration and also the pressure of driving .
