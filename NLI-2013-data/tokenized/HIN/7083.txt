I disagree with the idea that in about 20 years time frame there will be fewer cars in use that there are today .
The reasons for my disagreement follow .
Firstly , the populations , as always , is on a high rise and will continue to do so .
Hence , there will be more people travelling on the same and limited space on earth .
Further , the birth rate and life expectancy of the people has been increasing , with the help of medical advancements that are made everyday , and hence , there will be more number of people who will be in a position to either drive the car by themselves or at least travel in the cars .
Hence , there will be a definite need of more cars as there will be more people for using the cars .

Secondly , advancements in the machinery of the cars and various parts of the cars are being made every passing day .
Such advencements are also directed towards cutting down the cost of the cars .
If the cost of the cars is reduced to great levels , more people will be able to afford a seperate car for themselves .

Thirdly , the world is growing global with every passing day and each member in most of the families has seperate goals and different daily routine .
In order to achieve their goals and lead their different daily routines , each member in the family may need a seperate car .
Hence , the idea that the number of cars will be reducing in future is not a realistic one .

Although , I agree that with the increment in the number of cars , more fuel will be needed and we have limited source of energy and resources of fuel .
But with the researchers making continuous efforts for creating and finding new sources of energy , it is not far that we will stop using conventional sources of energy and will have newer sources of energy .
For example , it is not far that we will be able to utilize the solar energy for driving our cars , in fact , many of the cars that run on solar power are already in the market .

For all the reasons listed above , I disagree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in use after 20 years that there are today .
