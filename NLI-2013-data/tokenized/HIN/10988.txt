Think of it if we would have had no internet facility and we would have send this response through a letter .
What would have been the turn around time ?
Its even hard to think of it .
Its because of few successful people that we are savoring all these facilities .
Human being is blessed with a mind power not to use it for things he is already aware of , but to try out different things so that he can help others with it .
People who try out new and different things are better known in this world compare to the ones who have been amongst the common ones .
Successful people differ from others in different perspectives like courage , approach and many more .

First lets take an example of Sachin Tendulkar , the youngest player in the history of international cricket .
If he would have assumed that a person can only be a part of country team only at adult age .
Then his name would not have been written in history .
With his courage and strength he gained the major place in world .
Its his different styles of batting that make him stand different from others .
Otherwise he would have been like other common players .
There are many others and few of them are Abraham Lincoln , Mahatma Gandhi who were known for their courage and stood against the governing bodies to bring in the change for all .

Second , think if Einstein would not have come up with those innovations .
Had it been easy for men now to relate different things which are made easy now , with those laws .
If he would have stopped because of his continuous failures and would not have taken another risk then people would have been deprived of another innovation .
Its the approach and abilty to take risks that counts the most in this world and makes one successful and distinguish person .

How many know us ?
Well very few untill and unless we come up with few distinguish ideas or achievements that make us stand different from others .
This is the reason why the Researchers or Specialists are given high positions in the society .
Its not becuase they have different degrees attached to their names , its because of the innovations and their capability to try out new and different things .
