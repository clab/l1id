We live in a world which is very interesting and contains plenty of Knowledge .
Is n't fair to say which one is better for us , either in having broad knowledge of many academic subjects or be a specialized in one specific subject .
I beleive we should have knowledge of many subjects and be a specialized in any one subject to which we feel that suits us .

Let us have examples , As we are in our school we are taught to different subjects like Mathematics , Life Sciences , Social Studies .
As we grow up to University Level , we are given a chance to choose what we are interested in like Medicine , Engineering , Business Administration , Music , Law etc .
So i beleive we should have enough knowledge in all aspects of life .

If i beleive in having broad knowledge of many subjects rather than be a specialized , then it is highly impossible for me to remember the things .
For example a Doctor ca n't be a lawyer because the medicine knowledge is endless where as the lawyer has to remember all the laws and he has to upgrade himself with change in Government and in `` law and order '' .
So a person cant be specialized in many subjects .

Let us say i beleive in second point of being a specialized in one subject rather than have enough knowledge in various subjects ...
Suppose I am secialized in Business Administration and if someone asks me about the Business I am able to answer to all of their questions and if one day someone asks me anything irrelevent to my subject of Business I may not be able to answer the question .

If we take an example of sports , we often have interest in many sports but we love only one sport .
Thats why an football commentator cannot do commentary in Badminton because he may not be knowing of the rules correctly .

Learn the good things as much as we can whether it may be from a scholar or from a small kid because learning never ends .
