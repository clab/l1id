It is quite possible that the number of cars in use will reduce in twenty years because of various factors .
Firstly , if the public transport facilities keep on improving in all countries , as it seemingly is , there are chances that people will rely on them to a greater extent than on cars .
Already , in many parts of the world which have a high quality public transport system , people going to far off places for jobs take their cars only to the nearest parking place from where an efficient commuting source is available .
No wonder if the transport system keeps on getting better and better , they wo n't even need to drive to the parking place in a car either .
Another factor that can cause a reduction in the number of cars is the cost of fuel that cars depend on .
The cost of fuels is increasing all the time at such a high rate that sooner than later , only few people would be able to afford a car .
Added to this the possibility that the source of petrolium may die altogether in twenty years as has been predicted by various scientists .
However , this point is itself challenged by the fact that other new sources of power ( for example fuel cells ) might develop in twenty years that would replace fossil fuels as the most significant source of energy .
Another factor that could account for the reduction in the number of cars is the population increase .
The human population in twenty years would increase to such numbers that it will no longer be possible to drive a car through most places as they would be overcrowded by pedestrians .
There might not remain enough space for public parking as residetial buildings are going to occupy most of the available space .
The condition of the atmosphere would have worsened by air polution by then and various governments would have to impose a restriction on the maximum number of cars their country can afford to accommodate .
While on the brighter side of it , we can expect that in another twenty years , people are going to become sensible and mature enough to avoid using cars and depend more on walking and public transport in order to improve their healths and save the environment from various forms of pollution .
