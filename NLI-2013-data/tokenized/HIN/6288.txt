I dont believe that in twenty years from now there will be less cars than there are today .
As we can see around us that it seems there is a deluge of cars and other modes of vehicles .
It seems that everybody wants to own a car as it has become a matter of status symbol and a nessecity .

As the world economy is getting stronger with each passing day and develping countries turning into developed ones , the financial capability of lay persons has improved a lot .
So they can spend on things of luxuries such as cars .
Another reason to believe that number of cars will only increase from here on and not decline is that today it is not difficult to obtain loans to buy a car , all the leading banks are willing to shell money out of there coffers to entice customers to get a car .

Although some people are driven by the thought that rising fuel prices and depleting fuel stocks will ultimately apply brakes on number of cars as people will not be able to buy fuel and in about next twenty years petroleum reserves will be exausted .
But I do n't think this will happen as scientists are working on prepring biofuel which will cost less and will last for greater time and I have a good example of this study as some of my friends prepared biofuel from Jatropha plant and with the help of this fuel they ran an engine .

With each passing day the prices of cars are slashed and new comforts are added so people think that they should go for it and own a car .
As in most of the countries the public transport system is very tiring and there is such a great rush of people that now people have started to use there own vehicle for commuting and this urge will lead to more cars .

Hence I disagree that numbers of cars will decrease from now onwards .
But according to me it should increase .
