The issue at hand is , whether it is good to travel alone without a tour guide or in a group that is led by a tour guide .
This issue is very troubling to me because there are so many people in the world who enjoy going to different places by themselves without a tour guide although they can afford one .
But i 'll support the tour with a guide with a group of people because sometime you can find many good life long friends in a group and many beautiful sceneries that you cannot see without the help of a tour guide .

I prefer the best way is to travel in a group led by a tour guide because a tour guide can give you a lot of information about the places you are going to view .
You cannot find that information if you are travelling alone without a guide .
Moreover , if you are travelling in a group you will actually enjoy the travelling & you would not even know about the time that you spent for travelling .
On the other hand , if you are travelling alone without a tour give you can cause trouble for youself sometimes .
For example , you cannot find all the sight sceneries without a tour guide & it will be a great hassle if you are travelling alone in a taxi without knowing anything about the city you are visiting .

Second reason why a grop travelling with a guide is preferrable because of the economic figures .
For example , suppose you are travelling alone without a guide it will cause you to spend a lot of money if you do n't know the visiting city well .
On the other hand , in a group tour all the participants pool money so that every individual has to pay a little amout of money .
Furthermore , travelling by a group of people can enjoy their travelling a lot instead of a single individual .

In conclusion , i 'll say that travelling in a group is far more exciting experience as compared to travelling alone withot a guide .
I believe this is better option because it is economic , exciting , worth spending money to travel with a bunch of people rather than alone .
