`` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''

Yes i do agree with the above statement

Successful people use their enterprise and gained knowledge to try and invent new and better ways and tecnologies and methods to do the same thing in a better and easier way

Sucessful people not always follow the path shown to them or the path normal people tend to take .
they are willing to try new things and take new risks in the hope of better results and achievements .

A lot also has to do with ones attitude .
A successful person will have a positive attitude and will be optimistic of his achievements and failures .
An unsuccessful person will be pessimistic about his achievements and mourn on his failures

Successful people have an urge to go beyond the obvious and the commenly followed ways and measures the are risk takers and the diversify their knowledge by trying new things and experimenting .
The most effective discoveries that have been made in the past are by people and scentist who where ready to take a step into the unknown and dared to touch the untouched .
they refused to follow the same old traditional patterns .
it is an art to open your minds and look for anwers for the questions never asked before .
Mechanically doing the same old thing makes people 's mind robotic and life monotonus .

Lot of millionares in India eg tata birla and ambanies are people who are big industrlists are those who where willing to dream big and to seek success bydaring to take actions which normal people in those times will think twice about .
Growth and sucess might come later as one might also suffer fron failures but people can always learn from their past mistake and improve , adapt and innovte an old and commenly used method for the betterment of future generations .
