the risk taking people never plan for the risk they just do it as their passion also even they never think about the outcomes from it .
they donot do the different thing but they do the things differenty by taking risk .
even they never collapse when they failed but they try more harder next time .

doing the same thing or the thing which already konw is like doing or repeating the same thing again and again .
