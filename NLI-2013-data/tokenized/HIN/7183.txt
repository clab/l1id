Presently , I witness every day that the Number of Cars on the roads have increased day by day , reason being the increase purchasing power of the common man .
Nowerdays , owning a car has become a necessity from a luxury as it was in olden days .
but this increase in cars have raised our concern regarding our future generations .
it is very unlikely that 20 years down the lane from now , we will witness fewer cars in use .
but taking the truth into consideration that non-renewable resources are getting extuinguish , i think that the use of cars will definitly will decrease if not in 20 years but surely after that .

the main reason for this will be decline in the reserve of petroleum on the earth .
for example if there will be no petrol or deseil then how will the car run .
the other possible reason could be the increase in use of public transport by the people .
basically , this is a step towards conservation of resources and sustainable development ofv the nations .
for example in delhi recently , Metro Rails have been inroduced by the government .
and many cpmmuters have now opted for metros than the cars in order to avoid traffic jams and it is laos less time consuming .
delhi being the 2nd most polluted city in the world , it was observed that most of the pollution is caused by cars .
now people prefer puublic transports and use their cars only for family outings .

the people now realise that more cars on the roads will lead to lot of traffic jams and time wastage and hence they 'll be late for their work in the morning causing lot of mental stress to them .
thus in my point of view the use of cars running on petrol and desiel will decrease but there will be no effect on the number of cars running on Battery such as Reva .
science has developed so much that it is inventing such cars .
but very few people have opted for it because of it maintenace .
this is the prediction about India .
but in other courtries around the world the car has become a luxury to some extent as people rely on the public transport the most in order to save their time and money .

this stage is yet to come in India but it has started .
Thus , i firmly believe that i 'll witness less use of Cars in the 20 years from now .
