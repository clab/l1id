Being a Young person i believe that in today 's professional world young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , as they prefer their profesional life has a dominant role in their life .

Now days life is getting very professional as compared to earlier days .
Earlier , people use to work till the evening and after that they go somewhere around with their friends , parents , family but now days the work pressure is so much that they dont have time to even take a proper sleep .
According to the recent surveys working people especially aged between 23 to 40 could not sleep for even 8 hours a day which the doctors advice one should atleast sleep in a day .

Earlier people treated temples and churches as the places where they believed that god lives and they can be relaxed and make themselves calm but nowdays people treat those holy places as a picnic spot where they can go with their children and enjoy .
Nobody wants to work like Mahatma gandhi .

There are many NGO 's which are working for the welfare of the community but no one joins them rather no young person joins them , you can find most of the retired person who are working there as an officers because they dont pay you much .

Today young people wants to achieve the higher goals as to earn more money .
Higher they will go in their company higher the remuneration willl be .
For eg.an employee of a company can work there for 18 hours in a day but if he is being asked to work for a NGO or any social community then he will definately say big NO to it as it will not be higly payable as he is getting in the company

After considering all the facts i believe that young people wants their life to be the most succesful professionally not for the welfare of the community in which they live in .
