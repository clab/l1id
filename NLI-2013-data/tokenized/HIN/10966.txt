I strongly agree with the statement that that successful people try new things and take risks .
It is very difficult for any person to be satisfied with his or her achievments .
moreover if a person is successful and has means to try something new he will never hesitate .

It is a human nature to desire more that what he has .
it is said that if a glass is half filled and half empty one should be satisfied with the portion full with water .
but it is never seen .
A person always want to touch new horizons of success .
For an example if company becomes the topmost business of a country the owner will try his best to make it the most successful business of the world .
Rather this will act as a driving force and he will be ready to take any risk for it .
If a person is successful and has enough cash and credit he will be more inclined to take risk and explore new areas of bussiness .
he can start a new work with a small portion and in case he would not secceed he will not lose much and still have enough from the old bussiness .
Moreover a person who has proved him self in the market has gained respect and faith of many people , so others are always ready to help ficancially or by other means .

This is not true only in the business world .
World is full of such examples .
There are many scientists , artists , mountain clinbers , and many more other people who did not stop after being successful and earning reputation and money .
Rather have always tried to do more that what they did till now .

In sum i think that sucess acts as a driving force making a person want more and more and a successful person has tha advantage of having more support and resource so he can take more risks to achieve more .
