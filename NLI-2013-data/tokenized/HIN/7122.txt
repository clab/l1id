I believe that two decades from now we shall have fewer cars than there are today .
To achieve a sustainable development , already many countries are discouraging use of private transport and framing rules and regulations that will lead to mass acceptance of public transport .
Moreover , with advancements in transport technology , alternative modes of transport will develop .

World population is increasing at tremendous rate .
With rise in population increases the demand for travel since the total number of individuals increase So , one might think that future will show us growth in number of cars too .
But , for this to happen infrastructure should also increase at the same pace .
Car building workshops will have to increase the capacity .
Pertroleum companies will have to dig more wells .
But , from where are they going to find the resources !
People cannot go on exploiting environment in the way they want to achieve their comfort of travelling in their own car .
There is growing world consciousness that one cannot sacrifice the development of future generation to become merrier today .
Hence , many countries of the world , like US , Brazil , Singapore , India have embarked upon a novel and ambitious project of `` Sustainable Development '' .
Various organisations like International Energy Agency and World Bank work together with many countries under this project to create a better future .
Rules and regulations have been framed to popularise public transport .
With time certainly demand for personal transport will go down and so will be the number of cars .

Moreover , if one were to go by temporal relationship between science depicted in movies and technolgy in the day-to-day world , one will see that whatever a fiction writer or movie director imagines has come true in about few years from the inception because of science .
For instance , a ` submarine ' imagined in `` Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea '' ( a book by R.L.Stevenson )
was made a reality few years after its publication .
Hence , it would not be preposterous to believe that we will have our own personal flying automobiles as shown in the movie `` The Fifth Element '' .
In fact , if humans are able to colonise in space e.g. moon , there shall be more space vehicles and less cars .
One might also envisage a `` Particle Transporter '' as seen in `` Star Trek '' .
Then there shall not remain a need for anyone to have a car .
Given , the rapid development and promises offered by Science all this seems quite achieveable within next two decades .

Hence , it can be safely said that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years down the line .
