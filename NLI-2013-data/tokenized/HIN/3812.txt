Young people have always been seen as a future of their community and are expected to work for the betterment of their community .
I feel that young people do take care and try and help in growing their communities .
The world is growing and people are well aware that it is ` survival of the fittest ' policy that runs their lives .
Anybody in that case would want to make a place for their community in this expanding world .
Young people are very much aware of what the community has done for them and are always ready to help their community by giving in their efforts and time .

Young people know what they mean to the community they belong to and in this social world , they do most of what he can do to help his community .
For instance we can take an example of Mr. Dhiru Bhai Ambani and his children .
Mr. Ambani has always been interested in his community which is gujarti .
He has always been working hard to improve Gujrat as a state .
And this is continued by their sons Mr. Mukesh and Mr. Anil .
The men who have their biggest project in Gujrat jus to improve employment and economic condition of their community ( gujaratis ) ...
They could have that big project in metro politan cities that have better resources and climatic conditions .
They spend a lot of time to help needy people in Gujrat and do what they can for them So , this can be sighted as one of the best examples for young people do for their community .

In this world where time is no less than money , people do spend time in charity , sponsoring funds for their community works , helping poor , counsellin their community members , attending their community meetings , finding out ways for the betterment of their community , managing their community functions .
Young people are more enthusiastically participating in the above mentioned activities which gives them satisfication .
They try and spend lots of time and work for their community which is worth mentioning .
We can also take an example of ` Orkut .
com ' where communities are rapidly increasing .
Also people registering in each community is increasing day by day .
This serves as an evidence of how people spend time in helping their communities by giving in forums which are very helpful for the growth of the community .
Thus young people are the ones who are going to handle their communities and I think they are responsible enough for it !!
