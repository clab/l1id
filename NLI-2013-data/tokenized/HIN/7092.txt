Cars have different meaning for different individuals .
For some its a neccessity , an object insperable .
For others its a status symbol , an object that expresses their power , success and wealth .
What ever might be the perceptions , a car is surely one of the most fascinating objects created by man .

When Henry Ford invented the car , he did not fathom how important it will become in our daily life .

The demand is high and the number of cars being added on the roads is increasing at a dramatic rate .
In the developed countries as compared to the developing countries this rate is much higher .
Some countries take it positively as its an evidence of their economic prosperity .
More cars on the road implies more earning power for a common man .

However , lately the opinion has been changing as people are starting to realise the adverse effects that are being caused due to cars .
One of them being traffic jams which are very common in large cities like New York , London or New Delhi .
A lot of time gets wasted due to this reason , as drivers get stuck in them .
People have surely realised this problem and are preferring car pooling , buses or even bicycles as means of commuting .
This means that in future there is a big possiblity of reduction of the number of cars on roads as the other mediums would mean reaching the destination faster .

One other factor is noise and air pollution being caused by cars .
This is a very big problem for people who live close to a main road where the density of cars is very high .
On the other hand it is also a nuisance for the car drivers or the passengers as the pollution causes harm to their health .
Imagine , monday morning when everyone goes to work , the traffic jams and pollution start the day .
This will surely lead to a decline in the number of cars .

Another strong reason could be the rising fuel consumption which is increasing the fuel prices .
This is making people to look out for alternative mediums to travel .
This will surely lead to a decrement in the number of cars as people would prefer buying a buss pass which would prove to be lighter on their pockets as compared to purchasing fuel for their cars .
Even if an alternative cheap fuel is invented , increase in traffic jams and pollution will definitely lower the number of cars .

Finally , the number of accidents being caused by cars are inreasing day by day .
Due to this reason people are preferring trains and buses which are comparitively safer .

All the major reasons mentioned above will surely bring a drop in the number of cars , and twenty years down the line we can expect fewer cars in use than there are today .
