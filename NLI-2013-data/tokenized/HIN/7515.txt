We always want to spend our free time effetively .
Especially , vacation time is valuable for us so we can utilize carefully and that 's why I always prefer to travel with tour guide .
If I have tour guide then I do n't have to worry about necessary arrangement .
Most Important , tour guide knows the best places to visit and familier with the local language and holidays .

Firstly , I am going to vacation to relax and spend my time without any worries .
A tour giude will be with me then I will not have to worry about hotel reservation and find the good resaturants .
I just need to check my group which is comfortable for me or not .
All significant arrangements is my tour guide problem , I just have enjoy my vacation .

Furthermore , a tour guide have list of the good places which would be helpful for us .
A tour guide has knowledge about good musiumes which represents that place 's history .
Tour guide should be familier with the stores which sell good product in good prise .
I don'e have to learn musiem 's schedule and find the stores beacuase my tour giudes is with me .

Moreoever , a tour guide has to have better knowledge about the holidays so he can inform us for the proper dress for the holiday .
He als aware with local langauage so he can give us good description of the place we are looking .
In the short time period , either I do n't need to learn local language to figure out the things those we are looking or I do n't want to wear stupid costumes for the day and look fool .
