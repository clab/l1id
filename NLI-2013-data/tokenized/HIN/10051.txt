I do not agree to the statement .
In my opinion successful people do n't do new or different things .
But they do things in a different maner than others which gives them success .
There are a lot of areas that a person can explore in his life .
He dreams to be someone in life that will take him to new heights and new horizons .
However in this process he undergoes various adaptations , learns new principles .
What matters success is the method in which it is attained .

For birth of a new thing its not always trying something new will give success .
It is the perseverence with which it is done .
Not all inventions are successful at the first time .
For example Thomas Edison invented the bulb on his hundredth attempt of his experiment .
So in this process no doubt he did invent the bulb which was a great invention in that time .
But at the same time he never gave up on his plans and attempt by attempt he rediscovered his theory behind the electric bulb .

There are many scientists , archelogist , poets wo were not given the recognition they deserved on their inventions .
Many times they were discouraged by the society to bring about changes .
So society also molds life of a person .
So in my opinion a person has to leave behind all the blocks that try to hinder his performance .

Positive attitude also plays a major role in anyones success .
There are many negative elements in the society which always brings the marale of a person down .
For success to happen a person has to be dedicated in his aim .
He should act accordingly to attain his objectives .
Moreover trying new things does not alone bring success .

The circumstances in which a person attains his plans of life also play a major role .
There is always a difference between a man that is self made and a man who has readily got an establishment from his forefathers .
The self made man with his motivation will try to evolve into something he always wanted to be .
He has his goals set and in the least favoring conditions he will move ahead with his goals .
However a man who has a readymade establishment will try to continue in the same status .
He would not try to move ahead with the given foundation .
Hence only a man who knows the techniques behind say business management or technical principles will be successful .

Hence just trying out new things and taking risk need not always bring success .
Instead a man can be significantly sucessful if he tries to do things he already knows in a different maner .
For example for a ball bearing manufacturer who has a fixed clientele can try to expand his business by setting up additional manufacturing plants and increase his clientele and the applications where the balll bearings are used .
There is a saying in the business management world that `` Not taking a risk is also a risk '' .
The timing should be adequate and the should be calculated earlier .

Hence according to me trying out new things should be on the mind of every individual but it should be accompanied by various qualities as described above to make it a big success .
