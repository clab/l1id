I totally agree with the given statement .

Ideas and concepts are associated with the thinkers and innovators .
Whereas learning facts is associated with the followers .

The understanding of an idea or concept gives students the ability to innovate , and to develop their ability to deal with different circumstances and problems .
Merely memorizing facts will simply let the student know of a particular solution , but would not empower him/her to develop new solutions .

Let us take the example of classical physics .
There are several equations and several forms of equations .
However , these numerous equations are derived from certain core concepts of principles .
Once these principles are understood , any equation can be derived .
But the understanding of these concepts is extremely important to master trhe subject .

This does not only hold true in the case of science / technology areas .
Understanding the concepts is critical to all areas of studies .
For example , a management student refers to several case studies .
But the intention for this is not to merely note the actions taken by earlier managers to deal with problems and to keep a record of the same .
The intention is to analyse and think of possible solutions and to understand how the particular decision was taken .
This approach would give future managers capability to come up with innovative solutions .

Today , we have so many electronic gadgets to manage data .
Do we wish to turn our brain into another data storage warehouse ?
Our brain can do something that not even the fastest computers can .
That is to innovate , to think , and to get ideas .
Let us not waste it by encouraging students to give importance to merely learning facts .

I am not averse to the idea of learning facts .
It is important .
Knowing the facts enable us to speak confidently about a particular topic .
However , knowing the concepts behind those facts is what will lead you to innovate new facts !
