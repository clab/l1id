I think broad knowledge of many subjects is good , but not always .
So , I strongly disagree with the statement .

I think , in mordern world one should be specific towards the subject , because there is a limitation for human beings .
A person ca n't be perfect in everything .
For example there is a difference between the knowledge of an engineer and a doctor .

An engineer can better think about mechanical things like machines , instruments etc , where as a doctor can have better idea of presentation of human body than an engineer has .
So , a doctor can better manipulate human body .
So the knowledge is always limited for both of them .
That is why , a person ca n't be a doctor or engineer at a time and ca n't be expert in both the fields .

Among doctors , a general practictioner has knowledge of human body but are not specialized in purticular area like cardiology , neurology etc .
As they have limited knowledge , they refer the patients with cardiac problem to the cardiologist , who always has better knowledge of heart activities than them .
So , a specialist in specific subject is always better .

.
At last I will say that , due to limitations it is always better for a person to be specialized in a specific subject , because this is the way one can be perfect in the subject , and one can learn deeply about that subject that having little knowledge of many subjects .

This is the way one can stand in this competetive world with the perfect knowledge in the particular subject , otherwise the person will neither have good knowledge of all the subjects nor will be the master in one .
This is the way I want to be in future , and would expect the same from others .
