I agree with the statement because one can do everything in his life until he have energy and not but obivious it is more in young generation . ''
Enegy provides the interest , interest provide the entertainment and entertainment provides the enjoy '' .

At the younger age , man is at the the stage of his life where he can contribute more and more for himself and when thinks about the enjoyement the main duration comes from his young life .
In young life he first experiences the college life which no one can disagree the best days of anyones life .

At the young age he earns the money by his own so there is no tension of spending it at the the prelimenery stage until he gets responssibilty so at that time also on becoming self sufficient he enjoy his life than old man can enjoy .
At the old age the man get dependent because everywhere we can see man works for their childs not for their future and at the old age he thinks to enjoy he cannot expect the money from his child or he feels shy in demanding so keeping all aside he gave up enjoyment and works in day to day routine .

At the young age only he feels the spirit of life and does watever he wants but at old age he has to think before taking any risk because he do not have that much power to gain again or work again .
At the earlier stage that is young age he feels attraction more towards oopsite sex and so does so much funny things to attract them but it does not happen in later stage of life .

So the basic conclusion emits from above that one enjoys more in young age as compared to the old age because freshness is the basic requirement to enjoy the valueabale moments of life and that remains only in young age .
