Young people surely enjoy life more than older people do .
There are various reasons to support this opinion .
Firstly , young people have more energy and vitality than older people who may suffer from various ailments and may become less physically active as they age .
Youth , with all its energy provides a chance for various adventures and possibilties .
This may be one of the reasons why younger people outnumber older ones in adventure sports and other thrilling and sometimes potentially dangerous fun activites .

Secondly , younger people may have lesser responsibilties than their older counterparts because of absence of dependents like spouse and children .
Hence they dont need to take many factors into account or compromise when doing or pursuing an activity or vocation of their choice .

Thirdly , young people have more opportunities and less obligations and are more inclined to venture into unexplored areas and innovate .
They may be ready to take calculated risks if it helps in their growth and advancement .
Though this may sound as being less responsible , but a person only grows when he moves out of his comfort zone .

Also , older people may be less flexible and less open to change even if it is for their own good .
While young people are open to new ideas and willing to try them .
The excitement , enthusiasm and openess to explore a young person brings to the table is unmatchable .

Hence , it can be averred that young people are able to enjoy life more than their older counterparts .
Else , why would everyone want to retain youth forever or why no one in this world ever wants to get older ?
