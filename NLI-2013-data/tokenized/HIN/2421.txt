It is true that young people enjoy life much more that older people do and I support this statement entirely .
We have to however , realize that we maybe refering to a specific time period and different stage of age-groups at different times , this may include one 's years of adolescence or even the teenage years .

As an adult with a family to look after , there are a lot of additional responsibilities that are thrust onto one 's shoulders .
As a younger person there maybe the academic pressure that one has to cope up with but not a problem as such .
Afterall , it is the duty of every child to study .
The adults are incorporating into their lives what they have already learnt , while the younger are still in the process of learning the basic tricks of the trade .
Learning however , is a never ending process .

As a younger person , there is always a tendancy to experiment .
Sometimes this may prove to be successful or may lead to failure .
The whole point is that as a younger person , we are at an immature stage in our lives and things may not affect us that adversely and this is a big advantage and a huge motivational factor to go out and try different things .
After all as said by George Bernard Shaw in his famous play Pygmalion , `` What is a life but a series of inspired follies . ''

Younger people have a lot more freedom , in the sense that they have a much wider curriculum and whole lot of facilities to avail off , which our elders could have only dreamt of having in their time .
Ofcourse there is no shortcut to success and the required amount of hardwork has to be put in , only we are luckier that we have access to better and quicker resources to consult .

A great example could be taken from within a school community itself .
The Senior-Junior relationship .
As a junior there is not much expected out of one , except a good academic , which goes for everyone across the board .
As a senior one may be vested with great power , and with great power comes great authority and greater responsibility .
It is really surprising , yet true to see such a major shift of responsiblity even among a smaller group .
School is however only a micro-cosm of the world and this is how the heirarchy is maintained the world over .
The younger lot have no tension as such .

The younger one 's always have a much relaxed attitude towards towards life and its other various aspects as well , and why should'nt they , there is the right time for everything and as they grow older the burden of responsibility will get to them .
Life at a younger stage is much more relaxed and stress-free .

As an adult one may be dealing in a very rigorous and challenging climate , with a lot of intense competition , however , different than that of a younger person .
Thus , I can conclude by saying that the younger lot do enjoy life a lot more than the older people do .
