One would be glad to find a single person today who is not worried about the rising gasoline prices , and the burgeoning traffic jams !
The gulf states the major producers of oil have been foreboding for long that they have alreday reached their maximum limit and the produce fo oil is only going to plummet from here on .
All this spells evil for the car manufaturers .

Cars though expensive have some clear advantage over public transport but it is losing this advatnge a fast pace .
Not only are they becoming more and more uneconomical to drive the traffic situation challanges the other advanatges it has i.e. of quicker transport .

Comparing this with a more efficient public transport system which is way cheaper considering the rising gasoline prices and is much more quicker considering the worsening traffic jam situation .
Anyone would be enticed to use public transport rather than use private transport i.e cars .

Necessity is the mother of invention the mans need to move made him invent the car but this is being challanged in a number of ways these days .
Off recently number of companies have started offering option of work at home , univeristies have started courses which are internet learning based .
All this has reduced the need for people to move and hence eliminating the need of cars form our lives .
And as we move from a manufacturing based economy to an information based one the need of the transport is going to decrase further as people would prefer to stay at home and work .

Though there are certain things that might just save the fate of that beatle in your garage , might be an electric car , which might be cheaper to run as we find more and more renewable souirces of energy and might be much smaller in size and hence solving the traffic issue .

But all this is ot far fetched untill some solid discoveries are doen we can easliy say all this spells doom for the existence and number of cars .
