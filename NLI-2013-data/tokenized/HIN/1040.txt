knowledge is like an ocean and man gets this life only once .
only people who have experienced the taste of gaining knowledge can tell very importance of gaining knowledgeth .
what exaltation and exuberation knowledge it can have

i completely agree that it is better to have broader knowledge of many subjects rather than confining oneself to one subject .
it will give students a wide specrum of thier knowledge .
they are going to know a little about every thing .

i just state an example from my own personal experience .
when i was doing my undergraduate .
i was offered a variety af subjects .
and as i progressed i realised there is interconnections between different concepts from different subjects for example i studied metallurgy in my first semister .
and in second semester i had advance mechanics of structures .
first i thought that they had no connection but later i realised the without the metallurgy i would not have been able understand advance mechanis of structures .

also one specific subject can make a person master in that subject but he is going to have less job opportunities than the person with wide spectrum of knowledge .

a wide variety of subjects makes a person to be in the tune with the present world

i can give an another example of a scientists newton who had knoledge of wide variety of subject and was able to discover theories which were not related to field
.
in hindu mythology it is said knowledge brings you closer to god so more u gain the knowledge more closer you will be to the god .
knowledge can unravel the hidden secrets of this physical world so the more you learn the more intellect you become
