I disagree with the given statement .
In my opinion , young people do their best to help their community and society .
I can say this with conviction because I myself have done my best to help society .

My grandmother runs a primary school for children with limited means .
Since I was about ten years old , I have been going to this school every summer to do voluteer work .
I have interacted with the children , played games like soccer and cricket with them , taught them extra-curricular activities like dance and painting and even taught the children younger to me academic subjects like math sometimes .
It is a great feeling to be able to give to somone something so important - education .
Some of the children there became my friends and I still do talk to them .
Some of them are in high school now .

My brother too has been doing his bit for the society .
He goes to old age homes .
He interacts with the old people there and reads stories to them .
They are lonely and need someone to talk to .
They feel extremely touched when young children like my brother take out time to come and meet them .
My brother too loves to go and spend time with them .

Many of my friends are into community service as well .
A very good friend of mine , Julia , works closely with mentally challenged patients .
She is also an active volunteer for a school with mentally challenged students .

So , in my opinion , it will not be entirely correct to say that young people do not take out enough time to help their communities .
I do agree that there are exceptions this , that there are people who do not wish to indulge in community service .
However , they are mere exceptions .
