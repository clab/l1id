Knowledge is devine and is a must to everyone in any form it may be present .
But most of us consider that knowledge of only certain limited things or subjects around us enough .
The knowledge in those limited things may be deep and secialized but it does require the knowledge of certain other things also .
So , I go with the thought that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
This can be proved in a number of ways .

If we consider feild of biotechnology as an example we can find many deciplines in it like cell biology , microbiology , genetics , bio chemistry , bio organic chemistry , thermodynamics , instrumentation process , bio process engineering , bio informatics , genomics and proteomics , molecular biology , genetic engineering , etc. if a person taking a subject as biotechnology as his major and tries to confine himself toward the specialization of a certain subject rather than aquiring knowledge in all his academic subjects it 'll be very difficult for him to do anything .

if we consider a person wants to specialize in genetic engineering he just cannot do that without the knowledge of cell ciology , molecular biology , genetic map , instruments to be used , etc. so it is a must for him to know all these subjects from his academics in order to master genetic engineering .

Now a days all the diciplines have become inter related and it is very much difficult to say that a person can master in a specific subject without the knowledge of the other subjects .

If we consider gardening as our next example we need to a little of botany a little of chemistry and a little of maths too .
We can explain this as such , firstly the person intrested in gardening should know what type of plants he wants for his garden and are those plants able to survive in those climatic conditions and next he has to know a little bit of chemistry to know with which chemical the plant is to be treated if infected by any knid of disease or pest and finally maths to know how much quantity of chemical is needed to get the required amount of the treatment effect .
So , in this way if a person wants to maintain a proper garden he has to know a little of the above deciplines .

Like this almost all the feilds are inter related and no feild is specific to itself .
Thus I can strongly conclude that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialization in one specific subject is always better .
