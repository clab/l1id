There are some out there who think that the Facts are more important than the ideas or different concepts .
Others think in completly opposite manner .
As far as i concered the i have always been follower of the true fact that is practical stuff .
I have some example to support my statement .

Firstly , the importance of facts should be understood in more broader manner , the ideas and concepts are derived by facts .
So if one cannot understand the fact , it would be diffcult to understand the ideas and concepts behind certain fact .
I have one astonishing example of Einstin .
I have read in the magazine ( Reader 's Digest ) that he always understood the concept and ideas by experiencing facts .
The Theory of Gravity is perfect example of the , fact coming first and then the concept and ideas .

Secondly , the facts represents the overall idea behind it .
So why not learn facts first then the ideas ?
In fact , if you consider or hold very much importance of the fact , you are bound to understand the concepts behind it .
Most of scientists derive their thoery by understanding the certain facts in most perfect manner .
So i think it is really important to foucs of te learing different facts .

Thirdly , student should focus of the pratical knowledge , which holds tremeadous importance in really life .
I , myself , is perfect example , being a civil engineer , the fact behind every condition holds a important .
In some condition , we obivously require the understanding for concept .
But most of the time the learning fact is key .

In the end , the point i like to conclude is the students as far as possible should foucus learing and understanding the critical facts of any subject .
