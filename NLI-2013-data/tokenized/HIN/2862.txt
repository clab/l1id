I partially agree with the statement that - Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
First I will explain how younger peole enjoy life more than older people and then put some point in favor of older people , who also enjoy their life in their own fashion .

Being a young individual , I do not have any doubt that the present younger generation is realy enjoying their life at fullest .
Young people with greater energy and excitment for exploring the world has definetely greater potential for enjoying life .
We can see young peoples here and there enjoying all the flavor of life .
That flavor may be sports , music , dance , club , dangerous activities ( like-bull fight and road rashing ) , touring different location around the world , curiosity for innovation or anything of this sort .
We may be enjoying life in our ways and anything mentioned above could be the means of enjoyment .
We feel enjoyed when we drive our car beyong 300 km/hr .
We enjoy , when we go to party at night or got drunked , do some mischieves , tour some distant place , experience some different culture and satisfy our curiosity by doing something innovative .
So enjoyment has different for different people among young people itself .

Now coming back to older people , if I again think of te phrase - `` enjoy life '' , the same thing appears .
Infact , they also have different opinion of themself about enjoying their lives .
Old people may also enjoy in the their way .
They may enjoy in seating on their chairs , watching the sea , walking near sea-beaches , touring to some distant cultural place at the end of their life ( or may be just for fun ) , talking to her married wife or childrens .
Now some young people can say that having several sexual affairs can also be a way of enjoyment what young people do more .
So ..
well ..
may be ...
Its their way to enjoy . !
Therefore its all about the hman mentality that at the point of our life , our way of enjoyment changes somehow .

Finally I conclude that although young people enjoy their life more through different exciting , adventerous and innovative ways , there are different ways , the old people enjoy their life .
