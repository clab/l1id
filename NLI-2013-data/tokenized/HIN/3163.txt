I m line wid the idea that young people enjoy their life more then their elders do .
Young people beleive that only a healthy mind can dwell in healthy body .
Youths have revolutionised the world of entertainment and serves to be the backbone of entertainment industry .
Young people are very energetic and enthusiastic .
They do every thing , they undertake , with extra vigour and keen intrest .
Undoubtedly their physical state plays a major role in making them appropriate to enjoy life to its fullest .
while ours elders lacks that zeal and enthusuasm beacause of their dotage and senility .

Jack , a graduate student from harvard university , has variety of hobbies ranging from taking part into adventorous river rafting , enrolling for mountain tracking to horese riding .
Playing football is his strength and chess being his meditation .
He also does yogic exercises while in gymnasium .
Moreover indulging himself in sports helps to stay him fit , active and alert .
And this thing had helped him substantially to achieve a sense of contentment at all the three fronts of his life , be it professional , personal or social .

Youths beleive that Enjoying life could recede stress and pressure from their life .
So they go to theatres to watch a latest movie , play various musical instruments , surf the internet to gather the information about latest happenings around the world , go for paraglyding , take part in adventurous sports and many more other sports and medium of entertainment that our elders could not even think of .
It has been seen that a boy would be very excited and cheerful about his new bike and would take pleasure in admiring the beauty and latest technology , the bike has .

On the contrary our elders are burdened because of their social and professional committments .
They do not have enough time for relishing and savoring their lifestyle .
So they may not enjoy goimg to a movie or a horse riding .
They would prefer to live rather a calm an serene life without excitement .
