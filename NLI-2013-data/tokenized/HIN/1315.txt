I strongly disagree with the statement given .
It is not good to have a broad knowledge about many academic subjects .
A broad knowledge will not get you good grades in the examination at school .
Everyone has heard the famous saying `` JACK OF ALL TRADES BUT MASTER OF NONE '' .
Also little knowledge is a dangerous thing .
It can infact endanger a person 's life .
For example while doing the CPR technique to resuscitate a dying person you need to have the complete knowledge about the procedure , otherwise you can put his or her life in danger .
Another place where the specialized knowledge is useful is the `` school of life '' .
Having a specialized knowledge can create a great career oppurtunity .
This can translate into a prosperous and comfortable life .
Another point to be considered is that people who have a broad knowledge about many subjects are generally restless people who cannot concentrate long enough on any subject to master it .
This loss at concentrating will result in failure at every stage in their life .
This will make them a complete loser .
Also people who have specialized knowledge will make a positive impression on their kids .
This will result in highly inspired kids who will then become able and successful adults .
These kids will in turn produce another great generation .
In fact specialized knowledge can transform a dismal or moderate nation into a truly great one .
This is the stuff winners are made of .
A broad knowledge will only take you so much far , but to go that extra mile you need to have a something `` EXTRA '' .
This extra is specialized knowledge .
In the end I would like to say that it is really much better to have specialized knowledge about a subject than to have little knowledge about everything under the sun .
Go for specialized knowledge guys , it is certainly worth it .
