The young people of today are very commonly reffered to as the leaders and the great minds of tomorrow , yet we find ourselves asking wether the youth helps its community .
My responce to this would be that the young people are just as concious as the elders and they fell just as responsible for the welfare of the community .

To ensure that the young adults feel responsible towards their communities , they are inculcated with these values as children by making the children feel more responsible towards their srounding world .
This is done by incorporating a community service section into their school curriculims and allowing the children to discover the satisfaction of sharing .
These young influences are carried along with the youth and as they grow , so does their sense of responsibility to society .
Then these young people do infact spend time from their busy schedules to serve the community .

Nowadays we continually see student-run organizations and events that are held for the benifit of the community and also function as awareness programs to show the adults of the community what the problems within their own sorroundings are .
The profits from these types of funds are then put into good use to benifit society .

One such example in my life that we , as the students of my school achieved for the international organization , The Red Cross was that we had a fund raising event that was in the form of a party to the young childre .
We had ortganzed games and other such events that fascinated the kids and earned us enough money to make a considerable donation to the foundation for earthquake relief in Gujrat , India .

I would like to draw attention to the fact that the Young people of today are just as concerned for the preccious comunity that we live in as are the adults .
After all , what is the point of being a leader tommorrow if we can not preserve our community and hertage today ?
