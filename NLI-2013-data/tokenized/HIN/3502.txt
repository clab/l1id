Young people nowadays are diverse in their opinions and one will find a number of people that have completely opposite opinions depending upon their background or beliefs .
Most of the young people today , I feel , do not give enough time to helping their communities prosper .

To begin with , a reason for young people , today , not to help their communities is basically due to the increase in population that has led to the increase in competition .
For example lets take a person who has spent his childhood in poverty .
Such a person would hardly think about helping his community because the only thing on his mind would be uplifting himself and his family to a higher status .
Due to the amount of competition that exist today one has to be really unique or good in order to be at the top .
Thus , since young people today are more interested in seeing themselves at a higher position they do not think about helping their communities .

Also , young people today have become too narrow minded in their approach to life and do not want to think beyond the future .
For example a person who at the moment is wealthy but doesnt know what is in store for him in the future .
People like these eventhough have the money and resources to help their communities do not do so because they do not believe in it and feel that why should he help others when nobody has helped him .
The fact that he is neglecting here is that in case he does manage to loose his wealth due to some unfortunate circumstances and if he has helped people from his community in the past , it would be those people that would come to his rescue and support him in any way .

However , there still do exist people who do give a lot of time to helping their communities because they have been taught to help others from childhood or have it in them to help others .
Examples can be taken from the young social workers that one finds today .
These workers are dedicating most of their time to helping others and giving them all the support , financially or morally , to come out of a precarious situation .
Thus , one still finds young people that are willing and happy to help others in many aspects of their life .

Nevertheless , in the present scenario young people are more concerned with their families and are only looking towards their betterment .
They are least bothered about what others do and what they need .
Also , as we look to the future the situation is going to get worse and there will be a time when no one will be prepared to stand for others .
