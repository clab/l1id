Its true that humen is totally depending on the power of vehicle to move from one place to another .
Transportation has made human day to day life more easy than before .
In ancient days as people used to walk to cover distance from one part to another , now use of cars and other transpotations made it much eaiser .
Motor cars are usefull to take three to four or more peoples to one place to another .

I disagree with the point that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I feel that use of car wont be fewer in another twenty years .
If we take an example technology has improved so much that now most of the middle class family is affording to have a four wheelar with new models but same time those people who have old Ambasedor or Fiat cars dont want to change their old models after so many years also .
So their can be chances that after twenty years when technology will come up with new things and modalities for transpotation , there will be lot of people who will like only to use cars .
And also the poor people who are able to afford only motorbike can use cars after twenty years .

Same times there also can be possibilities that after twety years when science will come up with new inventions and helicopters and planes can be available in cheeper rates as like todays any of the four wheelar or if their fair will reduce to normal train or bus fair then sure there will be less use of cars .

In conclusion I want to state that my agreement or disagreement with this topic hardly matters .
Only the thing matters is how much technology has improved and how its helping to normal or below middle class people for their transpotation .
