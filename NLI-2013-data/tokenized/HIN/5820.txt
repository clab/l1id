Globalisation means opening up of the domestic market to the outside world .
There has been development in all the areas and the situation is entirely different than it used to be twenty years back and therefore , i dont agree to the statement that , in next couple of years there will be lesser cars than they are now .

The world as a whole has been developing very fast .
There has been new discoveries , technologies , cost effective methods are being employed to increase production by reducing cost expenses .
New cars have been coming in .
Some years back , only few models of General Motor ( GM ) could be seen on roads but now the situation is different .

Competition has resulted in a slew of cars .
New companies are coming in the market and with their cost effective models , are luring the customers .
This kind of competition will continue to occur .
Consumer demand is also increasing .
People are becoming richer and richer , countries are flourishing and thereby affecting the demand .
Since the choice of car selection has become wide individuals from various walks of life are able to afford it within their budget .

Attitudes of people has also changed .
They now want to spend their life comfortably .
Since cars are a luxury commodity they dont mind to invest in it .
Unlike the people in the past who were merely interested in saving and were conservative , the new generation loves to face challenges .
They have become more pompous , also competition among the colleagues is the reason for such a lavish lifestyle .
Everybody wants to spent more money than his neighbour .
And this trend is going to continue in the future as well .

Nowadays , people have become so busy , for them time has become precious so in order to complete their work in time they always require an effective mode of transportation and nothing can be better than a car .

Hence , a redution in car use is a nightmare because people cant live without it .
It has become a neccesity for them .
