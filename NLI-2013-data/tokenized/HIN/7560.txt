Travelling can be perceived as a very niche art and different people indulge it in very different flavours and have a lot of personal touch to it .
Always travelling in the group with a tour guide is definitely not the best way to visit every place .
The destination and the members of the group would be a critical factor in deciding how you would like to plan for it .

Group travel with a guide is the best way to go around a city where you expect to mingle with people and there is little unknown factor in your travel and if the place you are visiting requires some historical and technical input which a guide can provide well .
Visiting a art gallery , amusement parks , Mayan ruins ets are some placed where a guide can enhance you experience .
Group travel to destinations which you are not well acquainted with and you have serious social and cultural diferences has advantages as a guide can help you avoid getting into embarrassing or possibly dangerous situations .
A non native person visiting Europe would prefer guided bus tours as he is totally new to this place but you would also find a more adventruous person in a similar situation would not be satisified by just going to the popular destinations and would like to mix with local people and explore the hidden secrets that the city has to offer .
This kind of experience cannot be had in group travel as its unlikely for locals to mix with a large group of foreigners .

One of the main issues in group travel is conflict of personal preferences .
Even though it alleviates some logistic issues during your travel it can also limit your experience and force you to spend time on things and places that are not as interesting to you and proportionatley lesser time on things you personally like to explore more .
Unless you are a group of people who have very similar interests and personalities , there are going to be differences of opinion on places to visit .

There are certain spiritual experiences like travel to Tibet or safari through the deserts of Rajasthan or hiking through a quiet , isolated valley in a national park which can only be experienced by a person travelling alone with a guide or in company of just one or two fellow travellers .
A large group would essentially destroy the experience of the trip .

Even though group travel has a lot of advantages due to the company of people who can assist you in unfamiliar place and the luxury of a guide who can tell you exactly where to go and what to see , it is not always the best ways to travel to all destinations .
Depending on the place you visit and the nature of your visit , going alone or in company of a person or two can greatly enhance you travelling experience .
