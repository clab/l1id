What is going to happen twenty years later , cannot be predicted accurately by anyone .
The use of cars will decline or increase depends a lot on the success of the contemporay researchers success , who are curently working diligently on finding an alternate renewable and cheap source of energy , which may help power the engines of the future automobiles .

If we do not find a replacement for gasoline as a fuel for driving the cars engines , this exhaustable fuel source will some day deplete .
In the situation of reducing supply of the fuel for the car , the prices of the oil will increase , making it less afordable .
The car companies may initially decrease the prices of their automobiles to lure the customers harrowed by the increasing oil prices .
This price decrease may not last long , since the car companies will realise later that it is more sensible to sell high priced cars to a few people and gain a higher profit by working less , rather than making more cars to gain the same or may be even lower profits .
Hence the number of cars on road may decrease .

Furthermore as the world economies grow more , the governments of the world would try to improve the public transport systems , and recomend to their citizens to favour it over the use of private vehichles .
The litreacy rate is also bound to increase with time .
Hence the literate and more sensible citizens would readily take the advise of the governments and start favouring public transport .
This would again decrease the number of cars .

If a new renewable and cheap fuel source is invented , initially the automobile industry may suffer due to the technological changes that it may have to adopt but , eventually this may bring about a boom in the automobile industry .
People would be interested in trying the new technology , and hence try to adopt it .
Cheap and non poluting fuel may make people want to own their own private vehicles .
The government will try to subsidise this new fuel to wean off its citizens from the use of gasoline .
Such moves will make people want more cars and hence the numbers of the cars on road may increase .
The growing population of the world is producing more consumers , hence the number of cars in the given circumstances are bound to increase .

Hence in conclusion I would like to say that the question of weather of not the number of cars in the future is goin to decline cannot be answered instantly .
It depends on the developments in science in the near future .
