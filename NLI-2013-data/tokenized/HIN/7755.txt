I believe that best way to travel is to travel alone .
Most importantly , this gives us an opportunity to explore the place on our own pace .
We do n't have to rush to keep up with the travel schedule provided by the tour guide especially when we want to do something else or want to be at a place where others are not interested and therefore not covered in the travel plan .
In this situation , travelling alone many turn out to be more productive and fun filled leaving more time to spend at the places which captivate our interest .
In addition , we do n't have to compromise our preference over the majority because the main aim of the group travel is to satisfy the majority rather than taking care of individuals which some people are expected to compromise .
For an example , if the group decides to go to an art museum , while my interest lies somewhere else say a tech museum at the other corner of the city .
There is no way both could fit into the schedule thus resulting in compromise on my part which is not acceptable to me .

The people who prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide can argue that guide can offer us valuable details about the place .
But there are other ways to get the same information such as internet which provides almost every detail one might expect to know about a place such as sightseeing locations , restaurents , important festivals that might coincide with your travel dates and so on .
Thus , it virtually elliminates the importance of tour guide .

Moreover , travelling alone also offers an unique opportunity to mingle with the natives which almost impossible if we travel in a group .
I describe this as unique because spending time with the natives is the best way to learn about their culture , customs , eating habits and other important characteristics not visible otherwise .
They can also give us valuable information about the monuments found in the area such as background history , the reason behind their construction , etc .

Though , there are a few advantages of a group travel , I prefer to travel alone as it offers the flexibility which is of foremost importance to me .
