Advertisement is the channel by which a product is displayed in the eyes of the masses for increasing its sellling power to the market as well as the people .
I personally feel that most advertisements are designed to effect people more than its actual worth .

Advertisements nowadays are based on marketing stratagies more than the quality of product itself .
I have had some personal experiences where i fell for the beatifully displayed advertisements and purchased products , only to regret later .
The colors , backgrounds , personal emotions and photography are enhanced to impress the people about the product .

One of the experiences that made me realize that a product is much more than what it is advertized as , is when i bought diet pills by watching a television commercial .
It was a 15 minute commercial where people talked about how the pill worked effectively on them and showed drastic results .
It definitely worked on me emotionally and i ordered the product .
It was an expensive purchase , hence expectations for the results were high .
I folowed the directions and time of usage only to realize that it didnt work without diet and exercise .
There was no difference in how i looked and i was extremely dissapointed .

The commercials on television , radio and newspapers are made more to attract buyers , than to actually display the truth about the quality and the genuineness of the product .
Advanced technology and photography make products look very attractive , even to a point where advertisements are targeted to effect that part of the human brain which would get effected by the way the advertisement has been displayed .

All in all , i believe advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There is always more information about the product that one needs to know besides the advertisement .
The Advertisements is the means to increasing the selling power of the particular product , hence only the positives will be shown .
I believe that laws should be made so that the companies are complied to give the true picture about the product , the good and the bad .
