I do not corroborate with the author that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
On the contrary , I feel that in general there is an increased awareness of one 's obligation towards society and towards the community one belongs to , and examples to reiterate this points can be seen in the various events and activities occuring around us .

Let us first dwell into what we mean my communities .
A community may be huge , as in the case of the country , or even the world , after all its a global community all of us live in .
It may even be small , like a small village which may only have inhabitants sharing a common family tree .
A community can be a group of people sharing similar thoughts , for example the community of female activists who who work towards the community of females , their rights and their enpowerment .
It may be the alumni of a university who seek to work towards the development , in what ever way possible , of their alma-mater .
Essentially a community is a group of people sharing similar thoughts , motives , ambitions , origin and a whole list of other attributes whose listing in itself will require lots .
Young people , realising what they owe to their origins from where they have come are actually playing a lead role in the development of their respective communities .

There are various instances of a boy from a small village of the under-privileged , somehow making it into an honourable university by virtue of hard work , going on to become a powerful industrialist or tycoon , and returning to his village to empower the people , to give them and the children out there what children in his days were deprived of .
No matter what the magnitude of help is , it is at least better than nothing .
People belonging to this genre not only donate money judiciously , but also their time .

Let me rather cite a personal example .
I am a member of the NSS ( National Social Service ) .
As the name suggests , it is aimed at helping the underprivileged through various ways .
More importantly , all of us are undergraduates .
There are a few students who go twice or thrice a week to teach children who cannot afford education subjects like Mathematics .
Others collect newspapers and spare stationery item from students in the campus , and the money we recover by selling these is used to buy books for those children belonging to the weaker sections of society .
More importantly , this is not a local organisation , it is an organisation operating actively at a national level .

Apart from such societies in which young people have enrolled in large numbers , there are a large number of young philanthropes who contribute very judiciously at times of tragedy .
Besides , many people volunteer to go to the unfortunate sites as well to provide relief to the victims , all this requires a lot of time .

There is an explicit line of difference between contributing with time and contributing with money .
Contributing with money alone does not necessarily sevre the purpose , what if the money goes into the wrong hands .
Th emobilisation of funde has to be monitored and contributions with time should be given an equal amount of emphasis , of not more , and a greater number of young people today understand it .

Gone are the days when the victims did not have any one to look up to when at need as several instances of history such as the recurrent draughts in the Rajasthan area of India has told us .
Although much still needs to be done , but we can all look towards a better future when more and more younger people will contribute with both money and time towards the upliftment of the downtrodden
