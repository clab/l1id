Different people have different views as to how they spend their life and what they weant to persue .
As time moves on , these goals and behaviours also change with the mindset and lives of people .
It is necessary for people to be able to live their age .
For example a high school student 's priority would be do excell in his studies and do well in school whereas a businessman 's would be to ensure he earns as much money he can .

The main difference between the people above in the example is that where one is a sixteen year old kid , the other is a thirty-five year old who probably has a family to support .
That does not mean that they live only for those things .
They live life the way they are supposed to , accordingly to their responsability .
Young people comparatively do n't have much to worry about and can enjoy themselves at a discotheque or play sports or what they are able to do .
Older people can indulge in more ` mature ' ways of having fun and enjoying life like watching an ` art ' movie or going for a cruise .

I personally do not agree with the statement as I feel that it does not take into consideration people 's lifestyles .
Young people can also watch and enjoy art movies if their lifestyle is like that .
Richard Branson the entrepreneur is a major risk-taker and lives life to the fullest .
People have their own ways and methods of keeping themsleves satisfied and enjoy life as the feel is right to them .
There have been plenty of cases where old people have gone water-skiing , I think that they are really enjoying their life !

True there are limitations when it comes to the age-factor , if the biological clock is ticking then one must face it and roll with it .
One can not expect an eighty year old to go rock climbing .
That same elderly person may enjoy him/her self in the compnay of friends or family .

Young people dont enjoy life more than older people , they enjoy it differently .
