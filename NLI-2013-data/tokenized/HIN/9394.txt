I completely disagree with this statement .
I think that the whole world is mainly dependent on the life facts .
Mr. Gandhi had said that if their is facts and truth in your life then you are on the verge to win the world .

In a class room when many students are listening a perticular lecture .
They mainly concentrate on the lecturer .
They listen to the only part which the lecturer is saying .
As a part of the study , lecturer provides them only the idea behind the topic .
And accordingly the student follow the instructions of the lecturer .
At this time students can not understand the topic because they have not any real example to support the topic .
They just mug the topic and leave it as a part of assignment and some may think that it is only a part of our syllabus .

On the other hand some students go in deep .
They analyze the topic .
They dont mug the topic .
They approach each other or go through the book to understand the concept behind the topic .
But in book , it is not compulsary that every book has mentioned the reality of the topic and from where it comes .
But some book conceptually explain this very well .
Various concepts are provided for a single thing .
Now student has multiple option for a single thing .
Fourtunately their topic becomes more clear by using this much amount of the concepts provided by the books .
But when they come in real life these concepts are worthless because there can not be a ' idea ' to handle the situation .
They do not know the facts about the life and by that they can not survive in this confused world .

Most of the time , the facts of the life are useful than ideas and concepts .
For doing science and mathematics study ideas and concept works but in real life the student should be aware of facts of life .

Life works on facts and truth not on illusive ideas and concepts though they are useful in study and in doing business .
