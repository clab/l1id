Being young and old are different phases of the same life we live on earth .
Every man goes through the young and old phase of his life or we might say most of them so he experiences almost everything .
I believe that young people more life than old people do .

You spend most quality time in young age compared to old age as this is started by you entering into teen age which also known as the crazy age as everyone does and experiences most of the crazy things in life at this age .
For example when you are young and enter college you are in a world of mischief a world you create on your own only for you to enjoy ignoring all the consequences you may have to face .
This is the first time you start bunking lectures on your own wish and go for movies , attending parties , you donot attend parties in old age .
Do you ?

Old people donot enjoy life as young people .
Most of the people in their old age are bedridden , having deseases , they hav undergone heart attack by this age .
This keeps you away from smoking , drinking and even dancing with your love ( your wife ) , in short the means to enjoy life .

Love reminds me that young age enjoys the joy of asking the girl out for a first time in your life .
It is a very joyous moment for the young guy experiencing it for the first time .
Later on in your life it becomes a habit and you want to take every girl on a date and shes ready if you are young .
Young people also get to experience the joy of the first day at work , everyone enjoys it and its different .
Then one day finally you get married to the girl you love and grow old with her and have kids .
All these happy moments are experienced when you are young .

However young people enjoy life not only because enjoying means being happy .
There is more to enjoyment than just happiness .
The dark side , when things start going wrong and you just cannot help it .
Many people are scared of experiencing such challenges in life .
I had a bad experince once in my life when everything atarted going wrong for me .
Nothing seemed to work and like everyone else i too was sad and depressed .
But i learned a lot from it .
My bad times taught me a lesson in life and if it wer n't for those bad times i would n't have been what i am today .
Pain they say is inevitable , so why not turn a masochist .
I have enjoyed my pain now and i feel what i am now , after what all happened to me gives me more joy than anything else in this world .

We can say that young age is the age when you start experiencing everything and old age is the age when you have experienced everything .
So experiencing is better than having experienced .
