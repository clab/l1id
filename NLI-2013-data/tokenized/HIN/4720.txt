Now adays advertisement is the best way to sell the products .
The companies are taking the advantage of the advertisement , Beacause advertisement shows the product more fancier than they really are .
I totally agree with this statement .
Advertisement make product more better by showing its good qualities , Size and comfortibility .

First , Advertisement only shows the good qualities of the product .
It attracts the consumers to buy that product .
Every one like tobuy good products in the market , Because good products are duable .
Second , Advertisement make product look In better size .
Now people like to buy small things like I-Pods , digital camaras etc .
In the advertisement these things look cute and small , which attract people to buy them .
If yiu go to store and look at the same things which were advertise are not has the same look as adevertise by media .
Finally , Advertisement shows that products are vary comfortable in use , but it ends up in not very comfortable in real .
People get fooled by the advertisement .

In conclusion , I like to say that most of the time People get fooled by the advertisement and buy the product , which are not as ggod as they look in advertisement .
