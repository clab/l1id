I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Young people are usually healthier than old people and are full of zest and energy .
Good health opens a lot of avenues for enjoyment to the youth .
They can go bungee jumping or sky diving if they please so .
Frail health limits the aged .
They have to think twice before performing even routine activities of life .

A lot of fun involves medium to high risk .
At a young age , people are able to take a lot of risks in life .
There is very less at stake for them .
And that is also how they learn .
However at an advanced age , it becomes very difficult to take even medium risks and the aged prefer to shun such activities which would involve risk .
How many times would anyone have seen grandma riding a motorbike ?

The young are more curious than the aged .
Hence experiencing new things is a source of joy and fun for the youth .
However the `` worldly wise '' aged has seen it all in life and there is rarely a thing which can excite them the way it excites the youth .

While young , people have a better ability to change .
The young are tuned into the times .
The elderly usually find it difficult to adapt to the changes of the current times .
For example , there are not many elderly who are comfortable with the latest technology and gizmos like the computer and the ipod .

Lastly the world is geared to cater to the needs of the young .
Besides medical care and certain specialized products for the aged , the TV is full of advertisements targetting the youth and children .
A visit to the malls , restuarants , pubs , entertainment parks and movies reiterates the same focus on the youth .
The entire economy churns out billions of dollars catering to the whims and fancies of the youth .

Hence young people definitely have more fun than the elderly .
