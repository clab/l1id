The young boy helped the old lady cross the road .
This is the stereotype on how the youth help their community is based .
According to me this extremely unfair .
The world has evolved and with it so should the defination of helping your community .

The youth of today contrary to general opinion are not so different from the youth of yester years .
We may express ourselves in a different way which may or may not be acceptable to society but at heart we do care for our friends , family and yes even our community .

A vast majority off all social , environmental development drives are carried out by the youth .
The soal purpose of these drives is the betterment of our communites , our society on a whole .

For instance in my school we carried out a `` Say no to Fire Crackers '' drive .
In my country the festival of Diwali is a grand affair which is celebrated with great zeal and vigour .
Bursting mind boggling amounts of fire crackers is a part of the festival .
These firecarcker are made by poor children as the are a cheap source of labour .
My not supporting the booming fire cracker industry we not only aided a social cause but also majorly decreased the excessive pollution linked with the festival .

The youth of today may be caught up in their own issues but that does not we sacrifice the welfare of our communites .
It is not uncommon to see child picking up a wraper or can from the road and throwing it in the nearest bin .
We still carry out our responsibilities as proud citizens of our respective countries .

My school bus had stopped at a crowded intersection on my way back home from school .
A motorcyclist on our side of the road dint mangae to break in time hit an on coming car and fell of his bike .
Our bus driver saw the man fall and decided not to stop the bus as he felt other would come to his aid .
One of my seniours ( i was in 7th grade ) though immediately told the driver to stop the bus and ran to the injured motorcyclists aid .
He told the bus driver to conitue on and took the cyclist to hospital in a taxi on his own .

This was just an example of somthing which is quite commonplace in todyas world .
