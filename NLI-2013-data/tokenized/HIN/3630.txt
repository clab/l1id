It is a general opinion that youngsters do not give enough of their time in helping their communities .
I agree with this statement .

In today 's fast paced life , hardly any youngster would even give this a serious thought .
Helping the community could mean something as simple as organising evening classes for destitutes in the own hall , or organizing an event for the orphnage children , to collecting funds for building a new school or college .
But how many youngsters actually think beyond the days ' work ?

Consider the case of a student in high school .
A typical day would begin at eight in the morning , classes for the better part of the day , then maybe some soccer or piano lessions in the evening .
And then , of course , the usual homework sessions that stretch into the night .
Not to mention the ` discotheque parties ' that form an integral part of their weekly itenary .
How are they supposed to find time in their ` busy ' schedule for community work ?

Even fresh graduates , just entering the job scene , are not spared .
They have late night schedules , loads of work , and very little time for anything else .
Even their families expect a portion of their time and energy .
It is virtually impossible for them to squeeze in some time for a visit to an elder 's home or community centre to help out .

There are a lot of expectations from someone who has just entered graduate school or someone who has got a new job .
They put in their entire energy trying to live up to these expectations , and finally do not have the energy , or even the inclination , for anything else .
If you consider their side of the story , it would seem rather unfair , considering their workload , if they had to put in some more effort for the betterment of their community .
After all , they would say , `` are n't the clergymen supposed to take care of that ? ''

But what they do not realize , is that each one of us has to contribute , in the maximum possible way , to help our community .
A proper division of time and workload would ensure that even college students and working youngsters find enough time in their schedule to do their bit for their community .
