YES i agree that young people do not get time helping their communities .
the reason for this i think is the increasing of the fast and busy life and also because of more and more increasing compettition .
this leads to the pressure on the young people and require to struggle as much as they can to lead a succesful life .

earlier the fight for the facilities , employment , leisures of life were not so difficult to achieve .
this may be because the earlier life was more simple .
but as there is a boom of technologies and introduction to new fields , the young people require much harder effort and persisstance to get through the comming challenges .
earlier the structure of the societies was also different than it is today .
their was much more interaction between people and the young ones and the adults would participate together .

Another reason of the availability of less time for the young people can be because of the introductions to more and new means of entertainment , interaction etc.entertainment like television etc. and interaction facilities such as internet chats or mobile services etc.therefore the young people spend most of the time in either struggling for their better lives or spending time with new means and sources for leisure whenever they get free time .
for example a person with the same 24 hours if given a choice would do more productive work which would be beneficial for him in future than spending time to interact with people .
the phrase ' survival of the fittest ' is now best suitable for the developing societies and young people wants to cope up with the speed to find their way for their easy survival .
even in case of small children , the increase in the difficulty of their subjects and the increasing load has restricted them to spend more time in playing with their friends .

i would say that the young one are not to be blamed of the current senario because the situation has created a need for them to behave in a more introvert rather than more extrovert manner .
the young people , s behaviour is changing due to change in the structuring of the overall society .
the society is forcing the young ones to fight more for their future than living the present and spending time to socialise and time witheir communities .

The above reasons i think justifies that why young people do not give enough time to help their communities .
