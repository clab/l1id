Basic education in school covers a wide range of subjects .
Schools try to impart broad knowledge of many subjects to students .
However , after graduation , a person has to take up a particular role in an organization or society .
In order to perform his role effectively he needs to specialize in his job .
I believe that foucs on specialization is very important in today 's world .

People contribute to the society in different ways .
Some people produce grains while others defend the society .
The social system makes sure that people cooperate with each other and everyone takes up different responsibilities .
This division of work leads to a more prosperous society .
Hence people need to choose their specialization and make their contribution to society .

Some activities , like research , need specialists .
If someone is planning to undertake reseach , he needs to devote a lot of time to his topic of reseach .
Today 's world is very complex .
He will be more productive is all his energy and plans are focussed in one area .

In conclusion , I believe that specialization is very beneficial to society .
In fact , specialization is the need of the hour .
Hence , as soon as students complete their basic education , they should identify their strengths and pursue a career that utilizes his strength .
