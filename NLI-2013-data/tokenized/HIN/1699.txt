`` Jack of all trades and master of none '' .
Well yes !
I totally agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

I look at eductaion as primarily an aid to better living , enriching lives of the recipients with its vast and varied database .
Life itself cannot be compartmentalised into few specifics .
It is actually the amalgamation of a wide gamut of experiences , problems , oppurtunities , successes , failures , emotions , relationships and the like .
Thus , to deal with such a vast range of things definitely requires some sort of formal education about the broad features of various academic subjects .

For example , for a home-maker , to successfully run and manage the house , only an education in basic cooking or rather the home-sciences is not enough .
He/She needs also to be equipped with the broad details of mathematics , economics , social sciences , etc. to be able to better execute the responsibilities at hand .

Further I believe that knowledge of diverse domains promotes the all-round development of an individual .
The person is much better aware of the socio-political factors affecting him and his surroundings and is able to make informed decisions about his life in particular and the society in general .
On the other hand , a specialist in a particular field might find it quite challenging to deal with issues that are beyond his domain .
This will put him at a great disadvantage as compared to the other generalists in his surroundings .

In terms of interpersonal relationships also , the specialists find it quite difficult to relate to people who are not from their field of study .
On the other hand , having being exposed to a broad spectrum of topics , the generalists find it quite comfortable to get along with even radically different people .
This helps in strengthening their contacts and improving their communication skills .

Lastly I feel that since we have only one life to live , we must make the most of it and fill up our lives with as many possible experiences that we may percieve so that we may not have any regrets on having missed out on anything in life .
