I completely agree with this statement .
There is no doubt that the advertisements do make a product look much better that they actually are .
We should understand that the adverstisements are aired to make consumers familiar of a product and to promote its sale .
If a company has launched a product it has to have maximum sale in order to have profits .
So , they try to attract the attention of the comsumers by projecting it as the best product available in the market .
Every company advertises its product as a super product as if no other product would ever be able to beat their product in terms of quality and price effectiveness .
I feel that they try to fool innocent people for their own intrests .
These days , companies project the researches about the products .
They just project the good qualities of the product and hide the negative ones to mislead people .
For example , they wiill air that the studies have established that their product is better that the product A , B , C and D in X , Y , Z parameters but they will hide the other parameters the product is not good in .

I feel that a good quality product does not need any fancy advertisement , its quality speaks for itself and such a product will become popular with population just by word of mouth .
According to my feelings , making a decsion to buy a product just because it is advertised as a very good product is utter foolishness and a waste of money .

I , myself have been a victim of fancy advertisements .
But , I learnt my lesson of not going by advertisements by incurring heavy monetary losses .
I now feel that it is resposibility of individuals to protect themselves from falling into the trap that companies lay to extract money from consumers by advertising .
