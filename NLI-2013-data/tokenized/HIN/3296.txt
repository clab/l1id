I partially agree with statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
They are more after creating a comfortable niche for themselves even if it may demand seclusion from the community they came from .
But the scenario is slowly changing .

The first thing which may be useful to analyse is the focus of the young people today .
Where are they looking themselves after 10 years of their study ?
Will their work help the community they come from ?
Today 's generation is more interested in high profile jobs which will help them earn more .
These are areas like software programming , telecommunications , research labs etc .
Very few people are today interested in taking up positions in the Non Govermental associations which work for the community on a no profit basis .
Also , it has been noticed few people actually want to become professors at universities and this has even led to the shortage of faculty at certain educational institutes .
Thus there is a slow drift from the jobs which actually work for the community .
Some people may argue that an Indian researcher at Microsoft Research is contributing to the community besides a comfortable life also .
But the bigger question is if the new technology built by him be available to the Indian below poverty line and that too at a easible cost .
Clearly no .
Thus , if young need to contribute to their community through their work , the work must be focussed and not just a pretence for such an argument .

Most of the young after completing their graduate education take up the lucrative job offers abroad .
These includes high profile banking jobs , research lab positions , or even the jobs that are similar to that in their own country but are `` abroad '' .
These people , the Non Resident citizens ( NRC ) then give grants to the government and feel satisfied that they have done their bit towards the community .
But actually a large fraction of this money goes directly into the pockets of a few corrupt politicians .
The money could have been well utilized if the NRC could have come down to his own country , spent some time there and looked after the utilization of his grant .
But that is the foremeost question .
The generation today does not have `` time '' .
The mindset of the young clearly needs to be changed .

On the other hand , many institutes around the world today have realized this need of students having to contribute to the society that actually built them .
For example , the Indian Institutes of Technology have started a scheme where it is the part of curriculum of the student to actually spend some time doing some service to the society .
This includes going in the schools and taking classes , working for better living conditions by taking up sanity projects in the nearby underdeveloped colonies .
Though the students were intially skeptical towards scheme called the National Service Scheme , but now they have realized the importance of this work and are coming forward to take up various projects .
Such schemes if implemented , can bring about the changes in the attitude of the young .

Focussed more on career , the young generation today is losing its focus from contributing to the society they have actually come from .
They tend to delve into the comforts of their own lives that helping the community around them .
This has to change if society needs to progress .
However , many attempts in various parts of the world have initiated this process of changing the mindset of the young and have been successful .
The young have now started to realize their responsibilities and to share with the community what it has given to them .
