The young generation of today is part of global world which is evolving very fast and has become very demanding for all the people who are an intergral part of it .
The life of today embraces only those things which can help people to run faster in their life to achieve their sky high ambitions .
Thus to say that the young people of today 's world do not have enough time to slow their life and take out some time for helping their community is not an overstatement .

First , the global mantra of modern world is to get the best of everything in every sphere of life to be able to become very successful .
What this results in is an inner drive in all the young people to go to the best school , best college and then get the most paying jobs .
However , this does not mean that these young people do not spend some time with other people around them and help them .
But the community service mostly done today is done to get some good voluntary work on their resume to be able to make it to best college .

Second , i feel that there is lot of pressure on these young people to perform the best .
This pressure includes both peer pressure at workplace or place of study and also social pressure in the society which does not recognize people unless they are on top of every activity .
This increased pressure has resulted in young people becoming part of only those groups which include people who have similar goals and aspirations .
As a result , these young people feel that is it waste of time by doing something like community service on regular basis that does not promte their own ambitions .

Finally , i feel that the work load of all young people has increased .
The school work hardly result in any time for these young minds to take out some time even for their parents .
The extra long working hours of the wokplace also ensure that people are out of house for most part of day all week .
My example is most suited for such situation cause I spend atleast fifteen hours daily for six days in week at my job place and there are times when i do not get a chance to even talk to my parents for weeks in row .
The one off hoilday here and there is spent by me with my friends .
Thus very little time remains with me to be able to do some help to other people .

However , there are still certain examples today of people who have left colleges and their well paying jobs to start some venture to help their community , The example of a famour NRI is inspiration for all who left his multi million dollars job to start micro finance project in rural India which has become the first and biggest organisation of such kind .
There are other examples too where young college students have gone to rural areas to teach the farmers and help them to manage their business .
These students have formed a NGO in Delhi which has affiliation from more than 10,000 students all over India and are involved in giving reaching classes in 35 villages in 5 states in India .

In conclusion , i feel that the youth of today is too engrossed in his own life and thus find difficult to do anything for the people around him .
Not to mention , that there are people who are able to manage this so called busy schedule of theirs and realise that helping others is the biggest virtue of human beings , These people perform the dual role of achieving their ambitions and also helping some people round them in whatever way they want can .
