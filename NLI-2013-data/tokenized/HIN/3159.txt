Happiness and enjoyment is a perception and has no relation with age .
I donot agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

When a man is young , he has to make a career and has a lot of responsibilities on his shoulders .
Though he is more physically active , but he may not have the resources to enjoy the way he wants .
His social and personal obligations would keep him occupied all the time .
On the other hand a person who has the time and resources and has got the maturity to understand his needs , can live a happier life .
He knows what would give him pleasure and would not merely experiment with things .
He knows the value of time and money and would utilize it more effeciently .

Enjoyment is not just going to night clubs or do adventure sports .
A person can enjoy a stroll in th park or a sun tan on the beach .
But for enjoyment you need a relaxed mind .
A mind free of tensions and anxieties .
I see more older men , who have achieved their goals enjoying life than their younger counterparts .

I went for a cruise this year end with my parents and girlfrend .
There were people from all walks of life and different generations on the ship .
People were enjoying their heart out but to my surprise it was the older people who were looking happier .
There was a newly married couple who were on their honeymoon and had a room next to me .
I could listen to their fights every night .
There was another couple who didnot have much time to talk as the guy was always busy on his laptop and the cellphone .
Majority of the young people did not look happy and satisfied .
They had goals to be achieved .
They didnot have time to sit back and enjoy their accomplishments .
They had worries which could not leave them even on a vacation .
A person who cannot maintain a balance between his personal and professional life cannot enjoy life .
Therefore , I feel an older person can enjoy life more than a young person does .
