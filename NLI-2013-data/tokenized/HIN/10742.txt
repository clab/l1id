I totally agree with the statement that ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '
Let me start it by supporting myself with a saying - ' WINNERS DONT DO DIFFERENT THINGS , THEY DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY ' .
History gives ample examples of people who chose a different pathway for them altogether to achieve succes in what they believed .
Taking risks comes in way of trying out at new things .
Of course people are worried because of unseen worries by selecting a path less travelled .
Quoting names of few people hailing from different regions of society and from different disciplines but successful in there deeds - MAHATMA GANDHI , ELBERT EINSTEIN , WRIGHT brothers , HENRY FORD , BILL GATES , SACHIN TENDULKAR , MICHAEL SCHUMACHER .
All these people achieved success .
Success does not only come from a studies oriented field which is clear from the examples stated above .
Every one is not created with a same bent of mind , there are people wgo are strong in sports and other extra curricular activities .
They perform well in those fields but only if they choose to take a risk of choosing a track different from the usual .
There lies the risk but it is only psychological if they are ready to work gard towards it .
Who said success cant be achieved in sports ?
Who said freedom could not be achieved with non violence ?
No one choosing to do a regular task would believe the fact that a brick layer 's son ( Michael Schumacher ) would be a success synonym with car racing .

Ideas develop in thoughts and thoughts have to differ to develop new ideas , and wright brothers are perfect example for that - noone thought of flying in air but their different approach led to the gretest inventions of all time - the AEROPLANE .

All these factors sum upto a success story .
New things and ideas and taking risks only lead to development .
