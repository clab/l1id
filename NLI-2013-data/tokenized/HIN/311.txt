I totally agree with the satement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
It is somehow true that successfull people always try to do new things involving high risks to see their capibility to fight with the world .
Some people only try new things because of their high interest innvolved in that particular field .

When a new born baby come to this world , he doe not know anything about reading , eating , and other activities of our daily life .
As our life moves on , the child comes to know new things like how to eat poperly , how to play , how to write , and so on , which helps child understand life better .
It also helps understand people with different beliefs and opnions .

Doing what a person already knows will not help anyone in any way .
For example , if a person has finished his school and wants to become a scientist , he will not be successful and will not reach his goal until he study futher doing some experiments and researchs .
One should always try hard to understand new things and apply them to their daily life .

If a person is unsuccessful in his first attempt , he should not stop practicing thinking that he in uncapable of doing it , however , he should bring some fantasy in himself and should redirect his negative feelings into positive activities .
One should always remember the most couraging line that `` Practice makes a man perfect '' .

There is a story of a spider who tries to climb a high wall to reach his web .
He falls again and again even before he completes half of its way to his web .
But he never stops trying having faith that , one day he will reach to the top .
His positive attitude towards life and his practice makes him successful leading him to to his web one day .
this story is a good example
