I agree with statement that nowdays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This has resulted form a cumulative effect of various factors like the fast pace of the life , changing global scenario , changing perspectives etc .

Due to fast pace of the life , the amount of time a person spends with his family has steadily decreased .
This has accompnied with a substancial reduction in time that a person spends in the community .
Also living in nucleated families lead to increase in responsibilities and thus further leads to decrease in time available for him to spend in helping his community .

Young people nowdays have become very narrow minded in there outlook as they feel that instead instead of spending time for helping their communities , they can devout the same time to earn more and thus live a lavish life .
During this course they forget that human being is a social animal and by helping his community he is in turn helping himself .
This thirst to become rich overnight and desire to live a comfortable life by cutting down on the time they spend in helping there community is the underlying principle behing this change .

We see this in our day to day life .
During the celebration of various festivals we find that most of the arrangements and other things are looked after by our parents and elders .
We rarely see any young mind working there as he feels that it a waste of both him time and energy .
This fact becomes self explainatory when we observe the strength of the young people present at the meeting meant for improving services and facilities available to the community .

To conclude , we can say that this unhealthy change that is being observed in our society will have malignant effect and must be balanced by taking necessary and efficient steps .
