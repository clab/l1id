Every statement has two sides one is negative and other is positive .
but i will take a balanced stand for the above statement .
In twenty years there will be few cars in use , if technology advances as rapidly as one can think .
on the other side , there will be more cars in use than today .

Firstly , if government tries to emphasize only on the profit making tasks then there will be very few cars in future .
the people who are already in power tries to overcome the middle class and low class people .
they will try to be at the highest level .
on the other side of the coin , if goverment make some policy that rich people can own limited facilities .
then other middle and low class people come into limelight .
So they can start thinking of facilitation .

Secondly , if government concernd just with economy , then we can say that there will be fewer cars in the future .
To maintain the system , government needs financial support also .
if every one tries to buy a car , then there must be lowest economy level .
it can cause the problem of valueless resources .

Thirdly , as the technology advances , rich people try to get the latest facilitation .
but middle class people remain with their old cars .
this advancement can be in face of less expensive things .
so that other people can also purchase the same latest technology car .

In sum , i conclude that the number of cars will be fewer if currency value will be higher .
this number can be increased if currency value will be less .
So currency level is dependent upon the economical state of the country .
If the government is well concerned about the the growth and developement of the entire country then there will be higher numbers of cars in the furure .
