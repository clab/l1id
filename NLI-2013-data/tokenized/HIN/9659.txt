Today in our world no one can not count his success without taking risk .
If one wants to successful he must have to take risk .
Without risk one can not success .
I m agree with this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already known how to do well .

First , successful people have good expiriance about his business so they wants to use his expiriance in other business .
By doing this they also know new things and also knowing new business stretergys .
These stretergy helps them to creat their business more powerfull and strong .
For ex. recently a popular industrialist from India under take a gient steel company of Europe .
His exprince helps him to buy this company .

Second , successful people are already having good setteld business so they can give their more time to new business which they started .
By taking this risk , starting new business they also come in touch of new people from another industries .
By comung in touch of these people one can study another industries and it help him lot in new business risk .
A business man started softwear comoany but he does note have expiriance about it but keeping touch with other I.T companies it helps him lot in his new business .

Third reason is successful people have already earn good amount of mony from their business so they have good balance of mony to spend on new business .
They allways wants to be successful so they never think about risk .

It is true that successful people try new things and take risk but in todays competitive world every one have to take risk to became successful .
If one take risk for being successful his chance will incresing to be a sucessful .
