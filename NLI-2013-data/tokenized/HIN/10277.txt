I would like to start by stating an old idiom ` Nothing succeeds like success` !
Which implies that if one suceeds in one field he is more likely to succeed in other fields also .
And I think it 's true and successful people do have better chance in in succeeding in new fields .

Firstly switching to any fild requires finance and funds at disposal .
And if one has succeeded in a particular field he would definitely be having savings or earning to take risks .
And eVen if they loose they have cushion behind them as they can again go back to the field in which their name has already been establishjed .
And to add to this when one has earned fame or goodwill in one field they can easily utilize that goodwill in other type of fields too .
we have many examples of well known actors switching to modelling and endorsing commercial brands .

The most important factor according to me is confidence .
Success brings confidence togeather with it and is the main factor that encourages the person to take risk and succeed .
Moreover a successful person is having experience which he can very well utilize to gain and reducing the probability of failiure .

This is true that one should not gamble in a field he is having less knowledge of but also one should not be adverse to risk , as risk and success are directly related .
one who is taking risk may or may not succeed , but one who does not try and take risk can never succeed .
And its quite obvious that a sucessful person can take risk with much less fear .

In the end I would like to conclude by saying ` RISK is not everyman 's GAME ' and a'A SUCCESSFUL PERSON IS THE ONE WHO TRYS NEW THINGS RATHER THAN STICKING TO ONE !
