The media of today is a very powerfull tool .
In other words the media is the king of the world .
Whatever is shown in the telivision , in the newspapers and the magazines ia greately influencing the public .
Children and even some adults get carried away buy thir tactics .
The influence may be negative or positive .
I believer that they sometimes mislead the people .
Thus i completely agree that the advertisements make the products seem much better than they are .

Adversitements that are in forms of writting on paper or those seen visually on the telivision are very different from those that they actually show or tell us .
Firstly the product shown in these advertisments are not what they actually show us .
Lets take the example of medicines .
The advertisements in a mere ten to fifteen seconds try to explain us for what it should be taken and for what if it should be avoided .
They may inform us that they do wonders for , like lets take an example of a patient of some heart disease .
They may tell us that the can help cure or treat high cholestrol in just one month and also tell that you need not follow a diet conrtol ..
But scientifically how can a high cholestrol be cured in a month and that to without havin a diet control .
Thus i believe that these can be missleading Sometimes they may tell us that any kind of skin problem be it on face or any other part of the body can be taken care of .
They may use the words like `` magical cream '' .
The patients may believe them .
They may use them but in vane .
Actually this is just a tactic they follow to fool us .

Lets take another example of a `` hair remover cream '' .
The advertisements may show a beautiful girl with no hair on her face or legs .
She would say ... `` for a silky skin like mine use so and so cream '' .
The irony is that they already have talek a girl who had no hair on her face or legs .
So are they not trying to mislead the people .

The advertisments tell us that if we buy for example a laptop on this particular day , u will get a printer and a scanner `` free '' with it .
They do this not to tell us to come and buy them but to fool us .
They before hand had already hiked the price of the laptop so as to acomodate the cost of the other things with them .
Morever i am a firm believer of the fact that `` nothing in this world come for free '' Thus i completely believe that most of the advertisemants make the product seem much better than they are .
So before buying them one should definately do their `` homework ''
