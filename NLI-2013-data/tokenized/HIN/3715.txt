The statement raises an important issue of the modern society .
I completely agree to this statement .
It has been seen that as the society is progressing the interaction of youth with the society , that constitutes its proximity , is decreasing .
This declining communication restrains them from taking the initiative of supporting their communities .

With the advances in technology young people have started spending more time in playing with the devices that they treat as the sources of entertainment .
Consider for example television and computer .
If an option between watching television or doing some social work is given to a bunch of young people then most of them would choose to stay at home and watch some TV show rather than taking the pain of doing social work .
These technological gadgets and sources that promises to amuse the user do very little to motivate them for any community help .
Hence they never realize the need of involving themselves into any social help .

Moreover very little efforts are put into to make the young people realize about the responsibility of helping out the nation and community .
Young people do n't want to help their country because they can survive happily without doing that .

Another reason that might supplement the above mentioned reason to spare very little time for the young people is the expectations of the family .
Every family wants to see their children as a succesful person .
Very few families would like to see them as a citizen who is trying hard to help his community .
This combined with the vast variety of sources of entertainment pushes the youth into a vicious circle where he/she either spend his time trying to fulfill his dreams or relaxing after the long duration hard work .

These points explains the reasons for the unavailability of enough time with the young people .
But this should not be a justification .
The modern society , which we call the developed society , is actually abasing itself if we compare the behaviour of the today 's youth with that of the previous generation .
