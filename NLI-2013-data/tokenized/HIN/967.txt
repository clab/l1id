In olden days we use to hear people saying `` Jack of all and Master of none '' .
Well , it means that the particular person is skilled enough to perform many tasks but not in depth .
These people can find jobs , works in many different places earlier but not today .
Yes , today we belong to the world of Specialization .

By specialization we mean that the person is not master of all but Jack of one thing in particular .
These principles apply to our daily schedules , programmes and studies even .
Like around us we can observe the height of miniaturization being achieved by companies , scientists etc .
These can only be achieved if the person has a thorough knowledge about a particular subject , regarding its principles , designs oriented its pros and cons and many other things .
As a result it takes people to study further go for Masters , we can see people pursuing their Ph .
D 's in a particular topic which an undergraduate student would have read under a chapter .
So knowledge in depth about the particular topic or a subject can result in many interesting conclusions and its amazing results can benefit people later on .
Though it requires a lot of hardwork to have knowledge in depth but on the other hand it can help the world with new discoveries and inventions .

But along with the specialization one needs to take care regarding the fattigue which results to an individual practising the same instrument for many years .
As a result along with specialization person should involve in various other activities too so that his interest in a particular application is maintained .
Since its the world of specialization so we need to be specialized in a particular task and help this world with its demanding needs .
And along with it we need to take care of our interests , refresh ourselves well within time and work more enthusiastically in future .
