I think to be succecssful you do n't need to do different things but to do things differently .

Success :

What is success and what the essential ingredients which makes a situation or a person successful ?

In simple terms , success is acheiving goals with maximing efficiency .
To set goal for himself and envision the future is what successful man do differently .

In life everybody makes series of decisions and it depends on the permutation and combination of thoses decisions which destines how a person or a situation will come out finally .
How much a person is ready to take risk will determine how commited he is to his goals .
Coupled with this commitment an innovative approach will imparts maximum efficiency to an endevour .

I want to give example of Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani who established Reliance empire in less than a life-time .

He started his career in a gas station as fuelman in some distant middle eastern country .
He decided to quit his job there come back to India and use Stock excahnge to new heights .

He has to his credit making stock market familar to common man .
Stock market did exist before his advent but common man was quite aloof from it .
He gained most of his financial strength from people 's money .

He also used the political spectrum of the era to greater use for the well being of his business .
He was most political savvy businessman of his time which others never though of using .

Things were existing before him entering the business sphere but he gave a real meaning to them and shown the world how to use things .

This example makes it amply clear that it is how you do a thing that matter and not what you do .
