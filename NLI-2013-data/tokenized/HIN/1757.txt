Something about everything and everything about something .

That is my moto in life .
One cannot either deciede to take any one of the above , that simply wont be enough .
As normal functioning humans in this day and age of information explosion , we cannot choose to be ignorant about anything .
Also indepth knowledge about some particular subject is also very important for our own professional success .

As far as academic subjects are concerned , the key word here would be time .
When a person is in school , his subject study should be as broad as possible .
He should learn literature , science , arts , maths and everything else which canbe covered in his curicullum .
School is the time when the brain is developing and the mind is growing .
The child in this time should get the widest exposure possible .

One in graduate college , the course he chooses should be more specific but also include subjects covering wider toipcs .
A medical sciences students should be taught about digital circuitry too as should psychology be included in a course on engineering .
The student must have an option of branching out or even experimenting .
Also having related knowledge only helps in understand how varied information canbe utilized to help in what would seem to be unrelated subjects .

Then further on with post-graduate and research based study the students can aquire more specialized knowledge about the subjects of their interest .

But as I stated earlier , the whole question about broad knowledge or specialized knowledge would depend upon the fact that when is the question being asked .
In relation to a school student , broad subject study is essential and otherwise he would just be isolated from the many different things he could learn and become .

In relation to agraduate student , the coursework needs to have a direction of flow but the coverage of topics should be wide as it shall allow experiment and improvisation .
Then as post-graduate and then doctorial specializations come up the nature of knowledge should narrow down drastically .

But as far as life is concerned , a combination of the two will be elementary to success .
Moreover with increasing pressures on democracy , overpowering multinationals and a growing global marketplace , inormation and knowledge might just save the day .
