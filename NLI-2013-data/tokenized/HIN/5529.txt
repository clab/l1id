I agree with the statement that most advertisenments make products seem much better that they really are but not always .
Media nowdays plays a big role in making correct decisions .

Advertisements are used to promote selling of products so that the company can have profits .
It is never for the sake of one 's good .
Companies care for their profits and loss and that 's the reason why laws have been enforced for making advertisements to protect privacy of people and filter the content of the advertisement .

Insurances are to protect people not to show their lifestyle or something .
By saying that what I mean is the better insurance that you get people think that the better off you are .
By better insurance I mean the reputed one or the one that has a lot of media influence .
For ex , I see an advertisement for Geico Car Insurance almost everyday on the T.V. trying to get more customers by saying that their prices are lower , but what it turns out to be is that they reduce prices in one place but make up for that and profits in another section .

It is basically tricking people .
Like if you do n't you well on a certain part of the test you try to make up for it in the other section but it does n't help because it affects your grade anyways .

Advertisements are not always like that they sometimes they are made in favor of the well being of the people .
For ex. There is ad which asks parents to be friendly with their teenage children and talk to them about not going on the wrong way like becoming alcoholic or smoking .
I think that ads like that are not bad and they just help reduce generation gaps in my views .

In conclusion , it depens on the type of the ad wheter it is trying to make the product seem much better or not .
But most of times the statement is unfortunately true .
