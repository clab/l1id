The world in which we are living today is shrinking .
With the advent of computers and internet , it is possible to stay back at home and work .
Daily we are flooded with so much information .
Today , undoubtedly , information is the key to success .
In this new environment , it is important that one should possess variety of information .
Lots of new opportunities are created because of these radical changes .
However , I believe that though variety in learning is important , specialization in one subject is critical for the survival .

With the increasing competition , maintaining the superiority and growth potential in one 's profession is becoming increasing difficult .
If you are not the best then somebody who is , will definitely replace you .
It is particularly important in today 's scenario .
There is a lot of change happenning around us .
Sometimes good and sometimes bad .
Consider an example of recession in the U.S IT industry in the year 2001 .
Lots of software professionals were fired and given pink slips in those days .
However , those who had sound knowledge and degree behind them managed to stay back in business .

Consider an example of a doctor .
If someboby is suffering from a heart problem and needs an heart transplant , he will definitely prefer a cardiac surgeon and not an M.B.B.S who has the knowledge about all medical problems .
In short , some professions strictly need super specialized knowledge to be successful .

If we are talking about primary education and even undergraduate studies , learning many subjects is of prime importance .
However , when we taught about graduate studies and work environment , it is extremely important to have specialized knowledge .

I will summarize by repeating that a broad knowledge base is of no use unless we use it in acquiring specialization in one specific subject .
