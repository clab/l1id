I disagree to the statement that young people today give less time to helping community .

I myself form a relevant example .
I am twenty-seven years old and have been actively involved in community service for the past six years now .
I have taken up various types of projects .
I have given lectures in health camps organized for the slum dwellers .
I have organized blood donation camps with the colleagues at my workplace .
While I was in Gemany , I tutored English to students and job-seekers from various parts of the world who had come to Germany for studies and work but could not afford the costly language school .
Being an Electrical Engineer , I have volunteered to teach professional courses of Electrician , to help people make a living for themselves .
Currently I am working with a project for rural women .
I am organising this project in order to build expertise in rural women to take up small tasks which can help them earn a living and also rear the traditional rural art of cooking , stiching , embroidery , etc .

And it would not at all be strange to reveal that all the activities that I have mentioned above have been done in groups of fellow young students and professional .
I name us all `` philanthropic enthusiasts '' .
I have seen people from different backgrounds joining hands to improve the society around .
And whenever I have asked the amateurs about the reason behind their interest for community , I have got the same answwer .
That they all get a strange satisfaction in these volunteer activities .
This feeling of fulfillment fills the void in their lives which is created by the day to day struggle at university , office , personal relationships , etc .

In fact , i feel that young people today are more active than they were a decade ago .
This may in turn be to some part attributed to the education system across the globe .
Schools and Universitites today mandate that a particular number of hours per week be spent in community service .
This madate helps student learn the advantages of such work and in the process they start loving it .
They also realise that how the volunteer work serves dual purpose , of enhancing the community and the individual as well .
