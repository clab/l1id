I agree with the statement that `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
The twenty first century is accompanied with a lot of growth and development in science .
Globalisation has led to a lot of countries coming to our country and trading here .
This is generally seen to leave an impact on people .
The cultural values are slowly fading away from our society .
Young people are given the responsibility to help their community move ahead and have a strong stand in the society .
Unfortunately , the younger generation has failed to divide their time and use it to the fullest .

The cultures are changing at a very high pace .
It is seen that the young people want to take an easier path and go with the flashy stuff .
Little do they realise that by doing this they will eventually let their community to fade away in the longer span of life .
They are so impressed by other lifestyles and communities that they forget their responsibility .

People are migrating to different countries .
Most of the countries have formed a group of a certain community people .
But , it is seen that there are very few who work whole-heartedly for their communities .
Others , usually either do n't have time or are reluctant to help .

It is also seen that the younger generation lack the sense of responsibility .
They have taken it rather too lightly .
They will have time to go to a party with friends or go to a holiday with the family but find it too difficult to take out time for community development .

Helping out their community is rather a kind of formality for them .
They might pay the yearly allowances but never care to go and check if its actually being used to the fullest .
Even if they make it a point to attend to it at certain intervals and make some improvement , it would make a lot of improvement .

What is required is their full support and their ideas to help it flourish .
They should realise that it is a kind of an investment .
This will never go waste .
The more they will help , the more the next generation is going to benefit from it .
This should give it importance because if not looked upon now , the values will become extinct sometime .
No-one will care for their origin .
It will come as a setback later .
The hardwork of our ancestors should not go waste .
