I strongly agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
While learning facts has its own place in education , these limit the students to ideas and opinions of other people rather than thinking on their own .

Where as learning facts gives the student mere information on things and is very specific information on any one subject , understanding a concept or an idea , i.e understanding the ` why ' behind things or the logical sequence and reasons for a paticular event taking place , gives the student the abbility to reason out things for himself when faced with a similar problem .
This approach of learning to think logically which is aquired by understanding ideas and concepts applies as much to practical life as it does to academics .
A person with a strong sense of reasoning will be much better equipped to face challenges and find a solution to a problem than a person brought up memorising facts .

Also , after the student life when the person has to start a career , and face and solve new problems that he has never encountered in his life , the conceptual and understanding approach will help him find his way through a difficult situation .
Moreover , while facts may be applied to a specific area of study , conceptual skills and understanding abilities encourage analytical thinking and sharpen analzsing abilities which have applications in all areas of life , and aid in practical decision making .

Learning facts may improve the memorising skills of a student and improve his general knowledge about things , but it might prove to be boring and can lead to a child disliking education alltogether .
On the other hand , making students understand ideas and concepts is the key to originality of ideas and innovative thinking in their future .
Understanding concepts will lead to the brain experimenting on its own , toying with varoius concepts and ideas , and will light the fire of inspiration and ignite curiousity , which is the foundation for enabling a student to think towards inventions and new techniques .

In conclusion , where as the method of simply learning facts treats the brain like an empty container to be filled , the method of making them understand ideas and concepts treats the brain as alive , giving it tools for construction and improvement , to make a new and better world in the future .
