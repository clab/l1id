I do believe that the young people enjoy life more than older people do because the young people have more time and energy to enjoy in a day as compared to the older people who work throughout the day mostly to make ends meet and hence are left with not much of a time and energy to enjoy at the end of the day .

Being young you have lots of things to explore and look at as in school and then the college .
All those different field trips and the social and cultural programs are just a few to mention when we say about how the young people enjoy more than the older people .

For the older people , their jobs or businesses do not have such field trips or cultural programs to lighten up their spirits , as their schedule does not permit with all such things .
A typical 9 to 5 job to takes up the time of the day doing pretty much the same job for years together .

The older generation pays for the enjoyment of the younger generation .
And literally , it is so , as the older people spent most of their lives making and building their assets , which is of course for the younger generations of theirs .
So the young people spend on their parents money and do not have to worry about how they will get the money tommorow as they know they have a monthly or the daily allowance which is going to come their way anyways .

As the older generations have more worries in thinking about their finances and budgets and their house hold requirement which the younger generation does not have to think of as it is been taken care of for them by the older people .
So that again leaves them more time and energy to enjoy .

So I feel that young people surely do enjoy more than the older people do .
