Should students pay more attention to understanding concepts and ideas rather than learning facts ?
There has been much debate over this topic .
I strongly agree with the view that it is important for students to learn and understand ideas and core concepts as compared to learning facts .
This is because of several reasons .

First , the understanding of ideas and concepts helps in innovation .
If students have a good grasp of concepts then they can apply them effectively in different and new areas leading to innovation .
On the other hand , factual knowledge is limited and is not extensible .
The facts can only be cited out or reused but they cannot be always extended for innovation .

Second , the factual knowledge is easier to obtain and there are several sources for it .
A student may not even need to go to the best schools or may not need to work with best teachers to gain the fact based knowledge in a better way .
A person who might have never attended a school may also know many facts .
On the other hand , when students study at best schools then they can gain a lot more by understanding concepts and ideas from the teachers and professors as compared to focusing more on fact based learning .
They can engage themselves in research work in order to understand and analyze the different concepts learnt from their course curriculum .

Third , facts are stated and it may not be always possible to verify them .
Students have a lot of potential to learn and indulge themselves more in digging deep into the ideas in order to verify them .
If they focus more on the fact based knowledge then they will not use this potential .
Understaning of concepts and ideas makes them to explore more into their field of study and get more benefit out of the study .

Lastly , there is more possibility that the fact based knowledge coulb be lost if not refreshed after a period of time and the facts are also subject to change .
On the other hand , the understanding of ideas and concepts is more logical in its approach and it is difficult to forget it because students learn them by understanding them through in depth analysis .

Although , arguments can be made for both the sides of this statement , I think there are more advantages for the students by understanding ideas and concepts as compared to the learning based on facts .
