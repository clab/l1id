Ideas and Concepts make one student perfect .
Understanding the ideas and conecpts are much important than understanding them through the facts .
I agree with this saying that student should understand ideas and concepts .
These ideas and concepts makes one student get succed in his future than just understanding them in the form of facts .

Ideas and concepts are important , if we take a example in acedemics , as to understand any subject in his acedamic the student must be with his basic concepts and the point in with it is explained nd the basic idea for that subject and he must be aware of all the concepts in that subject where as if he goes through the facts he may not cover with all th concepts and he may not have the grip and that formness that he had when he is with the ideas and the concepts , so understanding the ideas and concepts for a student makes him have more ability to explain or to express that subject .

student who understanding the ideas and concepts this makes them to achive major tasks like if we take an example of any experiment in sciences that student should know all the concepts to do that experiment like take example of a frog if the student want to experement a frog he need to know all the respiratery organs and how its lives in water and also on the land if we go just by fast that it can live in water and aslo on land that is not sufficient to do experiment on it this may lead to the death of the frog so one student should have the idea when nd in which condition like at what weather condition it servive on the land on in the water so by knowing this student can experiment it .
if we take in the lonching a rocket the scientist should have many ideas and concepts like when to lonch the rocket it dosent on the fact that as the rocket lonches it goes in to the space and get every details this will not go as lonching a rocket have many methods and it deals with may concepts like when nd where to do this and how to deal with this .

Student can improve his mental ability by thinking much insterd of going according the facts shows , like if the student starts thinking much and consntrate much on his thinking abilityes he gets new ideas and in this way he can put all his concepts in these new ideas and develop him self this makes him 2 get succed in inventing may new new things .
like when newton sat under the tree he saw a apple falling down then he started thinking about this this made him to know about the gravitational force he did not leave this to the fact that if a object is thrown then for conform it comes bak on to the earth he just started thikinfg about this and he got sudcceded in kowing about this .

If we consider in other fields like in business if he leaves his business to the facts that he get profit if he sells this may also lead him to get the loss so if one have the idea and concept about that selling of the product then for sure he will get succeded in that stream and he will be with the profit .

In this way i strongly belive and suggest that one student should go according to ideas and concepts than going through the facts .
