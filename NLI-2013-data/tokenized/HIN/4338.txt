They also helped in collecting food , medicine , blankets and various other comodities that were very vital for the survival of the victims .

Secondly , not only during any kind emergency but there are certain incidents in our day today lifes that youngsters perform willingly .
For example , if our neighbours need any thing from the market or any other kind of help such as repairing bicycle or droping thier kids to the school then they are alway willing to help .
