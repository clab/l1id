Yes , i agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
How a person is successful ?
Or you can ask Why a person is successful ?
The answer to this question is that ` it is all about the Innovation ' , i.e. innovative mind .
If you try doing new things , innovative things , definitely one will succeed in the area in which he is trying new things .
Its not thet you are not successfull in one field than only you can try another field .
People who are successful in one field , also try to be in another field and try to succeed in that , those people are successful people .

Their mind think differently , think innovative and unique things .
Also if a person is doing a similar thing for longer period of time , he will get bored of it .
So one should try doing different things not for the sake of success only but for their own knowledge also .
Successful people never stick to one thing which they know how to do well but they always try doing different things .

There are many examples of people who are very innovative .
They are successful in one field but then also they try doing different things in which they are new .
And if hard work is done with dedication , nothing is impossible .
There are many people who are very successful in their cinema career , sports etc but they tried politics also , and guess what , they are successful in that field also .
That people were also new to politics , but they tried to manage both the fields simultaneously .

So what i think that a person should always try different things and never stick to just one thing in life , not for success only but also for a change in life .
