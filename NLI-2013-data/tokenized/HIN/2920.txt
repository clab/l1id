Life comes only once , hence one must enjoy each and every moment in his life , and live without that voice in the back of his mind that says I didnt enjoy his life one as much as i should have had .
Life is like a flower which has to bloom and which wants to enjoy in the sun .

Youth is the stage in life when one has the time of his life .
At youth the young man is full of energy , at a tender age he spend most of his time playing with dolls , drawing or anything which amuses him .
Then in teenage , young people enjoy amongst their friend circle .
Not only that these young people will try to enjoy each and every time of their life by doing the most absurd things which one cant even ever think of , like me when i was young - Me and my friends would occasionally ring the bells of our neighbours and run away .
Every one in his life might have done something or the other equally thrilling in their lives .

If you look at it you will mostly believe that ones enjoying days are only during the youth , But who said that old people cannot enjoy ?
Their lives arent over they still can have fun .
Take My grandparents for example .
Just because they are old doesnt mean that they cannot have fun .
My grandparents still enjoys by visiting place which they couldnt at young age because of education .
Although i know that due to these illustrations it seems that young people have an edge over the young ones with respect to enjoyement and if i were questioned if `` young people enjoy life more that olden people do '' , then i would say thats a difficuly question my friend , the older people had an equally enjoyed when they themselves were young , similarly to the young ones , i would say enjoyement isnt over for you guys as yet , u have the rest of ur life to live ...
