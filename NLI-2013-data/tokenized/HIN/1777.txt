In my opinion it is better to have a broader knowledge of many academic subjects .

In today 's world , no subject can be studied in isolation .
Subjects are linked to each other .
For a good understanding of one subject , some amount of knowledge of a related subject is essential .
For example , for studying complex genetic engineering , a knowledge of computers is required for studying models .
Similarly , while studying history of a particular region at a certain time , it is beneficial to know the economics of that area at that time .
It would help us better understand the events occuring at that time and the reasons behind them .
Thus , as subjects are inter-related we need to have knowledge of many subjects .

We also need to understand things happening around us .
Things happening around us are also related .
To understand issues like why did the Iraq war occur , we need to understand politics and history .
To be aware of why and when tsunamis or hurricanes occur , we need to know geography .
If we catch cold , then we need to know why it happened and how we can prevent it .
So we need to expand our horizon of knowledge to include many subjects to increase our awareness .

Does this mean that we dont need specialists ?
Specialists are required as there are many areas which require a detailed and thorough study which specialists have done .
For research in particular fields specialists are required .
In my opinion , the number of subjects to be studied should vary according to the level of education .
Primary and secondary education should focus on a variety of subjects as they are the building blocks of a student 's knowledge base .
Higher education can be focussed at a specific subject .

Thus , a broad knowledge of numerous academic subjects is essential at the primary and secondary level of education .
