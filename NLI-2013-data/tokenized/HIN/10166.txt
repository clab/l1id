yes , i agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ''

I agree with this because my friend is very successful person .
He is from electonics backround but takes the risk of experimenting the new things , for example one day he had a problem with his bike .
It was unable to start .
so i told him to take the bike to the mechanic but he didnt do so , instead he says its good chance for me to experiment some thing which is new to me .
And he started repairing his bike , it took more then 5 hours and was unable to start , so i said him again to take it to mechanic .
but he went on like that with his work .
And i was very much surprised to see that the bike started , and even his patience and the motivation towards his work .
and he was delighted with joy as his risk was fruitful .
so because of this reason i supported the statement .

There are some people who actually wants to experiment or take risk but some dont want to do so they will be worried and they will not take the risks .
Just they do the things which ever they know better .
And more over it depends upon the understanding of the people .

Therefore from the above mentioned example i support the statement that successful people try new things and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
