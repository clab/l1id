now a days competions increase rapidly person win the race who use ideas and concepts at right time and at right place .
For student both the facts understand ideas and concepts and learn facts are essential .
sometime they get benefit to learn or sometimes to understand them .
i am completely agree with the statement that understand ideas and concept are more important then learning them .

first , as far as student concern they have to learn lots of concepts of their course and other things .
so for the student it is not easy to learn all the things .
therefore they need to understand the detail or main idea of the course .

second , when student can understand the ideas their chance to learn more thing wil increase .
for example if a student can play any vocabalary quiz game then it would not learn all the words from dictionary for the quiz .
but instead it can understand the meaning of root word as suffix and prefix so it become easily to learn more words .

most important fact is that recalling or memorizing power .
when student can learn the ideas then it is probabaly not recall all the ideas at right time and as a result it can loose the race .
however , if he can understand the things better then definately it would recall at right time .
one example is that if the student has to face any mathemetics related comepetive exam then understanding of the formule is more helpful then learning as their are more then 100 formule so to learn all those are not easiy .

in increasing competition world student plays important role as they are the bright future for the world .
so to understand as much as ideas and memorize those ideas are really helpul in mordern world .
