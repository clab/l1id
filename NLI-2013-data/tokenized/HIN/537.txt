Everybody has its own point of view on a certain issue and its not neccessary that the my point of view may corrobarate with other or say in accord with other .
Coming to this particular topic of weather its better to have a broad academic knowledge on many subjects rather han specialization on one , i personally feel that keeping in mind the present global scenario and growing competition its better to have a broad knowledge in many ascpects rather than to limit yourself to one particular field .

Why i think so is that , it gives you the cutting edge over the others to survive in this otherwise predatory competition .
By having broader knowledge you are not limited to one field only .
Lets understand this by an example , suppose iam a laboratory technician and in addition to that i have a basic knowledge to handle the accounts and also to manage a office , this not only addes to my profile but also give me an extra confidence to work in different work condition if iam imposed to them .
( Here i have an standout advantage over a only laboratory technician . )

Not only this it can be a source of some extra income which is very neccessary keeping in point of view the rising prices of commodities around the world .
This can be understood by again looking into the example explained above , suppose i get from the laboratory early during the working days i might take some tutions of accounts as iam well verse with it also , this could add extra income to my pocket , does n't it feels great .
I am sure it feels so .

And lastly but most importantly it gives you a sense of secured future in a way that you are not limited to a particular field , if you are not satisfied with your current job environment you can easliy switch on to the other as you are not limited to a particular proficiency .

You can also change job when you feel ennui because of the same stereotyped work .
So i would rather advocate to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
My idea looking to present secnario is `` IT 'S BETTER TO BE JACK OF ALL TRADES RATHER THAN MASTER OF NONE . ''
