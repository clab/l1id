Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , i agree with this statement .

When a company make any product by spending a huge amount of money .
than the company want to sell it .
and then the main Question arises that how they can do it .

They apply publicity stund .
by advertise they try to make it much better than usually the product is .
they try to allure customer .
if the advertise is good and attractive , more people attract towards it .
and buy it on demanding cost .
after making the product they spend lot of money on advertising to make popular it among peoples .
because there is a lot of comptetion in the market and every product maker want to sell more products than others .

for example 2 company make a same product , then there is a great comptetion among maker .
who will allure more to customer , will be in profit .
and advertisement make a base for this .
good advertise for the product , more customer will allure , more profit will occur .

so by this way most of the selling of product depands upon the advertisement .
and so maker take the help of advertise .
