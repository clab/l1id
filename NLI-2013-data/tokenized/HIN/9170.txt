With regards to the statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
, I totaly agree with it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts .

The first reason is that students can hold theories and applied sciences much longer this way than learning only facts .
The second reason is that students are able to link different subjects at the university , and therefore they can understand much more things in the different subjects .

I am studiying at the university in Cologne and I have friends , who believes in the same statement like me .
I often ask my proffesor at the end of the lecture , when I couldnt understand a lot of things in the ideas and concepts , which he or she has presented us .
The reason why I do this , is to capture all the things to understand the idea and concepts .
Otherwise I cant understand the whole lecture , whe i onlz get the facts , e.g numbers or dates .
I also would forget most of the facts , when I only get the facts without learning the ideas and the concepts .

The second reason is that students are able to link different subjects at the university .
It is very important to understand the ideas and the concepts to link theories in the different subjcts as a whole .
When I understand the concepts and the ideas , I am able to link the subjects to each other in many cases .

I am quite sure that I will do the same until the end of my study .
I hope that my collegue will also follow me The above outlined reasons are why I always agree with the statement that `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts . ''
