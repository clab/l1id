I agree with the statement , and feel that only a hand full of people spend enough time for helping their communities .
The following are few of the resons why i agree .

First of all , the young people are so much inclined towards their job and shaping their carrier and looking for leading a luxurious life , that they hardly get any time for helping their communities .
They have time to go to the pubs and hanging around with their friends but hardly any of them spends time for their communities .

Recently , i approached a friend of mine to accompany me to an old aged community , that runs for the old people who have been abandoned by their children , only to give some food to them that my mother had prepared .
But he began to give all lame excuses that he has to go out along with his parent 's .
Later i found out that he was at home the whole day .
He did not even think that by doing so how happy will they feel .
Also helping their communities implies that the person has some humanity feeling in him .

Moreover , the young people in their teens are so much so influenced by their friends and other activities that at a point they even do not behave properly with their own parent 's .
For them , their friends are their everything .
Such people hardly spend any time helping their communities .
Looking at this rate the young people , must realise that after some age even they will not be young and also they will be in need of young people for help .
Atleast , having this in mind they must spend time for helping .

The above reasons makes me feel so , In order to overcome this , the young people , especially the student 's must make it a routine to spend some time , not much , but atleast half an hour per day for helping the communities .
