I partially agree with the statement that ' Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are ' .
I think it is tough to clearly tell whether one absolutely agrees or disagrees .

Advertsements are one of the most important aspects of modern day business .
With so much competition in every field and each idea superior to the other , good advertiment has become absolutely mandatory .
Advertisements help a lot in increasing the customer 's awareness about a product .
With so many products in the market these days , there is no way the manufacturers can reach the people without publicity .

Increased competetion can be cited as the most important reason behind an underlying exaggeration in all the ads today .
If an advertisement is very modest , and explain the flaws as well the qualities , would there be any takers for the product ?
People have so much choice these days , the manufacturers ca n't afford to loose their present customers .
They are always trying to increase their market share .

Advertisements have a deep impact on the consumer 's mind .
He goes to the market looking for a particular product keeping the advertisement in his mind .
It is only the beneficial aspects of the product that draw him there .
An example could be that of luxury cars .
All the ads emphasize on the increased space , better tyres , better suspension , etc .
No one says any thing about the huge monthly installment that would go in to enjoy this luxury .
But thinking from the consumer 's point of view , he will not even go to have a look at the car if the ad is not attractive , leave apart buy it .

But , on the flipside , there are many ads that are very misleading too .
Like , the ads for weight reduction methods .
These manufacturers know that they have easy targets in women or young people in general .
They publicize how someone lost a major chunk of his weight by consuming their pill .
There is absolutely no mention of the side effects of these artificial methods on the body , which may look healthy after losing fat , but can develop other disorders , like reduced in fertility in females , to cite one .

Most of the time manufactureres know their target .
They cash in on the weak points of that target population .
Sometimes these can misguide the people and lead to irreversible losses to them .
By the time the truth dawns on them , its already too late to react .

To conclude , I would say that taking one stand on any one of the two extremes is not fair .
The maufactures should be allowed a little liberty in making claims as long as they are not absolutely unjust or too exaggerated .
But they not let go of their ethical responsibities , and should not go to the extent of causing harm to their consumers just to increase their profits .
