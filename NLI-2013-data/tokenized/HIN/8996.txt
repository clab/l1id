A true learning is one where the students are clear with basic ideas and concept of the problem .
This the way by which they can solve many problems without complexities involved in it .
Though , fact about the perticular topic is important to know and it forms an important element , without which learning is incomplete but understanding the ideas and concept are equally required .

for example , a child wants to learn about how to solve a mathematical problem like addition or substraction .
Then it is very important that he knows the concept of the problem .
It is important for him to identify where he has to add up and where he has to substract .
This will help him out to solve similar kind of problem in future , only becuase the ideas and the concepts are clear to him .

Further , we can learn the facts only by making inferences and drawing conclusions which involves the complete understanding of ideas .
only then it will be possible to reach to a conclusion and eventually to learn about the fact .
For example this is the fact that earth is the only planet where life exists .
The main ideas and reasons behind it are becuase of the favourable atmosphere , presence of oxygen , earths distance from the sun etc.these things helps us to make a conclusion about existence of life on earth .
Which is the fact .

In other words , the concept of a model which was suggested by a scientist with sun at the centre in the planet system , one can give reasons and explain the fact that earth is locatedat a perticular distance .
so , what is more important is , to first have a basic idea about a concept and then learn the fact which is associated to it .
This is the way any problem can be solved with better understanding and improved learning ability .
