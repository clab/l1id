I disagree with the statement .
In my opinion , it is better to be specialised in one field rather than have incomplete knowledge of several subjects which may not serve any purpose .
Its no good being `` Jack of all trades - Master of none '' .

A person having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is like a blunt knife .
It has a large area and zero penetrating power .
A specialist , on the other hand , can make breakthroughs in his field and contribute more to the society .

These days the knowledge of each subject is very vast .
To know about everything and then assimilating that information into something miraculous is not possible .
The days are gone when a Leonardo Da Vinci could paint masterpieces , write mathematical theories and create models for an aircraft .
Today 's cutting edge technology requires specialists from diverse fields who can work together and bring about a significant development .

For example , consider a car manufacturing company .
It does not have all its employees knowing how a combustion engine works , much the same way as it does not have all of them knowing how to market its cars .
It has specific people for a specific job .
It has promoters to fund development , engineers to design cars , accountants to operate logistics and advertisers to sell a car .
It is a team of diverse elements , each a master in his or her respective field , that can contribute something useful .

These days many pioneering researches are carried out by groups of scientists who are proficient in their respective field .
A physics and a chemistry expert may collaborate to give something that one could not have hoped to achieve by himself .
A scholar who knows something about everything cannot do much when the requirement is everything about something .

Humanity has thrived on its dynamism and diversity .
To avoid stagnation , we need specialists as the fields of knowledge have outgrown the capacity of a single human .
A jack may fit anywhere in the pack of cards but it never beats the king .
