This is true that most products look better in advertisements than they really are .
In this age of agressive marketing and bullish economy , it takes a monumental effort to successfully launch a product , and then capture a niche for the product in the face of competition from other similar products .

The problem which most of the manufacturers of different products face is that the market for their product is overcrowded with similar products .
So , in order to make a consumer base for their product , the manufacturing companies try to make agressive advertising strategies to make their product look unique and different from other similar products .
They try to rope in celebrities like film stars or sports personalities to work as brand ambassadors and spend a huge amount on making advertisement films .
Also computer graphics , animation and stunt directors are used to make advertisement films depending on the product and its target consumer clientele .

Few examples which we can see are the Cola giants , Coke and Pepsi .
Although the product is nearly the same , they spend a lot of money in making advertisements to look superior and different from each other .
Similarly we can observe advertisements of cars which are literally flying in the air .
All this is a part of a unique marketing strategy , to catch the consumer 's attention and creating a separate niche for the brand .

We should also acknowledge the fact that if the companies do not make the product look better in advertisements , nobody will buy the product .
They will not be able to compete with other similar brands and the product will fizzle out or die .
So this situation of aggressive marketing and making super ads is as much important as that of the making of the product itself .
Any good product cannot survive without look extra - good advertisements .
