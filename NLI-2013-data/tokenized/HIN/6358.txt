I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Firstly , the fuel reserves on this planet are limited and the consumption of fuel is only increasing with time .
One of the reasons for the increase in fuel consumption , mainly petroleum , which is easier and cheaper to refine , is the growing population worldwide .
Petrol is not only needed to run cars but also needed to run cities - to generate electricity which is needed to run all our electrical appliances at home .
Also with an increase in air travel , the fuel consumption has gone up .
Another reason for increase in fuel consumption is due to the increase in industrialization and other technological advances and research .
Thus although the fuel consumption is increasing , the resources are limited and hence the demand will eventually outdo the supply .
Thus to prevent this the number of cars running on the roads will need to be reduced .

Although , alternative resources of fuel which are more enviornment friendly are being researched , such as substituting petroleum with ethanol , which is being widely discussed about currently , the researchers have a long way to go before this can be used commonly by the consumer .
Various other factors such as fuel economy and effects of using this alternative on the car engine need to be sorted out .
I also feel that the costs of substituting petroleum with other fuel alternatives would be very high and not possible for the common man to sustain fuel charges for his car from econimics point of view .
Hence not many will be able to afford cars then automatically causing a deline in the number of cars .

Lastly , we all know that the current increase in the number of vehicles on the road in addition to the increase in fuel consumption is causing a lot of enviornmental changes .
Global warming is only increasing by the day .
Even scientists are shocked with the effects of pollutants released in the air on our climate .
These drastic changes in our climate will compel us to decrease the use of cars and look for more enviornment friendly alternatives .
