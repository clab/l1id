Advertising is one of the key factors in the success of a product in market .
Some people feel that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I do not agree with this and will explain my point of view in the following paragraphs .

In today 's world , there is a lot of awareness among consumers and the product manufacturers know that they cannot fool them by giving false impressions about their product .
They know that if they give a false picture of their product in an advertisement , they might fool customers for a short term but in the long run customers will know the real picture .
Therefore , intelligent and successful businessmen refrain from wrongly advertising their product .
Thus , we generally do not see an add of a product that projects it falsely .

In today 's world , only the best products are able to sustain themselves in the market .
It is generally these successful companies who can afford to invest and do invest lot of money in advertising .
As the market is very competitive , there is little or no difference in the quality of products from two companies .
The motive of advertising of such companies is to catch consumers ' imagination , to influence them emotionally so that they buy their product instead of their competitor 's product .
Therefore , I do not think that companies that manufacture products that do not meet the market standards ever advertise their product .
Neither do they have the money nor is it worth spending money because there are better products available in market and consumers already know that .

If we observe the advertisements nowadays , we find that they are very creative .
Companies sometimes do blow up their product in their advertisement but that is just to make their add more interesting and appealing than that of their competitor .
They do not project wrong information about their product .

Therefore , I feel that advertisements project the product that they advertise correcty and that in today 's world , they cannot survive in the market if they advertise a product falsely .
