The question whether to have a broad knowledge of many acedemics subjects OR to specialise in one specific subject is a very arguable and can lead to many a heated discussions .

In my opinion , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to just have expertice in one .

According to me , the practical value of a person increases when he know about various other subjects apart from his major .
This makes him a lot more versatile and flexible .
He can take care of a lot of things without external assistance and thus can prove to be an asset .

Moreover , in todays world , one has to be aware of a lot of things to make himself as well his family prosper .
For example , a doctor by profession has to have a basic knowledge of electricity and safely measures of electrical appliances to safely operate the appliances .
If he does not pay enough attention to this , and only be expert at his profession then he may unintentionally cause an accident .
Also for example , a Chartered Accountant needs to know the basics of first aid in order to administer the same when the need arises .
In the same way a Contruction Worker needs to know the basics of taxation where he can save a dollar more .
Hence for a comfortable living in todays world , one needs to have a practical knowledge of a variety of subjects .

Seeing in the practical aspect , this opinion is reflected in the corporate world also .
We dont have a lot of experts of scientific or civil fields .
The reason for this is the amount of extra effort that they have to put in to become an expert .
To further explain this , the time when a student starts learning the contents of a subject , I believe , he is not mature enough to decide whether this is what he actually wants to expertise in .
He is unaware of the other subjects and possibilities that lay ahead in them .
For making a sound decision , one has to spend some time in knowing the subjects and then deciding .
In we take this approach practically then , by the time a student gets aquainted to all the subjects his learning time has lapsed biologically and he thus becomes Jack of All but master of none .
But there are a few exeptional ones who do pursue specialised education and become specialists in their fields .

Hence I feel that , the choice should afterall be of the student to decide between Master or Jack .
But given a choice , I would prefer to be a Jack rather than a master .
