Even in the pressurised atmosphere which the youths of today 's generation face for building his or her carer , I do not think that they have detered from their responsibilities towards the community .

It is true that day by day as the youths are getting more and more competitive so is the pressure on them by their parents and relatives to have a secured future and decent earning .

In such an atmoosphere it becomes a bit difficult for the students to give way to their genuine feelings to help other .
But still as I have myself observed in my community the youths have taken up the challenge and are helping the poor and needy ones by whatever means they can .

I would like to give an example of a very small organization which carries out such a function .
In my own institute theere is an organization called `` Kashi Utkarsh '' which tries to educate the illiterate , poor children and provide them with ceratin daily requirements .
They even get the financial aid from the students of the college itself .
There are various big and legally organized institutes which have been build by the governments of a country which have maximum youth participants .

It is true a part of the society keeps on postponing its responsibilty toward the society by putting up various kinds of lame excuses like that of their time having not arrived yet to help others and they should first secure their position in the society before helping others .

On the other there are various children who help the needy ones in their localitiy itself .
It is not essential to join an institute to help others Social service is quite appreciable even if done on a very small scale .

Even on governmnet 's side especially in United Staes Of America , the will in the students to help the needy ones is being promoted by exempting a part of their college fee on volunteering for the helping people with very limited means .
The students are encouraged to take evening classes for students who have some difficulties with their subjects .
And the students are not payed for this hence making them understand the menaing of their being a part of the society they live in .

To illuminate my point I do not think that example of Mother Teresa will be out of date .
She did not start healing the wounded and helping the poor and needy ones across the nations after she got old !
It was only that her works were recognized on an international level after a certain period pof obscurity .

To conclude there is no dearth of students who are ready to work for the community .
What they lack is opportunity and proper guidence , which is provided adequately , there would never be any such question arising !
