I disagree with the argument that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years down the line than there are today .
I can attribute a number of reasons to support my agreement of argument .

The most important reason I consider is the recent technological advances to use non-conventional enery sources instead of conventional fuels like gasoline and diesel .
Although I agree that there is decrease in quantity of oil pools one can find out whcih are used to produce petroleum which in turn is used to extract gasoline and diesel , the main fuels that run cars today .
Further , scarcity of petroleum has lead to an exponential increase in the growth of petroleum product prices which directly affet the consumption of the product .
We can see in the current times , petrol prices are rising at brisk rate and the trend will follow in the future also because of the limited availablity of petroleum resources .
However , there are steps taken by companies , independent researcher to look for the non-conventional resources of enery like hydrogen , electricity as future fuels of cars but the experiments have not been successful commercially .
I am sure that twenty years time is considerarably good amount of time that the non-conventional sources of energy will completely replace the exisiting conventional fuels .

I assume that non-conventional fuels will replace the existing fuel technology in the future because they are easy to use , pollution-free .
Automobile manufacturing companies like GM , Toyota etc. are looking forward to welcome these new non-conventional fuels and their research and development groups are persistently working on prototypes which are small boxes that can easily be replaced in existing cars .
Existence of this box will imply that we can just have this new box fitted and use different fuel and there is no need to change the car .

That 's why I think number of cars twenty years down the line will not be fewer because of the existence of non-conventional resources of enery and the adaptation that the vehicle manufacturing companies are doing to their products .
