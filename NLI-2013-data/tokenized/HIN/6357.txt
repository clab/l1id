I agree with the viewpoint that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

There are many reasons to prove my viewpoint .

One of the main reasons for fewer cars in use in future may be the crude prices .
Crude prices are increasing day by day which results increase in petrol and diesel prices .
Increase prices will affect the use of the car because it might be very difficult for normal person to cope up wit increase prices .
There is lot of demand for crude and as it is non renewable source , it is going to become expensive in coming future .
Increase in petroleum products have major impact on sales of cars .

Other reason may be increase in traffic due to high number of car sales .
People may get frustrated because of traffic and may prefer using public transport rather than cars .
For e.g most people working in london city travel by train because it is more convinient for them to use train rather than car .
It will be more cheaper for people to use public transport rather than using a car .
Even government is trying to improve public transport which results in more convenience to people .

In future may be prices of cars may rise due to increase in raw materials for making a car .
To compensate with the increase prices of raw materials , company has to increase price of the final product , so this increase in prices is passed on to customer which may resist customers to buy new car .

Increase in pollution due to burning of fuel in cars may push government to impose new laws which may add additional cost to customers and they may get reluctant to buy new cars .

So , in summary there will be fewer cars in use in future than today .
Neways it is very difficult to predict a future but according to me car sales will have negative effect because of the reasons that I have mentioned above .
