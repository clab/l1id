The statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is although a little extreme , yet correct .
I agree with this statement to a large extent .

Firstly , Young people living in this world of capitalism , are very materialistic .
Success today is judged by the amount of money , or luxuries of life that a person has , and the young people are greatly influenced by this fact .
Young people work towards getting glamourous and high profile jobs .
They concentrate mostly on personal gains and do not give enough time for community activities .

Secondly , some young people are influenced by the violence and crime depicted in films and on television .
A lot of crimes nowadays are committed by young people .
These young people are unemployed and have a tendency to commit illegal acts for money .

Some young people are influenced by radical ideologies and join anti-social , and terrorist outfits .

Some might argue that young people do help their communities by helping and working for non-governmental organisations such as the P.E.T.A , Old age homes and orphanages .
Yet others might cite that some young people are involved in developmental activities for their communities and as such , are not absolutely materialistic .
These facts are true and factual , Yet In my opinion , there are not enough young people involved in the noble and social activities stated above to fully support and generalise the claim .

Finally , a lot of surveys conducted by various agencies clearly show that the young people prefer money , social status , sex , glamour and a strong education a lot more than they prefer helping their communities .
Some young people do have a desire to help their communities , but do not take the step towards realisation of this desire due to a lack of time and commitment .

To sum , most young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Some help their communities , but in my opinion the majority do not help and this is the reason why i feel that the statement , although a little extreme , is still correct .
