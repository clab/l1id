In my opinion , the term ` enjoyement ' is very subjective .
It is a state of mind which may be experienced both by the young and the aged .
To the youth , ` enjoyment ' could refer to socialising with their friends , partying , watching movies , adventure sports such as scuba diving .
Whereas , to an old couple , enjoyment couls imply relaxing at home , spending time with family , taking vacations or simply spending time at an aromatherapy spa .
So to take a stand on which age group ` enjoys ' life more is rather difficult .
However , if we define ` enjoyment ' as the feeling of experiencing the ` high ' of life , of taking full advantages of all the opportunities available to us today , then I believe , it is the youth which has more of an advantage .

The most important advantage that the younger people have is their health .
Not to say that older people are always sick , younger people tend to be fitter , healthier and more energetic so as to be able to avail of more pleasures of life .
Lets take for instance the example of scuba diving or trecking .
It is most likely that a yound person would be much fitter to enjoy such activities .
There are many cases where older people are not even allowed to participate in activites on account of risk of heart failure , unfavorable atmospheric conditions ( para gliding ) etc .
However , many old people are fit to underatke these risks , they are generally advised not to .

Moreover , the youth has a zest for life which is not very often seen in the older generation .
This is not to say that the aged dont appreciate life , it is just that the youth has more to look forward to than the elderly .
What is unknown , always entices .
To elaborate , the young look forward to all the things that are in store for them for e.g graduating , going to college , taking vacations with their friends , travelling the world .
While on the other hand , the aged have alreday been through the various stages of life and are not particularly excited about the future .
Infact most of them are more involved in the lives and problems of their children who are busy ` enjoying ' life .

As one grows older , the weight on responsibility on ones shoulder increases .
It is not possible for older people to take the same kind of risks the youth can take , may it be health-related , family related of even financial .
Let us consider the case of a graduate student and an old man who has a family of five .
The student is more likely to splurge his money on enjomnet activities such as partying , membership os sports clubs , travelling than a man who needs to save his money in order to support his family .
Thus it leads us to the conclusion that , younger people have fewer financial restraints than older who need to support their families

To conclude , it can be reiterated that ` enjoyment ' is an highly subjective term and may mean different things to different age groups .
Though our strict definition of ` enjoyment ' does bring to light the facts that younger people ahve more time , money and energy to spend on enjoyment activities , the argument is in now way insulated from exceptions .
Exceptions are always there is every walk of life and so there might always older people who ` enjoy ' life more than the youth .
