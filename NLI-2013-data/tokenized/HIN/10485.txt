yes I totally agreed with this that successfulpeople try new things and take risks , as there are more confidentiall by themselves and they will get experience to hold with , the situation so they will easily jump in the new trial .
As they got the success in new things they are automatically pushed in the new trials , as they are well supperted by the public also because the are already won the public keeps the same hopes from those successors .

I remembered well that of my friend he got sucess writing , who is very sucessful writer he do very good job in writing ariticle .
his boss always appreciated by his article by his job even the journalist company also got a good fame the newspaper of his is become all over in India because of my friends ability he got the sucess very soon and quickly .

By these sucess my friend got the confidence and experiment in writing and in himself , in a very little time my friend started writing a novels and stories book also .
As soon he got a sucess in the article he placed himself in the novels and story books in which he got a tremendous sucess in the sucess he was not only supported by his friends , relatives and by the public also right now he was not only a famous article but also a famous novelist and a story writer .

In my opinion the person who got the sucess in one thing he should jump in another things , also .
He should take the advantage of the every movement which he will get by his hard work and by stress .

He should take the advantage of his sucess , his hard work and gift given to him by God , he should not shy by taking a risk , and he should not thing that if he was not thing he was not win ?
what happens he will going to get a marked with his prior sucess also but he should encourage him self and keep in mind that `` every adversity of the life teaches a lot then getting a victory directly '' .

So , I always encourage to myself and to my friends and my family that taking a risk is not a bad .
taking a risk and playing with a life is only a life .
