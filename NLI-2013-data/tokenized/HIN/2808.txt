In my opinion yes young people enjoy more life than a older people because young people are more enerzised , fun loving , enthusiatis , out going and more over a passion to do something new and great which attract others .
lets take my example when i have gone for my holidays with my family me n my sister both has done riverrafting and diving whereas my parents were there but they had not done anything like this they were actually roamimg around in the beach and enjoying the wheather .

similarly at night i would love to go night clubs but if i give change to my parents they would choose to go for a long drive .
the only reason is i enjoy dancing and having fun at disc with friend and they enjoy conversation with there age group people .

another good example would be u can find a clubs in a ares where colleges and hostels and even place where more young people are there , whereas you find a nice beautiful park when you visit any society of retired persons .

In my organisation people who are working in field force as a sales executive or document pick up are mostly young boys or girls because they are more energetic whereas if you see in administration and back office more olderly people are working where job profile does not include much stamina .

according to me older people would to do those kind of job which reqire more mental stamina rather then physical .
young people has more stamina then olde people .
But yes there are always exception i have a uncle who is always into a mood of enjoyment or having fun all the time .
you find these kind of people very less whos has lot of energy even at older age .

so its again depend on the person to person how he takes his life to potential .
