There is a very popular saying in English which goes `` A Jack of all trades is a master of none . ''
A person who has limited knowledge of various topics but little or no specialized knowledge of any one particular topic is generally referrred to as the above mentioned saying .

While it is good to know a little bit of everything that surrounds you , it does not harm to have specialized knowledge of one subject .
Based on my personal experience , I strongly disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

Excellence in any field can be achieved only when one has specialized in that specific subject and reached its pinnacle .
By having a broad knowledge of various academic subjects one can only achieve mediocrity .

An individual who has specialized in one specific subject is respected by society and his peers and looked up to by his juniors and subordinates who aspire to be like him .
He is often approached for advice and resolving certain issues pertaining to his subject .

A indivdiual can use his specialized knowledge in a specific subject to make new breakthroughs , inventions and discoveries in that field .
The entire society has benefited from the research works of scholars and learned men in various fields of science , history and art .
Society has evolved due to the innumerable inventions and discoveries which were a result of this extensive research .
Thus specialized studies have given a forward thrust to mankind as a whole in terms of technological advancement and evolution .

A specialzation in one subject is also an indicator of the dedication and perseverance of an individual .
It shows his sense of commitment to a particular task .
Thus it is the reflection of the qualities and character of an individual .
