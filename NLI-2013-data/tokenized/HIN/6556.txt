I believe that there would be more cars 20 years down the lane than there are today .
My statement is based on below facts .

As of now only 7 % of the world population is using cars .
Mostly this population resides in developed countries .
The ratio of people using cars in developing and under developed countries is very low , due to poverty or shortage of disposable income to be spent on luxury .
The statistics show an upward trend in income of people living in developing and under developed countries

For example , number of cars on road in developing countries like India and China have seen a 30 % growth annually over the last decade .
Other countries are joining this race .

Further the government of such countries are also providing infrastructure in terms of roads .
Hence , using a car becomes easier .
In addition , the world is moving towards globalisation .
With this , availaibilty of cars for sale and availaiblity of wider range of cars like cost effective cars is being witnessed .
Hence , people would be able to buy and mainatin a car more conviently , than today .

For example , in last 2 decades there has been a 300 % increase in number of people directly or indirectly involved with automotive industry .
This is only possible if the automotive industry is showing very positive growth signs .

Moreover , the change in outlook of people .
Cars which were once considered a luxury are now being viewed as neccessasity to remain mobile .

One more very underlying but important reason for people not to buy cars is its running cost i.e. cost of fuel the car runs on .
With invention of cars which run of water , solar energy or japharta ( a seed which can produce pertol ) and other such biodegrable sources , using a car would gradually become cheaper and envioremental friendly , encouraging more people to buy & use car .

Further rate of car being disposed of as non usable is very low , as technology is available to refunction and reuse them .

All the development mentioned above is taking place gradually and it will see its peak after to 18-20 years .
Hence , my claim .
