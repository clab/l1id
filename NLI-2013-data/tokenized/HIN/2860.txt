I personally feel that young people do enjoy more in their lives than older people do .
According to me the best period of a human being 's life is `` Adolescence '' .
Young people have enough physical strength , mental capability , strong determination and will power to overcome hurdles and move further in their lives .
Some peole may argue that young minds are generally burdened with matters like their future prospects and academic career , but younger generations has an inner desire ( or we can say some sort of fire ) to succeed and excel in every field of life which extinguishes in older people .
Young people have very less responsibilities as they are generally in safe hands of their parents or guardians .
It 's true that no person can forget his school or college days ever .
School life memories are always with a person till the end of his life .
People who enjoy their lives to the maximum are in the age group of 15-25 years .
This period witnesses building and cemnting of friendships and relationships which are everlasting .
A young person never hesitates in taking risks and is ready to venture into any new business .
He isfree to fly in his dreamland , atleast he can dare to do so which is impossible for older people .
Adolescent people enjoy media , entertainment , nature and almost everything the most .
While older people are prone to more health disorders and are usually at the mercy of others .
They are helpless and have to take help from others in certain matters .
Thus they are unable to enjoy their life .
They always have responsibilites and a tired life .
