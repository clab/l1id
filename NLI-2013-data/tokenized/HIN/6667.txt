I think that in twenty years there will actually be fewer cars than there are now .
In this essay , I will explain the reasons why i think this will happen .

The main reason for my views is the increasing price of gas .
We have seen that the petrolium prices have gone through the roof recently .
In the last three years , they have more than doubled .
The fuel efficieny of cars has more or less been stagnant in the last couple of decades .
It is reasonable to assume fuel efficiency will not be able to offset the rising prices .
At this rate , it will be prohibitively expensive to drive a car , and people will prefer public modes of transport such as buses and metros .

Another reason is that more and more people are becoming aware of the pollution caused by cars .
People are increasingly concerned about their environment , and are taking steps to maintain it .
In Denmark for example , an increasing number of people are using bicycles rather than cars .
Taking a cue , other Europeans have started adopting these steps .
This trend is likely to spread well beyond Europe , into America and other continents .

Cars make people lazy .
As people become more health conscious , they will stop using cars , and use more healthy ways of transport such as cycling or biking .
They may also prefer to walk if the distance is short .

With the advances in aviation industry , it is becoming increasingly affordable to travel by air .
If we can extrapolate this , travel by air may in fact become cheaper than travel by cars in another twenty years .
In that case people are highly likely to stop using cars .

In conclusion , it is more likely than not that there will be fewer cars twenty years from now .
This is supported by present conditions as well as past experience .
