Technology has been racing ahead to touch the zenith one day .
Amongst the various inventions and discoveries the designing of an engine that can be used for transportation was a remarkable discovery .
And now , in todays time we see cars zipping past us every second as we saunter on the road .
The number of cars being used today all over the globe is almost infinity , and if it continues at this pace then one day it wil outshadow the human population .
But i believe that in next twenty years the numbers of cars in use will be fewer than they are today as with passing time efforts have been made to make people aware about the distinguishing amount of non renewable resources available on earth .
Petroleum , deisel and natural gas being the most important fuels of running cars are being not as abundantly available as they were few years back .
The reduction in the level of such fuels under the surface of earth is alarming .

In order to make the people aware all over the planet steps have been taken by certain NON GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS ( NGOs ) by reaching to the grass root level .
Running drives on conserving every drop of fuel has been one of the fertile efforts to awaken people .
Promotion campaigns to encourage office goers to pool in cars and go toghether was a very good ideas one of the students association came up with .
Encouraging people to use public transport is one way to lessen the number of cars on road and thus avoiding the diabolical traffic .

If all the nations work hand in hand to make people understand the consequences of the upcoming danger i firmly believe that in next twenty years the number of cars would be less than what it is today .
But the need of the hour is to spread awareness by being a part of a group or organization or as an indiviual .
EVERY ONE OF US CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE .
