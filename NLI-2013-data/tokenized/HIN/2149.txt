An individual enjoys most of his life in his youth period .
It is that period of our whole life that no-one wants to forget .
Also during that we shapes our personality and ability of thought .

In our adult period we do n't have much responbility regarding our family and our soul & body are full of enery & pasion .
We get a chance to live our life freely and full support of our family & freinds is available .

The most sacred relation that is marriage also provide a oppurtunity to understand what love is all about ?
We can enjoy , play and learn new & innovative techniques during our adult age .
As long as we are earning we can spend a small amount of that money for our recreational activities .
enormous amount of zeal and passion is available to go for adventurous activities .
Activities like river rafting , mountain climbing , roller skating also requires a fair amount of physical strength and endurance that are present in a young lad .

As far as social circle is concerned younger generation childern have thier interaction with freinds , teachers , community in which they are living and also with some industrial professionals .
We get a chance to visit several different places and sometimes can do crazy things for which we desire .

At last , I would like say that even in our old age we ca n't forget our childhood memories and wants them to stay for ever with us .
The time that we had spend with our friends , familly members still reminds us for the past experiences .
For instance , TAJ MAHAL that was build by shah jahan in the memory of his wife , still today it is regarded as a symbol of love they had experinced .
