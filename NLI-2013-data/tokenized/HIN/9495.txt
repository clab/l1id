I am agree with the statement .

Concept is nothing but the theme of the topic .
If your concept and ideas about any particular topic is clear then you can add number of facts for that concept .
Facts are nothing but a type of example for any concept .

For example theory of gravitation , Newton has invented the theory of gravitation .
If your idea and concept about the theroy of gravitation is clear then you can think about number of facts based on this theory .
You can apply your concept wherever you find suitable .
But if your ideas and concept is not clear then you would not be able to convey your opinion and facts .

Students should have clear ideas about the topic that they are studying and also the concept behind topic should be clear .
If your concept is clear about any topic then you can remember the topic easily and forever in your mind .
And if you learn something based on facts rather then basic concept that will be harder to remember .

For example NEWS is a simple english word but if somebody explain you about this word I mean how the word NEWS made , then it would be included in your never-loss-memory section of your mind .
The NEWS word made based on the following concept :

NEWS = North + East + West + South

NEWS word is the combination of first letters of four words ( North , East , West and South ) .
So the word itself contains inforamtion about all four directions and give you information about all four directions .
So this is the concept behind the word NEWS .

Conclusion , As per as my opinion is concerned about the statement , Ideas & concept behind any topic or subject should be clear , so that you can use that knowldge any time , any where , and forever .
