The person can make the better future if his knowledge is diversified .
If you concentrate on a single subject then you can not improve your personality .
A diversified knowledge can improve your personality .
raise your attitude , becoming you a confident person .

If any person have a knowledge of so many subjects then other person can not face you in any debate competition .
You can raise your confidence and you will leave the mark on the society .
You will get the better position in the society .

If you have a diversified knowledge and you are doing the job in any office then your boss will always give you the preference and he will always take your suggestion to start any work , because he knows that whatever you will tell him , it will be beneficial for the company , any the company will earn the profit .

From the knowledge of many subjects you can develop your personality , you will not feel shy in front of the others , by that diversified knowledge , you will feel confidence yourself .

As we know that many general knowledge competitions are held in the society and in the school campus .
In that competition those students and persons can win whose knowledge is broad .
If you will win the competition then also it is a better achievement for the school that a student has won the madel , but you will also appreciated for your broad knowledge , people also give the respect to you .
You will also know in the school or the society with a different eyes .
People always give the preference to you rather that a student or person whose knowledge is ot broad .

That is better for the students or person have a knowledge on different subjects but we can not ignore the person or students who specialize in one subject , because he is expert in on subject .

At last I agree that the knowledge should be broad and diversified to help for the personality development , and get the better position in society , and to raise the confidence .
