Success lies in what you have thought of and the respective positive outcome .
Success is a phenomenon usually that should be developed by each and every individual .
Success reflects the idea of the man in his behavior .
Success should always come taking on new things in life .

To say perfectly a sucessful person is one who succeds in trying out new things and plans .
Trying out new things is definetly related with risk taking .
As complicated the plan will be risk accosiated with it will also be high .
Its not great on implementing the older ideas but to go on for self associated ideas .
Fear for failure should not be associated otherwise it will reflect on your work .

For example if scientists does not go for newly generated ideas many familiar inventions wuold not have been possible .
Such as computers , cellphones , telivisions etc.the amount of risk associated with it is also high .
If suppose if a batsman thinks of hitting a six as a risk then he ca n't ever succed in his life .
Accordingly if he plays without fear many milestones would be crossed by him .
So both name and fame will be associated with him through out his life .

So generation of new ideas and the amount of risk associated with it gives greater chance to develop in life .
This not only supports for development in life but also raises respect for us in the human society .
Majorly successful people are recognised due to implementation of their own ideas and the risk associated with it .
Instead many people want to succed copying other ideas and implementing on the well known fact .
But success counts on new ideas and the risk factor .
Hence success accuont on the people who work hard to succed which is reflected in their ideas .
