In our society every person have their own way of thinking some think that it is important for students to understand ideas and concept while other prefer that it is important for students to learn facts .
I agree , student should learn the concept and ideas first and then they should learn other things .
if they does not able to learn ideas and concept then they will not able to learn other things .

Firstly , the student should learn the ideas and the concept of the particular topic .
For instance , when teacher teach their student .
teacher forces the student to learn first the concept of the topic she explained .
Also after teching the topic teacher usually ask the student that whether the got the idea about what she taught and also asks them to explain what they learned .
if the student was not able to understand about the idea of the topic , then he is not able to answer the question that the teacher asked him .
Furthermore , In every field it is necessary to understand the idea and the concept .

Additionally suppose for example , In science there are various laws which always has some concept for instance , about the gravitional .
In the law of the gravitional force , the scientsist want to infer that , that law states some idea and the concept about the force .
Same thing is there in the maths law is also based in some law and conceept which we apply later on for solving the problem .

Secondly , It is impossible for any student to learn fact without understanding the idea and the concept of the particular topic .
I m working in the field of research where we have to first understand the ideas and the concept .
Additionally when i was child one of the professor taught me first understand the idea and the concept of the topic when i was studying about the science , he also told me every topic is based on some iea or the concept .

In summary , it is important for the every student to understand the idea and the concept of the topic , which will help them later in the future .
