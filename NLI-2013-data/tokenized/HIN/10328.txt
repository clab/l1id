I disagree with the mentioned statement .
A successful person will be having complete knowledge of his specialization .
He is generally percieved to be a master in his field .
This , generally is true .
However there is also another particular trait of a succesful man i.e he will also try to explore new avenues to improve his knowledge and skills .
This is again percieved to be an over the top move or a `` risk '' .
But this is not true , because knowledge is an ocean whose depths are unknown .
A successful person is not satisfied with the knowledge he has got and always try to do one better .

A successful person always believes that if he loses the quest for knowledge he will lose the will to succeed .
Also if a person is satisfied with whatever he has got and achieved it leads to its stagnation and he does not grow as an individual .
Hence it would be inappropriate to term this quest as a `` risk '' .
A successful person always enjoys the pains for trying out new things or venturing into new topics .
It may appear as a risk to teh watcher but for a successful person it is the divine pleasure of learning .
This learning could be of various types ranging for wide range of subjects to learning something which is embibed in the nature .
As long as it is constructive in building his character he is happy .
More over trying new things makes us gain knowledge which is the biggest gain in life and nullifies any other loss that we could experience .
A successful person can start his life fromany adversities he faces utilizing the knowlege he gained by venturing into various diffrent things .
Hence it would be inappropriate to say that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
