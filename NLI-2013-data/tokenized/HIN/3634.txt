The communitiy gives an environment that helps us to learn , grow and progress in life .
Therefore helping the community is an important responsibility of every citizen .
However , we freqeuntly find young people of the current generation not giving enough time for the benefit of the community on account of varied reasons such as lack of availability of time , lack of awareness , etc .
But , I feel that many young people do work for community service in some form .

Increased competition and complexity besiege the life and career of many young people of the current generation .
Young people are busy advancing their personal goals in life and seldom find time for community service .
Many-a-times lack of awareness about options available for community service in a area leads one to not give enough time for community service .
We find numerous examples of people of such kind .

However , to conclude that all young people do not give enough time to community service would not be appropriate .
There are several organizations like the `` Yuva '' in Mumbai which are channelizing the efforts of the young people interested in community service .
The number , membership and work of such organizations is growing .

Also , there a lot of young graduates these days who choose community service as a career option even when they have to accept lower salaries .
Increase satisfaction serves as their prime motivation .
Besides , especially in India , I see a lot of people choosing civil service option with an objective of serving the society .

Thus , we see a mixed trend in the dedication of the young people of the current generation to their communities .
On one hand , we find young people who are completely selfish and do not care about community , while on the other hand we find those that dedicate themselves for community service .
Most of the people stand some where in between .
On the whole , I find that the awareness about , interest in , and efforts towards community service are increasing .
