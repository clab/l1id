`` The younger generation just dont listen and pay gratitude towards community '' .
This is the statement I very often listen from my grandfather .
Have the younger generation actually become so selfish and preoccupied in their own world that they do n't even have time for their own people ?
Being a young man myself , I feel that it is shameful , but true .

With the advent of technology , the world has become fast paced .
Everybody is short of time is always busy with worldly matters .
The greatest impact of this is seen in the younger generation .
Younger generation are called the future of a nation .
They constitute that section of the society which is very vibrant and full of energy .
At the same time they are also immature and tend to get influenced by external forces , the most .
So , they tend to get distracted to a number of activities around them .
So getting attracted to Rock music , going to concerts is natural .

But let me pose a question to all the youngsters - Have you ever gone to do community services - like helping old people , helping out orphans , or planting trees ?
I bet the answer to my question would be a unanimous `` No '' .

Futhermore , youngsters nowadays are excessively involved in partying with friends or playing online computer games that these type of community activities have the least priority on their list .
Infact , these are sometimes considered to be boring and the `` Older people 's job '' .

The young people need to realise this fact that it is due to a mutual interaction between an individual and his community that an individual develops .
So , the individual requires to take care of his community .

But , Is it that it is solely the younger generation responsible for this apathy .
I think there is some other aspect to this discussion as well .
This is based on what I have seen in my college .
There is a small percentage of youngsters who are interested in doing good for the community , but due to the excessive pressure of the parents to excel in the exams , loads of courses that we are required to complete and excessive competition , these students are unable to do anything concrete .
Who is responsible for this the youngsters or the elders ?
It is pretty clear , the authorities have to think on these lines if serving the community is a matter of concern .
For example , the college authorities can float a compulsory course in Community Service .
So , in a way this course will motivate other student as well as let the already interested students to participate .

In conclusion , the younger generation need to realize that it is their responsibility to help the community because it is only bcause of this community that they would flourish in the future .
They need to understand that if they help the community the community would surely pay them back in a good way .
