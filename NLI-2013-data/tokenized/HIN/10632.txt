in my opinion succesful people have always succeded when they have taken the risk .
behind every successful man or company their is huge amount of risk involved .
some people even believe that thier is no fun without the risk .

for example if gandhi wouldnt have taken the risk of his life and continued his work of that of a lawyer in south africa , india wouldnt have been an independent country today .
so for every succesful mission to take place a risk has to be involved .

all the leading buisness companies of the world take a major risk when they invests into a new project .
the new projects may or may not do well and the company might run into losses .
but most of the successful people are ready to take this risk and most of them are suceesful in their plans .

over the years the risk factor has been taken into consideration by all leading men and they take the risk into account even before they take up a buissness .
but its annoying to know that these people who are mostly successful when they have taken the risk or taken a chance have been successful otherwise today we wouldnt be connected to the entire world through the internet if the risk was not taken .
we wouldnt be doing so much with the computer if bill gates wouldnt have taken the risk and invested so much in only developing computers and its softtwares .

people who are successful in share markets are prone to huge risk and losses but all the leading men in share companies take risk and are successful also .
all the world leaders are also subjected to risk of their lifes but the dont step back from their posts .
the are subjected to risk of their lifes from terrorists and opposition also but this doesnt stop them and they are all world class suceesful leaders .

in conclusion i would like to say that mostly people have been successful when they have taken the risk and they continue to do that rather than do what they already know how to do well .
