I disagree with the statement `` Young people do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
You can find youngsters doing commuty services at college , at the welfare clubs and anywhere they find themselves needed .

College is main area of such service centres .
They have their own groups there that does works like collecting funds from students for a worthy cause , or conducting any event , may it be cultural or academic to raise the money for a need .
I would like to quote something related to the recent `` tsunami '' attack that killed lives of many .
There were casualties and loss of properties and the poor people who live in coastal regions were badly affected .
Our college group , who wanted to help the victims , raised a `` Contribute some and Save them '' event to raise money , and it colleceted a gross amount nearing eighty thousand .
It would be small , when only one college is considered , But when all the colleges in that area are considered its a substantial sum .
Its even amazing how much such events in colleges throughout the country would have acquired .

Another instance to quote is the recent `` Blood Donation '' camp that was organised by the youth club in my locality .
The event was done with guidance and it was a huge success .
People , mainly youngsters - both boys and girls participated whole heartedly .
And it surely would save lives .

Not only at college or residential area , even at our workplace such services occur frequently - may be blood donation camp , may be raising money for a cause , or maybe visiting a hospital or an orphanage .
These visits include spending time the children in orphanage and making them smile and doing cultural perfomances to give them a good time .
Or hospital visit - majorly to help in soothing the patients and hearing their problems .
Both visits end up in donations being made to them .

These show that youngsters are doing community services very good .
