There are three aspects of traveling involved in the statement .
First , the best way to travel ; second , traveling in group and third , having a tour guide .
I do not agree with the statement as a whole and I will explain with respect to each aspect of the statement that I pointed out above .
The following are my reasons for my disagreement :

I believe there is no one best way to travel .
It is a very personal preference and differs from person to person .
The best way to travel really depends on what kind of place are you going to tour , what is your objective of touring and what are your preferences .

Some people may enjoy company of a large number of people while traveling and some people may love to travel all alone and experiment during their travel .
I do believe traveling in group leb by a tour guide can be very enjoyable but sometime traveling in group without a travel guide or traveling individually can also be enjoyable .
Traveling in group has it 's own problems .
There might be disagreements among group members and it may delay things .

If my objective of touring is to learn and at the same time enjoy the company of my friends and family members than I would prefer to go in a group led by a tourist guide .
Tourist guides are familiar with the place and they can provide us the history of the place in a very short time and you may not have to put lots of efforts to know about the place .
If my objective of touring is to explore new place , learn more about the place than having a tour guide may not serve the purpose .
Tour guide provides a snapshot of the history of the place .
In this situation I would like to travel on my own and explore the place in my own style .

To sum up , I would choose my traveling method depending on the situation and my personal objective .
If I want to spend time with family members I would like to travel with my family members in a group and would like a tour guide to help us but if I want to explore and experiment with a new place I would prefer to travel alone so that I have independence and liberty to take my decisions and experiment .
