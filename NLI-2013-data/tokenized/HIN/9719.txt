Success is not about `` How you do things '' but it is about `` How do you do things different from others '' .
I completly agree to this phrase , successful people are the one who do things in a different manner , and who are more creative and accept changes .
Success counts on your ability to create something different and therefore , I feel successful people always search for new ideas and new methods of presenting them to people .

Let me speak about a successful person , Mr. Bill gates , every single person on this earth has heard this name .
He was the one who contributed in creating the best way to use computer and made learning computer and using them so easy .
He was a known person and he became successful for one main reason `` he acheived it first '' .
The idea that he had for being successful could have been used by someone else and this would have not given him that fame nor the credit , because he was the first person to invent and start the new technology he was so well known .

It is important to be creative and to do things different from others for being successful but also the time that you use to achieve your goals is important .
This is the main reason people prefer taking risk in whatever they do and this helps them to grow better and faster as a professional and also a human being .
Doing things that has already been discovered will not make you successfull as you will just be following the successfull person .

People who feel secured in their comfort zone wont try to do things new as they are scared of the failure they might come across and they will do things only if someone before them had tried and knows that it works without any problems or risks .
People with different attitude towards life but the same qualification work as collegues , but some grow faster some stay where they are due to the factor of taking risk and trying to do things better than others .

Thats one of the reason being successful is difficult , as it requires you to use your brain and work towards achieving the goals that you have set within a particular span of time , rather then sitting and waiting for someone else to do it for you .
