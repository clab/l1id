In my openion young people do enjoy life more than older people .
This is a very evident fact and can be said based on reasons .

Firstly , Younger people have more risk taking and dander facing tendancy than older people .
Young people are carefree and more enthuziastic than older people and hence they tend to perform any activity for just the sake of enjoyment .
While older people do not have that carefree and risk taking attitude .
Older people are much mature and tend to focus more on the danger and possibility of damage or accident that lays ahead .
So , younger people many times enjoy themselves by taking up risky sports like car and motor-bike racing , bungy jumping and para-sailing .

Secondly , the phsical conditions of older people does not many times allow them to move to different places and perform many fun related activities .
While the body of younger people is more flexible and strong so they get less tired .
So , they can enjoy by taking up sports , long country tour and other similar activities as a source of enjoyment for themselves .
Also , young people are more flexible an adaptable towards the changes in the culture and in technology and hence more by going to a disco , pub , getting tattoos , playing games on computer and using various eletronic items like i-pods and mp3 player .

Lastly , though it is possible for older people to enjoy life but they are not able to enjoy as much as younger people due to other limitations .
Older people have many responsibilities of family , work and society on them .
So , they are not able to enjoy themselves as much as young people who are free from these responsibilities and have much more time to enjoy .

Therefore , it can be said that due to carefree , flexible and risk taking nature of young people it is possibe for them to enjoy more than the adults who are less flexible and have much more responsibilities on themselves .
