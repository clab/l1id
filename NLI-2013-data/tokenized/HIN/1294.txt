In today 's world where information is the key factor in any success and the things are so complex that every subject is related to another area , I would agree with the idea that the knowledge of many academic subjects is better .
The communication is the key factor for success today and the successful and effective communications need information on varied topics and different aspects of a subject .
To communicate effectively it is very important to have knowledge on various subjects and multiple aspects related to a subject .
Since the things are so complex and closely related it makes it a neccesity to have knowledge on related subjects even when one is talking about a particular subject .

Another key reason for which I would favor the knowledge on multiple subjects is the fact that this provides multiple opportunities in choosing profession and choosing things one likes .
Until one has information on various subjects the opinions and the likings are biased and are because of the lack of awareness .

The knowledge on various subjects makes things interesting and a person curious which further adds to the knowledge of the person and thus such a person grows its knwoledge continually .
