Iam in complete agreement with this statement .
Nowadays , young people are not devoting sufficient time to helping their communities .
There are several reasons why I believe so and I shall put forth some of them .
I shall also try to cite some reasons why I believe such a behavior is prevalent today .

There are several examples that illustrate the declining devotion to the communities .
Earlier in India , there used to be a lot of institutions that used to help out the poor people .
A primary example is the service institute run by Mother Teresa .
But such instances are on a rapid decline these days .
In our school , we were required to complete 20 compulsory hours of community service , where we had to teach illiterate people , young or old .
To me , this presented us with an excellent opportunity of putting our knowledge to good use , doing something that would benefit our community and our country .
But a lot of students used to bunk these classes and used some unfair means to put in the attendance .
As a result , this requirement of community service was removed after we passed out , which clearly illustrates the feeling the young people have towards their communities .

It is true that a number of institutions are coming up in India that aim to help out the elder members of the society .
This might be considered to be a positive development .
But when we look closely , we notice an alarming fact .
Why are these institutes needed .
The reason is that young people do not stay around to help and support their parents .
The parents , when they get old , need some help , and since their own sons/daughters are not around to help , they seek refuge in such institutions .
This demonstrates the level of selfishness that prevails amongst the youth of our country .

To me , my community also comprises of my family members , relatives and neighbors .
People have even stopped caring for their parents these days .
Lot of students graduate and go abroad and then forget their parents .
They do n't come back , do n't enquire about their health and do n't send money that their parents may require .
Selfish attitude has become prevalent in the Indian society these days , where you do n't care for anyone else but for yourself .
The parents , who have sacrificed so much in bringing you up , are not given the respect and attention they deserve in old age .
Little can one expect the youth to go around helping the communities they belong to .

If we look closely , we might be able to find the reasons why young people are neglecting their communities these days .
The world has become extremely competetive and as a result , people need to work a lot harder than those of say 50 years back .
The competetion has become very stiff and as a result , a lot of time has to be devoted for personal things like studying for various exams , working overtime at work places , etc .
So , the increasing competetion might be one of the major factors why young people do n't devote enough time for their communities these days .

Increasing job opportunities abroad might also be a reason for this kind of behavior .
The kind of money that is offered in some jobs abroad is extremely tempting .
Young people flee from their countries , never to return .
They become intoxicated wth the new way of life and forget all their obligations towards their parents , friends , relatives and their other communitites .

Thus , in my opinion it is true that the young people of today are not devoting enough time , if any , in helping out their communities .
