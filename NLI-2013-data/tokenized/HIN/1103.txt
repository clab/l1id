It has been rightly said ,
`` Little knowledge is a dangerous thing ,
Drink deep or taste not the Pierian Spring ,
There small draughts intoxicate the brain ,
While drinking largely sobers us again ! ''
Indeed , I believe that instead of limiting kowledge to small draughts of one subject , it is much more beneficial to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects just like drinking largely from the Pierian Spring .

If we specialize in one subject , our knowledge is contained only within the narrow boundaries of that subject while the vast ocean of truth lies undiscovered before us .
We become ignorant about other impotant things that we need to know in order to attain a high level of intelligence and understanding .
By specializing in one subject , we tend to forget that there are millions of other possibilities in store for us , that there is so much knowlege to gain in this world and so little time .

With a broad knowledge or several things , we widen our vision and expand our horizons .
We realize that we have miles to go before we sleep .
Broad knowlege enlightens us about the vastness of this universe and makes us aware that even if we spend out entire lifetime gaining knowledge , there will still be thousands of things that we are ignorant about .

Another important fact is that various aspects of knowledge are related to one another .
Without being aware of other subjects , knowledge of our own subject becomes constricted and we tend to have a narrow minded approach towards things .
Moreover , if facts are bricks , accumulation of facts is as much knowledge as a pile of bricks is a house .
We need to know what is going on around us to put our knowledge to good use .

Also , practically speaking , what use is speacialization in one subject in our daily lives ?
Is a Ph .
D in microbiology going to help us cope with the obstacles of everyday life ?
Only awareness of every branch of academics can enable us to practically gain benefits .

So , it is my firm opinion that one should try to learn as much as possible in this short life given to us .
I , personally , would prefer to be a jack of all trades rather than a master of just one .
