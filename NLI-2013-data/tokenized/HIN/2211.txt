Does age really make a difference towards enjoyment ?
Is it only the young who can enjoy and not the old ?
Enjoyment is a feeling which every human being experiences .
Each person whether young or old can enjoy in different ways .
Enjoyment has no bars however the type of activities one maybe involved in to enjoy may differ .

For example , for a young person going to the disco or pubs may be a form of entertainment and enjoyment , however for an older person just reading a book , watching television or going for a long walk may be more satisfying rather than going to the discos .
But not all young people would do this as a form of enjoyment .
Due to ones maturity and age , older people may not like to be around noise or for medical reasons , they may not be able to drink at pubs .

A person who is old is unable to do things that a younger person can .
For example a young person may like to go rope climbing or bungee jumping to enjoy him/herself .
An older person may not be able to engage in such activities as he/she may not be physically strong to be able to do so even if he/she may really want to .

From the above examples , it is visible that there are certain activities that an older person may not be able to indulge in due to their age or physical situations .
Each ones form of enjoyment may differ , not everyone who is young may want to go to a disco or pub .
A younger person may also like to stay at home and read .
Hence its not only the young who can enjoy , its also the old who can enjoy in their own ways .
Hence age should not be a factor towards enjoying life !
Lets live life to the fullest since it is short !
