I do n't agree with this statement that `` there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
In today 's fast life , as no one has time even for breakfast , and time for more competetion and hurry has come for everyone .
I think there will be more need of cars in coming next twenty years , because life will become more advance than today .

First , People use car for going different places such as schools , colleges , work places or any other place such as going for a trip with family or friends .
Going on a trip with family or friends is not possbile without car , we will not enjoy if we will not go by car .
If we will go by train or any other way , I think we will not enjoy our trip more .
This prove that use of car can not be stop , and it will become more and more in the coming years .
And one important thing is that people are going towards luxourious life more in coming years .

Second , as competition is growing more and more between peoples of the same or different organization , they need to manage their time fastly and effectively so , they use cars and use of car can not be stop in the coming years .
In a daily routine Business people , Job workers , self employed everyone needs a personal car so that they can use that on their personal level .
In morning they go to their office , from office to their mettings at different places and then again return to home at late nights .
These all is not possible without the use of car .

Overall , I think that as long as life will go on the use of car will go on on and in the coming years its use will become more .
