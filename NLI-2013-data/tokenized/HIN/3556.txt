I disagree with the statement .
An elaborate analysis of the reasons in favour of and against the notion would clarify my stand and help us develop a better understanding of the concept .

Some would say that the young generation is money oriented and is involved in selfish deeds .
But the point to be considererd here is that these money oriented youngsters contribute to the formation of a strong world economic backbone .
Hence , every moment spend in earning money is in itself a contribution towards the upliftment of their communities .

Youngsters do not look at the world like a divided place with boundaries and categories of communities .
Tied up with the string of globalisation they all feel united and responsible to their single world global community .
They serve in every fields of life and hence ensure a global upliftment of the human race .
They are there in development of new technologies in the various fields like medication , communication , etc .

Along with contributing indirecttly towards their community they also face thei responsibilities directly .
They perform vital roles in representing their communities politically .
The special needs of each community is explained by its representative properly .

Moreover they are there in the entertainment industry , hence representing their respeftive communities before the entire world and help them being a part of the global happy family .
The idea of globalisation is so ingratiated into the comming genereations that they are ready to shed all the differences of color cast race etc and come united under the shade of love for each other .

Hence keeping in mind that the revolutionay idea of globlisation has changed the world I stick to my stand
