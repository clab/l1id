Young people enjoy life more than older people do i am truley agree with this statement .
I support this statement because young people are with full of energies and power to enjoy and celebarte each of their day as a festiwal .
On the contrast old people have little energy to enjoy .

As time paases the old people are become less energetic , emotionally weak and depend on young people in every aspect of life .
another reason , i support this statement is young people are full of sprits as they have not seen the hardships of life and they have the companion or a partner to enjoy with them , on the other hand , old people have seen many problems and they usually stay alone as their partner are not with them or their children are far away .
They either are studying or they left them alone in long journey of life .

furthermore , the young people are well in every aspect such as health .
They are also independent finencially .
Whereas old people they are not healthy socially and as well as mentally and they have to depend finencially on others .

and in the last i would say because of changing patterns of life the true meanig of enjoyment is lost .
now a days people are become very materialstic and parctical and they try to within themselves .
But in older times people used to enjoy with others and were very social .
Last but not the least to enjoy life age is not the limitaion , you should have tendency to enjoy ever aspect of life .

And young people should take care of their elders and try to enjoy with them also
