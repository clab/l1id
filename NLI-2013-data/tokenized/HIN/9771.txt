I believe that it is not necessary that successful people try new thing and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .

For me , success is an absolute term .
It cannot be defined by some standards like having money or a high position in job .
Success is what you feel it is .
For some people success may be to lead a peaceful life with family and friends while sharing whatever you have .
So in that terms a person may be successful by just doing whatever he knows to do well .

On the other hand , those who try new things and take risks may not be successful .
Taking risks has both pros and cons .
One may achieve a lot and at the same time there is a possibility that he may lose everything he has , while a person who does whatever he knows well is sure to keep doing that part and be content .
In taking risks and trying new things , until you succeed you have the fear of losing .
You put not only your happiness and well being at stake , but also of those who are dependent on you for their happiness .

A person trying to do new things has to devote a lot of time researching the options , finding the best opportunity or creating one and then working on it .
If he devotes the same time in doing what he already knows , he can spare some time for pleasure and fun .
There are no statistics to prove that conservatives ( who do not take risks ) are less successful as compared to aggresives ( who take risks ) .

Risk averse and risk tolerant attitudes are also reflective of a culture or background .
Again , there are no reports that show that people who took risks and tried new things were the only ones to succeed .
e.g. Mother Teresa is a successful personality .
She did social work which she new well and kept doing it till the end of her life .
Similarly there are examples of people who gamble with the view of taking risk and trying to be successful , but lose everything .

In conclusion , I would say that if for me success is to be happy and satisfied in life and I am happy and satisfied while doing whatever I know to do well , then I am a successful person .
