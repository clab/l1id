The statement states the contribution of young people to their communities .
The statement is very important and holds a very strong base in a modern time , it basically would help us to conclud that in which society we are actually living and what generation we are producing .
According to my view , I am totally disagree with this jugdement and there are several areas which shows that there are young generation who are actually working towords it .

First point I would like to give , there are several societies and voluntary organisation run by young couples which are working old age people , actually help them to re-establishing their life again .

Second points there are couple of people who are assoicated with organisation and give the monetary help for education of poor children , Moreover they are running the evening classes for uneducated older and weaker section of soceity after the office hours .

Thirdly , there are many Industries which have made funds for medical aid to weaker section of soceity and furthermore the HR departments are organising various medical camp for medical aid to weaker section i.e the blood donation camp .

Lastly , now a days various youth unions are conducting the cultural events for various natrual clamities that has destructed various regions .
for example Creckit match has been organised recently for Sonume tragedy .

In the conculsion we can say the our roots have been developed in such a way that we can not neglect the importance of society and its members .
Its been proved above by various example the young people are actually taking out time and working for the betterment of waeker and older section of soceity to bring harmony and peace in all the section of various communities .
