I agree that in twenty years , the number of cars in use shall go down .
At first glance , this might appear absurd and strange , what with the rapid technological , social and economic growth everyday .
However , on carefully analyzing and thinking about it , this claim actually makes sense .
I shall try to elucidate on why I feel that there will be fewer cars after twenty years .

The population of this world is increasing day by day .
Public places are often jam packed .
Traffic jams , accidents and so on are the order of the day .
If this is the situation now , one can imagine the state of affairs after twenty years if things continue like this .
Think of any big city and unfortunately the first picture that comes to mind is of heavy traffic , lots of people and no space .
Because of the rapid development and technological advancement , one often says that ` the world has become smaller ' .
This statement sounds highly appealing in a figurative sense .
But after all , the world is physically of a fixed size too !
If the number of people and their cars keeps on going up , where will all of them be accomodated ?

Be it small cars or big cars , the pollution levels are at an all time high .
The fumes from these cars result in lung related diseases and breathing problems .
When the number of cars was small , these issues were often brushed under the carpet .
However , now is the time to think of these things .

At an age when we are facing the consequences of our actions , be it in terms of global warming or war , people need to realize that we should look for alternatives before it gets too late .
Community vehicles , car pooling , even bicycling ( for short distances ) often result in much less tension and effort in moving about today .
With more efficient buses , metros and trains , people have started to realize that driving around in a car is becoming more of a nuisance than a convenience .

There is also a growing concern about the limited petroleum resources in this world .
The petrol , diesel and oil prices keep shooting up day by day .
We need to find alternate modes of travel using renewable sources of energy like solar or wind .
People are researching on solar cars or wind driven cars .

With the scale of progress today , the open sky might also turn out to be a very viable option .
If we can introduce cheaper air travel even between shorter distances , this will not only result in much faster travel but shall also help ` decongest ' the earth .

Unfortunately today , people have become so lazy that even for short distances they prefer to drive rather than walk or cycle down .
But people need to realize that this phenomenal growth in cars cannot go on indefinately .
People need to look for alternatives .
I am hopeful that in twenty years , we would have shifted our focus from cars to public transport , non-petroleum based vehicles and perhaps even air travel .
