In my openion , Successful people should try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
people can improve their skills , knowledge and achieve a great successthat can help them to become a famouse person .
I have three reason to supprot my openion .

reason first is If the Successful person try new thing than that person can Improve skills .
If his / her work is more riscky than whtever he/she did before than that person can get more experience .
For Example , One ancient people investgate how to make a wheel out of wood .
After that they Made cart by using that wheel and they became successfull .
After making a cart they did n't take any risk to make any equipment or any vehicle .
so , Do u think that we are able to use cars today ?
No , We wo n't be able to use car but , they worked ahead and took risk and find more ways to use that wheel .
Theire skills of understanding increased by their risky work .

Second reason is If successful person try a new things and take risk than only doing what they already know how to do well , than that person 's expereince will become limited .
that prson does n't know anything rather than he/she already know how to do well .
For examle , If the person suceesfully become a teacher and after that he did n't read any source .
Than , his knowledge will become limited .
If a student ask him question and that teacher will not be able to answer his question .
Only becouse He was satisfied with his success , He did n't studied anything accept whatever he studied during his school and university and he stoped reading .

Consequently , I strongly disagree with the statement about
