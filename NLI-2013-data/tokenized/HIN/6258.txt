It is hard to predict the number of cars after twenty years .
As we can see that the technology is emerging greatly .
We can assure this much that the public transport will be improved in coming years .
But also considering the fact that most of the people are working and earning good , they prefer to keep their own transport vehicle .

Technology improvement confirm that public transport like metro train , delux buses provide convinent transport to many people .
Most of the people from middle class or lower class prefer to travel by means of this transport and save their money over the high rate petrol or desiel .
If government keep on providing this high technology transport or some better transport than we can hope some decline in the number of car present .

Now a days many of the people are having satisfying jobs .
This increase in employment give a hint that most of the people will going to have a good salary in future .
This kind of people will not worry about spending money on petrol or buying a car .
Cars have become a status symbol for many high class people .
Also the low rate of cars are also attracting the public of middle class .
If the rate of cars keep on decreasing than there will be a chance that in coming future there will be nothing but the cars on the road .

It depend on the government to increase or decrease the number of cars .
If government will provide the low rate and more convenient public transport than the normal human being will prefer to take the advantage of high quality transportation syatem .
But government need to keep a check on the rates and stock of car which come in the market .
Also an individual need to understand that whether the car is his real requirement or just a piece to show in public .
Keeping an account on this point we can hope for a better futur with less number of cars .
