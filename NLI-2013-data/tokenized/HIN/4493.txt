I agree to the statement that most of the advertisements make their produts look more better than they really are .
I agree this from my personnal experience , it has happened with me all the time .
When i see some advertise in television , news paper or a magazine , it looks appealing to me but it gives me nothing but disappointment .
Advertisers attract common peopel by using famous people , stars and attractive models to sale their products .

Recently i saw one advertise in a magazine about one kitchen appliance which can cut and grind all the fruits and vegetables with ease and in all the shapes and size you need .

Looking at the advertise and the way they had presented it felt like all my problems wil get solved by getting it at home .
The very same day i got it and it proved to be a desaster , it could n't do a single thing that was shown .
Marketers attract people by showing all the good things which a person could imagine without judging its truth .

Many people do get fooled because of the advertisement .
Even produsers and distributers of movie try to sale their products by showing trailers in a manner that everybody feels that this movie is the biggest hit of the year and it is watchable .
But many a times we come out without being entertained .

Advertisers are those who put a attractive gift wraper on the real product .
They cover up faults and present it in a glamourous way which compels people to go for it .
