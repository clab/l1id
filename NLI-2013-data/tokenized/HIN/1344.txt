In my opinion one must rather specialize in a specific topic , rather then have broad knowledge on various fields .
It is also a lot easier to gain knowledge on a variety of topics superficially .
While this may give us a lot of information , it will not be helpful in getting answers .

In the past , it was perhaps more beneficail to have a wider range of information .
However , as we continue to advance in all walks of life , it is going to become increasingly difficult to obtain new information unless we dig deeper and deeper in the topics at hand .
This will require a us to specialize in specific areas of study .
We will have to tackle problems at even more minute levels .
We can consider the exapmle of Biotechnology .
This field traditionally included the subjects of molecular and cell biology , and the basics of biochemistry and physiology .
Today however , biotechnology spans areas such as particle physics , high speed computing and even biomechanical engineering .
It would be virtually impossible to have information about all these branches .
Moreover , the only way to excel at these topics would be to specialize in them .

The need of the hour is collaboration between individuals in specialized fields .
with a high level of specialized knowledge .
On a more personal front , I feel than a persons self worth is perhaps elevated when he/she masters their field of interest .
It seems rather easy to gain broad basic knowledge as it is so readily available .
With tools such as the mass media and specially the internet , it will be even simpler to do so .
However , specialized knowledge will push us to think in newer directions .
Collaborative efforts between specialists in different fields will help us decipher several vexing problems which currently have no answer .
Overall , it will give rise to newer and beneficial technologies .
An only through specialized study can we be a part of this revolution .
