I agree with the statement that , `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
In this essay I will present a variety of reasons and examples that support my conviction .

The very purpose of an advertisement is to maximize sales of a particular product .
To maximize sales it is imperative to convince people to buy the product and make the product appear much better than it is .

Advertisements highlight the good points of a particular product while neglecting to mention its ' bad points .
Advertisements for new drugs , for instance , often highlight how a particular drug can cure a certain disease while neglecting to mention any side effects that may occur as a result of using that drug .

Some advertisements advertise qualities of the product that are unlikely to be of much use .
However , people may be encouraged to buy the product .
For example , many car advertisements advertise the top speed of car - but who is going to drive a car at 300 km/per hour ?

Other advertisements portray products as they would function under ideal conditions , without describing how they would function under conditions of common use .
For instance , advertisements for mobile phones and other technological items suggest that they can function perfectly for an indefinite time period .
This does not , of course consider the effect of normal wear and tear and entices people to buy them .

The cleverest and often the most successful advertisements make use of subtle psychological tricks to encourage people to buy products .
They do this by ascribing attributes to the product that it may , in fact , lack .
Advertisements for cigarettes are a classic example .
Cigarette users are depicted as fashionable and popular as opposed to those who do not use cigarettes .
No company mentioned the harms of cigarettes until government regulations forced them to do so .
Deodorant advertisements are another example , often suggesting that the male user of a particular deodorant would have women following him left , right and centre !

To conclude then , advertisements aim to maximize sales of products by making them seem much better than they really are .
They do this in a variety of ways - examples of which I have given in the above essay .
