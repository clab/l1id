The use of cars today is not restricted to only providing transport .
It has now infact become one of the basic requirements of each individual .
Therefore , I disagree with the statement and feel that the number of cars is surely to go up in the next two decades .

We have a reason for this right in front of us when we see massive infrastucture projects consisting of expressways , freeways , complex over bridge networks , better roads etc. being completed one after the other .
There is a conscious surge in the infrastructural development today and this is happening mainly due to a realisation that the number of vehicles is going to show a definite increase in the future .

More importantly , economically speaking , going by the rapid population increase in our country combined with the want of owning a car by each individual , we can say that it will be a major factor in alleviating the number of vehicles around .

There are several other factors too for example : Individuals nowadays are earning higher and better salaries and enjoying better perks which gives them satisfaction .
Therefore they can afford to buy a car not only for themselves but also for their working partners , which is increasing too , and sometimes also their children who wish to drive to their educational institutions on their own .

Furthermore , Some people from business families think of owning cars as more of a status symbol and therefore keep several of them even if they are using only a few .

Though the increase in the number of cars will also increase problems like high levels of pollution and stress in individuals , it is something that cannot be totally controlled .
We can foresee on the basis of the statistics of the past few decades that it is bound to happen because it has been going on the same way for quite sometime .
