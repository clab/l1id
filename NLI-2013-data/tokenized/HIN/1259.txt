Knowledge is an ocean whoose depth increases as you go deeper .
So , it is next to impossible for a human being to have a complete expertise over any subject all what a person can do is have a good approach towards a topic so as to have the best available information about it .
In my opinion it is always good have an idea of vairious academic streames and then cofine your study to a particular one when you have acquired a elementary knowledge of many .

It is very important to have fundamentals of variegated disciplines , even if it does n't relate to you .
Take an example of curriculum followed by the junior high and high schools where a student gets to learn almost all most all possible fields of study right from science to econonics to languages and history .
This helps to decide what field you may take up in your future .

Having a knowledge of different types of feilds exposes you to experiments .
You can use your knowledge for relating two different aspects of study .
Moreover it creats channels for the exchange of idea .
Else how do you expect an electronics engineer to have a discussion with an automobile engg or a computer technical .

We have real life examples like Leonaordo da vinci , Albert einstein .
Who have knowledge of multiple feilds like science , arts , philosophy and have still proved to be geniuses in what they did .
focussing on one single aspect through out your lifetime will lead to a wan and gloomy lifestyle with less interest to learn at a point of time in our life .
Whereas interactions with vairious particulars will help you discover and energetic to learn .

Having a broad knowledege of many academic subjects does n't not signify specialsing in all of them but it definetly boosts you to come out of the nutshell of a particular filed .
learning is a process which has no ends so one must keep working towards the expansion of his ` Ken ' .
Expertising any particular area does n't guarantee success neither does it hinder your path towards it , but exploirng different ideas keeps alive the desire to learn .
