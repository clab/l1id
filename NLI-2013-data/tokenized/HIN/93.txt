When we are young we are more energitic , more powerfull , more encouraging and also more willing to do new things in every part of life .
So i think yes young peoples enjoy life more than older people do .

People who are older cant enjoy that much how much younger people can .
Younger people can go for trip like rock climbing , rappling and all which old people cant .
Because of there heart problem or even they get tired very easily because of there age .

Normally old peoples dont go to collage for studies and all where young peoples have most of there fun .
They can new friends , go for parties with friends , can go for trips and all .
Which old peolpes cant do because of there health .

Take an example of new year when every young peoples go for parties and all , then they came late at night and again on other day they go to collage with that energy and again have fun which tell us that life is more enjoyable for the young peoples .

Normally each and every young people like to drive bikes and car very fast , they know that its very dangerous and even i know that they enjoy that also .
Which after an particular age they cant enjoy .

Even you can see in live world that every rock star , actors and good dancers are normally young .
There can be old also but mostly they are young .
Even all cricketers or athlics are young who can enjoy sports in that particular age limits .
This all tells us that more or less young people enjoy more then old ones .

So from all the points above we can note that young enjoy very much more than old peoples but every old goes once from young .
