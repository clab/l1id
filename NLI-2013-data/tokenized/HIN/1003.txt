It is always wise to have knowledge about a particular subject rather than knowing everything about every subject .
We all are humans and have only a limited capacity to grasp things though there are exceptions .
We can focus clearly and effectively on one particular topic at one time .
Focusing is very important for a better result and that can only be possible if we exactly know what we are going to do next .

There are lot of people in this whole world who are effectively doing research on a particular topic of their interest and therefore are expected to give productive out comes because they are very much focused .
They have enough time and energy to concentrate on a particular aspect of a research also it is a very old saying that little knowledge is a dangerous thing and as we know that our brain has only some limited capacity so we cannot afford to have profoud knowledge of each and every subject and therefore this will only result in frustration .
Also incomplete knowledge can proved to be dangerous and misguiding also .
For example if a chemistry student tries to teach physics then he surely be less effective in explaining every point because he has only limited knowledge of the subject , this will be harmful for the students he is addresing and this is quite possible that something wrong can be construed from his teachings .
Similarly a chemist cannot perform a physics experiment or vice versa and this can result in even accidents Moreover if we assume that every person know everything about every subject then this will result in decrease in interaction among people and advancements in any field will be halted because we know more the number of brains working together , more better is the outcome of the result So in my view it is always beneficial to go more deep in a particular subject rather than having a superficial knowledge of all subjects because in that way an individual can benefit the society in a more effective manner and this is also neccesory por the satisfection of the individual that he is master of atleast something .
