I do agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
Its every persons dream to become successful in life by doing some thing great for the society and mainting the same standards for long span of time .
One had to risks his everything to create some thing new , which has value and which is useful for the people in general .
New things would never discovered or come in to existence if the person like Edison , Ghram Bell and Nicolas Tesla would have risks there all possesion for there new inventions .

Thomas Edison and Nicolas Tesla were already famous for there discoveries in thier respective field like electric bulb , electrical printing press and A.C current generation and transportation of electrical current over the long distance .
These things have become essential for the human society and play great role in day to day life .
But , never did Edison or Tesla left these things there but worked over it to make it more successful .
Due to these great people thinking and risk we have new way of A.C current generation and transportation , the Inducation motor which has great impact at that time of era .
Due to there new discoveries they are more sucessful then the fellow scientist of their time because they never gave up things what they thought .

Though it takes long time for people to understand the new technology and utilize it to its full potential but that does n't mean that people should stop trying new things and stop risking lot for new discoveries .
In todays world technology development are at its higest level but there is yet new discoveries had to be done , Successful person like L.N.Mittal who never gave up or stop risking his fortune for accuring new company .
It was his dream to become the single largest steel producer or the world he did it via risking it .

i think that people should never stop risking things to become more successful .
