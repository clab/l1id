Specifically the topic refers to a very pressing problem in todays time .
As a young individual I regretfully agree to the topic that the individuals of today do not give enough time to helping their communities .

One of the reason attributed to this is that the young generation does not have enough time to deal with the problems of the society .
We are so much engrossed in our daily activities that far from giving attention to our society , we are not devoting time to our children and our aged parents .
The society has become excessively money minded , married couples are working 10-12 hours in their jobs that leaves practically no time for other matters .
I do agree that doing your job is a must but probably we have to find a way to give time to our family , society .

Helping the comminity does not only means that we donate money to it .
It probably demands much greater attention on our part .
We are learned men and women , probably the best brains ever produced , thus it is our responsibility to attack the problems together and work out a rational solution which reflects our intellect .
But the problem is again our self - centered nature .
Today people are just concerned obout themselves , their business , how much profit they made and ways to enhance their economic conditions .
The society has lost its significance as most of us today prefer to live in secluded appartments , aloof from others .
Most of the inhabitants in a building sometimes dont even know the person living next door .

Because of too much of interest in profit making nowadays , corruption has crept into our society .
The business organizations sometimes resort to unethical practices which may also endanger the health of the public which uses their products .

A recent example has been the case of softdrinks .
In order to earn more profit , the company didnt took any measures even when it was revealed that it contains large amounts of pesticides , a great danger to human health .

We have forgotten the ideals which the leaders of our country Mahatama Gandhi , etc gave us .
Today we are more inclined to fight with others , even get them killed if they do not resort to our demands .
Typical examples can be seen in the young generation in india which do not even respect their parents , leave them after all the hard work parents put to nurture them .

The generation gap is widening in our society because of which we tend to oppose uur parents and in many cases even prefer to live alone rather than living with them and serving them .

Thus in short it can be said that even though our society is advancing by leaps and bounds the moral values are degrading and we forget our community which gave us the resources and means to flourish .
