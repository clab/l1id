I completely agree with the statement .
According to me , Success cannot be acheived by a particular formula or a so called tried and tested method .
To become successful you need to have your own new or derived set of ideas that you think will make you successful .

If you have to acheive great success you have to come up with new ideas otherwise you will lose or at the maximum be moderately successful .
For eg. We all know about the `` easy '' group which is headed by Mr. Stelios .
When he tried to venture in Cruise business there were preset notions and fixed rules like the Ship had to be always be on Sea and all the luxuries of life were to be enjoyed there .
Moreover , the average age of Cruise goer was in 50's .
Stelios completely revamped this strategy and brought his ideas .
His prime area of thinking was that the cruise should attract younger people .
So he developed his own way by bringing in new concept of low cost travel and also halts at prime locations .
The Cruise took stop at places like Monte Carlo during F-1 racing which is a very expensive place to stay .
Thus it can be said that Stelios did venture into risks and tried new things in which he was successful .

If you to survive in the competitive world of today you need to try new things because there are large number of people who are goin to do the same old things that they know .
Venturing into risks is other major aspect of being successful .
You have to take calculated risks if you have to survive the competition .
For eg L N Mittal formerly the Chairman of Mittal Steel took a calculated risk by weighing his options and did a bid to take over another steel major Arcelor .
He did became successful in his venture and now runs the biggest Steel making company Arcelor Mittal .

So if you have to be successful in any field you would have to break the stereotype and find a path for yourself that you feel is going to make you successful
