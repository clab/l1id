There is an old saying which states -

`` Jack of all trades and master of none ''

I personally believe that being jack of all trades and master of none would never do any good to anyone .

This leads to my disagreement with the given statement which states it is better to have broad knowledge of many fields than to specialize in one specific subject .

I do not deny the fact that it is important for one to have a broad knowledge of various academic subjects , but in no way is it better than to specialize in one specific subject .

Academics is all about gaining knowledge .
Ever since our childhood , we are taught various subjects .
Initially a child is taught the basics and then gradually the intricacies of the subject would be taught .
On one hand , where it is good to know the basics of a subject , on the other hand it also becomes very important to attain specialization in one particular area of one 's interest .

It is said ` Half knowldege is a dangerous thing ' .

When you know something of every thing and nothing of one particular thing , it might result in serious disaster .

For example , if a medical student who has not pursued his masters in nuerology is made to give a treatment to a patient with nervous breakdown , then , with his limited knowledge of whatever nuerology was taught to the him in his initial years of pursuing medicine , the student might end up in taking the patient 's life altogether .

What patient needs is not a person with varied knowledge in different streams , but a nuero surgeon who is a specialist .

Another reason why it becomes important to attain specialization is the fact that every body is blessed with one or the other skill .
And so , a complete justice must be made to whatever skill one is blessed with .
Now this can only be achieved if the person shows perseverance and dedication towards his potential in the skill and attains expertise in it .

For instance , a work which is done by a carpentar could never be done with the same finnese by a plumber , how ever talented the plumber might be .

Each one of us have our own talents and skills and so we must pursue them further till the skills reach pinnacle of finnese and perfection .

Primarily , if only a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is given to a student and the students decides not to go for perfection , he would not only end up messing his own life , but also of many others surrounding him .

The whole world would then be filled up with many people who know many things , tits and bits of every thing but the indepth knowledge would be misisng .

This would mean , there would be no doctors , no lawers , no engineers and no researches .

Where as , the specialization would enhance one 's capability , one talent and potential and make this whole world a lot better place to live in .

Conclusion :
It is important for a students or an individiual to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects but what is more important is to gain specialization in one of the fields which interests or appeals the most to the student .
This would not only place the entire education system in an order but would also result in a highly talented pool of individuals who would be of some worth to the society and inturn would become its priced assets .

An indepth knoweldge is always better than having half acquired knowledge .
Where on one hand the latter could destoy the civilization , the former would develop the whole civilzation and would make this whole world a much better place to live in .
