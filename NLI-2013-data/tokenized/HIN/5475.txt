I totally agree with the statement .
The basic purpose of an advertisement is - publicity .
And the more flashy an advertisement is the better publicity it attains .

It all derives from the fundamental rule of business and marketing , that is , making profit .
when a product is launched into the market , stress is laid on how wel it is advertised so that it catches the attention and interest of the masses and not on how wel it is going to stand upto their expectations .
So the ground rule laid for the advertising companies is to make the advertisements ( or ` ads ' as it is more preferably addressed ) as luring as possible .
And hence , most of the times the ads end up promising much more than what the products actually deliver .
On quite a number of occasions the ads have been found guilty of misleading the masses .
They lead people to believe how safe and benefitial the product is when actually the safety front has been compromised .
The recent decline in the number of people indulging in soft drinks after some toxic chemicals were found in their contents is a good example of how the advertisements blow the products out of proportion .
In order to make huge profits every product is depicted as an ideal one but the the flaws only start appearing after a while when it is actually used for a period of time .
the sad part is they prey on the most comely bait i.e. the common people .
They are the one who have to bear the brunt of all the false claims made in the advertisements .

Making advertisements is a very innovative work its true , but it should never compromise on its ethics which on most number of occasions it does .
It should always be kept in mind that in a way it is also a means of serving the people as it lets them know about the things that are available to them and that can make their lives better in one way or the other .
Today most of the advertisements do not seem to realise this and are evasive of their responsibility towards the people and the society .
