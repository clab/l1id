Iam totally disagree with this statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . ''
Car , which was the travelling mode ( venegance ) for the privileged class in early 20th century , but with the growth of the technology now the cars is there in every house and in every streets .

The new technology makes the use of car more reliable and inexpensive .
After twenty years , the use of cars will definetely increase with the inovation of new new automobile technologies .
The use of solar car will replace the use of fuel feeding cars .
The modern technology made solar cars but still it is rare to find them in streets .
Because they are very expensive .
But after twenty years this expensive mode will also be available at reliable rates .

The constructions of fly overs , underground tunnels and the highways were help the people to go from one place to another with saving their time which otherwise they lost by hanging out in the heavy rush .
But how the people will travel from one place to another ?
They will prefer for self vehicles .
And if the solar cars which will be reliable to get then why the use of cars after twenty years will decrease ?

Every one wants to live a fast and speedy life .
Then why they will waste their time by depending on buses , trains .
They will try to have their own vehicle and the vehicle which is comfortable and inexpensive .
After twenty years the car rates will defenitely be reduced and every one will have their own car .

The problem after twenty years for using the cars will be of fuel , which is probably at the stage of extinction .
But technology is make the solution of this problem also .
The solar fuel , the energy trapped by solar module which stores the energy and transforms this energy to electrical energy .
So the use of solar cars will be both the solution for fossil fuel extinction as well as for pollution free fuel .
So in the next twenty years the people will make use of solar vehicles and if the solar cars will be available then why not solar cars , which is more reliable , inexpensive after twenty years , pollution free vehicle and free of petrol or any other fossil fuels .

In conclusion , it is quite definite that after twenty years the use of cars will increase only because of new techology like solar technology , automobile technology and also because of construction of big big flyovers , tunnels and highways .
The life of the people after twenty years will be more fast and hence the use of these solar cars will increase .
