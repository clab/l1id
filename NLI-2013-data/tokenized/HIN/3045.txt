Each and every person likes to enjoy life .
Some think that young people enjoy life more than older people while some may think the opposite .
Different individuals have different views .
In my view young people enjoy life more than older peole do but not always .

Young people are full of energy and enthusiatic .
They like to enjoy each and every moment of life .
They are usually fit and fine as compared to older people .
So they have the energy to enjoy each and every moment .

Young people usually watch movies , play sports or even make girlfriends to entertain themselves .
They feel that this is the only age to enjoy , so they try to take full out of it .
They consider this age as if the age of entertainment and adventure .

Old people on the other hand are too weak to entertain themselves by playing sports or by going for a adventurios trip .
They also watch movies very rarely and only few of them make girlfriends at this age .
Most of the time they remain ill and complain about their health .
Older people often like company of others , if they are alone they might feel disconnected from the world and the enthusiasm to enjoy the life dies gradually .

As i stated above that young people enjoy life more than older people but not always .
Young people have many tensions regarding their education and career , so they cannot enjoy the life at its full .
Older people on the other hand are free from tension , so they can enjoy the life at its best .
Young people often think about their career and remain involved in their regular curricular or business activities and are not able to deliver appropriate time for enjoyment or pleasure .

So it can be said that young people enjoy life more than the older people but not always and not in all situations as this is the age when they have to plan for their entire remaining life .
