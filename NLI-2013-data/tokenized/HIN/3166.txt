The point of contention is wether young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I do not agree with this statement and believe the contrary .
The general perception might be that young people enjoy and live life to the fullest as compared to older people because they seem the more active of the lot .

I agree that the activities which younger people can indulge in are much more than the activities that older people can indulge in .
However the time required to enjoy these activities would be a factor tilted towards the older generation .
Young people generally lead a very hectic life and may have a very hectic study schedule as the early years of their life are more formative and demand more time towards their academics .
Older people on the other hand have more of leisure time once they retire .
Even people who are working at an older age have much more financial independence as compared to the younger generation .
As a result older people have a higher degree of freedom to indulge in activities they enjoy .
A person matures over the years and an older person can make better choices about activities that excite him .
An older person is thus more likely to derive a higher sense of contentment from the activities he or she indulges in .

A person who is old and , maybe retired is likely to have lots of free time and can learn more about the things he or she enjoys doing .
If for example a person likes to play golf then he has more time on his hands to learn the intricacies of the game .
A young person who enjoys playing golf on the other hand may be hard pressed for time .
Because of this the older person will enjoy the game more for the reason that he has more time to get involved .
As a result it might be the case that young people indulge in more number of activities but do not do justice to each one of them .

Thus in my opinion a person who is older would be leading a more content life and would enjoy his life much more for the reason that he has time to pursue his passions and also the financial independence to do so , both of which might be a hindrance in the case of young people .
