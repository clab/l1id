Nowadays young people are more concerned about their ownself than helping their community .
Everyone is becoming selfish and mean .
They see only their benefit and not the others .
For them , social life is important till the time it gives them enjoyment and self satisfaction .
After the satisfaction is over they turn to some other place where they have reason to go .

When young people do n't find any reason that gives them some benefit , they will not turn to that side also where others want some help .
I have realised this from my personal experience .
Once I thought to teach some students from my colony .
Specifically those who are staying in our neighbourhood and have problem in studying .
I told my friend about the same and asked her to help me in the matter .
She laughed at me and said she would prefer doing something which will pay me and will give more enjoyment .

I didnt listen to her and started a common class at my home for my nieghbourhood children .
I tierd improving their reading skills in which all were lacking .
By reading anyone can go anywhere in the world without hesitation , can gain knowledge about various topics ..
Reading is an important factor which mostly parents and teachers overlook .
It should be a general habit of every student which students dont realise in elementary classes .

Teenagers are more concerned about the parties and clubs but least bothered about the people around us .
The attitude of is so rude towards elders and even youngers .
We are educated and talented so we should take the best output from our education and knowledge by helping others .

Young generation coming up should think about others also , if not the whole world then atleast a minor part near to them to make some changes and improvement in the system .

Young people are the future of the country leading to the world ' future .
I do agree that young people nowadays donot give anough time to help their communites and this can be changed only if an individual wants to change .
