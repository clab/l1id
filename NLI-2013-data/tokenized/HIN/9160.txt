Facts are facts , but , ideas and concepts are different parameters all together .
I strongly agree with the statement which is mentioned .
Ideas and concepts are the factors which puts our mind in ideal frame because they keeps on challenging our mind and thus we feel the sence of urgency to learn something .

If at all facts are important than there could not have been the inventions of Sir Albert Einstein , then there have been no Newton and thus no `` Gravity concept '' .
Its all because of the ideas and concept they were able to invent something unusuall .
Facts are always facts that cannot be altered or modified but ideas and concept are quite flexible hence can be modified if and whenever required , thus this suits more to the general way of living .

Ideas are so pivotal to the humanity that without which nothing can be altered and modified , and hence we will remain the same using same set of object and belongings .
Revolution come only on the account of ideas and some way or the other concept is equally linked to the ideas .
They bring more pragmatic solution to a problem so always in need .

If ideas and concept does'nt have values than why Roberto Guizeto when became the CEO of coca colla it became huge hit , its just because of his ideas and concept that gave coca colla a grand hit in international market .
Also if we encounter the debacle of Apple computers , it happens only when Steve Jobs left the post of CEO of the firm , if facts would have been important than they could have been survived even after their departure .

Moreover , learning is a joint process in which facts have their own importance but they are not only important things to be learn , at some point ideas and concepts finds greater edge over the facts , hence they are more pivotal in upbringing of the society .
