I do not agree to the point of view that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

First and foremost I believe that when you travelling in a group with a tour guide you have to make a lot of compromises and are restricted to the sites that are covered by the tour guide .
These sites that are covered by the tour guide may not necessarily be the sites that I may be interested in .
Also you may not be able to spend enough time at a certain site if you desired to do so .

Secondly the loss of privacy and freedom when you are travelling in a group would kill the enjoyment of the trip .
When I travel for pleasure the last thing I want to do is to stick to a schedule set out by the travel group or the tour guide .
when you are travelling independently you can set your own agenda and can be completely flexible about it without affecting anybody else .

Thirdly in this day and age of internet , I do not feel the need to rely on a tour guide for information about any place .
I can get all the information about a place that I intend to travel to , on the internet and can then make a decision on what places interest me the most and than plan out my trip accordingly .

Lastly there is a general perception that group travel works out cheaper financially than if you travelled independently .
I do not agree with this idea .
With the availability of several internet based travel agents its almost always possible to get great travel deals on travel , hotels etc any time of the year to almost any place in the world .

For the above reasons I firmly believe that travelling in a group with a tour guide is not the best way to travel to any destination .
