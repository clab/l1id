The travelling is now very common in our scocities .
People generally alway want to go either the new place or the place which they have gone before because they want to know in detailed about that place .
Some people want to go alone or some prefer to group .
However , I perssonally prefer that when I go in group , it must be led by the tour guide .
Because tour guide have detailed information about that place , they have also explained in intresting way and also wasy to follw the group .

The travelling in group is fun but it is more enjoyable if the group have a person which explain about the place in detail i ; e tour guide .
when we go to the new place , we have superficial information about the landmarks , musium etc .
However the tour guide ihave detailed infomation about like detailed history , importance and significance about that place .
The travelling is worthwhile if we will get all the information about the place after spending a lot of money .

Secondly , Tour guides know how to keep happy to all the people in groups .
They make some funny statements , spme jokes .
Even sometimes , the information is real but they convey in a group such a way that everybody laughs .
For examle , I went to visit a monumant i.e Tajmahal in India .
This tajmahal is built by the Sahjaha in love of the wife .
Everytime our tour guide asked to us that what will your husband will make for you in future .
He laso commented on man that you eill not build this kind of monument thet means you donot like your wife .
This is historical truth but the way , tour guide were expressed make travelling intresting .

In addition , if the gruop is led by tour guide , the more organised and have proper schedule .
It is very convenient to follew the each and every person of the group and also timely fashoned .

If I spend a lot of meny and time , I want to know everything about that place .
My travel should have fun and well organised .
Therefore , I totally agree that going in group led by the tour guide is best way to travel .
