Fewer cars in twenty years ?
really sounds as if we are asked that will we have to leave our daily necessity ?
today cars have become a necessity of not only a rich person but also for the one who is just earning a hand full of money .
cars have really made are life comfortable and easy going ?
and we really ca n't think our life without them .
i dont think there will be fewer cars after twenty years .
today the man is progressing at such a fast pace that will only lead us to developing more and more cars with new technology .

The technology has made such an advancment that within months we have cars with a new and incredible functioning .
today we have automatic cars , with superb engine and their speed is somewhat we cant even think of driving at .
The new inventions being made on cars does not even limit us with the fuel that we utilize in driving the car .
today we have made cars that run even without fuel .

that either run on some gas or any other burning substance .
Further i believe making , buying and selling of cars is a bussiness that is really flourishing today .
we have so many racing cars these days that are so expensive and there is no shortage of costumers who buy these cars .
people invests a lot in car racing games that take place round the globe .
and after the race these cars are put to sale .

furtheron , i believe that today the economy is increasing at such a fast pace that there is no shortage of money , that people cannot buy a car .
even a normal financially stable familly today have two to three cars .
They are also a symbol of luxury for many people .
with the increasing population every second the demand and supply of cars are also increasing .

the new inventions and new facilities in a car like air condition , music system cars and big cars like limozine which are like a home in itself , are becoming more and more comfortable and easy going .
so i think that there will be more cars in twenty years than they are today .
