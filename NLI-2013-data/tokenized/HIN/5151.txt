The issue whether the advitisements makes the product seem better than other products or not is debatable .
I agree that advertisements helps to make product seem better .

Firstly , As we all know , many companies believe in successfull advertising and marketting to improve their product marketshare .
Whether an advertisement is successfull or not depends on its influence on the consumer .
To influence a consumer , advertisements can represent its product far more superior through any unrelated or false evidence .
Since , first impression can be the last one , many consumers read or watch about the product and instanly make up their mind about the quality of the product .
Unfortunately , still in many countries there are no harsh legal penalties for duping consumers through these false claims and hence , companies are not discouraged from such practices .

Moreover , our modern economy fuelled with competition encourages and somewhat based on `` winning with hook or crook '' theme .
For an example , in USA , many car manufacturers are competiing to gain market and profits .
But the advertisement about their car might not depict the truth about the car .
Advertisements are done such that , the bad qualities about the product are not highlited while the positive points are shown highly in the advertisements .
So in car advertisements , if the car lacks some additional feature like , music system , then it will not be told in the advertisements , on the other hand comparative mileage will be shown as a big plus point against competitors .

Also , the concept of `` real '' advertisement about the products may just boil down to Ethical behaviour .
The companies should be held responsible for double meaning advertisement about the their products which may lead to serious injury or dissatisfaction among the consumers .
Companies advertising the product should not leave the advertisements interpretation to the public .
Lack of information is same as false information in coming up with the conclusion about the product .

I would like to conclude that , yes , advertisements does make the product seems better , and the main root cause behind it is the higly comptitive economy and struggle for existence among companies and products .
But with strignet laws this phenomenon can be curbed and consumers can make correct decission about the product .
