I Disagree with the statement .
I BELIEVE THAT IT IS BETTER TO SPECIALIZE IN AN AREA THAT TO BE FAMILIAR TO A WHOLE LOT OF ACADEMIC SUBJECTS .

My response is based on an experience that speeks for itself .
Being from an engineering background i was faced with a similar situation where i needed to choose between a spealized course of INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ( IT ) and a general stream of computer science which also includes IT .
I would rather be good at one thing than know about a wide range of areas .
So I took IT .
Now i can proudly say that I specialize in IT n get a brilliant job rather than saying that I know about many areas n settle for an average job .

Similar case where doctors after doing MBBS have to specilize in a stream to be successful .
Suppose a person is just MBBS .
He knows about every part of the body but doesnot know how to handle a patient who urgently needs a heart surgery .
This again puts light on the topic where specializing counts a lot .
In this specific case it could mean life or death for the patient .

When a person is good at a certain area he/she can persue a career in that stream .
Everyone has likes and dislikes for subjects .
No one can say that he/she likes all areas of the academic curriculum .
Thus the person must persue the area which they are most interested in and specialize in it .
This will not only make him/her happy but also keep others happy .
And the person is most likely to do well by studying something they are keen on .

On the other hand the person who is jack of all trades is most likely to be unhappy n make people around him unhappy by not being good at what he/she is doing .

Thus we can clearly conclude that it is better to specialize than to have broad knowledge about academic subjects .
