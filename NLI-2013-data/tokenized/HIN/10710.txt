Risk is the foundation of real man .
How monotonous life would be if we were only to do tasks with prescribed rules to follow .
Sometimes it is a fun and sometims it is a compelsion to devise our own set of rules rather that following the established norm .
A look at the history reveals that almost every man who has make his mark in his field did not followed the footsteps prescribed by others .
Though exceptions are everywhere but the general rule is that that almost every greatmen till date did not believed in following the set pattern and discovered his way to successss by following and doing what he believed was just according to his own thinking process .
Be it Gandhi or Lincon .
Both of them knew law very well and could have gone to become very successful lawyers in their respective countries but instead of that Gandhi experimented with Truth and Non Violence and Lincon with the abolition of Slavery .
He believed in both these principles and was willing and ready to put his life at stake for it .
So was Lincon this reaction towards the inhuman practice of slavery was not taken very well by the dominant forces prevaling in the society of that time .
But Lincon was firm in his belife that the prectice must go .
The success which both these great men achived through their efforts is phenomenal One in term of freedom of India and another in terms of removal of slavery for USA and elsewhere What is common is between these to great and successful men is their wilingness to risk all they had to save the principle in which they believed and that is what classifies ordinary men form successful person All of them have one common feature that they do not compromise of the principle upon which they place reliance and are willing to stake all for it .
So I do agrre that Successfull ...
