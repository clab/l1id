In my opinion , in twenty years , it is more likely to find a larger number of cars on roads than we see today .
Cars which were a luxury a few decades back , have become more of a necessity today .

As more and more job oppurtuniies are being made available to the people , standards of living are definitely on a rise .
This is the case , specially in the developing nations , as the economies are growing .
With more money , more number of people would be able to afford cars and thus , be using them .

Also , most of the families which are financially well off , have more than one car for the family .
Typically , each member of the family owns a car of his own , as soon as he or she can drive one .
This trend seems to be catching up , lately .

Moreover , with the rise in population , we need more and more land to live on .
This has resulted in reclaiming areas , which were not in use before .
Thus cities a becoming bigger and bigger , with their suburbs getting densly populated .
As people prefer to stay in the suburbs , for reasons like , cheaper resourses , more area etc. , most of the major offices are still found in the main city .
This requires , people to commute long distances .
Travelling by public transport is not an idea a lot of people consider , when they have a car at home .
Thus , the use of car is increasing further .

With advanced technology , many car companies are coming with cheaper and more affordable models of cars .
Such cars , since they need lesser maintanance , have contributed to the increased number of cars that we see on the road today .
Atleast for the next decade or two , this seems to be a possible trend .

Also , traffic problems have been often associated with the increase in the number of cars on the road .
To avoid this , many companies have also come up with two-seater models .
These cars which are small , make manoevering in the crowded streets a little easier .
In the years to come , we can definitely expect to see a lot more of these cars , flooding the streets .

Thus , in the next twenty years , the number of cars in use , are most likely be higher than what it is today .
It is a bad news , considering the fuel shortage that is expected in the very near future and not to forget the pollution that so much traffic would eventually cause .
We need to be prepared to handle it or the governement needs introduce laws to control its effects , before its too late .
