A cheetah can run 170 miles/h when its young and slows down when gets older and would rather chase already dieing pray or not even bother for it if he can get his hand on a weaker predator .
As far as this saying goes it is appropriate to state that young people can tend to enjoy a lot more then older people .
life is becoming fast everyday and grows faster by the hour and the faster it gets the more people tend to release out their stress and thus end up enjoying the moments rather then wondering what will happen if they do bad at their job and they turn worse in an interview or even fail at an exam they have preparing for months .
By the time it all happens and everything tends to come through we all realise OH !
my god !
i wasted so much time planning tommorow and look i have become old and useless .
why not leave everything aside and live today .

As the genration has passed peoples thinking has evolved with more night clubs opening and parties held through out the year the new generation has learned to live through the stress rather then live with it .
people who are old and who have not evolved with the times tend to stay in their own little space and move out a little and talk about old times that they had. , missing on the fact the time is now and else is long gone .

MY friend has a grand father whom i respect very much , but then he still lives in the old times and telling us what happened centuries ago and that we should discuss matters that we have no knowledge of what so ever .
while on the other hand if their is an occasion all the benevolent people get together to party while everybody tells us to study .
Its not that we do n't study , we do it when its needed and no compromise with the enjoyments that we have now cuz this will all become a memory in course of time so live it through all , while we all can .

Eat the cake before the friends get home or there will be none left to taste and you will know that was probably the best cake ever made .
people before us beleived in letting others taste we can enjoy it later and it probably use ripe without anybody even trying it .

TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY
LIVE IT ALL .............
