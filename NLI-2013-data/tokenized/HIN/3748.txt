With progressing generations comes the progression of ideas .
It is commonly said today , that the young generation is very ignorant of what 's happening in its communities .
But i do not believe that this statement is always true .
The mindset of the young generation is highly influenced by its predecessors .
I belive that it is upto the community and the parents ( that is , the older generation ) to instill the values of helpfullness and service in their children .
I would like to illustrate the above , using my own experiences as an example .

I have lived in India all my life and service done by children is not as rooted into the culture as it is in Singapore where i know live .
Since the very beginning , even when i wa sin India , my parents always taught me to helpful not only towards my family and friends but also the environment and the community .
ven when i was in India , i was one of the few kids who went to old age homes to work with the elderly or try my hand at teaching the poor kids how to read .
And these valeus were embibed in me by my parents and hence , my parents were responsible for framing my mindset .

I belive that this culture is more prevelent in Singapore .
Walking across the street , one often comes across a young boy helping an old who 's trying to cross the road .
There are various programs in SIngapore that encourage the youth to help the less privelidged children , help the elderly or the sick in hospitals .
Some time back , i cam across an advertisement that asked for students volunteers to offer some of their time to playing with sick children in the `` National University Hospital '' of Singapore .
The icing on the cake was the long list of names of young people from all over Singaproe who were willing to do this .

Hence , i belive that the above examples , beautifully illustrate that its not always the young people who do not give time to the community .
If the virtues of service and helpfullness are instilled by the community in them , as in the case of Singapore , the young people can be extremely caring and helpful .
