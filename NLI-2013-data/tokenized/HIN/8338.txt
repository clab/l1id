Learning is a very important part of students life .
I think learning in any form adds to ones information and knowledge areas .
Therefore in my opinion when a student is at undergraduate level he should take variety of courses both in the areas of learning facts and understanding ideas and concept .
On the otherhand when a student is taking up a graduate program he or she should take up a course which involves understanding the concepts and ideas .
For example taking a professional course in the understaning of Computers is better than studying history or geography .
I beleive that task becomes easier and more enjoyable if one tries to understand instead of memorizing it .
Thus a practical approach is better than rote learning .

I feel learning facts is not as much interesting as understanding concepts .
Thus I agree with the statement .
