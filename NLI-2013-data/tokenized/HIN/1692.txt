Knowledgeable person is always acepted as a wealthy one in th society .
As Knowledge has no limits the broder the knowledge the broder is the thinking of the person .
However , according to me having specialize subject knowledge is better than those of having of many subjects .

Specialized knowledge is always a boon , sharp and a didicated one for a person .
As an example , scientist they have a broad knowldge but of a specfic subject on waht they are working on .
As an example , my father is an mechnical engineer from the past en years is working in mechanical plant from then and now his mehanical skills have became sharp .

Few people think that having the knowledge of many subjects can help in knowing each thing better but , it is just a misconseption things dose n't work like that if u want to learn more u have to be very specific about the subject you take .
For example , one my friend is very knowledgeable but not in the field of any specfic subject .

One more example i would like to discuse is about engineering or graduate programs offered by the various schools .
Why there are different subjects in different programs because , to make a person specialized in a specific field of study .
If a person have an deep knowledge of the subject of study he can contribute a lot more .
Example , astrnomers contribute there efforts towards the field of astropyhsics .
Another example , biologist he contributes towards the field of biology .
But the person having a broad knowldge cannot go so much specific about any subject .

Broad knowledge of diffrent subject help people in life but only in normal way not in any specific direction .
Hence , a specilized knowledge of a specfic field is more better then having a broad but genral knowledge of everything .
