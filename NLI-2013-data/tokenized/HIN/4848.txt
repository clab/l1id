I am agree with the statement that advertisements generally give wrong information about their products .
If a particular product is launched then genarally companies advertise their product to people so that people buy their product more .
An advertisment expalain about a particular product .
It should tell about the pro and cone of it .
But it can be put into negative use also .
Below I will explain for what kind of product genrally companies give false advertisement .

In competing market generally the company says better things about a product in it 's advertisement .
There might be some competing products , which are already there in the market and a company come up with the same kind of product .
The company tries to sell it 's poduct more .
So in it 's information they genrally put false information about their product so that their product looks nicer than the rival product .
I 'm giveing one example below .

You can see this kind of trend more in cosmetic industry .
Every hair shampoo is more or less same .
They all contain the same amount of chemical in it .
But still every company come up with different advantages of their shampoo .
They says that thier shampoo is more effective that the other .

Sometimes it also happen that company make cheaper product and try to sell them at higher prices .
To do this they make false advertisemnt about their product .
You can see this kind of advertisements for duplicate products .
You can see this when a roaming salesperson come into your home for selling his product .
Gennerally they give wrong information about the product and try to sell them at a high price .

It also happen that sometimes an advertisement says only good things about a product .
They hide away the bad thing .
For an example , say someone wants to sell slipping pills .
The advertisement says that the sleeping pill is good , it will give you a good night sleep .
But that sleeping pill might cause other symptoms also .
The advertisement is not going to tell you about that .

But you ca n't say all of the advertisements give false information .
Some of the advertisement really give helpful information about a product .
We should analyze an advertisement only on it 's true values .
