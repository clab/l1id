In next Twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is certainly true .
Although today cars are the first choice of personal transport , it will be not in same in future .

The time is changing the cities are becoming bigger and world is becoming smaller .
Now is the time people dont live in their own big houses they live in big buildings were every one share the same ground .
The people dont work in there separate fields they work in tiny places called office .

The pressure on cities is growing and the density of population is increasing .
The estimate percentage of people living in cities and in village will be 50 % by the year 2050 .

All this bring huge amount of pressure to the transportion system , whcih the cities like Tokyo and Newyork is seeing currently .
The city transport system cannot expand itself to accomodate space of each car for each individual .
The future of transportation is MASS TRANSPORTATION .
The cities need to bulld their transportation structure around the Metro trains and Mono rails .
There Might be possibilty of private planes or some new kind of transport .
Today they say That New york and Tokyo run as much as above the ground and underneath it .

The crisis of fuel and the poulation issue may be handled by new invention but the problem of space will remain same in future also .
The people travelling for day to day business will search for a cheaper and safer mode of travelling .
The answer will be Mass transport only .

The Car surely wont go out of market but will become a mode of leisure or fun .
It will be a kind of thing which people will use in there weekends , just like bikes and hourse now .
