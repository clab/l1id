I disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from today .
The question at hand is highly controversial as many people believe otherwise due to various reasons such as increasing pollution and fuel costs .
However , I still believe that the number of cars on road will increase .

Going by statistics , there is no sign to show that car sales is decreasing .
Every year , more and more number of cars are being sold across the globe .
The rapid rise of several coountries such as India and China will only increase the car markets for the manufacturer , leading to higher production .
Thus , there is no indication whatsoever to believe that the number of cars will decrease in the next twenty years .

Also , due to the generally risng standards of people , and the car manufacturers desiging and manufacturing cheaper and more efficient cars give rise to the speculation that as more and more people are able to aford a car , they will go ahead and purchase one .
One another major reason for this the rapid increase in the number of roadways avaliable in the world .
More and more number of countries have now started building broader and smoother highways .
Thus , improved infrastucture is not only an indicator of the trend that more people are going to invest in cars , it is also an incentive .

Many people might feel that due to the increasing awareness about the negetive effect of cars on air pollution and the rising oil prices , the number of cars may decrease in the coming years .
However , most of the companies have already taken a note of these factors , and working their way around these problems rapidly .

Hybrid cars had already hit the road a long time back .
Cars are also being developed which run on alternative fuels , such as edible oil and CNG ( Compressed Natural Gas ) .
These new innovations will make sure that the enviornmental pollution is kept under check and at the same time , the cars become less dependent on oil .
In fact , various research institutes across the globe are trying to harness the solar energy to drive modern cars !

Given the present trends , and the efforts made by research institutes and car manufacturers , I believe that number of cars on roads will only increase as the years pass by .
