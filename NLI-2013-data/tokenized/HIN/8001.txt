I totally concur to the statement that the best way to travel is in a group and led by a tour guide .
A tour guide well acquinted with the places of visit and is very beneficial when its a place having historic importance .

We had visited the Vatican City during this summer .
Even after doing a entensive course work before going to the trip it was unavoidable from hiring a tour guide .
Gaining knowledge from books is always considered less than gaining knowledge from experience .
It was easier for us to locate the places but we were literally confused when it came to the historic significance of the place .
Eventually , we landed up in hiring a tour guide which made our visit more pleasureable and even revealed a lot of unknown facts about the Vatican City which we might not have known .
The tour guide showed us each and every artifact of historic significance and also gave a brief description of the rituals carried out in the city .
Our trip was a success and even today it feels us with joy when we think about the Vatican City trip .

Travelling in a group has its own charm and benefits in comparision to travelling alone .
The most important and noticeable fact of travelling in a group is that we never get bored and the trip become more enjoyeable when the group consists of friends .
As mentioned in the previous paragraph , we had been to Vatican City during the summer .
Our group consisted of 5 members including me .
We had distributed the task among ourselves which was quite helpful in planning the trip .
I had the task of studying the maps and marking the places of interest on it whereas my other friends had various other tasks .
The planning of the trip was so perfect that we saw each and every place on the map and were never late of any event .
It would have been difficult for a single person to perform such a full proof planning .
And even the expenses of the trip is also reduced considerable as the overall expenses are distributed among the group .

The next time i plan a trip i would definitely plan it along with my friends and will always hire a tour guide .
