I strongly believe that the youth of today is committed to help their communities .
Even in today 's competitive world , we see numerous examples where the young people take out substantial time from their busy schedule for their communities ' help .

First , let us address the concept of community ?
The term ` community ' can be defined as a group of people , organisations or cultures that are motivated by a common manifesto .
Let us take 3 different examples to support the claim made above .

The concept of ` National Social Service ' or NSS is quite old in India .
It is a community of college going student volunteers that reaches to the under-privileged sections of their respective communities to ensure their upliftment .
In a recently concluded survey on its efficacy , it was heartening to note that 68 % of those asked were already a part of this service and had made on an average 15 visits in the last 4 months to various places .
And another 86 % were willing to help raise old clothes and stuff that would be useful for the poor .

Another example is that of the religious sects .
The youth today has ensured that they celebrate their religious functions with their utmost fervor .
This ensures that the religious principles are upheld which are so necessary for the spiritual well-being of a community .
In the recently concluded ` Navratri ' , one of the biggest Hindu celebrations in India , the youth was at its energetic best .
Across places , beautiful and decorative sculptures of gods were made for the people to worship .
Different groups of young people helped raise funds for the functions in their respective areas .

After the recent ` Mumbai blasts ' on 11th July , there has been a new committment on part of the youth .
Efforts to increase awareness amongst their communities are going on .
Mumbai saw a huge rally of around 20,000 college students to appeal for communal harmony on the next day of the blasts .
This was followed by a huge movement throughout India where the students formed groups and volunteered to distribute pamphlets about the ways to improve the awareness and internal security .
Numerous students came forward during incidents like Gujarat earthquake , Kargil War , Bihar floods , etc. and even in the rehabilitation process which took very long .

Thus the 3 examples above depict how the young people nowadays help in the economic , spiritual and social well-being of their communities .
