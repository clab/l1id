Even at certain extent so called Fact itself based upon the particular ideas and concepts behind it .
Basically the whole matters of this world depend on particular ideas and concept of its existance or creation .
Here if we dont understand the ideas or concept of particular thing then we take is as fact and we accept it as it is .
So i would certainly cent percent agree to the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas or concepts .

Because , if we want to understand the thing as a whole then we need to conceptualize that thing , we have to understand the content from the grass root level of that matter .
Then only we will be capable to solve the puzzle behind it and can explore the real eternal truth based upon the logical conceptualization and critical thinking .
As for the example , if the student want to learn the Math taught in his class then he needs to understand the basic concept from the fundamental level itself .
So that in future he can build his further study or professional career based upon that distinct concepts of his subject .

Another reason I would like to project is that if the student accept the study matter or any thing as simply as it is explained without getting the rational or logic behind it then there are more chances for student to flunk in their exams , especially when they just mug up the things as one of the fact or phenomenon .
This kind of attitude towards study may endanger them in their future prospect whenb they go in thier professional life .

Thus , I would l ; ike to conclude that students should understand the ideas and the concepts rather than facts .
