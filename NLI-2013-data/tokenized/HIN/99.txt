The issue at hand is `` Young people enjoy life more than older people '' .
I agree that young people are better enjoyers of life as they have their inner zeal and attitude towards life and also life has many things to offer to them .

The first reason i think that older people dont enjoy life ethusiastically and fully as compared to younger ones is that the older people have already done lot of enjoyment in their life and they know the meaning of enjoyment so their approach is not much enthisiastic towards enjoyments in life .
On the other hand young people have to go through their time what their elders have gone through hence they are more energised and enjoys things more

Another reason i think that young peple are better enjoyers of life is that they are physically and mentally much more fit .
Their attitude towards life is to enjoy things and their physical and mental ability let them do these things easily , for example not going far away if I ask my grand father to go for city disco he might refuse as he might not be mentally willing more over as every old person hasdiferent problems related to his body like pain in joints in this age even if his mind allows his body might not .
so to enjoy the life one must have his physical fitness and soul energised only then one can enjoy things in life .

Finally i agree with the statement because younger people are having much more exploring approach and attitude towards life hence in their eagerness to learn more they go through each and every situation curiosly which make them better revelling enjoyers .

In conclusion , young people are better enjoyers of life as their approach towards life is new and fresh and also their curiosity and their physical and mental fitness allows them to enjoy the juice of life at its best as compared to old people
