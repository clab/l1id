To specialize in one specific subject is really very useful , but in my opinion it is always better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects in this competetive world to excell in life , i.e `` Jack of all trades master of none '' .

Specialist are people who specializes in one specific subject and have a very detail information of that subject , so he can excell in fields which is only concerned with his subject moreover having a detailed knowledge of the subject will provide him with and extra advantage of doing research in his subject .
Whereas a person who have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will be unable to go ahead and work in details in any particular subject .

But in this highly developing world , where developements are going at a very fast pace it always happen that to invent something it requires people who have knowledge of various subjects rather than being a specialist .
e.g I am a student of of Mechnical Engineering very much interested in my subject and looking forward to pursue a career in mechanical engeering .
But in an industry many things goes on , many mechanical processes are combined wiyh electrical processes to get some result so it will beneficial for myself to have the knowledge of the electrical process to have a complete understanding of the complete procees .

Secondly it is also an advantage of a person with a broad knowledge of many subjects that he can select his career from a wide variety of choices and not just confining himself to a particular subject or field .

So summarizing the points i would like to favour the point that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , because knowledge of many subjects is reqiured to get the total information .
