In my opinion , knowlede is presently the fuel that is driving the engine of the global economy today .
However , the exact nature of knowledge that is fuelling growth is new-knowledge rather than re-hashing of old knowledge .
It is hence my assertion that this is the day and age of specialization .
Hence , I disagree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knbowledge of many acadamic subjects rather than specializing in one field .

Success , in todays world is monopolized my super-specialists .
Be it the investment banker who makes millions dealing ony in hedge funds , or a doctor who only treats with patients with one ailment .
The human race in general , and science in particular , has advanced so far today that it is impossible for someone to replicate Madame Curies unique achievement of being bestowed with two Nobel prizes in two seperate fields .

I would like to draw an analogy between acadamic knowledge and day to day life .
In a marketplace there is a barber shop you go to to get your hair cut .
In the same marketplace there is a bakery where you buy bread .
The barber does not know too much about baking while the baker is not really adept at cutting hair .
The market place thrives , despite not having a barber shop cum bakery .
If the market place can thrive using specialization how can acadamic knowledge be worse off by it .

In any case knowledge is so infinite that what I ( and this hold true for even the smartest person in the world ) know , is but a small fraction of what I do n't know .
If there is no chance that I am ever going to know everything regarding all the subjects , why should I not choose a particular subject and master it .
