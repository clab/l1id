I completly agree with this statement that `` young people nowdays do not give enough time yo helping their communities '' .
The younger generation nowdays spend most of their time enjoying themselves , not very affected by whats goin on withing their community .
They are to busy enjoying their quality time on uneccesary thing .
They do not understand the importance their communities have and how it could benifit them by being a important part of it .

A community basically gives the a child or young people some important moral values which they do not even recive from their parents .
These communities give the student the basic needs to live in a society .
They teach them how to behave in diffrent situations which could help them in their future .
Young people should alwase be a integral part of their communites and help them in what ever aspect .

These communites also take part in varios activites such as relif funds etc. for the needy people affected by varios disastors like an earthquake or a hurricane .
Young people should take an initiative in such activites and help their communities in perfrorming their important tasks since it will be benifical not only fer the needy and the poor but also for an individual himself , since it will bring in him an important quality of helping which is very important fer every human being .

These young people should take some time off from their normal activites atleast once or twice a week and spend some time with their communities and work with them and make it a better community .
But on the other hand these communites should also include some interesting activites like sports and games , which is sometimes fun and could enhance the participation of young people in them .
Thus the communities could me made more intersting by having such activties .
By this way they could promote their communites more and more and increse the number of young people joinng them and helping them to make the community a better place .
