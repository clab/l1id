I would disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communties .
To understand the question one needs to understand what a community is and how it has undergone transition in today 's era of what we call a knowledge economy/society .

Traditional community has been understood to be a closed knit section of people who share similar culture , ethnic , artistic , lingustic , religious or even political sensibilities .
So we have communities based on religion , geography and politics .
Tradtionally interaction within a community was more restricted to within itself and interaction with the other was not encouraged which led to a close knit community and encouraged greater involved of community in the nurture of its young ones and therefore had far more of their time .
Like the current American society and the closed Amish society , the amount of time spent by the community on its young ones varies greatly .
With the advancements of technolgies , influences were far more rampant and diffusion of ideas took place , reducing the hold of a community on its members .
Also the advent of internet has given birth to online communties with is often seen as a detachment from the real world .

These above are often cited as reasons for lesser involvement by the younger generation , which is a wrong notion .
Because what is known as ethos of a communtity nevertheless pervades through its newer members , only the means of expressions change .
In India for instance they say the younger generation no longer respects Gandhian ideals , but if one looks closely at contemporary writings and cinema , the ideals still remain there but the words have changed .
As far as online communities goes , we have instances of communities arising on the net in response to certain crisis , like the iraq war or to protest against certain issues .
So these communities become a voice for the younger generation to be heard and make their contribution to their community To accuse the younger generation of being untrue to their community is a heresy because in a globalised worlds and with advent of post modernist philosophy increasingly pride is placed on the smaller stories and celebration of diversity is promoted which compels individuals to take pride in their community and they become representatives of their community to the larger audience .
Today we have the young celebrating their festivals with more gusto because they understand the meaning behind it and become the promoters of their community .

As far as helping out the community that is understood as social work , I believe at no other time is history was more involvement of the youth in NGOs or CBOs ( community based organizations ) .
The idea expressed in youth lingo is that social work is `` cool '' and development job of the youth especially in developing countries , for they the capability to change .
I say that because I am a part of such groups and we see the young coming forward to help the community , fight for the rights of it and to change previous wrongs by means of street plays , protests , chain sms and emails for instance .

Universal education and awareness has made the youth more culturally and environmentally sensitive and so we see instances of student organizations at schools and collegs working on social causes and even entering into politics .
In view of above ideas and examples I would reaffirm my view that today 's youth is more involved with his communtiy and indentifies with it and is involved in helping it progress .
