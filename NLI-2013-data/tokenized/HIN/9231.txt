In school we are been though to understand ideas and concept but there are some students who lean the facts and take it the easy way out .
Most of the schools teach how it is done and why but there are some exceptions where schools teach to learn by heart .

Firstly , these schools just make them know that this is the information and they are suppose to learn it .
So such sitautions just make the student remember the fact and not know what it means and why is it like that .
The student should be tought the reasons of the subject and they should understand .
By this if for example , someone comes up and asks the students do they know the meaning of this or why it is like this , they all should be able to reply them back instead of saying no its just suppose to be that way .

Secondly , by learning the facts when the students is young it helps them as they grow up .
There are some things which have to be know as facts and not have means to it .
When they learn the teachnice to learn the facts when they are some , as they grow up the learning process increases and they can then learn facts aswell know the concept and understand the idea .

Overall , i feel that the it is important for students to understand ideas and concept aswell as learn the facts .
So by this the student will experience both and gain more information , which shall benfit later on in higher studies or after studies .
