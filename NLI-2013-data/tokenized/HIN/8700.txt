It is definitely important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts because facts are based on ideas and concepts .
There always is some concept in the process to reach for a particular fact .
So if a student is not clear in his/her ideas or concepts he will definitely have some problem in finding a particular fact about something .

Let us take an example .
Suppose that there is a student working on some physics paper .
Now he comes across a point of `` WORK '' . and he notices that the formula for force is WORK = FORCE * DISPLACEMENT ( force multiplied by displacement )
Now if the student does not know anything about `` displacement '' , i.e. whether a positive or a negative displacement , he will be confused .
Another important thing is that the `` facts and figures '' , that we make use of while understanding the `` idea or concept '' , are also based on some concepts .
Working on a concept with some facts leads to a new `` fact '' .

We sometimes take an example of Newtons third Law of Motion in our everyday life .
The law states that `` Every action has an equal and opposite reaction '' .
Suppose we hit the wall with our hand , it definitely hurts .
The reason for this is that when we apply force on a body it reacts to it at the same moment the force is applied .
We never wonder why we are hurt .
This also has many reasons .
First of ll the third law of motion prompts the wall to react back .
Secondly the density of the wall is more than our hand .
Because if we hit a bag of cotton with the same force it wont hurt Here we have made use of facts and concepts both .
We see that `` facts '' and `` concepts '' are interrelated but it is very important to understand the concepts and ideas before we try to learn or arrive at any fact .
Moreover if we dont understand any ideas or concept we just keep on working on the known facts .
But if we concentrate on the concepts or ideas about a particular thing , it may be that we develop a new fact about it .
