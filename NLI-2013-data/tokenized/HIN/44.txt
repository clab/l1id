the issue at hand is about the broad knowledge of many acamedic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
this issue is important for the versatility in any fields of interest .
in today 's world we need to explore ourselves in a complete manner in our academic career .
but on the other hand we need to specialize in one particular area also .
because education demands broad knowledge of everything but the career job demands specialization in one field .

i think both are equally important in a balanced way so , i disagree with the statement .

first , i think my option is preferable because of lack of expertism .
for example if someone wants to become a manager then he/she needs to have knowledge of subjects like finance , marketing , hr operations , it , etc.but if that person is not having specialize knowledge in one area then he/she will face problems in getting a good job because of lack of expertise knowledge .

second , i think my choice is better because of lack of problem solving ability .
for example a person has learnt a lot of programming languages like c , c++ , java , .
net , etc. but he has learnt only the basics or in other words we can say that he had not practice or given attention to one particular langauge , then he/she is going to face lot of problems in a software development of one langauge .

third , i believe that my choice is appropriate because of decision making skills .
for instance one person has learnt lot of fundamentals about the mba but he has not specialize in one area like finance .
then he / she cannot take adequate decisions in favour of the organization because of insufficient skills in that area .

finally , i would like to say that a mba person or manager is `` jack of all but master of one '' . it means that in today 's world he need have broad knowledge of all areas but expertize in one so that he can take certain decisions in favour of him and the oragnization

fianlly , i conclude my choice is correct .
