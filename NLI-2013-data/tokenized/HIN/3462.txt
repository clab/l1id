I feel that in general , today 's youth do not show much concern for the community .
However there are a few exceptions , and by gaining inspiration from such people we can change the current situation .

Let me illustrate this with an example .
In my institute there is a social services group called NSO .
All students are supposed to work for a minimum of hundred hours for this organization over a period of two years .
The NSO carries out activaties like educating poor children , tree plantations , cleanliness campaigns , etc .
However , as a secretary of this organisation , it is extremely disheartening to see the apathy of the students towards such activities .
Whenever we plan something , only a few volunteers come up .
Ultimately they run short of completing their hunred hours and ask me to help them in an inappropriate manner .

What are the reasons for such lack of concern .
One could be , lack of time .
There is a lot of competiton amongst students .
As they strive to achieve the results they aim for they forget what they owe to society .
Often students are motivated to do community services just to make a statement on their resume .

However , I would be wrong if I said that this applies to all youngsters .
I have a friend who is just the opposite .
He is very passionate about community service and does it because he feels for it .
Recently the college cultural festival was organized .
It is time for enjoyment and fun for most students .
I was amazed to see my friend running a stall during the festival to raise money for an NGO while the rest of us were having fun attending rock concerts .

To conclude , I feel that although most students feel the need and the urge for working for our communities , it is only a few who turn that inspiration in to action .
