I strongly disagree with this statement as the need for personal transportation will be even more in next twenty years than what it today is .
Rise in the living standards of the people and faster life style would be the possible reasons behind this prediction .
people are becoming more and more independent and solitary in their life style so the need for personal cars is going to be more .

There are certain things wich may resist increase of the number of cars in future and one of those is the fuel problem .
The major fuel for cars these days is petrol or other chemicals derived from petroleum .
The amount of fuel we have under oceans etc is expected to last for another 100 years .
so there will be enough fuel for the cars in next twenty years .
but even then other types of fuels such as C.N.G and hydrogen etc are also used by car manufacturers now a days so it would not let the extinction of cars happen .

cars are definetely going to increase in number on roads in next twenty years becase they have been made safer now a days than they were before .
with all this technical advancement and safety experimentation carried out at a war front level new models of cars coming out of the factories in future are going to be very very safe for the drivers .

last but not the least , with all the above reasons , the reason which might be the biggest and the most powerful reason behind increase in car 's population on the roads will be affordability , the mass production and competition in the market is working towards cutting down the prices of the cars so down that the day is not far when even a common man would be able to buy a car of his choie .

The freedom of mobility , safety and affordability would increase the number of cars on the roads in next twenty years .
