Method of studying is always different from student to student .
Many people hold their perspective to undestand ideas and concept while other prefer to learn facts .
I too beileve that it is more important for student to understand concept and ideas than to learn facts .
The reason , I think this way is because understanding ideas and concept clearity increase the creativity of student and it gives better knowledge for further growth .
Concept clearity and clear ideas provide better foundation for future education of student .

One reason , I believe that concept clearity and clear ideas give better foundation to a student is because if we understand ideas and concept then we never forget the subject .
Take my own example , When I was student I always preferred to concept clearity .
I still remember the concept of Newton 's Laws ; because my physics teacher of grade 10 had my concept clear about this subject .
Therefore it is always better to clear the concept and ideas so that we will never forget the same .

Another reason , I believe that concept clearity and understanding ideas is important is that it increase the creativity of student .
When we understand the concept of any theory then we feel more innovative to discover some more things .
In fact every scientific discovery was started from fifferent ideas .
For example , When Adison had understand the concept of electron and atom then only he could concluded that electrons can be used to flow electricity .
This is how understanding concept about atom lead to the discovery of electricty .

All these are not to say that to learn facts are all use less .
Facts are related to generally past which is also important .
But advantages of learning facts can not surpass the advantages of clearing concept and understanding ideas .

In short , In this scientific world , student with capability of learning ideas and with clear concept has better future than those who learn fact only
