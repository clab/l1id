The world is on a rapid pace .
Everyone is determined to try something new and employ larger and larger risks .
It surely get results to some and failure to many .
In my opinion , people who have achieved success can definately try and work on more things and get involved with the element of risk .
They would be better off doing things they were into all this while but the crave to achieve more will not help them settle for less .

Firstly , successful people can employ better brains and skilled man power to help working on new things and exploring better avenues .
With their past success they sure start believing in more things and are confident in their way of execution .
eg : Someone like Bill Gates can employ far better intellect in his business and afford more risks which isnt a trait for someone who is still striving to achieve big .

Another important thing one should think of and consider when getting into a newer thing is his past experience .
A succesfull man stands more chances for better and varied experience and i believe can handle critical decisions and policies better than someone who is a fresher or less experienced .
Coming to our same example , Mr Bill Gates today with his hard work and experience is in better position to make new business work and employ risk .
Through his detemination he has explored many more areas since from where he started .

Moreover , there are lot other priviledges that follows a successful person .
Not to deny his achievements but he is socially and politically more sound and strong to stand for his new risk and adventure .
The urge to try new things might also come from peer influences .

Lastly i would like to emphasise and support my opinion for successful people but would'nt want to neglect or limit the potential of any candidate or person on basis of his success .
He surely can make it big but a succesful person in my view stands a better oppurtunity and chance .
