I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In fact , I believe that in any mature market , this embellishment of the truth on the part of the advertisements is inevitable .

It all begins from the fact that usually , most companies do n't have the luxury of being in a product space where they have a monopoly .
This means that they are continously competing with each other to sell their products .
This means that they have to constantly innovate to try and make a better product .
But the innovation does n't stop just at the production , it continues into the selling stage and that 's where advertisements come into the picture .

Now in an ideal world , an advertisement would be indistinguishable from the specification of the product .
A company would just state the features of the product in a technically accurate manner and let the buyer decide .
Unfortunately , in the real world , usually , the buyer is a human being , which means that he most probably does n't have the time , patience or even at times the expertise to make a decision based on just the specification .
This means that the information provided to the buyer needs to be summarized into simpler and easily digestable form .
It is this gap between the real specification and the information provided to the customer that advertisements really become an important tool in boosting sales .

Thus while summarizing the information , advertisements give the company the opportunity to smooth over the defects and accentuate the good qualities of the product .
To take an analogy , the same way make-up enhances a woman 's beauty , advertisements enhance a product 's appeal .

Also , considering that only that much can be done to improve sales on the production side ( for example , how much innovation can really be done in a tooth-brush ? )
after some time , advertisements are left as the only viable alternative to push sales .
And once one company starts advertising , the others have to naturally follow which soon degenerates into a rat race of who can bend the truth more .

Therefore , one ends up with ` new-improved ' shampoos where the only thing that has been improved is the label , health equipment which can make you lose weight almost instanteously , and tooth-paste which can land you that dream-job or man .
