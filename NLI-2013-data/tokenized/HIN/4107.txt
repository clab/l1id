The topic that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities is very controversial one .
But i believe Yes , these days young people dont give enough time to helping their communities rather i believe that in todays world the approach of present generation has become global than to be limited to just one 's community , society , or nation .
In todays world the mentality of people have bnecome broader now the people are not just working to put forward their nation but are struggling to get all people at same level and position .

The young generation of today do not believe in words like community they embrace every person as their family member and is working ahead to help them out .
for example now days a social worker is not only interested in dealing with the people of only its community but rather people of everywhere no matter if they are racially different or social status of these people differ the basic purpose is just to serve .
For example in country like india where there are number of different religious group , when a destruction happened by flood a group of sikh community went to help these people no matter these people were not of there community , religion or region .

In todays world number of scientist are working towards dealing with environmental problems that are degrading there atmosphere .
Researchers are working hand in hand not only to bring up their society but to everyone .

There is also a vast number of young people who join the social working groups on part time basis and work at old age homes , societies for helping suferes from catastrophes and against illiteracy etc.infact , there there is a wide number of young ppeople who join the organization established by Mother Teresa on full time basis .

Nowdays even in schools to lean students towards helping the people now projects are assigned to students for a day or two to serve in orphanages , or old age homes etc .
Students organize charity functions and fairs to raise the funds and donate them to needy people .

Infact i believe that scenario is changed now from `` me to it has become We '' .
People are really working towards equality and its the reason why even when a famine or natural destruction occurs at any place people specially troupes of college going people with every possible resource reaches there to help out these people .
So i think i think young people do spend their time in serving but not their only community but whole world .
