In this set of material , according to the reading passage .
I agree with the statement ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' .
In this competitive world one have to be able to fight or handle , the different kinds of situation that arises in becoming him a successful man or take him towards , Glory or Victory .
One have to be very hard working and very fast and clevere to compete and to lead in the race of success .
A succewssful man according to me is a person who takes risks rather than working or doing a single thing in which they already have knowledge and they have hope that they are the best in that field .

According to my opinion a ` Successful ' man is a person who takes risks and lead the nation .
People should take risks and try new things through which , they can succeed .
Many great people have taken risks for getting success in there work .
For example , the egyptian people have made Churches with great height which was not possible until the Romans period .
They took a risks and constructed the Churches not only with a great height , but also took a risks and made the possibility of making windows in between the domes with the help of ` Barrel vaults ' .

So , according to my opinion a person is not ` Successful ' until and unless he takes risks .
He is able to learn more things or able to understand the different fields which he is not familiar about .
Taking risks , makes him think more this improves his ability to think and get closer to the things which he is not familiar about .
One 's he is succeded he gets a name and he becomes familiar .
By taking risks his mind power for thinking increases and he able to decide and get to a good conclude that whether , he is able to achieve that goal or not .
So , at last i conclude that one is not successful in his life until and unless he takes risks .
