I completely agree with the statement that sucess comes to those who take risks and walk the path less taken by .
Numerous stoires revealing how great discoveries and inventions took place by the people who went on to take risks .
To state a couple of examples i would like to start with Neil Armstrong , the first astronaut , who took the risk of going into the space and walking on the moon .
Man had never thought that could ever reach moon but it was made possible because some body thought differently and then went on to risk his life for that thought .
Otherwise man kind would have never been able to reach the moon hadent he had the faith in the thought that it could be achieved .

Another example that can be cited supporting my thought would be that of J.L Baird the inventor of television , he thought that by emitting electrons on a surface through a cathode ray tube images can be formed , it was only then that he could develop something which laid the base of the modern TV , he thought differently , and then put his thought into practice , it could have been dangerous but then the development of the modern TV would not have been possible .

Mahatma Gandhi the father of the Indian Nation used the most unique method of `` Ahimsa '' or non violence to gain independence , nobody thought of it , using non violence against violence , was unique , he risked his life to that thought and went on to gain independence for India .

Thus i would like to conclude my essay by saying that you have to think out of the box to be successful , normal and conventional everybody thinks and does , but what clicks is a unique idea , what sells is a unique idea and for that you have to think and do apart from the league and the people who do that are heroes or weave success stories .
