`` King of every thing but jack of nothing '' may be point of view of few people who think broad knowledge does n't help .
But i do agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects .
This do help in shapng the future of a person .

As technology progressed the similar happened with human being .
There started a race between many but the winner was one .
In order to coup up with it , there is always a need of getting an upper hand among the other 's .
Thus if we look in the field of engineering which requires a person to have knowledge related to various field in order to be higher than odds .
But if that person has insufficient knowledge as he had studied only one particular subject may let him down .
For example , a person who is working in an electronics company if he doesnt have any knowledge of operating and electronic transformer that will let him down in front of many .
Thus , if he had a sound knowledge about transformer he would have solved the problem within seconds .

In school days there are number of subjects studied such as history , geography , maths etc .
The real ainm behind it is to help grow knowledge of students so that they do n't encounter any problem in life .
Suppose if only one subject was thought then it would have affected the future of that student .

I my self being an Instrumwentation engineer know the actual essence of studying broad range of subject during my students life .
We were successful in studying Instrumentation as it contained mixture of various subjects from different branches .
The main benefit i got is during my last year graduation project where i have to make and design robot .
The robotics field being main part of mechanical engineering was know to me as it was in my cirriculum .
Thus , i completed the robotics project successfully as compair to other students .
Because of having studied various subjects i was able to achieve my goal of becoming a successful engineer .
