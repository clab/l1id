I disagree with the statement saying that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject .
I will illustrate my views below .

There is an English proverb which beautifully fits in the above case : `` A Jack of all is a master of none . ''
In the past scientific knowledge was relatively limited as compared to now .
Now many new fields have been developed and even in a single field there are many sub divisions .
For e.g. Computers .
Before there no sub-divisions in the field of computers but now we can broadly classify them as Hardware , software , Middle-ware , Internet & Networking , etc .

Even in these sub-divisions we can have several more options .
The point I am trying to make here is that fields are more diverse and varied then they were before .
Hence it is simply not possible to excel in all of them and having only a general idea about them will not suffice .

Additionally knowledge has become more and more complex than before .
Having a general idea about things is not enough to perform the tasks adequately .
For e.g. A CFO ( Chief Financial Officer ) of a company has reasonable knowledge about Law .
So does it mean that he will be as competent as a Lawyer specialising in these tasks ?
Alternatively a lawyer cannot do adequate justice to the job of a CFO .

Let me illustrate my point further .
Would you like to live in a building which has been made by person having a `` general '' idea of construction , architecture and engineering or would prefer living in a building made by a team of experts in their respective fields .
Focus on one topic inspires confidence not only in others but also in the person doing the job .

Hence with the points above I have best tried to justify my conclusion .
