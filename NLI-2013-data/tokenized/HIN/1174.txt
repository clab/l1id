In my opinion , it is better to have specialization in one specific subject rather than having a broader knowledge of many academic subject .
I believe that a person should be a specialist rather than generalist .
There 's an old saying , `` Jack of all trades master of none . ''

Firstly , a person should not waste his time and money in acquiring knowledge which he wo n't require or use it in future .
A person should not devote his time in learning unnecessary subjects which he wo n't even imply in his specialization like Literature and Mathematics are two different fields .
None of the things are common between them .
Also , a mathematics student would waste his time and energy in learning literature whereas he could use this time to do reserach in his prefered subject .
This implies vice versa too .
There is no practical implementation of Mathematics in Literature .
We should avoid our time and energy spent on learning unnecessary subject .

Secondly , all the renowned people whether it is from literature or history or science are the people who have specialized in one subject .
They are not the people who have studied everything .
Infact , they are the people who have devoted all their life in specializing a subject .
They work day and night on their subject to come to certain conclusions which become the basis of our lives .
Moreover there are lot of prizes and recognition for the people who have specialized in one subject .
There is no such recognition for the people who know lot of subjects and are masters of none .
There is wealth , fame and recognition for the people who have dedicated their lives to specialize and reserach in their particular field .
These are the people who are highly appreciated and respected in our society .

Thirdly , most of the profession in today 's world requires a specialist .
We have software programmers , scientist , engineers and etc .
They all are the people who have mastered their field which is based on one subject .
This shows that a specialist can survive in any conditions .
He will always have jobs for earning his livelihood .
He will alway have a preference over others .

Lastly , I will like to conclude that the greatest problem solver in any field are the ones who are specialist in their subject , not the one who know everything .
