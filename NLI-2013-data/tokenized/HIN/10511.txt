I completely agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
After all , if all of us continue to do what we currently do , and are good at , the human race will never evolve .

Innovation has been one of the key strengths of humans .
Some of the most important recent developments have taken place because a few people decided to try out something new , something that was hard to imagine before it actually happened .
Whether it was the telephone or the aeroplane , it was all because of people who wanted to try out new things .
Mankind could make it to the moon only because one individual , of the name Neil Armstrong was ready to try out something that was never tried out before , even if it meant risking his life in the process .
Even in the acient times , mankind discovered fire only because there were certain people decided to try out something new , even if it meant taking a huge risk .

Ordinary people like to do what they are good at .
They are content with the idea that they are trying to get better at something .
However , the real succesful people are the ones who try out newer things and take risks , and hence , contribute to the evolution and betterment of the society .

If we continue to pursue what we have been doing , our lives would become monotonous .
Trying out new things and taking risks gives us the excitement and the zeal which propels our learning .
We look forward to coming across newer expiriences , which teach us more and more , and give us ideas to make our lives better .

We live in a competitive world and a key to success is to try out newer ideas and take risks - to find out newer methods and ideas of improving your life .
In order to develop as individuals , we need to think out of the box - challenge our imagination to come up with ideas which have never been tried before , ideas which give us a significant edge over others .
If you think you have something new to try out , it follows that you would have to risk a lot to make sure that it works .
