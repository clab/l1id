Enjoying life is living it happily and getting actively involved into it further taking happly what it offers to us , with firm determination , Accourding to me i believe that for enjoying life there is no age limit and even old people can enjoy life equally as that a youth enjoys .

Initially for enjoyment in the life you need to be part of the activities which provokes happiness and give the feeling of enjoyment .
I remember that my grand father would actively participate in all festivals and use to enjoy the life with us Further more he use to enjoy more than us because he was much older than us and has more experience ..

Seconldy certain enjoyments such as walking around garden and watching beautiful trees , hanging out with friends , watching movies are not restricted to age even old people can enjoy them Furthermore we notice that older people enjoy most when then are in group and had more stable group where they share their emotions or even they make funs of each other and also there is less chance of fitting with each other , means there is only enjoyment

Some may argue that as they had grown old they cannot do much phisical activities of enjoyment such as playing outdoor games , swimming and many more such activities .
But some peoples may not regard this activity as an enjoyment and it is not that young peoples play outdore games it is been proved that old peoles also activily participates in outdore events but with some limitations .
But the botom line is that they enjoy the life being part it .

Therefore accourding to me there is no age liment for enjoyment and even old peoples can enjoy the life by participatind into different events of life and hanging out with friends or even watching nature .
