Cars are primarily a means of transport .
I reckon that the number of cars being used in the next twenty years will decrease .
Car manufacturers might not show their anxiousness and current sales trends might not show it but other ominous signs are on the horizon .
Things like population expansion , price of petroleum , low availability of road space and newer technologies will come into the picture .

Firstly , the population of the world is rapidly increasing .
As developing countries like China and India continue to prosper .
Their birthrates will most likely follow the same trend .
But , not everyone will be able to buy a car , in fact the birthrate in poorer populations have been found to be much greater than richer ones .
Governments will shift policies to facilitate mass commute and stymie the increase in cars ..
High taxes for owning more than two cars are already in place in many cities with large populations .

Also , it is common knowledge that our petroleum resources will deplete in around two decades .
Newer fuel technologies like fuel cells will come into the picture .
But these technologies are not expected to mature both technologically and economically in twenty years time time .
People have already started going to work in carpools , buses and subways , this way they save money on the already sky high petrol prices .
Imagine , what the prices will be 10 years down the line , let alone 20 years .

The last point that I would like to make is that cars mostly run on big city roads .
Most of these cities are around 100 years old .
They were not built to handle enormous numbers of cars .
Even after much reconstruction the road space availibilty is not expected to be increase much further .
Congestion is a day to day problem faced by all cities .
People have even started proposing flying cars and have built some prototypes for the same .
Which all implies that if there is'nt any roadspace left , there might not be newer cars being bought to ply on them .

In conlcusion , I 'd like to say that I would much rather put my money on public transport than cars as being the means for transportation in the future .
Government policies , rising gas prices , road congestion and population expantion all seem to point toward a decrease in the number of cars , however flying machines might be in vogue .
After twenty years , it just might be a novelty to go out for a picnic in your family sedan over the weekend .
