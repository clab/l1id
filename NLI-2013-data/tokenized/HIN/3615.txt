` It was in this year only that I along with several of my friends recieved tokens and certificates from the Indian National Service Scheme the NSS for the social service done , in as well as off the campus during our college life .
` The young generation is trained to serve the community in one way or the other .
This prompts me to strongly disagree with the notion that young people today donot give enough time to helping their communities .
Most of the educational dance dramas , the non government organisations involve the young generation .
They are more energetic and enterprising in solving community problems .

Starting from schooldays itself children are taught to help older people to keep their environment clean .
Many school has even included this as a part of their extra curricular activities .
For instance one of the schools in my locality graded students even on the way they rendered their services to the society .

Further the teenagers and college going students inspite of having a busy schedule and overburden of studies take out time to interact with people living in old age homes , in the nearby villages , in a nearby blind school or in the sweepers colony just next door .
They acquaint themselves with the subtle problems faced by them and guide them to get a solution at their level .

There are many Non Governmental organisations of which the Younger generations form a bulk ( the working force ) like the Sanskar Bharti in India which serves the community through Indian art and culture which is unknown to many here

Contrasting to this I agree that there is a smaller lot of younger generation which has a hedonistic attitude towards life .
But that can not outcast the services given by the greater lot which thinks about the communityu as well .

Thus I conclude that the younger generation is prepared to take the responsibility of Serving the society guide by the motto service before self .
it is
