I think both having broad knowledge of many academic subjects and at the same time specialization in one specific subject is required now a days to excel in this world and to be ahead of others .

For example if a person is suffering from heart attack then what would we do probably , we will take him to heart surgeon inspite of a general physcians , because if we take him there then he will need a lot of time to examine and to know whats the problem is and by that time the patient will die .
Let me take another example , now days as we can see that the corporate sector is growing so fast that they need people who have specialized skill like for an instance a company require a person who is skilled in C , C++ then company will not ask for people who are graduate in computer science only but will see the people who has the best skill and experience in that feild in these way specialization is required in almost every feild in this world .

On the other hand having broad knowledge of many subjects is also necessary for every human being .
Since we can see that now days most of the student only like computer related subject and they know that they want to make carreer in that feild , and because of that they do not concentrate on other subject for example Histroy , Mathematics etc .
Let me explain the draw back of not learning histroy .
They dont know any thing about there countrys histroy in this way they are getting away from the cultural and tradiational values of the country and they should be made to learn about the tradition , cultural value , histroy of the country as it very important for all the citizen of a country to know about there countrys histroy .
When it comes to maths almost every second student hate it but if they dont learn that , Then they will be in serious trouble in there life .
Mathematics is required in almost every part of day to day life , If you buy something you should know about basic calculation of adding , multiplying etc .
If you dont know that then you are gone any one can fool you .

Finally to conclude both specialized and broad knowledge people are required to make these world a better place to live .
