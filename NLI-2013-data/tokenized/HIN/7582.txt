I like to travel on my own schedule and leisure .
So I disagree that the best way to travel is by being in a group led by a tour guide .
For me travel signifies unwinding myself , discovering unknown things and waking up and sleeping when I want to .
By giving the tour guide control of this time and lettting him/her run my schedule would be sure shot recipe for ruining my holiday .

From my childhood days I have memories of certain trips I took with my parents where they signed up for group trips with a guide as part of the package I remember being tired and bored at the end of the day .
All the places we went to were predictable and crowded .
But when there were day trips we made to the beaches around and just lazed and played in the sand it brought me joy and the pictures always were a delight to watch .
One exception to this is when we visited a world famous sun temple in India which dates back to several hundred years my father hired a tour guide and he explained to us the meaning of different sculptures and their significance in history since this temple was located in one of the oldest kingdoms in India .

Now that my husband and I go on holidays together we do not follow any schedule .
The last time we went on a vacation unplanned we discovered a safari that was not listed in any of the local attractions .
We ended up staying in bamboo huts right on a strip of a private beach with its own kitchen .
The adventurer in me will not let me follow any set pattern of visiting famous attractions based on someone else 's prediction of what needs to be seen .
Of course , if I visit France I will go see the Eiffel tower or any world famous attraction in that city but I may just sit on the side and observe people As I will grow older and perhaps have more time to travel , I know the wanderlust will not fade away and I would like to travel and explore the world .
I also know that while travelling I will come across diverse cultures and people and their foods and habits .
I want to use my travelling experiences to know how and why people live the way they do and while I do that I hope it will help me and my family understand the world in a better way .
That is the legacy I want to teach my daughter - of tolerance and understanding for people who dont necessarily eat or look like us .
A group travel with a tour guide will definitely not help me achieve this .
I would think it will fulfill my role as a part of this world instead of just coming home from a far away place with a momento and a memory of a luxurious hotel .
