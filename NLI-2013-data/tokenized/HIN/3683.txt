The issue at hand is that the young people do to not give much time to helping their communities .
Yes I agree with this statement .
This issue is very important as it shows the unawareness of young people towards their communities .
I do n't know what 's wrong with today 's generation .
Now a days nobody is concerned about the welfare of their communities .
Every individual is so busy in his/her own lives that they are not even bothered about this .

The first reason is that the youth today is so much interested in just filling their own coffers and for them wealth is everything that they do n't have a single second to waste on such a stupid issue as thought by them .

The second reason is that they are forgetting the value of a community .
Today people have become so selfish and so inhumane that they show no responsibility towards their communities .
They are just flowing with the tide of 21st Century and do n't want to realise their duties .

Furthermore , its the modern times which has completely trapped the youth in its web and is not letting them to make a noble move towards this issue .
Well its hightime and the youth will have to come back from hibernation , otherwise their ignorance regarding this issue will simply destroy the values and ethics from the society .

Lastly , I feel that the elders should take part to help young people to be an active player in helping their communities .
The elders could be the right teachers under whose able guidance the life of youth can flourish .
