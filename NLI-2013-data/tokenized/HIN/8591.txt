I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .

An education based on the ` why ' behind many different topics will provide a holistic education to students .
As a result , students will understand ideas and concepts .
Students will have clearer pictures .
A student will learn a few factual information while he or she is in the process of learning an idea or a concept .
The student will become more creative .
The student will be in position to contribute more meaningfully to different discussions with different groups of people .
Such learning help student build some skill sets such as soft skills related to analysis , thinking .
Also , students feel encouraged to opt for constructive environment in which the learning is based on ideas and concepts .
Students feel no undue stress on remembering facts as just remembering facts are not going to help in the long run .

Instead of remembering some rules or incidents as mere facts , the student will be in position to question the existing those rules and incidents .
There are chances that more new ideas and concepts will be generated .
For example , recent changes such as orgnanized producers in retail sectors have resulted in better and efficient processes for the end customers .

In today 's online world , the factual information is easily available .
Students do not need to do any rote learning .
Also , learning facts hampers a student development .
Students will rely on memory for such a trivial case about which information is easily available .
For example , a trivial case would be that how many bones are present in human body .
There is no need to learn such facts .
Instead , once the student is aware that the number of bones can vary during the different stages of life or can vary due to some external factors .
The student will be in more position to understand the reasons for such a varied number .
Such a discussion based on ideas and concepts will provide more insights to everyone involved .

In sum , students who understand ideas and concepts will excel in life from the all round development and will be in position to contribute meaningfully to the socielty .
