I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn them .
When a student is taught ideas and concepts it helps him develop his own understanding and gives him the power to analyse differences in two given situations .
A student who has learnt the concepts properly can apply these and thus come out with a solution on his own .
So what this does is , it promotes and drives the student to grow as an individual intellectually .

Now consider the case that the student is given all the facts .
He will have all the knowledge that he needs to solve a particular problem or he will have all the answers to any question that is thrown at him .
Since he has learnt these facts , its easier for him to recall them whenever he needs to .

This is where the comparasion of the two practices is required to ultimately determine which is more desirable or which one is more beneficial to the student .
While knowing all the facts can be considered an asset , not knowing how and where to use them to achieve the desired goal , means that all the factual knowledge is wasted .
In such cases the understanding of ideas and concepts is more beneficial as the student will know how to use the information he has or can comprehend from a given situation or example and still come up with a solution .

For example i am taught in a phychology class that an individual when scared , acts in a particular way , i will learn that as a fact and the way i need to respond to that will also be learnt .
Now suppose the person for some reason , choses to act differently and takes me by surprise , since a response for this has not been learnt .
So every fact is not useful , the understanding of the concepts of behaviour in this kind of a situation is more advantageous and can help effectively deal with such a situation .

So i feel it is more important for a student to understand rather than learn everything he can because things learnt may be forgotten but if the student still has his concepts right , he can still deal with anything .
