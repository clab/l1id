I srongly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are because i think in some cases this is the basic purpose of the advertisements .
There are several examples to justify this statement .

Firstly take the example of Shampoos , now a days everybody has the problem of less hair and falling hair .
In the market you can find a large number of shampoos that will help you in reducing the problem .
In that case the advertisements will gave you the idea of which shampoo you should buy .
A well directed advertisement in which a girl is having less hair started using the product X regained hair by using it for say 14 days , this kind of advertisement will provoke you to buy the same product but the reality behind it may be different .
Only after using it you will came across the actuality .
The advertisements main aim is to attract more and more customers and it does not to give the real information all the times .
Its the case in most type of cosmetics too .

Second take the example of Yogurts , or any other food products , if you see any thing in the advertisement then you will surely try to buy the same thing because you would be curious of know whether the product does the same as shown in the advertisement , but my personal experience suggests that the advertisements are the ostentacious presentation in case of most of the things .
They are not what they look in advertisements .

Finally i believe that if you take the example of politicians you will find that in order to grab maximum votes they present themselves to be most promising among all others , nobody will show himself as a demagogue , So basically the purpose of advertisement is to make everything look perfect which could be far behind the reality .

To sum up I can say that in most of the cases the real purpose of the advertisement is to make product looks good , beneficial and worth buying .
