Now-a-days the life for everyone has become hectic , let it be a boy going to the college or middle aged man who has family responsibilites .
Especially for young people who have their entire life in front of them & its time now for them to decide in what direction they will steer their attention to get to the destination which will take life to the aim that they have to achieve .

For a start they have to attend college .
Some times have to pay for it themselves .
So for that work part-time .
But now-a-days i can see students dont mind working for their own education .
They have become more active in the society .
They have started realising the important of human values like honesty , humanity & trust .
Hence , I disagree with statement that is made here that young people donnot give enough time or help their communities .

I can give you an example which i experienced myself .
Few months back , in my city there was an excessive rainfall in a season when it was completely unexpected .
Hence , the government resources were not available on time .
At that time , people staying near the place , where lots of water was creating a blockage of traffic , came onto the streets to help the people for crossing the roads which were under water .
I even heard news that these people provided shelter & food to those who couldnt get to their homes due to lack of trasport .
All these people helping out others were young .
It was quite evident because old ones couldnt help doing so many things by walking in rains .

There might be some youngsters who are involved in drug activities or crimes or some even `` doing nothing sitting at home '' types .
But you cannot judge the entire young generation only by looking at them .
I think that today 's young generation is very much awake about its responsibilities & are doing their duties well , without fail .
Giving them opportunities to do it is now the responsibility of our community .
