I am quite agree to this statement which state `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' Nobody can learn all facts about any subject , but he/she can understand all ideas and concepts of any topic .
Genrally science and technical students prefer to understand the ideas and concepts of topic , they know that if they remember the ideas and concepts of any topic of a subject , they can explain that topic without the help of facts .
when i was in collage i prefer to give more time on understands the ideas and conceptas of a topics , becouse i belive that ideas and concepts are unique for a particuler topics but facts may match .

Research students are also give more time on understand the ideas and concepts of a topics rather than learn the facts .
Becouse they know that during the answer of a question , teachers and student like to know what are ideas and concepts behind this work rather than facts .

Business students are also give more attention on understand the ideas and concpets rather than learn facts .
Becouse coustmers and companies want ideas and concepts behind the successful products not facts .

Sports students are also give more attention on understand ideas and concepts of any game rather than to learn facts of that game .
They think if they know the ideas and concepts of any game , they could give good perfomance on that game .

Most of my friends ` when i was doing master in technology ' prefer to understand the ideas and concepts of any topics .
Becouse in masters lot of complex topics are involed in syllubus .
So , nobody could perform well in this complex topic when they do not have good command in ideas and concepts of that complex topics .

So , i finally can say that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
