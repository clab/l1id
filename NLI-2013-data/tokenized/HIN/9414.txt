In my opinion i am very much agree with that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts beacuse students are like buds they will blossom in future with some qualities .
If they stuck with fact they can never get what they want from ideas and concepts .

The students follow facts will grow but less than the students who always learn from ideas and concepts .
Beacuse when we make something we are like god we create what ever we wnat our mind will be crative so with new ideas and research we can get many new things or invent something new .
But who stuck with the fact never get chance to explore theirselves with something new or creative .

For an example invention of vaccine was not a fact it was idea .
How the mocroorganism will work against disease .
So reseacher develoed a vaccine for untreatable or dreadful disease like measles , typhoid , dyptherria and many more .
And now the research taking place is using the concept and idea .

Another example is Newton 's law ..
it was a concept what are the reasons that apple faal down not up , so he used some ideas , research on them and got a result that the things fall down because of gravity and his laws is famous as Newton 's law of gravity .

Like the invention of first steam engine observor was watching that steam has suffiecient power to remove the lid or it is easily pushing the lid .
So he get an idea why not invent the thing which run with the steam and he invented train .

We all know that we all have expressions like our parents because of genetic genes .
But Daniel and Waurik were the first who thought the idea that hat are reasons that we look liked our parents and then they invented DNA helical model .

So the new things only generated with the new ideas and concept like tial and erroe basis .
we can use the fact but upto which extent it will helpful we do n't know .
We come to know only when we do something .
May be one of the student get some idea so he/she can invent the medicene for the gray hairs means hair will never gray it will reamin black or invent some medicine to become always young .

This all base on ideas and concepts .
Graham bell invented the phone just he was sitted in yard and idea generated is there is any way to talk to distance people .
He thorough worked on it and invented a Telephone .

So i 'll suggest that generate ideas and make concepts and try .
Definately you will get something new and interesting .
Research is the great field for the ideas and concepts .
Where we can use the things to make our idea noticable .

All the major inventions are the result of ideas and concepts and thats why we are still progressing to achieve something new .

May be ideas and concept are not core but it is in our hand to make these into core like fact so that others can follow our ideas .
To make progressive make ideas and work on them .

So students have to make their mind active , alert , creative and imaginative .
So thay can learn more about the world , science ang geography .
And invent somehing new for future and for world .
