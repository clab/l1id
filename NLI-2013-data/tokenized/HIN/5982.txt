The world is changing from day to day at a very fast pace .
Form the time when man used nothing but his foot to travel he has reached a stage where he covers the same distance that he could before in a much smaller time .
Technical advancement and man 's thirst for more knowledge made these things possible .
Well , 20 years back from now in my country people used bullock carts , horses and man-pulled transport more than cars .
So , chances are fair that 20 years from now man will use fewer cars for he might find a better alternative to it !!
With this note I would like to agree with the fact that 20 years from now , there will be less cars on the road .

In todays era there are already too many cars on the road flooding every nook and corner of the city and the outside of the city with equal intensity .
The mode of transport that was believed to be the fastest till yeaterday had become the cause for the delay in most peoples travel schedule .
why ? ..
why not ?
How many times have we come across situations when we start really early from home to meet someone or to keep up an appointment but , to our vain we find a road full of cars waiting for us to give them company .
In any case even if the first hurdle is cleared we get to face another hurdle ` the red light signal ' and before you realise you are already too late to keep up your appointment .
This problem is faced by most of us .
To overcome this , the upperclass people prefer to travel by a private jet of a helicopter rather than taking a road .
While today it might be a transport of the higher class , 20 years is a long period to bring down the cost of air journey considerably , so much so that even middle class will be able to afford it .
Resulting in fewer cars on the road .

The second reason for the contribution of less number of cars on the roads could be the scarcity of natural resources .
while we all know how much petrol and desel is being burnt up every day in fuelling billions of cars all around the world , while the resources are very less .
It could be firmly anticipated that after 20 years there might not be much fuel left to ignite all the cars .
The country might take charge of the whole resource and use it only for the country 's experimentation and space reasearch .
The country would then encourage its people to use the publich transport such as buses and trams which would require considerably less amount of fuel expenditure .
It might also emphasize on electric-rail travel .
This would accounting for fewer cars on the road .

The third reason might be the spreading awarness of pollution among the youth .
The youth of today is the future power .
It is seen that the children of today are very understanding and more inclined to understanding their environment and problems connecting to them .
There is spreading awareness among the youth about living in a better place while leaving enough resources for the generations to come .
This might lead to a revolution where people would prefer to travel in a more nature friendly mode than cars .
This can already be seen among people of today .
They try using their bike or walk to nearby distances and travel in groups to school so that only one car need to be fueled .
This attitude might take a wider turn after 20 years resulting in fewer cars on the road .

In all the ways stated above the ultimate result would be fewer cars .
Even if this is not the the ultimate result we should work for it to become the ultimate result .
So that we can make our world a better place to live by avoiding global warming and pollution .
