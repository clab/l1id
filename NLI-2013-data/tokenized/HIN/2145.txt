I agree young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people are strong , smarter and they can do work fastly comparing to older people .
Young people enjoy life in different ways , they often go to movies , shopping etc .

Now-a-days young people are more brilliant , more smarter .
Young people when they go to parks or movie they feel enthusiasm .
For example , i am a young student i feel more enjoy when i spent with my friends .
I often spend most of time with my friends , we went to movies , parks etc .
Really i spend most of my time on new year day with my friends really it was enjoyable day for me and i often meet so many friends and i tell new year wishes with them .
Young people enjoy life more than older people but young people have to remember one thing you have to give respect , and you have to look them and you should be kind and respectful to them .

Finally , young people enjoy in different ways and they have curiosity to enjoy and accomplish things .
One disadvantage about young people is that they do some things wrongly beacause thay are teenagers .
