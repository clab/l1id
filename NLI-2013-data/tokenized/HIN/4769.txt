Advertisement are done to attract peoples , for the marketing of that products .
The actual idea behind the advertisement should be to introduce the quality of the product , it should include the importance of product & uses of the product .

I agree that most of the advertisement make products seem better than they are .
They think that if if advertisement is attractive then the product will sale good .
But i beleive that if the product is really good it doesnt require advertisement .
The people can talk about that product among themself when they will use that product that will be a real advertisement .

Once the product is launced in the market it needs recognition .
A normal advertisement can help it .
sometimes it depend upon the product , if the product is very useful in daily life it doesnt require much advertisement .
It depend upon the market also , depend upon the cost .
If it is resonable then each & every person can use that product .

There was a big advertisement of a perfume called ' LOVELY ' but when people used that perfume they realised that it was not that good .
But theer was a big commercial on the another cologn called ACQUA DI GIO which was very popular & still it is popular , but the difference is now that cologne doesnt require any advertisement because of its quality & the cost also .

sometimes I think if advertisement is big that means that product requires marketing , i mean its doesnot have a quality or what ?
some advertisements are made by spending lot of money eventhough the product is of low quality .
There are people who thinks greater the advertisement grater the popularity but i dont think that is true .
The product requires quality , availability , & value .
If the product is launced & if there is a great advertisement about that product and the product is very short in the market its useless .
It will be better if they will spend more money on the quality of the product even quantity of product .
It may possible by increasing quality the products value may get increased which is not good for all the people .

According to me the product should be more resonable & useful sothat each & every person can afford it not only by making big big advertisement .
The more the popularity of the product by an advertisement done by people more the popular product will be .
Advertisement itself is an expenssive process so value of the product may get incresed will cause decreasing the sale of that product .
