As the famous saying goes
` Jack of all trades and master of none'
I believe if one day my mom tries to make cookies with the methods of making cakes , puddings , ice-creames etc. all together it would taste rather ridiculous .
Try and imagine a person wearing a white shirt entirely covered with circles of red , green , purple and blue .
Iam sure it reminds of a clown .
on the other hand imagine a persson with white shirt and tiny scattered red and blue squares ; looks assum .
Similarly if a person has broad knowledge of many academic subjects and no deep knowledge in any specific of them then it could not be put to any specific use ; and if tried to use in some way would actually spoil things .

Consider an example wherein the teacher of history in the lecture while explaining about civil war starts relating it opera it would rather lead to a rather useless junk of thoughts in the students mind .
In order to be able to apply the knowledge one has gained to some practical use deeper knowledge regarding the same is required .
This is neccesary in oredr to ensure that what we do will be flawless .

A student to stand up strongly in future is no doubt has to be versed with everything under the sun .
But the depth of such knowledge has to be limited and whereas knowledge in one particular area has to be really strong .
Now is wan era wherein the complexity in various fieldfs is increasing ten fold and so is the avancement .
To keep pace with both of them what is neccesary is specialisation .

It has been observed for this matter that post-graduates and more precisely doctorates are in graeater demand in professional world than are mere graduates .
This is due to the fact that they definetely hold more depper , more preicse and absolutely flawless knowledge in order to be apllied directly .
Also the apllication point of view for their field is more clear Thus , although one should have knowledge about what is going around and whats in , it is also essential that he is able to get the deeepest possible knowledge in a particular field and apply the same in oredr to stand up strongly and more confidently in the professional world .
