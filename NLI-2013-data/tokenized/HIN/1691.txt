Broad view of all the acedamic subjects gives you an overview of all subjects .
It helps the person decide which subject he is really interested in .
It helps him in choosing his career .
However for higher studies one should always specialize in one subject .
I believe that specialization in a specific field is better than to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects .

Firstly specializing in a particuar subject gives you an in-depth understanding of the subject .
It helps in understanding of the finer details .
Careers can be built in that particular subject of interest .
Like doctors do masters in a particular field eg : cardiology , pathology etc .
Then they can treat patients having particular disorders like the cardiologists treating heart patients .
They can concentrate on one thing and really become a pro at that .
This helps both the patients and doctors .

Secondly specializing give an in-depth knowledge ofthe subject .
One can reasearch an a particularly interesting topic and probably invent something in it .
It gives an added edge to the person .
Moreover it develops the person 's interest into it .
Like after learning about networking it really increased my interest in the different types of protocols of networking etc .
If given a chance I would really like to work in that field .

I feel that it is necessary to have many subjects at the beginning during the undergraduate years where one is not sure about his or her own interests .
Learning all subjects would help one decide their subject of interest in which they would like to have a career .
However once decided it is better to do specialization in one particular subject of interest .
Thus it is necessary to do aspecialization in one subject of interest .
