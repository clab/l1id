I strongly agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The two main problems faced by people because of more number of cars on roads are the increasing number of traffic jams and the increasing levels of pollution .
People have become aware that its high time to address these two problems right now before it goes out of hand .

People today are aware of the harmful effects of the air pollution on the environment .
One major source of this air pollution is the vehicles .
Harmful substances like carbon monoxide etc. coming out of the vehicles is harming the ozone layer and thus increasing the cases of skin cancer .
Everyone has started realising that if we want to save our future generations then we have to think of alternatives of cars .
And people have started to act on it as well .
For example , in many European countries , we can see that people travel on bikes or on foot than on cars .

In many countries like Singapore , Malaysia .
England etc .
Metro Rail or Tubes have started operating .
The metro rails are laid as a network to interconnect the entire city and it has been proved quite succesful in these countries .
More number of people prefer to travel by metros than by their cars .
You will not find that many cars on the roads there .
Following their example , India has also brought Metro the country and people have started to travel by it .
Because of it , the pollution levels and traffic jams both have reduced .
There are more countries to follow .

In addition to this , petrol prices are sky rocketting making the car travel more expensive day by day .
People are not able to afford the monthly expenditure of the petrol or gas .
Also our oil and petrol reserves are very limited and will get over in the next thirty to fourty years max which will force us to look for other travelling options .

In the end , I would just like to say that forcibly or willingly , we will give up car travelling in future because of the above mentiones reasons which will let us see fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .
