The issue of to be successful , whether people should try new things and take risks or do what they already know , is a controversial one .
On the one hand , by doing what one knows well , the results of the actions are predictable and the methods are probably already proven .
On the other hand , risk taking and tyring new things opens new and unexplored avenues to success which one could never have imagined .
On final analysis , I belive trying new things and taking risks is more rewarding and brings about more success than doing what one already knows .

Successful people have always looked to the new ways to success , which were not necessarily the areas that they were experts in .
These people venture into doing new things , learning a great deal in the processs , and then end up creating a new path to success .
Microsoft Corporation is one such example of one such creation .
Created by a group of people , who belived in something new , in a time when the term ` software ' was known only to a handful .
Today , that belief held by that group of people has given us a software that has changed the way our life functions .

Inventions and breakthroughs did not happen because of people who did what they did well .
It happened because of people who moved out of their comfort zone , confroned norms , broke shakles , to prove a point .
And have these people been successful ?
Most certainly so .
Right from Albert Einstein to Micheal Dell of Dell Computers .

The argument in favor of doing what one does well is that one can predict the results , be assured of a short term success and then claim to be successful .
But to achieve the next level of success , one needs to go further and foray into territories which are less trodden than others .
