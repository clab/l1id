In modern era , people are getting more and more involved in their personal matters to such an extent that they cannot spare time for other social obligations .
Young generation , particularly focusses on its own interests disregarding the needs and problems of their communities as a whole .
I agree with the statement made by the author and substantiate my decision as follows .

The concept of `` Individualism '' has encompassed almost every corner and section of society .
People are preoccupied by the thought `` Survival of the Fittest '' .
That is why they are more focussed on their own personal lives and dont care for their community as a whole .
This is supported by the fact that whenever funds are granted for the upliftment of a particular community , people who are involved in such dealings tend to get maximum aid for themselves remaining unconcerned about the others in the community .

Also in today 's world everyone is flooded with the works and responsibilities one has to perform .
This leaves no room in their thought for such help to upbring their community .
Their hectic schedule doesnot leave them with enough spare time .
So they dont get enough time for considering concerns of their communities .

Moreover , these days the thinking of people have broadened and they donot want to give an edge to a community , no matter if that community is their own .
They believe in sense of competition and unbiased selection .
They believe in dignity of hard work and want justice to prevail among the society .

But one must admit as well , many associations which favor the improvement of a community as a whole are still present in fair numbers and are active .
Most of these associations are run by people who have been successful in life and want to provide opportunities to other members of their community .
Most of them comprise of donations , gifts and reservations for the members of their respective communities

In sum , despite of some exceptions the young people nowadays do not devote enough time to helping their communities and are more concerned with their daily responsibilities and obligations .
