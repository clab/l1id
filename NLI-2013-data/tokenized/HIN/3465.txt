I agree with the statement that young people nowadys do not work hard to help their communities .
I think they spend their time doing other unimportant and useless things such as playing games and killing time .
They also make the community worse in sum cases such as playing loud music in the middle of the night when everybody is trying to have a good night 's sleep .
They act agaisnt the society 's interests and add to the noise pollution .

There are several reasons that contribute to such behaviour of youngsters .
These include peer pressure , stress thorugh family problems , child abuse and so on .
Friends may think thst it 's ` cool ' to smoke , drink and do drugs .
They think that breaking rules is the way to gain fame and popularity among other members of the same age group .
Troubled childhood may add to such behaviour too .
Some youngsters may be facing a lot of pressure from family members or through child abuse .
This may lead them to remove their frustrations on their communities by troubling them and disturbing them by breaking the rules .
They may go terribly out of control and rebel arnd the age of 12-20 years .

Youngsters may not be willing to help their communities because they might think that it is boring and montonous to help out their communities .
Also to fit in to the ` group ' , their behaviour pattern changes which makes them less co-operative .

They try to distract and destroy their community by playing horrible loud music , blowing horn for no particular reason in the middle of the night while having fun with friends .
They may throw litter unneccesarily across the area and spoil the environment .
They may destroy habitats of certain species and cause them to become extinct .

The society can try and bring about a change in todays youngsters through love and guidance .
Older people can try and make freinds with the youngsters .
This can be done by frequently holding a community meeting .
For example , every month a community conference can be held specially for teenagers explainig to them the consequences of not handling their community in a proper way .
Drastic action can also be taken such as by complainig to the police should teenagers behave in an ill - mannered way .
Parents can treat them strictly for improper behaviour .
