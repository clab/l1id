It is more impotent for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts i m agree with this fact because if a student just go for learning the matter he/she will never able to understand the thing .

In order to answer a question a student must have to understand the question , because sometime teacher did't go for straight forward question they would change the language of it .
so student get confused , if concept is clear than he/she can answer but if the concept is not clear than he would not able to answer .

it is very essential to understand the ideas of the topic because if u have some idea about that topic than u can write some point about it .
and it 's also better to clearfify the concept of the topic because many of the time teacher will go for the indirect questions , eg.if a indirect question came the studunt who learn the thing will not be able to answer but if the student have understand the idea and concept is clear thea the student would be able to give good answer than the student who just learn the thing .

Another one of the good example is math student .
math is one of the tricky subject .
in math some question are very easy to do , but in some question student must have to use it 's own tricky mind .
some question just required a formula to solve the question but in some two or more than two formula 's can be used to solve the problem which can be done by a student whose who understand the question and whose concept is clear , if this type of question is given to students who just learn the fact he/she will not able to answer because that student will used to solve that question by using just one formula which is not possible .

So i think it is more importent to understant the concept than to learn facts .
