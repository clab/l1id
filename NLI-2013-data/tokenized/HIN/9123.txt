The life is practical not theoritical .
To live in this practical world the every student should know the facts about the life .
But there are some places for those the person has to understand the ideas and concepts of the things .
I think that the students should understand the ideas and concepts as it is an important part of their education but it is more important for them to understand and know the facts about the things and life .
The following passages will explain the reasons for my opinion .

Firstly , a person cannot live in the world just by having the ideas and concepts , they have to become the practical in their life .
So if students start learning the facts from their primary education then they will be able to work in their field more successfully .
I can explain my view with an example , there are so many books that students read while doing the MBA or other management courses but when it comes to practical while doing the job most of them are not useful , so at that time the students are required to learn the facts .
Like many books says that a manager should not tell any thing worng to his employees and should not hide and fact or any information from his employees but there are several conditions when the management is required to hide the things and some information fromt he employee .
For example if the team is working on the some secret project then in these comdition the the manager is required to hide the important information from the team .
So if the students will learn these facts from their child hood they will become a better manager or better person in their field .

Secondly , if the students will learn these facts from the primary school then it will also save their time .
As most of their time goes in learing only the ideas and concepts .

Finally there are also some benefits of learing the ideas and facts in the student life .
A student will get more knowlede and will be having better ability to understand the things .
For example , an engineering student has to learn practical things in his life at the last .
But if he will be having the better concepts and idea that how is work done and how are the requirements of a good job then he will be able to perform well .

In sum , i think that the students should be given the knowledge about both the things that is about the facts and about the ideas and concepts .
As both plays their important role in the life of a student both are important for a successful person .
But more importance should be given in teaching about the facts rather than the ideas and concepts .
