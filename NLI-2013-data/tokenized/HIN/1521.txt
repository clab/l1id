Knowledge is something that the more you have the better it is .
It cant neither be robbed nor taken away .
It is something that is going to stay with you forever .
Though Knowledge of all the subjects is required but I disagree with the statement and believe that specialization in one subject is more neccesary .

Though i do not disagree that broad knowledge of many subjects is required but according to me broad knowledge knowledge of many academic subjects is required till say a bachelors degree when you are young and need information in all subjects .
I agree that that if u have knowledge in all subjects then you will over all be a more educated person and have a better impact on people that you meet when u talk about a various number of things .

But according to me specialization is much more important when you reach a masters degree because todays world is more of specialization and only those type of people are valued that are specialized in their field .
See todyay if you are specialized in your field then you have a better chance of making to the top in this field and you cant earn a lot of fame and recognition in that field and you can also become a dr in that fields but incase of trying to know a lot of subjects would you might not be able to as good in either of the subjects .

For example we can see the Indian president APJ Abdul Kalam who is said to be the father of Indian rocket science but if he would try to have a broad knowledge in many academic subjects like say History or Geography or any other subject then he wouldnt probably be as good as what he was in rocket science and therefore he would not have been as famous as what he was then .
So thats is why in my opinion specialization in one subject is more important then trying to be good in all subjects .
