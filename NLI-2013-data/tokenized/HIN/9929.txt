I agree with the statement that successful people try innovative methods / things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I would like to explain the reasons for my agreement with the statement with the help of a few examples .

I believe that most successful people have proved to the world and to themself that they are capable individuals .
Therefore , only if they do some thing different and innovative , it would give them pleasure .
As per Mr. A. Maslow 's motivation theory , these individuals have reached the final motivation stage of `` Self-Acculization '' , hence only self-pride motivate them .

I would like to give the example of Mr. Sunil Mittal ( Chairman of Bharti Telecommunications ) and Mr. Anil Ambani ( Chairman of Anil Dhirubhia Ambani Group ) .

Mr. Mittal is the chairman of one of India 's largest mobile tele-communication companies , which controls almost 30 % market share in the GSM network in India .
Recently , Mr. Mittal has announced a plan to setup a `` organized retail venture '' in partnership with Walmart .
Retail and Tele-communications are very diverse sectors , but Mr. Mittal is keen to enter into the organized retail space in India for marketing consumer products .
This shows that a person who owns and operates one of the largest companies in India is ready to explore unchartered territory to take on a new challenge .

Mr. Anil Ambani is the chairman of one of the most reputed groups in India .
Officially , he is ranked among the richest men ( top five ) in India .
He has started an organization of acquiring secured debts / loans of distressed companies In India .
He plans to turnaround make profits by acquiring the liabilities of these companies at nominal value and then by selling the companies to strategic players operating in the same industry as the distressed player .
This business line is completely different from what the group already does .

Therefore , I strongly believe that successful people try new things and take on risks rather than do what they are already good at .
