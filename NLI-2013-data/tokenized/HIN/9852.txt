I agree with this state ment because the person who always do hard work and he knows that there is arisk .
With out risk we cant achive any thing in this world .
The world is totaly full of compation we hav e to take a risk .
Even though we know that about it for example a person who is well knowledge and experienced in bussines he will try to launch a prouduct in market in compation world other also launch a prouduct and both have confidend they will sale their prouduct .

This shows that they both are taking a risk because they have the confident on their prouduct .
If they do n't like this they don fill satisfied .
Successful always try new tinghs .
They know how to do it .
With out a risk there is no profit for a bussines man .
If there is a risk he will try alternate to balance .
They all ways try new thing so that that the industry become famous in the world .
Successful person never fill satisfied with one thing and all ways try new thing to develop is industries .

He all ways try to open industries in other countrys .
To establis his empire in the industry world .
Business man that tho see the drem to become a famous bussines man he all ways take risk come up in life then only he feel satisfied .
If he do hard work perticular on what he want to do .
Nothing is permanent in the bussines so at any he have to take a risk .
