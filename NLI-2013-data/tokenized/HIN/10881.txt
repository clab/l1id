As far as my view is concern i am disagree with statement .
As the old saying goes `` Jack of all trades is Master of none '' , I believe on the following proverb .
What I feel is you should concentrate on the one traget rather than trying your hands on too many target without pondering on its prose and con .
If you do so it would only lend you in a big trouble in the long run , so it is better to play safe .
My father alway taught me that if you would able to concentrate on your main aim , you would surely get success .
For example-if we take the example of shooting any target , If you concentrate on that target while shooting then there would be higher chance of accurate shoot but if your concentration loose and it diverts from the main target then that would have surely negative result .
Although , innovation is main key to success but you can also try your skill in the things you already know as that would be better ( in the sense of positive result ) and safe .
If you are not expertise any work then how would you get success to the fullest , it would be better to enjoy the positive result then a negative result .
Every human being want to become perfect at every front of life-Professional , Social and Educational , but he or she would be able to do so by giving hundred persent to each work .
For example if a person who already has business of his own which is running well-off but that business is older and he want to establish a new business that is not familiar to him and which is the fastest and innovative in the market , so the main essence is that how could he establish that business .
In this certain situation i would only recommend him to rennovate the establish business .
If we look at another example a student has a interest in engineering say electronics and telecommunication and at that time the field of medical has immense opportunities so he cannot able to adapt the medical field all he can do is just pursue the field which relates his field with the medical taking subject like medical imagindg system an
