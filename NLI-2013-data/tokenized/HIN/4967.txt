Advertisments are enticing .
They are put out into the market to influence a particular person or a group .
In todays world more time is being spent in front of the televison than with the outside world .
Knowing this information , advertising companies prey on that aspect of an individual and make then think and want a product .

The argument on whether ` Most advertisment make products seem much better than they really are ' is that No , i disgree with that statement .
Commercials that are made for the general public , have a time limit to protray they idea .
In this short span of time the concept of the commercial has to allure the viewer to that product , and that what exactly happens .
For example the Mastercard commercial that shows a person buying stuff and the price of every product bought and at the end is says that it 's ` Priceless ' seeing the joy , happiness on the faces of people who are dear to you and the satisfaction you get by seeing that expression .
Well , here it show how this card can make you acheive that one goal in your life .
This product , a plastic card can change a persons perception about getting the things you want in life and knowing that there is always a way for that .
That can happen , with one minor hurdle .
Your credit should be good .

Most of the times , commercails for cosmetics use famous people to market that product .
This product looks perfect on them , they seem happy at how beautiful they lookl .
Well guess what , they are doing it because they are getting paid for that and yes , they look incredible .
Here the idea is to have a celebrity endorse that product .
For example , Avon , Salma Hayak is the spokesperson for that company 's products .
She looks amazing in the lipstick , her eyes dazzel and lips shimmer .
You too can copy that look , but not look exactly like her .
The product will do the same for you , the only difference is that she has all the lights and angles that the photographs are taken that makes her look even more beautiful .

Televison , radio , billboards , print are ways of advertisment .
This is way that the general public gets information about an item .
Advertisment is about creativity and showing what a product can do for you .
