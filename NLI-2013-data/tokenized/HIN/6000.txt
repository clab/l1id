World is progressing towards pinnacles of technology and science everyday .
People have become more conscious about living standards .
Earlier idea was to save maximum money for generations and thus , people spent less in luxury .
Nowadays , buying a car is much easier than saving money as government keep track of all your black money .
Can you think of depositing black money in bank ?
Do n't you plan to change your car with changing fashion ?
Do you really care for saving for future ?
Today , people think for comfort and not money .
So , who can think of reduction in number of four wheelers ?
I believe that car is not a status symbol but has become necessity .
Can you think of going to write your exam by bus ?
Oh !
it is really pathetic .
I would prefer a car as it will keep my mind relaxed and air conitioned environment reduces fear and anxiety .

I disagree with the statement , `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . ''
Although , industrialization and increasing number of vehicles on roads has led to major problem of pollution , but this does n't mean that people will stop buying cars .
We always have alternative solutions to a problem .
Now you will say that fuel is on the verge of exhaustion .
But , with increasing technical and scientific advances we can come out of the problem of lowering volumes of petrol and diseal .

You must have heard of `` biodiseal '' been used successfully in Brazil .
There are so many alternative fuels available these days .
Thanks to science !
What about Gasoline ?
It is widely used as an alternative fuel .
In India , New Delhi has shown dramatic results by using `` compressed gas '' ( popularly known as CNG ) .
It is known as clean fuel thus saving environment from pollution .
So , now what you say ?
Do we really have to stop buying cars ?
After twenty years , will there be any change in number of cars ?
In my opinion , Yes there will be change but a positive increase in number because now people are more educated .
They care for environment and thus fuel these days is used judiciously .
Scientists all over the world are experimenting in order to find oil from bacteria and plants .

`` Jatropha '' , a drought resistant plant has been a boon for dry countries as these plants can be grown in harsh climate areas also .
They are found to release oil which can be collected by harvesting the seeds of this plant and then sent to industries for purification processes .
So , there is no need to reduce the number of cars as so many clean fuels are available .
They are less toxic than fossil fuels .
Technical advances are on the way to create a pollution free environment and gives hope for new horizons leading to more luxurios cars in the future .
