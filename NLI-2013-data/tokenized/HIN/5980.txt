In twenty years from now there will indeed be fewer cars in use than what are today .
No wonder that the purchasing power of people will increase because of the betterment of the economy of the country through agricultural , technical and various other advancement , this will act as a catalyst in the purchase of more cars .
The development of technology will help to introduce new features in the field of transport .
The electrical trains , which have already become a popular means of commutation , will get replaced be even more efficient ones .
Airborne communication can be subsidised for common usage .
Advances in nanotechnology can guide some new methods of tranport at the macro level .

Another factor that may reduce the car usage is the prize of petroleum .
The incessant increase in the fuel cost indicates towards their mammoth value after twenty years .
Hence vehicles driven by other power sources such as electricity , thermal power , nuclear power etc. would be preferred .

Moreover , the way in which the population is enhancing would result into a tremendous increase in the number of conveyances .
This would lead to crowding in the roads and parking places .
The introduction of publis means of tranport will enable more people to travel in a single vehicle and hence would help reduce the pollution to a great extent .
This would also involve less consumption of the fuel and also provide employment to more number of people .

Greater traffic would lead to greater pollution , greater enragement amongst the people and hence greater mental illnessess .
The hamful effect on the public health is more detrimental than the organic causes of diseases .
this increase in insanity would cause more crimes to occur , including suicide of course .
Pollution may injure the health of not only the human beings but also of the plants , trees and animals that dwell around .

Hence regarding the benefits of the publis means of communication the people after twenty years would certainly not prefer travelling in their own cars and hence there will be fewer cars in use .
