`` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
Well I certainly think that is the best and most exciting way to travel !

There are various reasons why it is the best way .
When you travel in a group you are among other people who are from different countries and places and this might be a new experience for them as it might be for you .
As you visit different places you may want to exchange your views and ideas with the fellow members in the group which itself makes the whole experience exciting .
For example , lets say your visiting a historical place or monument , the guide explains the history and the story behind the place and the way it originated .
Suddenly , one member of a group might throw up new and more information about the place which he read it somewhere or heard it , or saw it on the TV and this will help the other group members get a better insight and make the experience of visiting the new place more enriching and lively .
Now , this does not mean that the tour guide is not doing a good job , ( on the lighter side ) but , lets admit , he is no God to know every bit of everything that he is showing , and there maybe times he may miss out trivial details not deliberatly but unknowingly or due to the time provided at his disposal .

Also , when your among a bunch of people visiting a new place its more fun , you get the chance to meet new people from different backgrounds and make friends during the journey and share more experiences of other places .
You can share jokes and there might be people who may share humorous experiences they had which makes the tour a whole lot of fun and enjoyment .
You may even end up learning about a new place which may end up being your next trip for a vacation !

Hence , I think travelling with a group accompanied by a tourist guide gives one the advantages of exchanging more knowledge and information and meeting new people which can make the overall experience fun and exciting because you end up not only visiting new and different places but also meeting new and different people !
