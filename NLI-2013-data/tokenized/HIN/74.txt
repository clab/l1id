Some people might say that knowledge of many academic subjects is better , rather than to specialize in one specific subject .
I believe that one should surely posess knowledge about various subjects but its better to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons .

Firstly , students are taught many academic subjects in the college but when they pass out and look for a job , they are asked to prove skills in one specific field .
For example an MBA student can choose specialized courses while he is studying like Marketing , Finance , International Business and Information Technology .
This helps the student to choose the field he is going to work in the future .
A software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up Information Technology as specialized course during college as its expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perfom during his job .

Secondly , it helps students to take up courses in which they are good at .
For example a student might not do well in most subjects in college but they would be good in one .
So they should be given an oppurtunity/liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and making a career .
Few students are weak in mathematics but it does n't matter to them if they are good in political sciences and they want to make a career in politics or administative services .
I have even come accross few parents who give their children the liberty to choose they career goals or a specific field of education , no matter if they are n't doing well in most of the academic subjects .

In conclusion , I would like to express disagreement for a person to possess broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
After all if a person is `` jack of all trades , master of none '' he would not be able to work in this competitive world which exists today .
