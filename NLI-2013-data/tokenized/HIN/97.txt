Every person came on this world by thinking that he or she will enjoy entire life more than any person in this world world had enjoyed .
It is well said that `` Change is law of nature '' . every person changes when he get older .

In my view younger people enjoy their life more than older people do .
It is a natural process that when a person get older his everything become older like his way of thinking , how he manges his further life and many more things .
older people ca n't do everything what the youth can do .

To hold my opinion i would conclude some points .
First , old persons had enjoyed their entire life but after many years of his life he had not left any power in his bones or in veins to do any physically enjoyment while a young person have his bones like iron and veins like steel so he can do any physical enjoyment like going to party having dance etc. secondly , old persons had already done all the works which the youth is doing and so their all feelings of enjoyement had lost from whole of their hearts .
while youth have fresh and warm blood so they have each and every emotions in their mind .
thirdly , old perstons get more religious when they reach sixtys or more so they have no more plans in their minds to enjoy .

however , some people have beleif that older persons can enjoy the life more than the younger people but they should take in mind thaht there are many challanging situations in front of enjoyment of of older people like physical and mental conditions .
we know that we cant acheive more than what is written in our luck we cant also obtain less than what we have to acheive .

finally , i conclude that it travels generation to generation and its the time for youth to enjopy their life .
