I disagree that it is important for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for the to learn facts because in todays world , in order to achieve success a careful planning is needed and planning cannot be done without facts and figures .
For instance , if a scientist has an idea or a belief , than he needs to experiment it to get facts that support the belief and than when he gets this supportive facts than the theory becomes a law and would accepted universally .
So , in order to prove any thought belief and idea the facts are required .
Moreover , students should learn about facts and this will not only help them in their future job but also in every desicion either personal or professional which they make , will be much more realiable and result would be certain and fruitful .

While knowledge and understanding of ideas and concepts is also nesseary as without them the person would not be able to set goals in live and direct his full energy to achieve it nor he will be able to gain success in life .

For example , suppose an employee has been given a project .
So , the employee needs to study it than understand the concept , plan a idea , plan a stratergy , do research and find factsand figures which support the concept and on the basis of these facts he could also estimate the profits and submit the report , than the deal would be signed and succes in profits desired would be achieved and his work would be appreciated and he might get rewards for it .
Thus the knowledge of concept and idea is important but facts are the evidences thus , when support the former than it is implemented and the success is confirmed .
Whereas , the employee could also complete the report by indicating the facts and figures and submitting it , But an efficient , employee would study find pros and cons and evaluate the deal ability to provide desired profits that are expected by the owner and thus work for betterment of his company .

Therfore , the knowledge of both ideas and concept and facts are important as they are interrelated , but without facts the idea or concept do not have any significance .
