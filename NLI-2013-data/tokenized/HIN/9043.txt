Ideas concepts and facts .
they are 3 diffrent meanings altogether .
Ideas and concepts could be improvised from time to time .
Facts keep thier stance .
Ideas cannot be taught are laerned they have to be brought up by the individual themselves .
Concepts can be taught and from there can be implied on any given situation .
Facts remain as facts cannot be changed or improvised unless disproven by proof .

Students should learn both in a manner that can be used in the future .
Ideas and concepts supported by facts can make a innovation .
Agreeing with the topic saying that ideas and concepts are more important than facts are more important .
Facts can also be learned by experience , good or bad .
if learning by a good experience is good , but laerning with a bad experience could be harmful or irreversible .
When a child is told smoking is bad because is causes all sorts of cancer and other life threating dieases .
The child defies his parents and still continues the habbit and then realizeis he is too late for the change is bad .
This is a sort of fact which should be taught .

People often tell lies to escape a situation .
What they dont realize is that they tell one lie which leeds to another .
Then at the end the truth is heard out .
For saying that lie he is punished in resulting in a suspenion or a firing from work .
The fact in this is that do not lie .

in learning a concept and an idea a lot can be learnt .
when we learn something new we understand it and use it in our daily lives .
We can improvise it on using that idea on diffrent things .
