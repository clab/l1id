I support the first openion that having board knowledge of many academic subject is more important than just having specialised in one particular subjest .
here is the explaination .

First of all if u have board knowledge of many subjects you can easily understand what your university friends are discussing and you can have a feel for that and can add something in their discussion .
You will get the advantage of having interaction with many people and you will get many friends which is very necessary to keep a person happy .

Now let us move to the second point .
Now-a-days things are happening very differently .
Things are being connected and the current subjects which are evolving as challenging subjects are the combined subjects like BIOPHYSICS .
So if you want to do research in modern world you must have the knowledge of different subjects .
If a person has knowledge of different subjests he will be able to copmpetent in the field of research which is quite interesting in modern world .
He will be able to understand what is being discussed in seminars which are not of his field and will able to add his knowledge very much .

Again the advantages of having knowledge of various subjects is that is will increase general awareness of the person and will help in difficult situations .
It will give him confidence to face difficult situations .
It will creat an extra effect of the person 's personality in his colleague and society .
He will get more respect in society .
Who do n't remember LEONARDO THE VINCY ?
who is called UNIVERSAL MAN becuse he was having 16 qualities .
He was a good engineer , a good doctor , a good painter , a good mathematician and a good architecterer etc .
No body has ever born who has so many qualities .

Finally if you have board knowledge of different subjects you can guide your children in their career .
You may notice from their childhood in which subject they will prove to be good if you have knowledge of the subject .
You may help your children in the problems they face while understanding the concept .
You may provide them wider knowledge by giving link of the subject with other subject .

Finally I would say '' Do n't be a frong in a small well come out of the well and see the world .
It is very beautiful '' .
