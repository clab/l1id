I disagree to the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
This statement contrasts with the quote `` Jack of all trade master of none '' .
Not only academics this state is false for every kind of work .

I would tell my certian personal examples .
In my college I play football , cricket , weightlifting , powerlifting .
Despite of playing so many games i have not been selected till today in my any of the college teams .
When i am dropped out by the selection committee then i feel that it would have been better if i would have devoted my entire time on a single game and do mastery in that instead of playing many games .

When we talk about the world famous authors they mostly have specialisation in a single subject .
for example William shakespeare was famous for English literature , Issac Newton was famous in sciences , etc .
There are endless examples about different personalities who have achieved success by doing specialization in one specific subject .
So i would conclude this paragraph by stating that for getting renowned in your school , state , country or world you should have specialization in a specific subject unless you put in your best efforts in that .

Most of the people face unemployment because they try to put their hands and legs in many works which reduces their chances of success in that .
It is just as a person standing on two boats and trying to navigate the river .
So i would end with a famous Quote that `` Single bird in a hand is better than many birds in a bush ''
