Yes i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
because in this janration thay are so many way for enjoying thamself .
young people have so many things to use for enjoy tham self .

I think that whan the older people are playing some game with their firends but young people are playing games both type like thay are using computer game & also play with their friends .
young people have so many fasility to anjoy them self .
whan the young people have to enjoy them self than thay go for movi on multiplax , thay want to play than play on play station 3 , computergames etc.if the young jonration does't have any friend that way also enjoy alone but older people did't have any instrument or any game to play alone .
Now young people have so many way to make a friend like a surffing on a net means chatting on net to go for helth club , for sports club like so many places to make a friend or enjoy them self .

Now the world become smaller so young people are trying to make them self best for good in education thay are going for study to abroad .
young people are also trying to make themself good and important people for them self .
i will give you one simpal exam that just now i have my personal computer , personal car for tranportion me.but my father does't have their personal car to use so this type pf differants on t I am not saying that tha old people are not enjoying tham self .
oldpeople also enjoyin himself like paly with all street friends .
thay are also enjoying festivel togater and enjoy them self .

So both people are anjoying them self but as i my opinean YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOUING LIFE THAN OLDER PEOPLE DO .
