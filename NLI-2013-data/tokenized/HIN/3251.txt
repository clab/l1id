I disagree with the given statement `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
Although one may arrive to this conclusion by observing a particular group or kind of people .
However , one should remember these groups do not represent the whole of todays young generation .

I disagree with the idea because i myself have seen many instances of community work done by school and college students .
Many social work organizations accross the country constitutes of very young people .
For example in almost all institutes of excellence in higher study through out the country ( India ) , they have a credit course on social and community service namely ( National Social Services ) .
In this course students try and help their community by doing various social works in their free times .
For example teaching english to village children , educating villagers about certain diseases and hygine conditions , etc .

Also , since this statements seems to be a realtive one .
Like comparing todays younger generation with that of past .
I dont think scenario has changed a lot with time , i mean youth today are aware of their responsibilities and duties towards the community as much as their ancestors .
We can find all kinds of peoples at any given time period , Moreover , there are no conclusive evidences that section of youths working for the community have increased or reduced with time .

According to me nowadays the young crowd is more informed about its duties and responsibilities .
It is quite evident from the fact that competition is increasing in every area .
More and more people want to become something be it doctor , engineer or scientist , they all are willing to serve the community in one way or another .
The above example may be a bit confusing as , how these academic advances can be related to helping the communities .
But , in my view , a student studying engineering or medicine is surely serving the community , by providing it with doctors and engineers for the future .

To summarize , I disagree with the given statement due to lack of any given statistics and my own personal experiences .
Infact , according to my point of view the young people nowadays are more aware and responsible towards their community .
