In the era of ever changing technology , the person with specializaton in a subject and with a broad knowledge is needed .
Both specialization and broad knowledge about the subject is needed .
There are many advantages on both sides .
specializing would help the person to understand the subject in a better way , aslo he can apply his knowlege to improve the existing world .
On the other hand having a broad knowledge helps in combing his or her knowledge from various field to produce a complex product .

Consider , the person with specialization in a subject , this person would able to work on the real life problems relating to the subject and might come up with a solution .
For example , a eye specialist would know the various ways in which the eye can be treated because he is well informed about the processes as he had studied about the eye in detail .
The specialized persons can deal with the problem relating to their subject in a better way than a person having a broad knowledge .
persons with specialization can also do research and come up with a discoevry and act as pioneers

Although there are some advantages of being a specialist , having a broad knowledge is also required .
the person having a broad knowlege can choose the best suitable and available methods and integrate them to produce a product which is truly unique and complex .
For example consider a robotic student , while building a robot the student needs to know various subject like programing , mechanics and the electronic communication system .
The knowledge from the subjects is integrated in producing a robot which is combination of the subjects .

In conclusion , specialization helps the person in better understanding of subject and also enhacing the knowledege by doing research , while a person who is a jack of all trade , that is to have a broad knowlege about many subjects will have the ability to combine the knowledge from various fields to create a unique product .
so in my view both the specilazation in a subject and having a overall knowledge is need to futher our technology
