Life is a series of experiences .
These experiences start from birth till life ends .
If a series of experiences are enjoyable , we percieve that part of our life as good .
If we went through a series of bad experiences , we percieve our life to be dull & bad .
Thus , the degree of enjoyment one encounters in life is a result of the quality of the sum of series of experiences one had in a lifetime .

I disagree to the statement , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I strongly believe that the degree of enjoyment one experiences in life is dependent on various factors , the most important being one 's own mental-set .
For example : An old man woud rather be enjoying more , playing with his/her grandson than the grandson him/herself .

So , enjoyment is not based on age .
It is one 's own mind set & its ability to percieve things positively & appreciate them .
In turn it will result in an enjoyable experience .
Living life enjoyably is a skill .
It has to be learnt , either through experience or through knowledge .

The young people assume partying , going out with friends , seeing movie are the great enjoyments that they are experiencing .
But they are least exposed to the fact that these are only traces of happinees , just like bubbles on the water surface .
There are deeper , intense & more joyful moments in life .
The emotional happiness of spending lifetime with a partner is one of the deep enjoyments older people go possess .

With age comes maturity & stability to withhold happiness .
The experiences of life also provide the much wanted tolerance to older people .
This makes them a better knower of life , relationship & how to derive happiness from it .

In my opinion an older person is a better taster of different kinds of enjoyments in life .
