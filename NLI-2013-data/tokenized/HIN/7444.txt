This is a difficult topis as both travelling in a group and travelling alone has its advantages and disadvantages .
And the choice also can vary from person to person .
In my case i dont agree with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are various reasons to support my choice and these are discussed below .

Firstly in the case of taking tour in a group led by guides , there is time boundness .
The tour guides manages the time keeping in mind the whole group .
In this case i can not spend much time on the places which I really like .
If I am trevelling on my own I can visit the places of my choice .

Secondly , in the group travel the tour guides generally make the staying arrangements at the places which have better facility .
In this case you do not get a chance to interact with the local people .
When I am taking a tour I like to know the local cultures and talk to the local people. , because i think that is more fun .

Additionally i like to try the local food if i am going to some new place .
This gives me a chance to improve my knowledge about that place and the people there .
In a guide led tour there are very less chances of doing that .

Furthermore , I am a spontaneous person by nature .
I enjot thing at certain moment .
so if i am taking a tour with several other people it will not be possible to do watever I want .
And in this case i will not be able to enjoy properly and it will not be fun for me .

So in the conclusion i want to say that it actually depends upon the individual whether he likes to travel in a group led by tour guide or on his own .
