I totally agree with this point ..
that more succesful the person will be more risks or more new achievments will be given a thought .

As it is saying .
Success is not journey like Life it is destination and every body has to accept it .
Becuase nobody is perfect in this world and everybody do have a learning curve .

So , To achieve all these with success .
One has to take risk to try something new or to achieve some thing new .
Doing the same thing will not yeild profits and fame for a long time .
Being improvised in new things is also a important factor .

It can be stated with such an example .
Our Scientists were successful in making ROCKETS .
but to prove it to society and science that they works the way it should .
It should be shown practically and for showing it practically they have to take risk by sending them into space with HUMANS .
It was a big risk .
But they took the chance and also got success .

If they had thought that , using rockets will be dangerous .
They could have stopped making them and even not using them in future .

It is completely like this saying .

Winners and Successful people do n't do the same things repeatidly .
They do things differently .

and for doing it differently .
Risk has to come .

The knowledge that is engraved in people can be crafted in more suitable manner , By taking chances and imparting that previous knowledge in inventing some thing new by introducing some new ideas , facts , thinking and risk .
Because no body knows will it work for the very first time .
It may not .

So ending the part here only .
I strongly supports and agree to the point .
that Successful people try new things by taking risk .
Not believing on fact that the Knowledge they have is more than enough because again NO ONE IS PERFECT and EVERYBODY have a LERANING CURVE .
