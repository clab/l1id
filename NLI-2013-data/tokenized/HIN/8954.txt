I strongly agree to the statement that for students ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .
The following essay will illustrate this and explain why it is so .

Ideas come from the creativity with in aperson .
A person who has the capability to develop an idea of its own can do anything .
He/she can produce many facts from the ideas .
Ideas acts as the source of many inovations .
Thus a person with great idea will never be dependent on facts but will always create things on his/her own .

Concepts also play very important role in the process of learning .
To work in any field one has to learn the basics of that field .
It is a very simple statement but it stands quite good .
In any institution a student should invest most of his/her time in learning the basics and the concepts of a particular field .
A person with a strong base of knowledge can bring in astonishing chages in his/her field of study .

In our histtory if we have seen that great inventions , either by Newton or an unknown scientist , always had a stong backup of in-depth knowledge of the field .
If we see the paintings of Leonardo Do Vinci , those are based on the ideas and imaginations which he had and on which he had given remarkable belongings to the world .

Although , a small connsideration goes sometime to facts as it helps in strenthening ones ideas which has been developed by using the concepts of the field .
But ultimately its your own originality which can bring flying colours .

In the end I would conclude that ideas and concepts are more important than the learning the fact .
So students should concentrate more on getting the concepts and enhancing thier ideas rather than memorizing the facts .
