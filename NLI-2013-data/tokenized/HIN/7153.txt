i agree with the presumption that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
There are various reasons for this , having to do with the pollotion caused by cars , the diminishing space in our cities and the convinience of the public transport system .

Cars are fun and exiting to drive , they provide a fast and convenient way to get from place A to B. They are also getting more and more powerful with each passing day , with companies coming out with 1000 bhp cars .
these cars consume a lot of fuel and our resources are limited .
it will not be long before we run out of natural oil reserves .
also , due to the scarcity , the price of gas has increased twofold over the past 10 years ( in India ) .
For the common man , it is becoming infeasable to use a car everyday .
He is going to have to find some other way to commute , the car is just not a viable option anymore .

The other reason is that there is just not enough space in our cities amymore , for every house to have a car is sheer waste of resuorces .
there are so many people living n such a small space that there is no room to park the cars , same is the case in markets and roads .
The number of traffic jams and snarls is a clear indication of how there are too many cars choking up the roads , and people are waking up to this fact .
many people have started car-pooling which is better as there is lesser wastage of resources like gas and space and also , lesser pollution .

The third reason why i think that tere will be lesser number of cars in 20 years is that the public transport system is catching up in a big way .
With the introduction of the metro and clean CNG buses , the majority of the public has found a safe , cheap mode of transport , thereby questioning the necessity of cars .

There will always be car enthusiasts who will never give up driving cars , but for the majority of the public , these reasons , and more are convincing factors to switch to other modes of transport and to economize , by car pooling and other ways .
In conclusion , i do agree with the sattefor the reasons stated .
