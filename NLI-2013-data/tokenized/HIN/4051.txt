I do agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give eneough time to help the community .
But i also support the youngs by saying that in today 's schedule they have a lot of other activities which keep them very engaged , be it academics , work , sports or even the responsbility of supporting their tution fee .

In today 's time there is actually a lot of pressure to perform well and stay ahead be it at sports of studies or even extra curriculars .
One has to stay ahead hence it is abvious that the time for helping the coommunity could be curtailed by them .
Spending time in the community could actually be distracting for them and might start affecting their projects of education or sports adversely .
At this point of time it is more important for them to maintain a good record in college and their work place to extract long term benefits and lead a comforable life .

Moreover the community has a lot of people to be taken care of by .
There are so many men & women who have kind of dedicated all their life or at least whatever time their schedule permits to engage themselves in community works and see whats to be done to maintain its standards .
So when we already have poeple volunteering , why should the youngs also be forcibily brought in to it .

I dont say that one should never be engaged in community work at any point of time , .l After finishing ones eductaion , having reached a certain position at one 's workplace , its always worthy of being actively associated with the community and community works .
Moreover after a certain age one gains enough experience to sort the matters better and in a more appropriate and constructive manner , which could prove to be actually more beneficial to the community and the society as a whole than some youngsters or amateurs working at it .
