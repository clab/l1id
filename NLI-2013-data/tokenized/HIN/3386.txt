I agree with the statement that the young people nowadays donot give enough time to helping their communities .

The young generation nowadays in more and more engrossed in their own world of cut-throat-competition than pondering about the problems faced by their communities , let alone work to solve them .
For Example - According to a recent survey the young generation , theGen Y ( those born in the eighties ) spend most of their spare time on the computer playing games than interacting with the people near them , and thus shutting out the avenues for even knowing the problems faced by the community .

The community is itself somewhat responsible for this , by weighing success of an individual in terms of personal wealth , not on the selfless work that a person does for the community .
The emphasis given on the rankings of the `` Richest persons '' of the world , stands testimony to this fact .
Thus the young generation is more and more involved in making money in this rat race and spending lesser time trying to solve the problems faced by the society .

The media might be in part responsible for this , as is evident from the interest in publishing the un-necessary crap like the celebrity gossip , than to highlight the problems of the community , and sensitizing the young generation about it .
The news papers and magazines that we read these days stand testimony to this .

Another fact that contributes to the problem is political turmoil .
Political turmoil causes increasing inflation .
With the inflation on the rise every year , the people have to work more and more for satisfying the same needs as compared to the previous years , and hence are left with lesser free time to deal with the problems faced by the community .
