Knowledge in any form is welcome be it in depth or breadth .
For the development of a society both types of people are required , those who have in-depth understanding of a particular subject and those who have a generic understanding of many subjects .
In my field of consulting it is important for me to have a broader understanding of businesses rather than focus on any one .
Therefore the pattern of knowledge would primarily depend on a person profession and futrure aspirations .
I support the statement that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects are required , but even specialists are necessary .

There is no-doubt that specialization in subjects leads to further development of technologies and theories which help the society at large .
For example the invention of various kinds of vaccines were done by eminent researchers and scientists .
However , research alone does n't guarantee the success of an invention , it was a collaborative effort of businessmen who funded this research and made sure common man has access to it .
So it is not only specialists but also generalists that we require , who have a bigger outlook and can co-relate things .

But again it is the job of a person that should decide the apttern of his knowlege .
For example if the aspiration of the individual is to become a professor or researcher , then surely an in-depth understanding of the subject is indespensable .
Which would require him to focus on a particular subject .
On the other hand , if the person is a journalist or a politician , a broader perspective of society is requred , to perform well in their jobs .

On conclusion , I would like to add that both forms of studies are important .
Generalists and specialists both are required for the development of the society .
