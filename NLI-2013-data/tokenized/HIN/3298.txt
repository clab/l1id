Today 's youth is a dynamic one , everything is instantaneous and at a rapid pace .
As much as I agree with the amount of work load the people of today 's generation have , I still feel that the young people nowadays are not doing enough for the betterment of their community .

People especially young people complain about the problems faced by them in their cities such as traffic , corruption , crimes etc .
But rarely is there a person among them who is ready to jump into the system and take steps in solving the problems .
In my opinion if you do not have the capability to stand up and take the matter into your own hands , you should quit whining and live with what you have .

The youth nowadays does not understantd its responsibility towards its community .
They maintain a very laid back attitude , caring slightly about the problems faced by the community .
It is the young people who should step up and take control of a problematic situation , as it is they who are brimming with energy , have fresh ideas and will be responsible for the future of their community .
For e.g. in a country like India where the average age of a political leader is not less than sixty years corruption is rampant but none of the youngsters feel the need to join politics and improve the condition , they feel that joining politics would mean a waste of their academic degree .

For today 's youth helping the community is a very unimportant thing , for them their personal success comes first .
They are very self-centered and selfish and would rarely waste their time and energy on a project for the betterment of the community .
They seek personal advantage first hand .

Seldom after a natural disaster or calamity do we see the young people helping the affected people .
It is always the older people helping themselves or the young school going children collecting funds .
In such conditions it is the youth of the community that should step up and bring back the much needed stability .
Whereas instead of helping in disturbed conditions today 's youth does not bat an eyelid about it .
They feel it is a waste of their precious time .

An ideal example of a responsible youth would be Bhagat Singh a revolutionary of India 's freedom struggle who fought and even sacrificed his life for the freedom of his nation .

I think that today 's youth should follow in the steps of the great Bhagat Singh and realise their duties towards their community , and also take whatever steps necessary in improving their community .
