The youth of a coummuniy it is said is its very pulse .
How true this belief is in the modern day context is what remains to be examined .

With every passing century in the history of the human race its youth has become increasingly empowered , alert and certainly more aggressive in numerous ways .
As part of this section of the communiy I can safely afford to voice some of its concerns and predicaments .

While it is true that the young people of today have different priorities and expectations from themselves which often leads to a self absorbed style of living , it would be unfair to say that they are any less sensitive to the needs of their communities than they were in the last few generations .
Nor can it be said that they are unaware of their responsibilities that they owe to fellow human beings .
In fact the young people of our times are more inclined towards community service and other volunteer work than people belonging to older generations were .

A classic example is that of Bombay city , the financial capital of India whose youth came forward to help the administration in the post 7/11 blasts period and on another occasion when it was severely hit by relentless flooding .
Students , professionals and every kind could be seen not just helping clear the debris but also in managing the insanely difficult traffic in the thick of floods and disease that had devoured the city 's prosperity in a matter of days .

The entire nation watched on their television screens the moral strength and commitment that the youth of this organic city so selflessly displayed in times of a national crisis .

This however is not where it ends .
Contrary to popular and convenient belief the youth of today , across the world is better prepared and more committed to tackle to problems of the human community than they ever have been .
