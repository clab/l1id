I do not completely agree with the statement that in twenty years of time there will be fewer cars in use as compared to the present .
The present time is marked with great developments in the technology of cars .
There is huge compettition in the market where industries are striving to design and manufacture more and more sophisticated and advanced machines .
Highly innovative and modern features are consistently being added to the older models in order to attract customers .

There is a plethora of cars that require only their brand name to sound `` big '' and thus maintain their superior postion in the market like the `` mercedeez benz '' or the `` limousine '' which are owned by only the very affluent class .

Therefore , at the time when the market of a product is at such a high and when further advancements have been promised by numerous companies in this field , twenty years is too small a period of time to mark a decrease in the use of cars .

Though in wealthy countries , cars may not be a very expensive luxury to own , there are countries where people still save money with a dream to own a car one day which would make family trips and outings more convenient and enjoyable .

Children aspire to have a car of their own with numerous features .
The younger generation still craves for fancy models , racing cars , and other expensive brands .
So there is no reason which can accont for and explain a decrease in the use of a cars in the near future .
This might be a posiibility for more distant future when fossil fuels start to show a marked decrease , but then the future might be embracing Solar cars and cars driven by other non-conservative sources of energy .

Today , when cars have become a household item , and when it becomes difficult to imagine of a whole day without having a car .
It becomes difficult to pass even a single day away from your car when it may be having its share of time with the mechanic , and you feel handicapped .

It has become a necessity today because of the conveniances it adds to our life .
More and more companies are intoducing attractive and alluring models into the market .
A fall in such a prospective and lucrative market in recent future has not enough grounds .
