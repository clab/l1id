In my opnion , the number of cars that are in use today will not be reduced in the next twenty years .
In fact , I feel the number of cars will increase in the coming years .
I agree with the statment because of some valid reasons which are stated below .

Firstly , if we look at other modes of transportation available to general public , there is no other mode of transportaion which is so much comfortable and independent .
One can finsh so many daily activities and save time by having a car .
Travelling by train is not an easy task during peak office hours and if one is little late to the railway station , he or she misses the train and has no other option than to wait for sometime to catch another train .
This has so many other implciations on that persons daily routine .

Secondly , the price of cars are going down daily .
This has made cars easily accessible to the middle class family also .
They can plane to a get a small car which fits there budgets and satisfy there daily needs .
For example , a four seater car in indian market is available for 2 lakhs , which is very less as compared to the price of the same car few years back .

Thridly , there are many activities in daily life which have been directly related to cars .
For example , imaging a person going on a date for the first time .
These couple will not prefer to go in a public bus .
They will prefer to go in the car .
Other example can be , normal mode of transortation all not accessible at all the places .
So , in order to reach some remote places , one has no other option then to go by car .
There many other activities like going for a dinner with family , which can be easliy managed by having a car .

There are some major issues because of increasing number of cars on the roads .
One of them is increase in pollution level in the atmosphere .
This can lead to so many injurious diseases like lung cancer .
But I feel , govertment can plan some other ways to check and control the pollution level .
In my view this can be checked by making laws related to vehicle pollution more strict and punishable .

So , in my opnion the use of cars will increase in the coming years because in present world having a car is not a luxory but a neccessity .
