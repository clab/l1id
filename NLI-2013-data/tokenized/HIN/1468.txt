There is a famous English proverb that illustrates the scope of this topic , it reads : `` He is a jack of all trades , ...
but a master of none . ''
What this proverb essentially implies is that it is not possible to attain mastery in several fields , one can only specialize in one .
The statement of the issue being discussed epitomizes a very paradoxical situation that we as human beings encounter throughout the course of our life i.e the path of mastery or the path of overall education .

It is often as a child you are asked the question : `` What do you want to be when you grow up ? ''
.
The child being ambitious and idealistic at the phase of his life would base his reply on his passion for a particular subject .
Well , it is true that most well educated human beings eventually settle down to choose a particular career based on their academic strength and prowess .
When pusuing a higher education we are made to choose a subject that we wish to major in and probably the subject that will encompass our career in the future .
We are forced to academically pusue a mastery in a particular field of life as this field shall play a vital role in determining our future , our social strength and our monetary power .
It will help in determining what we will be in the future of the socio-economic struggle among us , which evidently has become an essential part of our survival .
It is a fact , we need to attain mastery to build our success , we need to excel at something to prove our ability thus developing specialization in a particular axcademic subject is essential .

There is however , a counter-claim to this argument , a claim which defines the power of a well rounded , overall education .
Possessing a fundamental and broad knowledge in every walk of life and having an opinion on all matters .
A person who follows this ideal is a person whom i would define as a `` Jack of all trades '' .

Through my arguments I do not undermine the power of a well rounded academic back ground , what im trying to imply is that education is what is inculcated at the grass root levels .
Acquiring a broad knowledge of various academic fields is covered at the elementary and sub-secondary levels of education .
It is after this stage , that a human being has metamorphosized from this phase of his life into a phase which is ready for mastery , he is in a position to choose .
The options are always open in life , but it is our duty to choose and master the option that we most strongly believe in .
This is a trait that will help us stand out as the masters of our field and give us purpose in life .
We were born to make a difference in this world and by attaining mastery in one field of academia we can fulfill our duty to ourselves and humanity .
