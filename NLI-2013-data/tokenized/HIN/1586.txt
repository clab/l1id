The statement advocates that having broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects is better than having specilization on one .
However , in my opininon , the question can not have a binary answer .

There could be situation when a broad knowledge of all concerned subjects is really needed .
On the other hand , in some cases specilization os more important .

In some case , one might just need particular skillset and other skills might not be of much use .
For example , an MBA student who is aming to become an investment banker need not be strong in all the management subjects , but he/she really need to be specialized in fiannce .

On the other hand , sometimes job requires a good overall understanding of all related topics .
continuing on the last example , if the same MBA student want to be a genral manager in a firm , he/she should have a broad knowledge of all the management practices and subjects .
In this case , specilization can not be of much use .

There could be cases when secilization is needed ` on demand ' .
Once one might be working in some area , and sfter some time he/she might need other skills .
In such case one need to have good knowledge of all related subjects .
With a solid foundation like this , one can gain specilized skills easily if needed and this wopuld not require seperate acadmic specilization .
For example ,

So , in my opinion , while one must have some knowledge of all the concerned area he/she is supposed to work on , whether specilization is required depends on specific case .
Sometimes , its better to be master of one , while sometimes being jack of all trades might be more useful .
