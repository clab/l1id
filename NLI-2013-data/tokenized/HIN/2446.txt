I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Because young people can do many things which they want .
Young people play many games which older people cant do .
Young people rome every where but older people cant because according to their age their stamina will be decreased .
Young people have much stamina to do everything .

The thinking of young people goes with the present generation which older person cant do .
For example a young person know much about computer and new softwares .
But older people they dont know and they dont need also .
A young person can play games to be healthy but a older person , they have to do exercise to be healthy because they cant play all games against the youth .
As a people goes old , they behave vey matured .
Young person behaves as a child sometimes .

Young people can enjoy the new technologies and new things in the market .
They can get all advantages and make easier all works .
Older person cant enjoy with that new technology or science because they have over come with many things in their lives .
Young people go to college , office , parties where they can entertain themselves in many ways .
But older people cant .
Because they have already enjoyed their life .

Young people dont have any responsibilty and stress of family .
Older people have responsibility and stress with ahich they cant enjoy .
They did n't get time after all responsibilities to enjoy .
And one thing what older people can do young people cant do .
Once in my life i struck in a position that i was not able to solve that problem .
That time my grand father handle with that problem and solved .
It clearly tell that young people enjoy life when older people take care of them .

Young people walk with the present life , fashion , styles .
Young people enjoy walking with the generation .
Older people are simple and make generetion to walk properly .
