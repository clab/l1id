A broad knowledge of many academic subjects would provide breadth of knowledge .
As against this , specialization in one specific subject would provide depth of knowledge .
In my opinion , a person should obtain a broad knowledge of many academic subjects while pursuing undergraduate studies and must specialize in one specific subject while pursuing post graduate studies .

Undergraduate studies are generally undertaken by students in the formative years of their life .
If at this crucial juncture , a student is not given an opportunity to explore a variety of areas , his learning process may be stinted .
If a student is encouraged to study many academic subjects , he will be able to decide his area of interest .
Further , he will understand the interdependence and interrelatedness of different academic subjects .
Pursuing many academic subjects would help the student to obtain a functional knowledge in all the subjects he studies .
Such a strategy would prove to be useful as the student will have flexibility of choice , when it comes to choosing his subject of specialisation .
For example if a student is pursuing graduation in finance , by studying banking , corporate finance and equity research , he will get a functional knowledge of all the areas in finance .
He may choose courses in banking or equity research while pursuing his post graduate studies .

Post graduate studies are undertaken by students who have completed their graduate courses .
Post graduate studies equip a student with specific skills that the student will need , when he seeks employment .
A person cannot be `` A jack of all trades , but a master of none '' .
Hence it is advisable for a student to choose one specific subject of his liking and specialize in it .
This would help him acquire expertise and mastery over one specific subject .
If a student were to study only one course in his undergraduate studies , say for example corporate finance , he may not be able to understand the effect of banking on corporate finance .
On the contrary , if the student has dwelved in corporate finance and banking in his undergraduate studies , he will be able to correlate the impact that banking has on corporate finance .

Thus , in my opinion , a person should follow an approach , whereby broad knowledge of many academic subjects is obtained in undergraduate studies and expert knowledge in one specific subject is obtained in post graduate studies .
