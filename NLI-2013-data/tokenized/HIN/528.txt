` Do good and do it well ' .
I firmly believe in this adage .
I believe that an accomplishment in one academic subject can win laurels to an individual rather than basking in the false'glory ' of being the ` jack of all trades ' .

According to me even if a person has has a broad knowledge rof many academic subjects , it is of no good .
Scientifically , the human mind can register information only to a certain extent .
When the information is of diverse nature and quantity , the brain tends to faulter , hence creating chaos in the mind of the individual .
This has an obvious impact-inadequate , misleading and incomplete information .
Besides the personal loss , it has a profound impact on the people around the individual .
The people grasp the so - called ` information ' , which is of no good to them , ultimately leading to incoherence in their minds too .
This leads to a cumulative multiplication of misleading facts .
It is analogous to an attempt to sail on two boats simultaneously .
Hence broad knowledge is not concise , not informative and at times misleading .
It neither educates nor enlightens , infact it causes destruction in the long run .

On the other hand , having specific , detailed knowledge regarding a subject not only satiates the individual , it is advantageous in the long run too .
Detailed knowledge regarding one subject leads to enhancement of personal skills .
It fosters the individual with self confidence .
Specialisation enables a person to put his knowledge to practical use .
For instance , a scientist can carry out research on an issue only when he is well informed regarding the issue .
At that instant it his detailed knowledge regarding that subject which counts .
If people did not have specific knowledge , innumerous mysteries would have remained unfolded .
As a famous adage says , ` too many cooks , spoil the broth ' according to me , too many thoughts in the mind can also produce disastrous effects .
We cannot expect an individual to be painter , historian and a scientist at the same time ; rather we better not .
Specialisation takes into account , scope for further improvement as well as further strenghtening of skills .

So ultimately , its better to stick to one subject rather than misguiding yourself and the others by unneccesarily trying to gain knowledge
