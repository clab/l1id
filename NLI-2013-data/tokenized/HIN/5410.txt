Advertisements , The Truth or False Exaggerations

Nowadays advertisements make products seem perfect and without any flaws .
But do these advertiements actually show the product 's true quality and worth ?

Recently I saw an andvertisement of a soap product that said that the soap would kill millions more bacteria and germs as compared to other soap products when used .
It stated that it contains certain chemicals , which had long and very `` flashy '' names .
Howewer this was not an exact detail , as even sunlight can destroy millions of germs and bacteria .
Later out of curiosity I checked the ingredients on the wrapper , And I saw that the ingredients were actually the same in almost every soap product of the similar type .
Another example is present within a soft drink company in India .
Several official reports stated that the product contained alarmingly high levels of pesticides , while the company continued to broadcast an advertisement which said that the drink had 0 % pesticides and was perfectly safe for human consumption .

Another advertisement was once brodcasted about a stock market fund .
It stated almost nothing about the risks involved in the investment , but only a very fine print at the bottom saying `` this investment is subject to market risks , please read the offer document carefully before investing '' .
The only thing it showed was celebrities saying that they would invest in the fund as they felt it right .

This is only a few of of many examples that a lot of people experience .
The truth is that the producers or the advertising Co. only want their product to be sold , irrespective of the truth about the product

Howewer this does no mean that all advertisements lie about their products .
Certain advertisements not only state the plus points about their products , but also the negative things , such as side effects , risks etc .

To conclude it can be said that , in the end it only depends on the consumer 's judgement to choose the product wisely and not fall for the exaggerations made by advertisements .
