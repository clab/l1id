In present scenario of diversification of knowledge as well as introduction of new subject everyday , it is a matter of great concern among people of academic fraternity that to which subject they should concentrate upon .
Whether it is better to have a diversified knowledge or to have a specialization in a particular subject .
It is a very arguable matter .
Before rendering my opinion let 's analyse the possible pros and cons .

Being specialist in one subject does n't mean that the person is not able to learn other subject .
It has been proved time and again by different great people in history that , a person may have equal mastry over two subjects of opposite nature .
I would like to present example of the great Leonardo The vincii who is a scientist , sculpturist , painter , philosopher and many thing more , at the same time .
Now a days invention of computer has made life much easier and knowledge easy to access .
With the help of computer and setellite technolgy we can save our time much and devout it over other minor subjects also .
Also in research area the demarcation between subjects is on the verge of extinction .
For example the cappilary rise equation in Physics is given by a scientist from medical stream .

In my opinion a person should have to diversify himself in multiple dimension as much as possible .

However as english proverb goes `` a coin has two faces '' , persons having opposite opinion may have some reasonable grounds .
But in my opinion pros overweigh the cons .
A person should be multideciplinary genious rather than specialist in one subject .
