It would be logical to think that as population increases , the number of vehicles on the roads would also increase as there exists a correlation between the two of these variables .
For example , the number of cars on the roads has definitely increased since the last twenty years .
Why has this been ?

Firstly , its because the number of people who can use the cars has increased .
Secondly , the technological advancements have brought about a reduction in prices of the average car as such .

So , if we go by the above reasoning , it should also hold good if we assumed that a similar trend will be observed in the coming twenty years .
However , a question to evaluate the above assumption would be : Is this growth scalable and sustainable ?
It is a known fact that pollution levels in the atmosphere are increasing and a major component of the pollutants come from the cars ' exhaust pipes .
There has to be an obvious drive to cut down on pollution and one way that could be adopted in the future will be to reduce the number of cars on the road .

The second obstacle to increasing the number of cars in the future will be the space crunch .
If the number of cars on roads keep increasing at the rate which it is now , the roads and the parking lots would not be sufficient to accommodate the cars .
In fact , an occurence in Japan is a testament to the above statement .
There are zones in Tokyo , the capital of Japan , where privately owned vehicles are not allowed to ply because of the space crunch and only vehicles like buses , or car pools which can accommodate many people at once are permitted on road .
In this case , the number of vehicles on the road has in fact reduced in Tokyo .

Hence , I would say that the number of cars on the roads will increase in the next few ( 5-10 ) years , with all the advancements in technology and the incraesing purchasing power of the consumers .
However , I also believe that because we are bound to hit the ceiling with respect to space avilability for the cars and the pollution caused , I do not think that the increment in the number of cars can be sustained over a two-decade period .

To conclude , I agree with the statement that in twenty years , the number of cars in use will be fewer than there are today .
