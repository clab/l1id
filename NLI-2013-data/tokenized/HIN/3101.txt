some people could have different opinions .
but as far as i am concerned , `` young people enjoy more than older people do '' . there are some reason behind this philosophy .
which would better explain it .

first , people who are young are comparatively more healthy and spirited then older one .
so , when it is talk about the enjoyment people usually enjoy more one they have no any health problem to consider .
for example , older person 's generally have problem of heart , lungs and other , in comparsion to younger one 's .
so , here spirit about enjoyment get low .
that 's turn in gloomyness .

second , in certain cases , enjoyment is assumed as adventure .
so , it can be co-related with the life risks .
and as it can be perceived that older man have more fear about the death , cause they lie at the edge of the life span , in contrary to younger one , who had longer life time .
it can be inferred that , due to the fear of death , they have less diversion towards enjoyment .

third , one can consider the point of responsibility .
that is , young people have generally less responsibility then older and the fact is also that they are less serious about there responsibilties .
so , here change in attitude occured betwwen them .
as older people are more awared about there obligations .
since , this could be a possible reason about there less fun in comparsion to young people .

at last , it can be considered that are several reasons behind this scenario , that younger have more enjoying life than older people .
whether , it could be the reason of better spirit level , less fear of death , or it could be possibly about responsibility .
so , these can easily support my opinion .
