It is said that the only thing which does not change , is the change itself .
With the passage of time everybody has to change .
Change is consider to be natural phenomonen .
For example , a new born baby is changed to a boy , then into an adult and finally into a old man .

Therefore , i agree that `` successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .

It can be observed that the organisation which did not change with the changing time got out of the business in no time .
Take the example of the pager compnies .
They did not anticipated the change in technology and had to perish .
It is important to do what you really know how to do well , but it should be taken care off wether or not that particular thing hold relevence to you or your organisation anymore .
One of the example here can be of IBM , which recently sold off its computer division to Lenovo , a chinese company , because it realisede that its main area of concern is the business solutions .
The acceptence of this change can be gauged from the fact that in the year 2006 , the mergers and aquisitions to diversify the business and to explore new ares were to the tune of 4 trillion US dollers worldwide .

One of the main reason why people are afraid of trying new things is the fear of failure , But that fear should be put behind if a person or a company wants to grow .
One of the Indian example to me mind relating this is of Bajaj Automobile Limited .
( A two weeler manufacturing company in India ) .
Bajaj was known for his scooters for quiet a long time .
My father used to tell me that there were hage queues of the customers to buy a bajaj scooter .
But latley bajaj realised that mobikes is the new buzz word of the Indian market and imideately directed its focus to manufacture motercycles and launched Pulsar , which is a huge success in the Indian market .

Finally i would like to conclude by saying that it is hard to change because there is a lot of risk attached to it but it is
