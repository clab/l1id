I agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I agree with the statement because in this competitive world of today one has to really master his skills in a wide variety of subjects rather to specialize in one subject .
In this modern world the technology has so much advanced that without having a broad knowledge about a variety of subjects a person cannot becom successful .
Having a knowledge about a variety of subjects not only improve his intellectual power of thinking but will also improve his effficiency at work .
A person cannot succeed in his work if he does n't have thorough knowledge of his subjects .
For example , medical field has become so advanced and has introduced so many latest techniques that without thier thorough knowledge it would n't be possible to even operate a machine .
A simple example of such machine is MRI which is also known as the Magnetic Resonance Imaging .
Its basically consist of two parts one the hard ware part and the other is the software part .
Hardware part consists of all the mechanical systems including the couch and magnets and the software part consists of the computer system where imaces of the different parts of the body are acquired and saved for further evalution .
Now the hardware part is based on the engineering perspective and a requires a person to have a thorogh knowledge of it to operate the machine and should know the function of each part .
On the other hand software part requires a thorough knowledge of different softwares like the different languages used in the compiter then he should also be able to study the images .
So , in order perform any tast seuccesfully person shuold have a broad knowdledgwe of all the subjects rather than one
