I believe that both thsese points are important at certain level of study .
If a person is going through his postgraduation or PHD studies .
he should be more specific towards his subject and intrerest .
While during undergraduation studies , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academics subject .

While studying in undergraduate program , we should have knowledge of many academic subjects .
It helps us to immply that knowledge in our specialization subject .
I have completed my Bpharm .
In this under graduate program I studied all the subjects like Pharmaceutical analysis , pharmaceutics , pharmacology and biopharmaceutics .
Now I am planning to do my masters in pharmaceutics subject .
And these other subjects will help me in any instance .
because basically they all are related with research .
Pharmaceutics is related with new drug research but pharmacology deals with the effect of the drugs on human body .
So there is one kind of interdepandability present between other subjects and specialized subject .

Now if we think about masters and PHD program .
it is neccesary to choose one specific subject .
It is better to gain deep knowledge in specific subject if your aim is towards research and developement .
Without the depth knowledge of subject , It is not possible to make our carrier in research .
At this level of study we are given special training for work .
If we take the example of doctors .
The only doctors and surgeons with the masters degree in chemotherapy can cure the patient from cancer , which is not possible for the general practitioner .
Doctors with specialization in anesthesia in medical field has decreased the death and and coma cases , which used to occure due to improper introduction of anesthesia .
If we take another example of proffesors .
The proffesor in history subject cant give knowledge about the mathemics subject .

so I believe that the both kind of knowledge is required at different level of studies .
Both have important at different level of studies .
