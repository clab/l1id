Man 's pursuit of technology has brought him in today 's world where everything designed and made by him gives an affirmation to the dreams he had sought for , the dream to live happily and comfortably .
In the light of that dream , and various cogent reasons , I disapprove of the statement mentioned in the topic .
We are certainly going to have more cars in use in twenty years from now , as we have now .

The question put up in the topic may be valid on two counts .
Firstly , becasue of the depletion of oil in earth 's reserves , fuel 's shortage could be a driving force of reduction in number of cars .
Secondly , the alarming rate at which the pollution is increasing may amount to a strict ban on the cars that emit harmful gases .
But both these reasons fail to assess the parameters completely they seek to build their case on .
The argument against these points is alternatives .

Neo-Malthusian economists beleived that increased use of natural resources will tend to increase their costs with time .
However , the famous Simon-Elrich wager in 1980 toppled that theory .
While Elrich said that prices of five natural resources ( which they selected ) is bound to decrease in ten years , Simon placed a bet that it would reduce .
The prices actually suffered a decline !
The simple reason is alternatives .
As society 's needs grow and resources fall short , various alternatives come up and keep the momentum alive .
In the similar vein , we can expect the cars running on alternative fuels rather than petroleum .
Billions of dollars , today , are spent on research on alternative sources of energy .
We even have countless cities where use of CNG ( compressed natural gas ) has replaced petrol as the fuel .
The advancements in technology are sure to pave way for the solar cars in future .
All this will experience a rise in the number of cars .

The same alternative fuels act as harmless substances to the atmpsphere , and amount to a reduction in the pollution .
It is imperative to mention here , that apportioned study of the air sample has suggested that most of the cities , the air pollution is caused more by the factories than by automobiles .
With the Kyoto Protocol in place , the countries have now decided and taken firm steps to curb pollution , not necessarily by removing vehicles plying on the roads , but by ensuring that they conform to the Euro III , Euro IV standards , and also checking the constituents of exhausts from factories .
With possibilities of more ore countries joining the Protocol , cars remain invulnerable .

The past also corroborates the fact that cars will increase .
The question of reduction in their number is not new , and even earlier , skeptics shared this viewpoint .
But data suggests that countries , especially after the globalisation and liberalisation , have suffered a dramatic rise in the number of cars in past few years , and researchers have predicted that because the purchasing power abilities of people in most countries is steadily increasing , production of cars is not going to cease .

The space is also not a problem .
With the advent of newer mechanisms of building high rise buildings with parkings at the basements and also the construction of various flyovers on top of the other , assures that man is ever thinking and persevering individual , who works hard and keeps his inventions alive .

The rise in the love for automobiles , whether in the form of Formula 1 racing or automobile engineering , constantly over the years , is going to ensure that new cars with newer designs and comfort levels continue plying in the streets .
When we live in the information superhighway , transportation remains crucial point of improvisation .
In this view , if we need to pace ourselves with the fast moving world , we need to save time and act modern .
Giving arguments against the technological developments that eare impending is belittling our own selves .
We must look at the bright side of the picture .
The cars today , have impregnated into the very social fabric of people , and it has become inalienable part of their lives .
Separation of cars from humanity is very difficult , given the fact that it has become a necessity rather than just an accessory .
Coming time will witness a surge in the number of cars , whose concept , design and power will outweigh the ones that we have today .
