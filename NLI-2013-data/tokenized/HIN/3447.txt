I disagree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier communities '' .
I personally give alot of time to take care of my community and ensure the well being of everyone in it .

I live in a community that has around one hundred families that live together in a society .
In my community all the children get together every friday and make sure that the society is kept clean and ensure that all the facilities are operational and the elder children also teach the younger children various sports and help them with thier school work .
Every alternate sundays the elder children of the community meet and spend time with the old people of the community , they involve them selves in activities such as chess and take the old people for walks and talk to them and ask them how their week was , the old people enjoy this attention very much and in the bargain the elder children learn alot .

I myself am involed in many social activities in the community and an active member in the board of the society , while growing up i have always been told to be a part of the place you live in since this increases your social skills and you get to make friends .
Apart from my own community i have also noticed in the other areas where my friends live that the younger generation is very involved in activities in the community and are very close to all the people that reside in it .
At schools children are taught to be a part of thier community and it is also compulsary in some countries to have completed a certain number of hours of community service to graduate , because of this many students are involving them selves in thier communities .

From what i have experienced and seen i personly think that young people are making a great effort to help their communities and are also benefitting from it .
