I agree with the opinion thjat young prople og today 's world are not that inclined towards community services as was the scenario some decades ago .
Multifarious factors might have contributed in this gradual change of attitude .
Factors worth listing include social and political ones .

Young people theses days are more career oriented .
The jobs of today 's hustling world consumes most of their time .
Little is the time they are left with .
Imagine an employee at some multinational company who has to work day in and day out to survive his post .
The stresses and tensions involved and the immense competition at his work place make it almost impossible to get some spare time for himself .
And that spare time too has to be divided judicially among family matters , recreation and the list will continue .
Still , there are people who , inspite of all these offsets , try to contribute as much as they can for community services .
But , this is for sure a limiting factor that discourages one to get involved with social services .

Another fact that might be propounded here , is that over the years there is a gradual chane in the thinking and psycholgical make-up of the society as a whole .
For example , a young aspirant who wishes to pay an equal importance to his work , his recreation , his community service , his family , might be let down by his peers who do n't think these ideals fit enough in the modern world .
It can be alet down , however , it depends on one 's discretion only what to follow then .

Various organisations have come up all over the world that cater to needs of society .
It is true that it is difficult for these organisations to attract young people .
Rarely do they find individuals who want to work selflessly expecting no exorbitant rewards .
The younger generation has many alternatives before it to consider for its livelihood in the developing world of today .
The lack of lucre in this field might also be a factor discouraging the younger lot to enter in community services .
