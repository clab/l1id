Well i m not in favor with the statment given aside .
As we know that for gracping or for understanding any kind of topic , we should rather must go through the both phases of study .
namely first one theoritical phase and second one is practical phase .
In school level student only follow the way that they had been describe in books means they only aware with theoritical aspects of topic .
i believe that text books are main media or way to providing thorough knowledege about concepts and aspects .
But it is failuer to teach practical aspects of the perticular topic .

Students can understand the ideas or concepts of any field by merely reading the topic in textbooks or by learning it in to classroom .
so i think such student dose not have ability to explain or to demonstrate the concepts or in other way they dose not understand the fundamental principals behind the topic .
while mere reading and understanding topic helps in assuming percpetivness of topic .
although only reading dose not satisfy the requirements of best student , while he must go through second phase of study .
if the student have clear theoritical concept of any specific topic then he or she can work or handel the problems related practically .
for example one chemical engineer student have only school degree while othe have therotical base with experinced in that field .
then in such case most of the chemical companies will hire the experienced student as he has better knowledge than inexperienced student .
becose company alwayes looking for those persons who have peculiar charcteristics of both theoritical and practical sense .

By learning actual facts or getting practical training he will feel more satiate .
as once in trainee period he has creates his ability to find the economically and ecofriendly solutions to the problems .

Thus finally i believe that it not only essential to understand the facts about any gernarl topic by reading or listing but also it will also flourish with actual practice on the field in kind of field .
