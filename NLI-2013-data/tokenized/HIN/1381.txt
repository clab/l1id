The statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one subject is an controversial one and I would describe the reasons why .
The statement actually begs the question and is an overstatement at best .
One must have a stronghold over one subject , and not just ` broad knowledge ' and additionally , one should be aware of the happenings in other streams .

The speaker 's claim that one must have information of many subjects is problemetic at best .
The speaker fails to give a number for ` many ' here .
However , I believe that any sincere student must have information over related subjects .
For example , a student of food technology must be an informd student of biology , chemistry , biochemistry and engineering too .
But his core stream will be food technology and its related subjects .
Thus , the speaker 's claim of speacialising in one subject is unjustifiable since the student may know about related subjects in more detail than just having broad information .

The student specialising in a subject is expected to know in detail about the subject .
For example , a student studying medicine is expected to be proficient in not just ready with the information but also to be able to practice it as and when needed .
This comes through continuous hard work and devotion to one 's chosen field of study .
If the student tries to indulge in other academic disciplines too much , he will harm the pateints and his own career .
Thus one has to be cautious about studying other subjects .
Studying many subjects , will make the student a mere dabbler who risks hampering furture growth .

Additionally the student is expected to have some inclination for arts and its various forms , political science , finance for these subjects help the student to go ahead with life with ease and to understand the significance of events efecting him .
Thus , the speaker 's claim about knowing only one subject is also not sufficient .

Thus , both the scenarios - of having some knowledge about all the subjects and knowing everything about just one subject - should be discouraged .
With the world becoming a smaller place and universities offering a host of admixed streams and choices to students , these are actually not even possible in today 's scenario .
A student should study hard at his chosen field of study and also , as he can devote time , try to learn other related and unrelated subjects but not at the cost of his subject .
