Ours is a fast developing society and and we have varied branches of study in which we can gain specialization .
The question whether it is better to have a knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one subject is a very debatable one and the responses may vary from individual to individual .
here , let us anlyze the situation ..

Universities to day offer many subjects in which students can choose to major such as the sciences , math , literature and arts ...
each of these subjects also have many applied branches .
Take for instance science which comprises of medical sciences , physical sciences , astronomy and so on ...
the scope of learning today is so vast that one cannot hope to master completely even one subject , so the view of learning may subjects seems to be completely out of question ...
Therefore , I strongly support the view that students should specialize in one specific subject rather that learning a lot of subjects .
My arguments for the same go as following .

As it is said that `` THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION SHOULD HAVE A DIRECT BEARING ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE '' , true as it is .
If a student focuses his energy and time on learning one subject he she can gain better expertise and thus he will be more proficient in that subject .
A proficiency in any field in turn bring with it better work opportunities and a better quality of life .
on the other hand if a student has sveral subjects to study and he cannot devite his time to one , he will probably end up being aimless and jobless too .

Here some people might counter my view by saying that .
if a person has knowledge about varied subjects he will be in a better situation to face the challenges of life .
yes , that is one fact that is undeniable but as far as professional educatipn is concerned i strongy support the idea of majoring in one subject only .

We all have plans for the future and we know what we want to be in the future , We are aware of our abilities and interests so after calculating on all these factors one should choose a field that he wants to specialize in instead of trying to learn all subjects because it is virtually impossible for mortals to retain all that they learn in school or university .
So if i want to be a computer engineer why should i be bothered about learning about the various forms of music .
The answer is obvious - it will be of no practical use to me .

In view of the facts that i mentioned above we can safely reachthe conclusion that one should focus on specializing in one field only rather than creating an anarchic situation in your mind by trying to gain expertise in various subjects .
