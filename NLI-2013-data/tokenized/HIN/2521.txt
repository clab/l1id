I Totally disagree with the statement given .
Rather would like to start the passage with a line rightly said that we have two childhood , one when we are born and the other when we are old .
In my opinion childhood is the best time of our life , which again pop up when we are old .
this is the association that i would like to make with this statement , as this is the first thing that came to my mind after reading the statement .

when a person is young , he is more active , adveturous , enthusiastic about life .
probably for the reason that he is physically fit and can take a walk in the nature without thinking twice about it .
youngsters enjoy the late night party and can manage the cocktails .
but what about the stress that they have to undergo , the stress related not only for there position in life but fight that they undergo for their ambition .
the fight to rise up .
the fight for making correct decision 's in life .
its a great responsibility for a young person to live a good and happy life In contrast the old people they are all through with the feeling of anciety or the fight for thir owm rights .
they again are babies who are looked after for .
they have almost done all the thing they wanted in life .
they can travel , go to places or even feel free to express themself , and nobody would mind it .
though it happens that majority of old people suffer with health problems , but then no one is perfect .

both have there bad and good aspects but i would always prefer the one supporting the older generations because i have seen at my home-set - up , the way they have been treated and i kind off like it .

so like to conclude by saying that it is a very personal view onlikes and dislikes and i woud support the latter , as it is the one which is more mentally stable .
