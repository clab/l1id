Personally i feel that it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I feel so because , in the present world wherein competition is at its peak levels , in order to excel in any field we need to have complete knowledge about that particular field .
For that we need to concentrate a lot in that subject or field .

For example for an ELCECTRONICS ENGINEER in order to take VERY LARGE SCALE INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ( VLSI ) as the career we need to have the complete knowledge of chip designing at the miniature levels .
We need to be well equipped with all the necessary tools and platforms whcih are part of VLSI , else we cant be a successful designer .
Having broader knowledge in all the other fields does n't help us to do well in the present field .
For example having ample knowledge in OPERATING SYSTEMS CONCEPTS and COMPUTER NETWORKS doesnt help a person intending VLSI as a career option .
All he can do is that he utilise those concepts to an extent but they are not going to help him perceive a career in VLSI .

One of the famous saying also states that `` JACK OF ALL TRADES MASTER OF NONE '' .
It means that a person who intends to master all the fields finds the going very difficult for him .
If we intend to succeed in a particular field then we need to plan in such a way that we are also aware of the recent developments in that particular field i.e ... , we have to be upto date regarding that particular subject or field .
In ordre to sustain in the competition one needs to be the winner and a winner never takes chances .
Moreover if we wish to have broader knowledge in many acdemic subjects it will be difficult for us to concentrate in each and every aspect of every subject .
In course of broadening our horizon in one subject we may not find sufficient time or we may not pay attention to the other subject , which may lead to the failure of the individual as a whole .

Morover we may run into a state of situation wherein we may be confused to chose a career comprising of which subject .
One cannot find a career which offers or applies all the subjects he or she has studied .

Finally , i conclude that it is advisable to be specialized in one specific subject rather than havingf broadened knowledge of many subjects .
