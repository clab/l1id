People travel to all over the world for various reasons .
Some do it because they want a change in their lives , whereas others do it beacause they want to explore the world and want to know about that place , the people and their culture .

Hence , I feel that if the reason is to explore the world or the place , the best thing is to do in a group led by a tour guide .
A tour guide is a person who is professionally qualified to help and show people the places they are travelling to , so it would be really easy if you are with a tour guide .
Also , travelling in a group has its own charm .
You are not only enjoinyg a new place but also you are sharing your experience and your joy with others too .

Although , I do agree if we are travelling in groups we dont possess the amount of freedom we would enjoy when we are alone but being in groups with a tour guide is beneficial in many other ways .
Firstly , since he is an expert you will get to explore and see all important places which you might miss if you are travelling alone .
For example you might just miss amonument and you later regret that you might have consulted a tour guide .
Also , by chance if you face any kind of problems you have so many people helping you out .
For example , you might have a problem with your health in a place which is new to you .
It might be great cause of concern , whereas if you are travelling in a group you have so many people to count on .

Also , there are people in this world who do not have families or friends these kind of groups are really beneficial for them .
It has been seen that after spending days together you really beacame friends even after you finish off with your trip .

When people travel in groups they spend all extra time singing , enjoing , dancing with each other .
Even the time you spend on travelling becomes so exciting .
To summarise I would say that travelling in groups led by a tour guide do take away some part of your freedom but it provides you with a real defination of enjoyment and excitement which you can never enjoy all alone .
