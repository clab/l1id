The topic herein holds great importance as it has to deal with the youth , future mentors of any society .
I believe that the young people these days are not giving enough time to develop and upbring their communities .
The young generation has become much more careless towards their communities as they are already so occupied with several other things which are of more importance to them .

Firstly , the increasing competition to earn a better living has taken away all their extra time that they would have devoted in heping their communities .
These young people are focussing these days on the need of earning a better living , better education , better standing in the society and all the other related things .

Secondly , with the increasing property rates , food costs and prices of other daily living needs , these people have become more money minded .
Hence , instead of giving free time for the upliftment of their communities , they can devote that time either to earn some extra bucks or to enjoy life with what they already have .
The time given for community may not yield any instant benefit to them , hence , the time is spent in an activity which will give them immediate results .

Thirdly , in the upliftment of their community , they may also have to spend some money alongwith time , which makes them bit more reluctant to indulge in any such activity .
These days , such activities can be related to charity and if someone has lot of money , the area of donations .

Lastly , I feel that the young generation nowadays are trying to adapt to the new economic situation which has a lot of significance for leading their future life and creating a good environment for the future generation .
They are a part of the changing world which has changed a lot over a period of time and is changing constantly with a faster pace .
Hence , all their time is taken away by the activities with which they survive in this changing socio-economic world .
