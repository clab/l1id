There has been a lot of change in the behaviour and attitude of the youth towards their communities nowadays as compared to earlier times .
Today , young people are more concerned about their own personal development rather than the developement of the communtiy they live in .

Because of more professional competition between people and a desire to move up the success ladder , people have forgotton their social responsibilties .
They have forgotton what their community has given to them and what their duties are .
Young people leave no stone unturned to be successful and work with all energy and detremination for their own growth .
But they often have lack of time for helping their communities , most of the youth are not concerned and sometimes are not even aware of who their neighbours are and about the societies they live in .

In earlier days , youth worked hard for community upliftment .
For example , Swami Vivekananda , apart from his personal growth , also worked for improving the status of women in the society .
His followers preached his ideas and principles and this led to the betterment of the society .

Such examples are rare to be seen now .
Advances in science and technology have helped the society but have also brought many mishaps .
People are thought of as machines , who work day and night without worrying about their parents who would be waiting for them at home .
Youth have forgotton towards their responsibility towards their own parents .

Youth have taken to several different forms of entertainment as a source of passing their time .
In their free time , they would surf the net or hang out with friends .
To give an example , many of my college mates pay no attention to the news or any natural calamities .
They are only concerned about them and their relatives .

This trend can be easily seen in case of a calamity like droughts , floods where people above the age of 40 are actively involved in the helping the affected people .
Youths are preoccupied with other non significant issues like a party at their friends place or a routine get together .

Hence , with the help of the above mentioned points I conclude that youth nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
