I absolutely agree with the above statement that there will be fewer cars in use in the future , than there are today .
The first and the foremost reason could be that the capacity of the roads had reached the threshold and the roads could not take in any more cars , thereby forcing the governments to provide more convenient , better , efficient and rapid public transport systems .
And once the pople have got used to this convenient mode of travelling , they do n't want to use their cars .

The second reason could be that , in future , the scarcity of oil will cause the fuel prices to inflate to such an extent , that it would become very costly for the people , especially the working class to use their cars on a solo basis .
Thus thay would be pooling their cars , there by reducing the number of cars plying on the road .

Thirdly , in future , the concept of ` Work from Home ' could be the default method used by the most of the bussineses , and this will definitely help reduce the number of cars on the road .
Also , many people will prefer working closer to home to avoid the rush-hour travelling .

Stricter government regulations for pollution and emissions may not permit all vehicles to run every hour or day .
It could be that vehicles of a particular type are allowed on a given day , while vehicles of another type are permitted on another hour or day .
Such restrictions may also discourage people from buying their cars , thus putting a check on the number of cars on the road .

Also the government may increase the taxes on cars to exhorbitant amount to discourage people from buying personal cars .
So , all these probable reasons can contribute to reduce the number of cars running on the roads in future .
