I do agree with the statement that most advertisements do in fact make products seem much better than they really are .
The reasons I think this is true are as follows .

Firstly , most advertisements always highlight positives of the product but do not mention any associated `` cons '' of the product .
Although it is true that without stressing on positives , the product would not sell , but leaving out details do not give complete information about the product .
For example , a Macdonalds advertisement would highlight the `` experience at an afforable cost '' but would not mention anything about the trans-fat content of the products which could have ill-effects on health of the consumer .

Secondly , advertisements use associations to sell a product and leads consumers to believe that acquisition of the product would materialize the association .
For example , the `` Air Jordan '' shoes marketed by Nike sold the association of having the `` ability to play like Michael Jordan '' using the Air Jordan shoes .
We all know that it requires a lot more talent and ability than a pair of shoes to play like Jordan .
Hence , the association always ends up glorifying the true benefit of the product .

Another reason that results in misplaced information about a product given the advertisement is the use of celebrity models in advertisements to sell products .
Even though the product might need a particular attribute in the customer ( for example a fit body ) to be beneficial to the customer , the customer does not sense that on seeing the advertisement .
They rarely recognize that what looks good on supermodels like Cindy Crawford might not necessarily look good on them .

Given the above mentioned reasons , I would agree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
