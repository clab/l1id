I totally disagree with the statement ` Young People enjoy life more than older people do ' , being in my youth at the age of seventeen I trully feel my level or energy of enjoyment is way greater than that of my uncles and aunts , but this dose n't necessarily mean that people who are older do n't enjoy life .

Young people have different kinds of enjoyment in life , as they have a lot of vigour , passion , aggression to do something or to be someone and to enjoy life simultaneously , whereas older people have vigour , passion and aggression for other things which do n't show as they have been through all the ages , they used to enjoy life differently and now they enjoy life as they have attained most of their goals and dreams .
I would like to tell you about an example , my dream is to have a house in Australia for which I have to work hard , whereas people who have already achieved things are enjoying their life .
There are different types of enjoying life by young people and older people , I would certainly call river raftin , trekking , playing in the snow , watching movies etc. enjoying life to the fullest , whereas my dad and mom would call Cruises , going to meuseums , go for classical music concerts enjoying life .
So there is a generation gap , but this dose n't mean that my parents are enjoying life lesser than I am .

Its not about how much you enjoy its about how you enjoy life , and that can be same for young people as well as older people .
Young people have the time to enjoy life , whereas older people have less time to enjoy it , but all of this depends on how much you are willing to sacrifice just to enjoy life .
So at the end of the day you are just trying to enjoy life and not measure who actually enjoyed more or enjoyed less .
