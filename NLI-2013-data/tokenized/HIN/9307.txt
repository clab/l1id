Ideas and Facts are two sides of the same coin .
While ideas bring about new experimentation , new technologies , new behaviourr , new ways to do things ; thier success brings about facts .
I personally beleive it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts as well as learn facts .
Facts usually gives the basis of an idea .
They know that this is what the charatersitcs are ; they can formulate an idea with the existing fact .

Focusing on only one facotr , i.e An idea or fact would mean invitng more errors or having things done the monotnous way .
For example : new techonology have been invented in the recent past becuase of new ideas being generated ; however , the existing facts about the present technology has helped them develop news ones .
Knowledge of facts helps students realise the limitations and the strength of a certain subject .
Concepts on the other hand are the basis of understanding any subject .
If a student has not understood his concepts well , he would be unable to understand the fatcs and not bult up on ideas .
Concept is the backbone of both ideras and facts .

For example if a student ubderstands Newtons LAw of gravity , he would understand that every thing around is attracted by earth .
Once he understand the concept , he can understand the facts about gravity and then built on new dieas to built a parchute or an aircraft .
Ideas , Concept6s and Facts belong to a viscious circle where one thing is realted to the other and cannot survive without the other .
Now , if students are exposed only to concepts and told to built on ideas then they might be building the same things which is already exisiting , or they might repeat the same mistakes made by thier forefathers .
Similarly , if students are only basing thier knowledge on facts they might not be in a position to invent new things and stick to the same old way of life .
Hence looking at all these matters , I conclude that ideas , facts and concepts are equally imporant to students .
