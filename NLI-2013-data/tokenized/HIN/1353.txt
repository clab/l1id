Honestly , I believe that it is a better to be a virtuoso in a particular field rather than being a dilletante .
A person who tends to grope at everything at once , ultimately ends up with empty hands .
To cite an example , I would like to take up the case of doctors .
How preposterous would it be to have a doctor repairing your dentures and at the same time trying to perform a cardiac surgery on you .
I for one would definitely not want to be at the mercy of such a person .

The new age world demands specialization .
It makes more sense to perfect a task , rather than to jump from one thing to another .
In todays world professionals are in great demand .
As the title suggests , one expects a person to be professionally involved in a field and not just pursue in as a hobby .

I would not like to go to far to adduce another example .
My grandfather , who happens to be an undergraduate in liberal arts , post graduate in marketing , and a diploma holder from IIFT chose to enter an industry as alien as the shoe industry .
Quite predictably he could not get a firm foothold in the industry and within a year , he switched over to an equally absurd field , construction .
My grandfather who was not even close to being an engineer wallowed meaninglessly in an arena which tacitly required a minimum of 4 years of engineering .
Quite understandably he could not survive in the cut throat competition among the architectural fraternity .
I regret saying it but he now sits idle at home , next to a dying hearth with his numerous degrees lying straggled around him .
He still has 4 years till retirement but unfortunately not a company to approach .

In todays world , competition requires you to be an ace at whatever you do .
The kind of in-depth experience specialization lends to a person cannot be achieved by merely scraping the surface of a particular subject .
To sum it all up , If one lays waste his powers in trying to dabble at anything and everything , he merely ends up being a jack of all trades for who this world , blessed with specialists in their own fields , has no room .
