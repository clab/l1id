I fully agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know .
Taking risks to achieve something big is what these successful people believe in .
They have big dreams .
They feel that without taking risks they cannot fulfil them .
They are not afraid of failing and they expect positive outcome from these risks .

Typically the people who fall under this category are the bussinessmen .
For example to sell his product a successful businessman would use a method like this .
He does the entire campaigning and advertising of a new product that he has to sell in a different way .

He keeps offers for his customer like `` buy one and get one free '' .so by doing this he attracts the customer to his product and thereby increases the sell .
He does n't think about the money that he is going to spend by keeping such offers but he thinks about the money he is going to make by using this `` buy one get one free '' offer .
So the risk here is to give such kind of offer .
so this is the outlook of a suuccessful person .
They see the positive side of everything .
They actually do the same things but they do it differently and thats what makes them different from a ordinary person .
Now if we think about a not so successful businessman in the same situation he would n't have taken the risk of giving big offers from the fear : what if the customers dont buy my product ?
I will be doomed .
So he would follow his usual way .
Even if there is no loss there is no extra gain is what this businessman thinks .
But the successful businessman does not fear about the loss and consistently thinks the big profit incase his idea succeeds .
