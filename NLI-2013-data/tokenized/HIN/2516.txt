Young and old people both enjoys life with their best they can do .
Young people have some problems too same as to for the older ones .
But here i think that the young ones generally enjoy more that that of the old people .

In my opinion , young thinks less about their future and the outcomes of their deeds .
While in case of older people they generaly think about the outcomes of their misdeed so what they do is carefully as compared to young people .

Most of the old people generally lost their purpose of living and wait for the death , indeed , some enjoys their life , regardless of the worries at home .
In joint families generally old people get the respect but when thing comes to the nuclear families , old ones are neglected .
But it is not in the case of the young ones they are loved by the whole family members and most of their mistakes are neglected .
This carries them to go on enjoying more .

Appearence the the next thing in the context .
Obviously , the old people have lost their charming faces , their well toned body and now they have lose skin with lots of raches and water is comong out of their mouth .
They seems little ugly but young-ones are cute and lovable .
This makes them to be loved by most of the people and get support to do things more and enjoy them .

One of the most important thing old people generally sleep late night and wakeup early in the this distracts most of the people and me too .
They wakeup and will do something , which generally disturbs others sleep and i love mornig sleep .
And young people also enjoys it a lot .

In this way I think that according to above based examples young people enjoys more than old people .
