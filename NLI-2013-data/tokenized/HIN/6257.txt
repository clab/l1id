Although the stated statement looks unbelievable , but I agree to the point mentioned and is based on following :

First , almost governments of all countries are concentrating on improvement and betterment of public mode of transport .
I believe this will have an sound effect on the number of cars getting diminished .
The public mode of transport being cheaper and safer than cars would provide better option and convenient journey to common man in contrast to the situation now .

Second , the ever growing fuel prices will force common man to rethink on using personal cars for day to day use .
The fuel prices have been sky rocketting and according to the study this pattern would continue for years to come .
Some may cast doubt on this study by arguing that fewer cars would automatically bring down the demand for fuel and hence price .
As a matter of fact , cars are not the only demander of fuel .
Fuel is used in various industries , airplanes , ships , busses etc .

Third , the very fact that global economy is doing well is a factor responsible for number of cars present .
Economy doing well increases the purchasing power of the common man .
But this fairy tale might not continue for long .
Again going by history patern and economic gurus , a slowdown or correction in economy is due and expected to continue for atleast 10 years .
This slowdown will automatically bring down the purchasing power of common man as well as the loan providing facilities by financial institutions which has assisted people to buy cars on a rampage .
The rate of interest will go higher which will not allow common man to even think of going for the loan .

Finally , when we talk of economic slowdown , the prices of some essential commodities will surge like that of steel .
We all know that steel is major raw material in car manufacturing .
Now if the raw material cost goes up , it will automatically augment the input cost .
Hence to increase bottomline on balance sheets , car manufacturers will increase the car prices which will drill holes in common man 's pocket .
This can be exemplified by recent spur in prices of cars by GM .

Taking in account the factors stated above , it is crystal clear that reduction in number of cars is inevitable in coming years .
