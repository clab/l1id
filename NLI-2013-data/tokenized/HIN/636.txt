I completely and loudly disagree with the statement - `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject '' .
Agreeing to it sounds like one is agreeing to `` it is better to have one foot on one boat and the other on another than both feet one a single boat '' .

The given statement reminds me of a famous Aesop 's tale in which a young boy learns , unfortunately after his death , that if he had dug a well instead of digging several potholes , he would had not died of thirst .

Specializing in one specific subject is like climbing a ladder while trying to get knowledge of many academic subjets is like trying to hold many branches of a very broad and high tree .
It is obvious which one is more fruitfull , which one is easier , which one is wiser and which one is better .

It is better to be a full artist than a quarter mathematician , a quarter chemist , a quarter biologist and a quarter physist .
The world remembers names of Newton , Einsten , Shakespeare because they specialised in their fields , not because of their part-time jobs or knowledge .
In today 's world of sheer competition it is not important for a student to have gained many bachelor 's degree in many fields but to have a specialization in one particular field , if he wants to secure a good job and future .
One should always remenber that it is better to be master of a single trade .
