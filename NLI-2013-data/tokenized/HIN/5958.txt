I would disagree with the statement , `` In twenty years there will be a fewer cars in use than there are today '' , for many reasons .
Firstly , i believe that the automobile industry is burgeoning and the number of cars manufactured by them is increasing in an exponential manner and therfore the use of the cars is increasing as well .

The population of the world has increased and hence the demand for owning a car as increased as well .
In the present world people who even earn a mimimal annual income are also buying cars because of the offers such as paying in installments , available to them from the various car vendors .
Hence the use of the cars have gone up and will continue to rise as there will be better offers available to middle-class people .

Another reason according to me would be that , the variety of the cars available in the market keeps getting upgraded frequently .
Every new car has a newer technology or some additional feature that makes it better than its predecessor .
This attracts people to buy a new one in addition to the one they might already own .
This leads to more cars on road and therfore adding to the use of them and we can imagine much better cars in twenty years from now as well .

Another example i would like to sate is that in a country like India there is no law against cars older that 15 years .
This adds to the fact that since the cars are not being recycled or carshed , the number of cars on road are just adding up and so is the use of them .
Therfore the number of cars would reach a very high level in twenty years .

Concluding , i would like to say that , according to me the use of the cars will not decrease in twenty years from now but rather increase in an unusual manner .
