Basic concepts and learning facts are two impotant ways to judge difficulties occured in life , which can be obtain to judge that what are the needs of a perticular circumstances or situation .
And those idea can be generated only when a person is gone through or learned the perticular facts .
Therefore , i completely disagree with the following statement .
That concepts are more impoertant then learning facts .

Their are two ways to learn the facts that is firstly , we can say that facts can be learn through the history and secondly , by experiancing on its own .
Students learning from the histroy would give them knowledge upto certain limit , but student experiancing on its own can get the complete lesson of the fact .
To make you understand , lets take one or two examples to make the statement clear .

Firstly , if the student would hear the story of a person who has travelled allot in his life .
The student would get the complete idea of the difficulties faced by the traveller through concepts but the facts of that traveller is not imagined by the student .
Instead of it , the student himself have travelled allot then he would get the complete idea of difficulties faced by him and then he could ultimately learn some lessons through the facts while travelling .

Secondly , if he had heard about the practical exams but never yet practised it in the lab then he definately going to face serious problems in exam because of unaware of directions and therefore , it is necessary for him to do practise for practicle exams before it is going to held .

On the otherside if we would go is that there are some aspects which cannot be experianced by everyone in that case student would definately go through the concept .
Likewise , if a student wants to learn the dishaster caused to the earth after second worldwar .
The student shuld not create the war again .

To conclude that both are equally important for a student to understand ideas according to the requirement of his interest .
