The role of advertisments in purchasing behaviour of consumer for any product is continously rising from a long time .
It is true that advertisments make product 's feature or chracterstic much better than they really are .
I am strongly agree with this statment because of number of valid reasons and examples .
It affects consumers and manufacturer in number of ways .

First , financial importance of advertisment to manufacturer of product .
Any manufacturer of products want to sell his products to earn the money or profit out of that process .
To introduce a new product or stand with competition with other providers they usually needs to advertise the product .
Advertisment are usually an expensive way of promotion .
Therefore , manufacturer use the best part of products to highlight in advertisments .
They usually hides the negative part of products .
Thus consumer usally disguised by claims made by product in advetisments .
On the other hand advertisements are also in favour of consumers .
These promotional activities make them aware of new products and selective features of products .

Second , effects of advertisements on consumer .
Advertisments in pharmaceutical industry usually shows the postive features of any drug .
Advertisments of drug Vioxx by Merck Labs never talked about the harmfull affect of drug on cardiovascular system on patients .
These advertisments increase the usage of drugs in consumer and ended up with serious effects on blood system .
On the other hand advertisments helps consumers or patients about the availability of various treatment options .
After the advertisments of drugs from Pharmaceutical company , patient come to know about the underlying disease and check with their physicains for availabilty of treatment option .
Therefore , advertisments improves the quality of life for some patients .

To sum up , we can say that advertisment usually hides the negative feature of product .
But on other side it is beneficial for both manufacturer as well as consumers .
Advertisements give more chance to growth and innovation .
