SOMEONE HAS RIGHTLY SAID :
`` LIFE IS AN ICE CREAM , EAT IT BEFORE IT MELTS !! ''

THE TOPIC THAT WHETHER YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE IS REALLY A VERY INTERESTING ONE , MAKING SOMEONE TO THINK REAL DEEP ABOUT IT .
` ENJOYMENT ' IS ONE FACTOR IN LIFE WHICH IS NOT RELATED TO AGE .
I THINK ONE ENJOYS LIFE WITH HEART .
BUT , AGE FACTOR DO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE TYPE AND LEVEL OF ENJOYMENT ONE CAN HAVE AND NO DOUBT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE AT AN ADVANTAGE AT THIS .

FIRSTY , THE ZEST & ZEAL WITH WHICH A TEENAGE OR AN ADULT WILL ENJOY DOING AN ACTIVITY , AN OLDER PERSON WILL N'T BE ABLE TO DO THE SAME THING WITH THE SAME ENERGY LEVEL .
HE WILL GET EASILY FATIGUED & LOOSE HIS INTERSET SOON .
FOR INSTANCE , ON MY BIRTHDAY PARTY , WE YOUNGESTERS HADE MUCH FUN DANCING & PLAYING GAMES .
BUT , ON THE OTHER HAND , MY GRANDPARENTS COULD N'T ENJOY THAT MUCH .
THEY WERE REALLY TIRED AND WENT OFF TO SLEEP SOON .

SECONDLY , THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS MORE ADVENTERIOUS & LIKE TO DISCOVER AND EXPLORE NEW IDEAS , THINGS & PLACES .
WHEREAS , AGED PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY HAVE SEEN A LOT OF THINGS IN LIFE AND NOW THEY WANT TO ENJOY REST OF THEIR LIFE PEACEFULLY .

LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST , YOUNG MINDS ARE MORE TENSION FREE AS THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY PRESSURE OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND LIABILITIES .
THE CHILD IN THEM ALWAYS LOOKS FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENJOY LIKE GOING FOR A PICNIC , RESTAURANT OR A MOVIE .
WHEREAS , THE PRESSURE OF RESPONSIBILITIES SHOULDERED UPON THE OLDER PEOPLE LIMITS THE CHILD WITHIN THEM FROM DOING ALL THESE THINGS .

TO CONCLUDE , I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT BOTH YOUGER & OLDER PEOPLE ENJOY THEIR LIVES IN THEIR OWN DIFFERNT WAYS .
WHILE , FUN , EXCITEMNET , PARTIES , DANCE & MUSIC MEANS THE WAY TO LIVE LIFE FOR YOUNGESTERS ; PEACE , CALMNESS , CHERISHING OLD MEMORIES , MEANS ENJOYMENT TO THE OLD PEOPLE !!
