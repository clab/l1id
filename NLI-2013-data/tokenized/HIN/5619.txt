agree .
i completely agree with the statement .
most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
the statement can be applied to almost any field .
firstly , the facts presented in the ads are not always correct .
these generally are not tested or not verified .
say , at one time an ad in asian country about the heat pumps said that the device can output two units of heat energy when it takes only one input of electrical energy .
now this challenges the very law of conservation of energy .
but it doesnt tell about an additional unit of heat energy the device takes from surroundings .

so on the part of the consumer it becomes really difficult to believe such facts .
secondly , it sometimes happen the statistical results shown about a product are not taken considering all possible situations .
say for example the windows beta version ad said that it can work longer .
but in actual working the software crashed after working continuously for forty-eight hours .
one obvious possible reason is that it was never tested in such conditions .
so in ad it looked very efficient , much more than it actually was .

thirdly , sometimes the ads make comparisons with the other products of same category .
in such comparisons they highlight those parameters which are good in their product as compared to the other product .
but rarely they compare all the parameters including those in which their product is inferior in performance to the other company 's product .
they never show the actual tradeoffs between the positives and negatives of the product .

so the comparisons can be misleading very often to the consumer .
lastly , very few ads show the potential harm a product can cause to a human or entity using it over long periods of time .
for example a computer monitor manufacturing company very rarely focuses on the part that continuous exposure to the screen can strain the eyes which can have serious medical problems in long run .
so the consumer never gets to know about these problems thinking that the product is efficient and doesnt even strain the eyes .
rarely such ads suggests to use anti-glare protective screens .

by using the above stated supporting reasons and approriate examples most advertisements make product seem much better in performance and efficiency than they really are .
