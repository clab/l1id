A person could excel in only one thing .
God has provided us just by one brain .
The brain could concentrate only at one point at a particular moment .
It would be better to be focussed on a single point than to be whimsical .

Moreover , the master blaster Sachin Tendulkar is the good example .
Inspite of sorrounding by controversies , he has always been focussed to the sports .
Further , Stephen Hawking , the well known scientist have always been dreamt about the astronomy .
Furthermore , Bill Gates have talked about the computers .
They have reached to certain standards and have became an icon for the youth because of their single goal .
One need to be stronghold to achieve a goal .

However , there have been people who have done plenty of the things .
Though , to live in the cut-throat competition , we are expected to know the certain things .
Nevertheless , Imran Khan was a good sportsman but now he is a politician .
Amitabh Bachachan who has done economics and now he is the celebrity and even the ambassador of many products .
They have shown to the world that they have been the all - rounder .
A one need to have the knowledge of the politics to the academics to survive in this world .

At the end , a person need to have a unique destination to accomplish it .
However , it is rather difficult for the people to be masters of all .
A person in higher school considers one specific subject to specialize in that .
An engineer could only be engineer and a doctor could be doctor .
Further , it is not an easy job to play several parts .
One has to do lot of the other task like working on hobbies than academics .
Furthermore , a person need to maintain plenty of relations .
In the conclusion , it is `` better to be a master of one than a slave of all '' .
