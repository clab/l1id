I disagree with the statement .
If anything , there will be a lot more cars in twenty years .
First of all , according to what i have learned in school , oil is not a renewable energy source , but there is definately enough of it to meet global demands for at least the next fourty years , if not more .
Second of all , the number of cars has been increasing since they were first invented around the early twentieth century .
So according to this trend , I do n't see how the number of cars will suddenly drop within two decades .

The reason this statement is even debatable is probably because of the fact that oil is a non-renewable energy source so some people may think that it will eventually run out ( which it will , but not within twenty years as the statement says ) and we will have to find or invent different means of transportation that do n't require oil .
But as long as oil is around and accessable , the number of cars will continue to increase .

Car companies - like BMW and Land Rover for example - are doing everything in their power to increase sales .
They 're giving better offers , their increasing the quality of manufacturing and they 're meeting public demands .
As long as they can keep their customers content with their products , which they have been doing since their companies are flourishing , the number of customers will only increase .
I honestly do n't see how the public will just stop buying cars for the sake of it .
They have n't stopped for the past ten decades , why will they stop in the next two ?

I have absolutely every reason to believe that the number of cars will continue to increase as they have always increased , for the next thirty or fourty years , till oil eventually runs out .
A car is probably the most important mean of transportation today .
If oil runs out , another energy source will just have to replace it .
If it does n't , then yes , perhaps the number of cars will decrease .
But i disagree with the statement because i believe that the number of cars will continue to increase for well more than twenty years therefore the number of cars will not be fewer , they will be greater in twenty years time .
