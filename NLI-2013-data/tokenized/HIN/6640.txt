`` Technology has always been a boon to the society '' , Due to advancement in technology there are smaller and efficient ways to finish a particular task .
The population growth of the cars has also been a major part of concern .
We are striving hard enough to meet the requiremnts of todays world .
So , I feel that twenty years down the line we may have very fewer cars on the roads .

In twenty years from now technology will be so advanced that person can work efficiently sitting at home or being online , so there is not much to travel and work at the same time .
Nowadays people are looking for luxury and work together .
They do not want themselves to stress a lot but , at the same time work harder and efficiently .
Think of people during ancient times , they were happy and contented with the work and efforts they used to put in at that time , but now the scenario is different people are looking towards the world with a broder perspective , they want to gain more and put less .
They do not want to sit ideal but also do not want to stress themselves .

With the growth in population , competition is increasing rapidly and people are looking focused towards their work .
They prefer to work more and gain more but , with ease .
People will be getting stuff ready at their doorstep and thus there does not arise a need to travel through cars and waste time as time is precious .

Cars are polluting the city heavily nowadays and so i feel that the government will provide other means of transport twenty years from now and ban cars .
May be this step will help us to get a healthy and pure environment .

Thus , one can mearly suggest that the rate of cars twenty years from now will surely decrease .
Some other means of transport may arise which will help to secure and improve the environment .
There will also be a lot of advancement in technology which will help us to achieve this .
