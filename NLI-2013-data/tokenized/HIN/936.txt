Having broad knowledge of many subjects does not lead to a good future .
Whereas specializing in a particular subject in more beneficial nowadays .
I completely disagree to the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjets than to specialise in one specific subject . ''

Nowadays there is demand for professinals , who know their job very well and can handle any task in a particular field .
People who have broad knowledge about many academic subjects , do not actually know what field they really want to master in and so they have knowledge about many subjects .
It is very well said `` A jack of all trades is a master of none . ''
So this implies that to be a master or to actually achieve what you desire you need to be pragmatic and should know what is neccesary for you to achieve what you desier for yourself .

I have even seen many people who have degrees in many fields but still do not have what they want for themselves .
For example , one of my friend 's elder brother has many degrees in different field and has alot of knowedge about many different academic subject , but he still does not have an aim or a particular direction to move in .
Whereas one of my cousins had a masters degree in computers , which was his favorite subject from his school days and then got a proper job with proper status and a respectful social life .

It is not bad to have vast knowledge , but having vast vast knowledge in many different fields , stops you from being interested in a particular field .
It is not only that having vast knowledge is important What is more important is to be more smarter and choos a specific field to major in .

Thus i would say that specialising in a particular subject is more beneficial than having fast knowledge of various subjects .
As , now you are wanted to be more knowledgeable about your subject , then it does not matter how much you know about other subjects .
