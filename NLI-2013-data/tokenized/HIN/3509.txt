I completely agree with the statement .
Today 's young generation hardly gives any time to help their community .
I feel so because , I have observed this .
I feel if this continues , it may result in the decreasing growth of country .

I had free time last weekend .
So , I was roaming around in the city .
The very obvious thing which I could observe everywhere was , teenagers dancing around in pubs , drinking , gaming , playing music .
At the same time I could see people starving for food in slum areas next to them .
But , they were not bothered at all .
I felt really bad and asked myself if this is the generation which is going to run this country in coming years ?
Our country 's future is in these hands waving unbothered in pubs ?

Having fun , enjoying with friends is not a bad thing to do .
But , one should always realize that there is a big mob of people around you seeking your help .
Bringing a smile on their face would surely add a lot to your community .
The young generation can always spend few hours per week to help their community .
They should realize their need for their community .
They should realize that the future of their country is in their hands .
Helping out the community is very crucial for a country because , the country grows with the development of community .
The implied meaning is , the teenagers giving more time for helping out the community is crucial because , they can always utilize some portion of the time which they spend hanging around .

There are many organizations formed by group of young people in order to help out the community .
But , the teenagers hardly know about them and they often do n't pay attention at these things .
I think , we should make today 's young generation realize the importance of community services by publicizing such organization and letting young people to participate more in their activities .

Finally , I would say , the enthusiasm young generation should not waste their energy by hanging around .
They should contribute to the country 's development by giving enough time to help their community and make the country grow with them .
