success is often measured by the amount of money one has or the number of propeties one owns or the number of cars one has .

nowdays people have ample oppertunities to prove themselves in varios fields of their choice and generally they venture into jobs which have been tested over a period of time and thereby reducing their chances of failure .

according to me successful people are those poeple who willing to take risks and are ever ready to try new things .
according to me risk equals reward and the more risk you take the better will be your reward .
when a person tries a new venture he does not know what the outcome would be and therefore he works extremely hard in order to make it function properly .

taking the examle of the stock market where the risk factor is extremely high since you know you could easily loose money if the market collapses , and then you look at the returns generated through the market which happen to be far more than what you would have earned putting your money in a banks fixed deposit .

many people in todays world have made career decisions not according to norms laid down by earlier societies which confined people to choose between becoming a doctor , or businessman , or accountant .
etc but today even people such as artisans , computer enigeers , pilots , artists to name a few are doing incredibly well since recent societies demand diversity and if you choose a profession which is likely to become a hit with society then you know that your risk or gamble paid off since you will be successful .
