Travel in a group with a tour guide is gaining poularity nowadays and some people do consider it the best way to travel .
However , it is not for me .
I am a person who believes in self-discovery and I like discovering places on my own and at my own pace .

For me , travel is a discovery and making friends with local people , getting to know them and living their culture is the true experience of travel .
I believe in taking out time to understance the cultural nuances of the new place and attempt to comprehend the true culture of every new city that I visit .

I have heard quite a few stories from people who had a fantastic time in group travel with tour guides .
I myself have sent my parents to such trips when they come to visit me as they are old and having a tour guide is the easiest way for them to have a comfortable , safe trip in a foreign land .
But , for me , with age on my side right now I do n't feel the need for a guide .
I believe that when you travel to someplace new you should be in that mood - willing to explore , try new things and meet new people .
Traveling on your own gives you the opportunity to converse with the local people and the `` authentic '' stories that you hear from them are incomparable to the pre-planned , oft-repeated stale information from a guide .

So far my experience with a group led by a tour guide has been fairly limited .
It was only on one occasion that I opted for such an arrangement and that was on my trip to Kerala in India .
The group was well organized , our itinerary fixed and lots of places planned for in the short trip .
I do n't think I got the real flavor of the state as the pace was too fast for me to understand the diversity and the traditional values the country is so famous for .

There are benefits of a group-travel .
But , personally I am all for travelling on my own .
I like to set the pace of my trip , relax on some days and explore a lot on some other days and most importantly , get the true flavor of the country and not just visit the so-called `` points '' of tourist-attraction that group travel arrangements usually entail .
