As the famous saying goes `` Necessity is mother of inventions '' the necessity has no doubt lead to various inventions .
Many great people have learned to find new things and discovered and invented great things in all spheres of life .
As these people worked hard to try new things and later came to know about the risks invoved in it .

Well according to be i would definitely agree the first statement that is Successfull people try out new things and take risks involved in it , rather than only doing the things what we already know how to do well .
People who wants to be known have to be different in their own way .
As I believe that `` Winners do n't do things diffently , but they do things differently '' .
Being successfull is every indivisuals dream come true .
Different people have different views , hence there is probability to learn differently .
hence instead of learning the things what have already known aur performed by someone else will be quite monotonic and boring .
Though knowledge should be gained about the already heared subject , but inventing or discovering something on our own will be quite lot interesting and exiciting .

A hardworker and dedicated man who has a zeal to win in his particular field often tastes the flavour of success .
Trying new things and doing research work sounds exiciting to me .
I remember during my undergraduate program lessons I had assisted my very honoured lecturer in his research work in Electrical Department , as this is my major i was really very excited about it .
But through my experience I have learnt that trying out new things is not just excitement but real hardships attatched to it .
Learning through trial and error method is not just fun but has pains and turmoils and dedication and hardwork required .
I have learned many valuable lessons through this course of study .
I had got to know the importance of lecturer in a students life .
I remember my lecturer was a great person he not only allowed me to learn with him but also helped me to understand it through trial and error method .
He was one of my favourite lecturer and guide .

At the end i would conclude on a note that being successful is not a matter of a day or two it requires hardwork and consistency .
As we say that `` success does not come to you , you go to it '' ! .
Hence I would agree that Successful people try and take risks rather than only doing what we have already known and know how to do it well .
