I think that in twenty years there will be more car sin use than there are today .
If we compare the prsent no of cars in use in present with the past we can see that at present there are more cars at present as compared to the past similarly i think that in next twenty years there will be more cars in use than today there are lots of reason for that which are as follows .

First of all nowadays there are having a lots of options for the car buyers .
The cost of the cars available nowadays varies a lot according to the economical status of the buyers .
So it has become easier for the car buyers to buy the cars .
Moreover we have got a numbers of bankers and financers who give attractive deals for the car buyers .
so it has become easy for the car buyers to buy the cars .

day by day the cars are pproduced in a way that they are more fuel efficient and so it is becoming more economical for tha car users to use the cars .
so this is one of the big factor due to which carusers are using the cars more .

Secondly if we see the convenience its more in the car as car can reach the remote where other means of transportation can not reach as easily .
in case we see the other means of transporatation say for example buses or train they are not able to reach every where as they cannot reach the remot villages the high mountain range so over there its easier for the car users to reach .

Nowadays cars are launched in such a way that they attract more and more youn generation .
youmg generation is attracted towards the speedy cars with sporty look .
the marketing is done according to the users where car manufactures want to reach .
So the marketing according to the needs of the costomers has also increased the nombers of the car users .

So my pinion is that in the twenty years there will be more car users .
