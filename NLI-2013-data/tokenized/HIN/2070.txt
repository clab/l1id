Enjoying life is altogether a different phenomenon taking into consideration the age of the people .
Most people enjoy their lives when they are young and tend to become more sober during their later lives .
There could be many reasons apart from the age factor that makes people to stop enjoying life when they become old .

Firstly , I do think that young people enjoy life more that the older people .
The reason for this might be that the people are quiet young and energetic and hence tend to explore more things in this world .
For example , young people generally like to travel around and see the places they have not visited before .
Not only with the family but also with their friends .
Hence those tours are meant for the enjoyment they can derive being with their friends .
Whereas , older people do not involve in such activities because they may have more responsibilities on their shoulders which the young people may not have .

Secondly , when people become old , they tend to think more about their offsprings rather than themselves .
And also the fact that the people like to look after their grandchildren in their later parts of their lives might deter people from enjoying .
Whereas , young people when they join their colleges , meet with new friends and tend to learn something from their new lives .
This will make them to explore new things and enjoy a little better .

Apart from all these factors , the most important factor is that the old people are being discarded by their children and being kept in the old age homes where they have very little to enjoy .
Youngsters , meanwhile enjoy a lot by partying , dancing and hanging out with their friends .

To summarize , older people like to relax in their later parts of their lives .
They would have also enjoyed when they were young .
Perhaps , this might be the reason , apart from the energy factor that the young people enjoy their lives more than the old people do .
