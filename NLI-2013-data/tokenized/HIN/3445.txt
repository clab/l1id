No community can exist if the young do not take an active part in its development .
Saying that young people do not give time to help their communities would be wrong .
The fact that the young generation enjoys the life and lives it up has created a wrong impression that they are not serious about their communities .
But if we look carefully then we 'll realise the role the youngsters are playing in the development of their communities .

I remember when i was in school , we were made to go to the slum areas and help the children over there to learn to read and write .
Camps were organised by students to educate the locals of a village on the importance of education .
All these initiatives were taken by the students who form the bloodline of any community .

Another example that I can recollect of the youngster 's role in a community is when I went for a vacation to a small town by the sea .
The authorities had allowed breaking of a ship that contained asbestos which is harmful to humans .
It was the effort of the young people of the community that that ship was made to return and a community was saved .

Therefore , the youngsters do care about their communities and play an important role in defining how a community should be rather than just being a part of it and accepting it the way it was given to them .
