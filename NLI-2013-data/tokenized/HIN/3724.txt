I think the statement that ` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ' is too general .
It always depends on the type of person whether he wants or does not want to serve his community .
There have always existed people who owing to there ambitions or vested interest do not give time to helping their communities .
So saying that this is the case at present only , would be very unfair .
There are numerous examples of young people world over who made it their lifes target to serve their community .

But I would agree to the point that there has been a considerable decrease in the number of young people serving their communities .
This is mainly do the following reasons .
Due to the process of rapid globalization the belief of ones community is decreasing as people now consider themselves more a part of the worlds cosmopolitan community rather than to aparticular community .
Also due to the ever increasing competetion in evey field the young people do not find much time to serve their community .
The high amount of stresses the youth are undergoing due to the ever increasing work pressure make them believe in enjoying whatever free time they get .
So they are more inclined to merryment and parties in their free time rather than to serve their community .
Earlier the reason for more contribution by the youth towards their community and country was that most of the countries were under alien rule and were fighiting for their freedom .
So this generated more patriotic tendencies among the young people .
Today this factor is absent at most of the places .

I feel that todays youth are more inclined to first make their lives successful and then at a later stage in life when they have achieved their targets they contribute to their community .
For example Bill Gates , in his youth might not have found much time to serve his community to agreat extent , but now that he has achieved his targets he is contributing a lot to the people of America .

In my country India , there is a group called RSS which is mainly composed of young people with senior leaders to guide them .
The main objective of the group is community service i.e. serving people in cases of drought , flood , natural calamities or any problem for that matter .
Also in college we have students teaching underpriveleged people free of costs in the evening hour .
So we find that though there has been a decline in the number of people serving there communities but still there is lot of work being done by the young people .
Here I would also like to point out that though some young people might not be serving their community in particular but by working in the field of scientific advancement in nation which offer better opportunities they are serving the humanity as a whole and so they are also serving their communities .

Thus I partially agree with the statement that thought there has been a decrease in the number of youth serving their communities but still there are youth making efforts in this direction .
Also they might not be contributing much in their youth but in a later stage of life when they have achieved their goals they contribute in a big manner .
