Now a days it has become a popular belief that the young generation is not helping their communities and are rather much more interested in themselves .
But I do not agree with this statement .
I beleive that still there are younger people nowdays who are helping their communities and I am myself involved in that process .
Let me illustrate this with the help of the example , in my college we have a society called NSS ( National Social Service ) .
As the name suggests this society is involved in the social services .
Lets me explain more about this society .
It is a society that is fully run by the students of the college , sometimes professors are also interested but they do n't bind or force any student to work for that .
So this society only has people who are not paid for any sort of service .
The students are take classes and dentote free books to the poor section of the society who cannot sent their children to school and that also free of cost and in their college working days .
The next example is that last month a student of our college suffered from the cancer but as the cancer was in the initial stages it was beleived to be cured but due to poor background his family was not able to afford the expenses as they were too big .
So what these NSS people did is , they display notices , went to the rooms of each and every student and collected the donations and made donations as much as they can do .
The result was that the students was successfully operated and is now recovering from the cancer .
In addition to all these services they organise voluntry blood donation camps with the help of red cross society and in addition to making regular donations they also encourage other students by giving some talks and thus helping in having the sufficient blood in the blood bank so that it can be used in the case of emergencies .
In order to help poor people of the society , as they themselves do n't have any funds , they montly go to the students rooms and collect some old newpaper and some other stuff so that that can be sold and can be used to help poor people .
They also collect some other stuff like old clothes from both Professors and students who are willing to donate any .

All these services are just being done by the undergraduates of my college and it is not only in our college there are several other schools , colleges and organizations who are helping the community .
All these services demand time as well as efforts and the now more and more youngsters day by day are actively involving themselves in serving the society .
Although there are some youngsters who are not the members of these organizations but still they are helping by making blood donations and other very useful donations to the society periodically .
