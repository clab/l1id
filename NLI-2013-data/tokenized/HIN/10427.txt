Sucessful people are innovators and risk takers that has been proved many times in the world history .
In any field or area , there are so many examples of great achievers who successed just by trying new things and taking more risk in comparision with common man .
I agree with the statement that people who attains goals , achieve sucess do try new and different things and in that way they take more risks .

If a person want to be sucessful then he has to try a new thing simply because if he continues to do what he is doing well then he must be a sucess which he is not .
So to get what he wants he has to try a new way or process .
If we consider a business and economy then Microsoft , Gillette , Ford and many more are the products which have caused revolution when they were introduced but initially they were the risk taken by their owners .
Today they are big sucess stories in the world business .
In science if a professor or scientist want to invent something then he has to try few things and use new methods , in a way they all are risks .
If they keep doing what they were doing before will they get success , surely the answers is negative .

There are many disadvantages of trying new things which includes lack of information and knowledge , economic risk and the risk of failure .
It is very safe to do what we are doing best and we already know how to do it .
There is a saying that contented people can never gain success as they are satisfied with what they are doing .
The thing which a person is doing well that was also new when he first started .
At the initial stages of the process he was not knowing that he would be doing exceptional in it .
But he tried that new thing and now he is doing very well .
So one thing is for sure to do well at one thing the new risk has to be taken .

For a lot of people , to take a risk is not considered a good thing and I believe that is the main reason that we do n't find too many successful people .
We forget that when we started walking , when we learnt driving , all were new things at that time .
There was a risk involved also .
If we would bot have done that what would have happened .
So to get somthing we have to take a risk and we have to try new thing .
