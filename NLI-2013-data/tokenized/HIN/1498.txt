The topic `` whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or have specialised knowledge '' is subjective .
In my opinion having specialised knowledge is more important than having little knowledge of every field .
I support my opinion by an adage `` jack off all and master of none '' as per the adage a person who knows bits and pieces of all the subjects but does not have complete knowledge of one field end up knowhere .
A specialisation is must because if person tends to select a career path the he must be focused on following it , he must be able concentrate on his or her desired field without bieng distracted by other influences , For example many people tend to switch careers because the pay is good or work is less taxing , they tend to obtaind knowledge of other areas which may be beneficial , but as trends change the motivation also change .
i.e if the particular field gets to crowded then people tend again to switch their area of expertise .
In doing so people may intially get better pay for their skill in different departments , but when it comes to progress they may find themselves at lower postion then if they had specialised in a particular area and waited for better opportunities Secondly having broad range of knowledge in itself is not detrimental If a person is able to keep with developments and progresses that are being made , In this fast changing world thing get outmoded quickly for eg in the it world people tend learn a lot new computer languages but as technologies develop some of them get outdated So a person must be able to keep up with progress .
Having said this , it is not humanly possible for each human being to keep himself updated with myriad of changes taking place in limited time he has each day Thirdly it is not only the knowledge in the different academic fields that matter it is the application of the knowledge practically that matter If a person is not able to apply himself or use a skill practically than the skill is worthless For eg if a person has knowledge in the following areas computers , medicine , law : all disparate field with little or no relation to each other and he cannot repair a computer when the situation demands or save a person when he is ill then the knowledge in different areas is of no use unless he able to do complete justice to all the fields Having said this having basic knowledge in some fields which is required for day to day functioning is good for eg basic computer knowledge is required in almost all offices in addition to basic knowledge it is necessary that person must specialise in particular area so that he can continue to prove his worth to employer and continue to progress in his carees In conclusion It is better to specialise in particular academic subject than to try to gain knowledge of all areas and as result end without proper direction to one career specialisation bring a sense of accomplishment which diversifying cannot
