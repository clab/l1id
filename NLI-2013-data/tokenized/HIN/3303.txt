In the modern era , where it is an era of Technology and Science , the upcoming young generation is faced with enormous challenge .
They have to preserve their cultural , social roots and at the same time keep abreast with the latest technological developments to have a decent standing in the society .
I personally feel , in between these challenges the young people nowadays do not have enough time for helping their communities .

The first thing that comes to my mind , as a part of young generation is to get a good education , good job and be stable economically .
In the modern compititive world , it has become so tough to keep up with this challenge that almost all of the time is eaten up concentrating on this single goal .
A youngster in modern era , is most consumed with this challenge that he forgets his commitments to the community to where he belongs .
If I consider my own example , I find myself guilty of the same thing , I am so much engrossed in my studies and thinking about future that I am not able to denote much time to the community .
I personally want to devote time to help the community where I was born and brought up , and give something back to the society , but at the moment I think of that I find myself constrained by my socio-economic condition and the inability to do so .

One of the major factors which I have noticed in the upcoming younger generation , is the loss of values and feeling of belonging to the community where they live in .
They consider it just any other thing in their life , and are mainly concerned with their enjoyment and their life .
As the facts in a lot of newspapers in India suggest , that a majority of upper class youngsters , who are not constrained economically and financially , prefer going to night clubs and parties to community helping , or tyring to help anyone in general .
I do n't have to go much farther to find examples of such cases , if I look around my college , and students with not much financial constraints would at any time prefer to go to a club or a movie to enjoy rather then to help anyone .

Even in today 's modern world , I do find some young people willing to take up the challange and improve the society which they are a part of .
A very good example of this would be YFE ( Youth for Equality ) organization formed by university stuents , in Delhi , India , to fight against the reservations in the educational system on the basis of caste , which was imposed by Govt .
of India .
Seeing their example , I am sure that some of the youths contribute to the society and country .
The only concern is that such number of organizations and people are very less compared to the total number of youths in the country .

If we look at the personal life of an average life on an youngster today , in most of the cases we will find that they are not very emotionally stable themselves .
They are very much confused about what to do and what not to .
In the modern generation , in most of the cases with both the parents working , the kids who form the young generation do not get to know their value system .
In absense of guidance of their parents , they usually do not understand their responsibilities towards the society , country and moreover to humanity in general .

I would conclude that , in general young people do not give enough time to help their communities , but the reasons for this are varying and are different for every young member of the modern society .
For some people it might be the socio-economic constraints , for others it might be due to the loss of values .
I firmly beleive if given the right direction and guidance , the young generation would realize that what they are missing on and definitely give more time to help their community , society , country and humanity .
