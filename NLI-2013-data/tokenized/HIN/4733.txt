Nowdays , before the launch of the any product it is usually advertised .
The advertisement of any product helps alot in its marketing .
Advertisements are so catchy that makes the viewers to think over the product and sometimes they are convinced to buy it .
But usually it has been observed that the actual product is so effective as shown in the advertisements .

I have been also misleaded by one of the advertisements .
I was having dark circles under my eye .
So , one of my friends suggested me an under eye gel .
She came to know about the gel from its advertisement .
In the advertisement it has been given that it will decrease the dark circle .
And one have to be regular in applying it .
The course period was about 3 weeks .
So , I tried the under eye gel .
In first few weeks it was giving positive results but as the time passed I noticed wrinkles under my eye .
And my dark circle were also not improving .
The gel has the side effect of causing wrinkles to my skin .
And was not helpfull in clearing all darkness .
I was really dissappointed by this .
So by this I came to learned that product in the advertisements are sometimes are much better than they actual are .
The advertisement companies do this in order to promote their product .
But they actually are foolishing the customers .

Like this there are several examples .
Another example can be the good , actractive packing of the candies , toffees , icecreams and etc. but in actuall they can be tasteless .
Also this in dress materials this is been seen .

Thus from the above points I believe that advertisements does n't given the actual picture of the product .
