According to me having a broad knowledge is important at the biginning stages of your knowledge building .
It serves as the base or foundation for your knowledge .
For me having the ability to contribute in every possible field in acadamic subjects is the great thing .
The main reason for this is my excitement and quick grasping power which attracts me to the every new and different thing around me .
I prefer to have every possible knowledge of all the subjects .
This developes interest and also helps to experience more number of fields rather than many things in same field .

By having broad knowledge of many subjects makes average level of knowledge very high .
but by speciallising in one subjects restricts the growth of knowledge in other subjects and also it has a specific limit .
What after that limit ? , when you know everything in the same subject .

For me its important to know more about many things than knowing everything about one thing .
For example in any industry , the main work consists of many small works such as machine handling , actually working on that machine , its maimtainance , repairing ant many things like this in many regions .
Here its not possible to solve every problem by only one specialist .
Because he has the knowledge about one thing only .
So he cant help for the other problems .
Here the role of generlist is important .
He has answers for many things and in many fields .
we can say manager .
Manager is called so because he can manage all things .

So i prefer to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects and thats why the are being introduced , thats why they are being teached .
Otherwise people will have one subject only .
which cannot work .

In todays world you cant live with knowledge of only one field .
More the knowledge more you can grow .
For me being a jack of everything is the best way to grow in knowledge .
