Yes i completely agree with this fact that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The world is progressing towards the scientific world in which there might be a possilbility that there will be invention of some other alternative which will replace the present day car to some extent .

As we all know that in big cities there is big problem of space .
Now why space is a required ?
the answer is in big cities due to large population one requires space in which he can have his living and other things safely placed ; what we call it a house , also if one is owning a house he will own a car and due to limitation of space one has to accomdate both his house as well as cars .
Also big cities have big shopping malls where lots of people come to shop and to have some kind of entertainment .
And there comes the problem of parking of the cars .

At present every big city is facing the problem of parking , so twenty years from now the problem will get worsen .
So the solution to this problem will be person will limit the use of cars .

Also the problem of traffic is there in big cities , Car require a large space to move on the road as compared to two-wheeler vehicles .
One of the problem that today big citiy is facing is of traffic due to large number of cars in the city .

Also petrol will going to get exhausted after 30 years from now and the major requirement for a car is fuel .
Also some research is going on about the alternatives of the fuel but it is still in the developing stage no one has assured uptill today that the solution to the fuel problem is overcome .

The technology is improving day by day and there is a possibility that very soon our scientists will devise such a equipment which will require less space and will have some alternative option for its functioning and will not require a fuel which is likely to extinguish .

So i conclude that by taking in to consideration the above stated problem , in my view there is a possibility that people will use fewer cars in future .
