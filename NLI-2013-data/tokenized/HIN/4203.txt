Young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their communities .
I strongly disagree with this statement because nowadays young people are very liberated in their views .
they are far more better educated then their parents or the older society .
and this eduaction and knolwege help them to think which thing or deed is more beneficial for the whole socitey or their community .

like , due the the knowledge of the science and technology they are in better position to help the community by gving them the information about epidamics and deasices like malaria , AIDS , hepititis A , B and C.and almost every young human being is doing so by just taking the jobs like scientist , doctors , working in a NGO , etc .

secondly they know all the mistakes and wrong decision taken by their parents , relatives , society or even goverment in the past .
for an example young people of every nation now do n't want war and they actively protest this .

young people now are more interested in the progress of their own country .
and thus they always trying to make the country better by working hard for the technological advancement , much better standard of living .
they are more wiling to go outside their country to gain knowledge and use that in their own country .
for an example many young people from developing countries go to another develpoed country for their higher studies and then after returning they use thier skills and knowledge to help the progress of their country .

finally , young people always make sure that they do n't do anything which can harm in anyway their community or society .
