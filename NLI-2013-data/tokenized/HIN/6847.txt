As it is rightly stated by someone that ` PREVENTION IS ALWAYS BETTER THAN CURE ' .
The world is looking to this by saving and preventing the extreme use of natural resources .
So I definitely agree with the idea or statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
To support this I would like to state few of my views as follows .

In my coutry like India , where there is tremendous population and for travel purpose there is enormous number of vehicles .
More vehicles talk about the private vehicles especially cars , which is used as mode of transport for the entire family , or say individual car for each family member .
Just imagine what do they do ?
They only add to the pollution of the environment .
As in air , noise and water pollution .

It does not only add pollution but also wastage of natural resources like petrol and diesel .
And for this we have to depend on the gulf countries .
Wherein it is only upto the economical crisis , which indirectly is seen in hiking prices of petrol .

What when this resources gets over , traveling will not only become expensive with other alternatives but also impossible one day .
Some western country have accepted the fact and started more conventional , cheaper and better way of traveling .
Like traveling on cycles to their work places , places where they have to visit often .
By cutting down on air and noise pollution , I think that 's a very wise decision one can take , in order to prevent future problems .
Also travelling on bicycle , one can do cycling exercise everyday which is always good for one 's health .

I think that it is smart decision , if taken by our govrnment can prove tremendously useful well on which government is already thinking .
And be a ` stepping stone ' to prevent hazardous problem .
And with this thinking and implication in future definitely I think that there be reduction in private vehicles especially the cars in next twenty years .
