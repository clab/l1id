Younger people try to enjoy each and every moment of their life to the full of their capabilities because this is the only time in which there mind is devoid of all sorts of worries and tensions which they have to face in future to acheive their destined goal .
This is the time when they have many friends around them to enjoy with , .
share feelings and emotions .

At this age person is free to go anywhere he wants to go to enjoy .
Also they are physical and mentally healthy ..
but in the old age a person cannot enjoy as he enjoys when he is young because their are several problems like degrading health day by day , few friends to share feelings .
for example if a person is young and he/she had to entertain himself or enjoy he can go to beach , dance party .
movie , picnic etc but same is not the case with the older people .
another example is that young people doesnt have responsibilites or boundations as older people have so their mind is free from all sorts of problems ..

To sum up , I agree with the given statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do because this only the time when they are free from boundation , responsibilities and also problems , sufferings which they have to face in future while attening their goal .
and another thing is that young people at this time is physical fit to partcipate in any sport and event to entertain themself .
