When we peek outside our houses the thing we can find in abundance outside our houses and on the roads is unrefutedly the Cars in different designs and colors .
The cars have changed the way we travel .
The invention of cars have brought a kind of a revolution in the times .
In addition to making the conveyance easier to saving time to accessing the remote areas cars have done almost everything to make our life more comfortable .
With the changing technologies and increasing economic growth i dont believe that the next twenty years in any way see a reduction in the cars .
This will be mainly because of the demand , advancement and status these four wheeled wonder is going to bring about .

With the increase in the pocket income and incentives more and more people will be able to buy the cars .
After all who wants to experience the overcrowding in the buses and trains and the waste of precious time these inconvenient travelling measures bring about .
The another factor which will increase the demand is the population growth .
With the population of the world sky rocketing the number of people who can avail the benefits of cars will increase and so do the cars .

Also with the advancement in the technology we will witness a whole new genre of cars in the next twenty years .
When people see something new and innovative they have a urge to buy it even though they may be having an absolete version of it .
So there may be many people with two or three cars in the next coming years .

Cars are frequently being associated with the social status of the people .
The people try to get everything that will elevate their status .
In many families we see peolpe having many cars .
One for going to office and other for social parties , other for children and hence enhancing their status with each car .
With these kind of social attitudes the sale of cars is definitely going to increase .

So we dont see any reason why the sales of cars will decline and we will see fewer number of cars in the years to come .
Though the excessive use of cars will create problems like traffic jams , chaos for parking , pollution and petroleum problems .
But these problems will find a suitable solution .
It just only needs cooperative effort and thinking .
So in the next twenty years we will witness more and also attractive cars down the road .
