The youth of this generation , who have been able to create a place of their own , who have been able to mark a positon in the society are the young people of today 's world .
They are able to make up to this position through a hard toiled path which includes their own efforts as well as their parents and elders views and difficult sacrifices made by them .
Many such succesful people unlike a few are very much known about the facts leading to their success .

so I strongly disagree to the statement .
Youth these days are definately giving enough time to help their communities .
They thank and are grateful to all those people who have helped them taste the sweet fruit of success .
I have seen and have encountered many such great acheievers who not only devote themselves entirely to their own work , but also squeeze out enough of time for helping others in their times of needs and thus solve their problems .

For instance the Alva brothers , who own a production company of their own .
They produce and direct environment awakening programmes that are in the benefit of nature .
Along with this they very inquisitely take part in the functions and programmes related to nature to bring about an awarness They are helping out people who need them , they manier times take up many honourary works to support them .
Thus they are doing a lot to support their community who have helped them to come up .

Such successful people , once they have achieved success and reached the peak , always strive for others , especially their own family members and relatives as well to reach a higher postion as them .
But this happens only if the others show an interest or are willing to do something great .

Such people work 24/7 nonstop manier times .
An instance for this are many Doctors and Physicians .
Their parents sacrifice a lot , so that their sons/daughters can mark a place , and after getting success , these doctors devote themselves entirely to the wanting people , the diseased people who are in need of them .

Mother teressa in her youth days is also a great example to be looked upon .
She devoted her life from her youth till her last breath to the cause of humanity and supporteding her community .
