I agree with the statement `` It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
Knowledge is the underlying point here in the statement , enough about a single subject or a substantial amount of many subjects .
The main idea , of having a broad knowledge is far more beneficial than to specialize in one specific subject .

Knowledge has to be something which is diverse , not just about a single field or a subject .
It has to be a collection of everything .
Being in touch or knowing things at a broader level has much more to do in today 's competitive world .
Although we require specialists too , but diversity is what is needed more .
In terms of studying subjects , sticking to one field or topic definitely limits one 's potentials .
Whereas studying subjetcs at a broader level adds to a more intellect and a overall study .
A person , specializing in a particular field or a subject remains limited to that field itself .
Therefore , resulting in a kind of ignorance of the other fields or the subjects around .
In contrast , a broad study of different subjects keeps a finger on every field around .

For example : A person studying Physics or specialising in this particular subject , will remain very centered around the subject alone .
Going thorough with the subject , even in Physics the person will needs to have some knowledge about an another subject , say , ` Mathematics ' during his study .
So in such a case , he/she will have to seek some other individual 's help .
In other words the person is not fully equipped with all , he needs to complete his work .
Had the person have had studied different subjects , it would have been fare more easier .
A person who has a broad knowledge of various subjects ( physics and maths too ) , is capable enough of solving things by himself/herself and also at a much broader and higher level .
And moreover having a broad knowledge increases a person 's over all grip on diverse fields and areas of study .

Finally , rather than being immersed in a single field of knowledge , it is more beneficial to have a broad knowledge of different fields .
In simple words , as the word ` broad'itself implies and suggests in having a more broader vision , understanding , and above all a better practical application of knowledge .
