I disagree with the statement , In my opinion it is better to be specialized in one subject field .
In todays world where the economy is growing at an uncontrolable speed , every industry is no less than a global giant , every field is becoming a money minting arena , in such an environment is will be a gross mistake to have a broad knowledge .
Specialization gives one an indepth of the subject .
It gives one the chance to excel and give ones hundered percent to a specific field .
It makes us clearly see our weaknesses and strenghts and helps us to evaluate ourselves and see where we really stand .
Broad knowledge is like a half baked story where one is not exceling in any specific field .

One can pick any field , art , business , music or even politics , everything requires the best peopleand those kind of empoyees who know their subject backwards .
In such a senario one cannot take a chance by having a broad grip on all subjects .
A situation such as this would only create doubt and ultimately a low pay or unemployment .

There is another alternative to this dillema and that is that alongside being specialized in any one field one can also have a hobby .
For Example , a film star , She loves her news coverage , her fame , her glory , her fortune , but there are times when everyone wants to forget their work and find themselves by doing things that they enjoy .
She can do social sevice or something small like pottery or photography at a hobby .

` If a bird spreads its wings beyond its reach , it will crash ' .
Thus , according to me it is more sensible to choose one line of work and excel in it .
But yes sometimes we must retrieve and pursue other samll activities as well .
