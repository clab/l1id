I totally agree with the statement that ` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . '

Ideas and concepts are quintessential for the development of understanding , propagation of thoughts and enrichment of students .
There is a very strong relation and link that exists between learning of concepts and the ideas that lead to these concepts , or how the ideas are generated and are derived from a particular concept .
All this forms the very basis of knowledge and understanding .
Mere learning of facts without a background would be as futile an activity as dividing a number by zero .

For students or for any learner for that matter , what matters the most is a strong foundation that lies in conceptual knowledge .
Only if the student has the basics right , he can go on and challenge a plethora of theories or formulate hypothesis , proceed towards solving challenging problems , look at things from different perspectives , analyse situations and , may be , develop his own viewpoint on it .
Learning concepts , ideas and also the interrelation between the two , leads a student to build up a knowledge that is relevant or can be definitely counted on .

Take for instance in mathemetics if a student knows the fact that 2 plus 2 is 4 , but does not know how to determine it , the fact would be of no avail .
Similarly if a student of chemistry knows that water is formed by hydrogen and oxygen , but does not understand how the process has taken place the fact will be a non progressive one .
Same goes for other subjects as well .

Hence , it is absolutely necessary for a student to understand the concepts and ideas and then , if necesary , proceed towards the facts .
