Every person has their own definitions for enjoyment which might even change according to the various stages of lifes .
I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Their is a vast age gap between the people compared who are in different phases of their lifes .

Young people enjoy life from their pure heart .
they can do the activities which makes them happy , excited and feels them elevated on top of this world .
No matter how small the task they have done they enjoy it completely .

In contrast the expertise of life . , ie the old age people enjoy their life for the matter of satisfaction .
At this age they start living for their children , their family .
They will be ready everytime to compromise their dreams for the sake of their children .
At this age they start thinking that they had lived their life completely now its the time of their children to live life , As the person grows older the problem of ego starts , he has to maintain his dignity according to his profession , the status in the society do matter , all these things deprives them from the pleasure that they could experience by doing few things which is really going to make them happy .

young people , specially the children can perform certain activities which cannot be posssible in the case of old age like asking few silly questions to their mothers which mothers do reply patiently , playing in muddy waters , children as such do not have any responsibilites on they shoulders .
Coming to the adolascents , they do enjoy lifes but here the definition of enjoyment changes .
They imagine themselves as independent individuals who has entered a competitive world which is even filled with fun and entertainment .
They have a huge responsibility on their shoulders of leading a successfull life .
They are the young bloods who can party hard , work hard and accept the challenges of their lifes .
In accomplishing them they gain experience and they even enjoy the difficulties faced by them .

Every person should enjoy till the time they are alive in this world .
They should look their life as a challenge and face it darely and enjoy every aspect of it .
Young people enjoy more compared to others .
