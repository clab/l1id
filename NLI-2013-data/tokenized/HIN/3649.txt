I do certainly believe that there has been a marked shift from the past in the attitude of young people with respect to their community .
Though it will be unfair to generalize this to all young people , but most of the young people today show little concern for their community they live and dwell in .

The younger generation today is much more concerned about their own future and well being and in this pursuit , they sometimes tend to neglect their communities completely or are just not able to afford much more time for it .
They do not shy away from exploiting the resources of their community to climb up the ladder of their own success .

In my day to day experiences , I have seen teens and students just littering away the wastes in the premises they live in .
They sometimes tend to scratch and damage the property which is there for evryone to use .
I am not sure what pleasure do these people derive by doing such activities but the fact of the matter is that they usually do it .
If they can not help the community atleast they should not damage it further .

To quote a personal experience , there was a friend of mine who was being offered the post of district magistrate of the town he has lived in from his birth .
He did all his schooling from that town .
He was a bright student and that is why he was able to get the post of district magistrate .
He always used to carp about lack of infrastructure of the town like frequent power resources , insufficient water supply etc .
Thus , he was never satisfied with the authorities .
But he himself got the post and got the opportunity to do something for the community , he just declined the job for a more lucrative job offer abroad .
Thus , when the actual time came to perform duties towards his community , he didnt take up the responsibilty .
This goes onto explain that young people usually d not give enough attention and help to their own community .

But , as I said before , this pattern cannot be generalized to whole lot of younger generation .
I believe that the success stories of people who do give help to their community will inspire those who shy away .
