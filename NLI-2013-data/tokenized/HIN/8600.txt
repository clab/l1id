I am agree with the point that the it important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn the fact The main resion behind of is that if a student want to be last long good students then in that case he/she will has to learn the basic things behind , which will still with his for whole life and when ever in the life he will be needing it will be just recalled by him .
Only those people can perform well in the platform of the life who was a good student in the past .

What I think is that only knowing the fact is creating the shortcut to learn the things , ya it helps sometimes but not always that why it is very much nessary to learn the things by the understanding the ideas and the conceots .

In future what will happen that if a student was not a good student in the early stages then in that case he would be also not a good teacher , i.e. he can not explain or transfer the fact to the others .

And to support my openion I am taking my own example - When I was a student in the college ( Engineering college ) then in that case my favourite topic was the Explosive and rock type ( Mining Engineering topic ) .
So , I took that topic with very much interest and the result is now I am getting today when I joined a company then it was a co-incident that i was putted in the drilling & blasting department and on the 14th day I had managed by owm a blast in that perticular mine .
And very soon I got the authorisation of the blasting in that mines in the 6th month , which is record for that mine , which only my personal openion .
So , here all credit will automatically go to those classes where I was provided the idea and the concept of the thing .

So , I am thankful to my proffesor who tought me so well , and I would like to pray with the God to provide the professor of that kind to other students also .
So , students should pay attention in the class .
