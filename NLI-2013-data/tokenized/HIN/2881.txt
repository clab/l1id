So , how would you feel an elderly person watching a soccer match and shouting at peak of his voice .
he has his goggles on , a bear can in hand , and say , England flag painted on him .
Wo n't you feel a bit annoyed by the scene .
Yes , its true that every diffrernt age group has a particular way of enjoying and even enjoying their joy .
But , it 's quite a bit clear that young people enjoy thier lif to fullest than the aged .
Just looking at the energy of the youngsters , the ways they enjoy and with no pressure of being ashamed , if seen by any one .

The main pointof diffrentiation in youngster and an eldrly person is the energy .
With body getting older , it tend to loose its energy and even the muscles weakens .
When young all the body cellls are young and can store and diliver the maximum energy requied .
So with this we can go on traking , dance , jump , play , and many more things .
But due to lack of energy elderly people cannot enjoy much , especially the things requiring more energy .

Another good reason supporting my point is , number of options available .
You just cannot expect an old man to go for cycling round the beach for 10km daily .
With sour joints , he has to bring lot many limitations to the kind of work he can do .
In contrast , young men and women have many opitions open in the ways they can enjoy .
A person fond of biking can go on long ride every week end , or an athlete can have a mounatin traking program set .
Along with this physically exhaustive joys , a girl willing o dance can take dance lessons and perform whenever she feels down .

Last in the list , and one of important factors of social life is fear of being caught .
With increasing involvement in social life , each has o take care of his image in public .
So the ways to enjoy the life get limited down for a man ho has lived much of his life than a yougster .
If a company boss is seen freaking around on beach is definitely pointed ou , but , if it 's his son is surely admired .

Thus to conclude with , I can only say that though youngsters have more ways to enjoy life than elder people , one can surely define his enjoyment .
Defining it we can be happy with what we have , with no greed for what we do n't .
