You are active enough when you are young and this enables young ones to go for making enjoyment .
The word ` enjoy ' can be defined as the way by which people feel themselve happy and which gives a feeling of satisfaction .
In my opinion there isnt any distinction for enjoyment because everybody is unique in there enjoyment .
I am giving following reasons for holding this opinion .

Some young one takes enjoyment in doing crazy things .
They feel that doing something crazy will give them enjoyment while other may look it as risky thing which will not give any kind of enjoyment .
There is feeling of adrenaline rush which is enforced within the crazy performers , when they do some crazy things like making a jump from high altitude place , or making something different from the world .

In case of elderly persons , their ways of enjoyment are diffrent they like to read novels , magzines or some religious literature .
They will not perform any other physical activity .
This does n't mean that they are enjoying less .
Their ways and views towards this phenomenon is different that the young ones .
Some may like to talk they may feel enjoyment in talking about memories of there time or talking about one of the friend of them .
There are many number of ways to feell enjoyment and to make enjoyment .

Moreover today the most prominent problem of world is depression which people gets from their job work or any other stressfull comdition .
So everybody tries to get relaxed from that and want to get some kind of feeling of rest .
So they tries to grab every opportunity which they get for making an enjoyment .
Therefore you can observe many people doing some crazy things while othere simply watching them and stilla making enjoyment in their life .

To conclude , there should not be any distinction between young and olderone about who enjoys more and who dont .
Everybody is having their ways of enjoyment for them .
