I agee with the statment that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept rather than to learn facts .
It is era of t science and technoly .
Growth of a nation dependes upon how much innovative they are .

If we talk in term of the student academic preview , a student who focuses on the concept rather than the facts can easly come across the acts .
For example if we know the concept and idea to develop a model then there is no need to focus to learn the model .
By knowing the concept and idea one would develop the model .
That is why , it is always advisable to know the root .

Iooking on the historical development of diferent coutries of the world , a clear picture emerges .
Those who had walked together with the new ideas and science , now they are in the llist of developed world and those who were behing now standing the row of developing world .
For a countinous developmemt of any nation , it need to add always some innovative and new ideas in differenet spares .

Let us look on the example how idea and concept is more important than leaning facts .
At a certain point of time , It was a known fact of xerox , copier and phone and people were using in their daily life .
But it was the idea which thought about the fax machine on the concept of xerox , copier and phone and made a fax machine and added a new thing in the society .

This not apply in terms of innovation of products only but also in the day to day life .
In a business world also the companies who are applying only facts are now going to the back burner .
Those coming applying new ideas with the existing concept are coming on the frontline .
