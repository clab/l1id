Trying new things and taking risks are two very important factors to succeed in life .

To begin with , trying new things actually gives a person a chance to find out what exactly is the person good at and where does his interest lie .
I feel its very important to do something in life which interests you and excites you .
This always drives you to give your best in whatever you are pursuing .
One who doesnt try different things in all probability will be doing the same thing throughout his life and may be in the later years it will be more for the sake of doing it and not because he enjoys it .

Sachin Tendulkar , world famous cricketer is a tenth grade drop out !!
He did make an effort to study but that never interested him and he had family to support him and who encouraged him to follow his dream rather than following the conventional model of keeping the studies at priority instead of sports or music .
But at that point of time Sachin Tendulkar and his family did take a risk and did something uncoventional and today he 's one of the most influential persons in the world !!

Another thing which is worth mentioning is , that once people become successful they are in a better position to take risk because of strong financial , social and political support .
eg a famous industrialist who has his business in IT sector can think of venturing into health care industry which is poles apart from his expertise .
But , with the right planning , organisation and support he can do wonders and expand his business into alltogether different field .

So , I strongly feel that having the courage to try different things in life and taking risk can lead one towards success and with success comes the liberty and ease with which one can further take risks and succeed to greater heights in life .
