`` Adolescence is the golden phase of life '' .
This statement will definetly support my idea that young people truly enjoy life more than older people .
One always remembers the life which he has lived during his early years .
It is always hidden as beautiful memory in some corner of their mind .
The young generation loves to face challenges , they are filled with energy , they have nothing to worry about .

Young generation truly love to do experiment with their life , this may be sometimes dangerous but they do learn alot from it .
They take every event or task as a challenge and then strive hard to complete it .
Even though they fail in their first attempt , they never give up and hence they learn how to live an enjoyable life .
This can be seen from an example that when a young boy tries to make some device , he faces failure in the very first attempt .
But then he tries to put more of his creativeness and develops new model .
This is why technology is advancing with such a rapid speed and the world is getting acquainted with new innovations .

Young generation is always filled with immense energy .
Taking example of various scientists like Einstein , Newton it can be seen that these people have created history because they had that unlimited energy to keep experimenting things until a final conclusion is not reached .
As young people are continously doing something or the other , they are never exhausted neither do they feel lazy .
This results in their better health .
They do not have to be depended on those highly expensive pills nor do they have to take some medecines as a substitute for food because all organs of their body are well functioning .

The most crucial secret behind the enjoyable life that young people enjoy is that they are free from all bondages .
They do not have any load of responsibilities , they treat themselves as free lancer and plan their living according to their own benefits and pleasure .
Niether they have to go to work and take responsibilities at the office nor they have to keep thinking about their home chores .
They can share responsibilities but they do not have to carry it as a burden over their head .

Thus , by summarizing all the above points and example it can be seen that young people have an aim in their life and this is the most vital reason why they enjoy living a better life in comparison with that of the old ones .
