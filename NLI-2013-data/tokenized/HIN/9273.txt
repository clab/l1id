The statement points to a very positive and successful tip for enlightment of every student 's academic career .
Therefore , I totally agree with the statement .

In the changing world of new upcoming ideas and concepts , it can be easily seen that the basic entity being very conventional .
So , if this convention or initial model is not well understood , the whole further theory would sound unacceptable and hard to follow .
In the later stages , situation of being in a state of total blank of the whole model can arrive .
It will be very difficult to switch back at the basics at that moment because the course has taken a speedy track .
Neither the students would be able to cope up with the lectures nor will they participate in the interactive session of the teaching , thereby leading to a bad impression upon the professor .

Learning the facts will not only be difficult but also very confusing .
There will be numerous facts that the student will have to cram up which is not an easy task to go ahead with .
Moreover , a situation may arise wherein the student finds himself in the utter world of contradiction , since he did not pay attention to the basic ideology in picture , or the fact that he is trying to mug up is entailed with a certain ideology very conceptually , which he merely ignored .
The art of learning facts rather cramming I would say , is not a key towards the long term success .
Personal satisfaction is major point one should lay stess upon .
Naturally , it will not give innate satisfaction with the art of learning without understanding .
An individual will not feel the real content of the course he studied .
It will be very superficial kind of studying technique he will be adopting by ignoring various basic logics to be understood .

The very obvious example to refer is the regular course or bachelor degree the student is pursuing .
The basic idea behind every course of study is the implementation of the same in the real life i. e. education for the real world .
A crammer will not remember anything , the ideologies , the concepts , the implementation whereas a mindful attitude will be a positive outlook towards basic entity of understanding and cracking the every problem faced in a coherent manner .
