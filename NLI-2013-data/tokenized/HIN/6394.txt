A car , today , is a necessity for many people .
Saying that , in twenty years from now , there will be fewer number fo cars is not true .
Cars today have become passion for the people , a status symbol and if someone does n't own , he or she dreams about owning a car .
They work hard to achieve their dreams .

Although , many people points out that fossil fuels is getting expensive and we are using it up at a very fast rate .
This will lead us to a time , when there will no fossil fuels .
But these people are not aware that , a lot of research has been done to find an alternative fuel .
These days , we have cars available which do n't run on petrol or diesel but on hydrogen ( known as fuel cell cars ) .
This fuel has one more advantage of not polluting our environment .
Even companies have produced cars which run on both petrol and electricity ( better known as , hybrid cars ) .
So , there will be fuel available in future for our cars to run .

Moreover , for most people cars have become necessity rather than comfort .
People are growing richer due do booming economy and higher pays .
so , they love the comforts provided by the cars .
Today 's youngsters are , even , more crazy about cars .
Every teenager has a dream ( either known to him or hidden ) to own a specific car .
They will be the consumer of tomorrow .
Its clear form this fact also that , in future there will be people to buy the cars .
They may want to show-off or enjoy a ride with love ones or go on a long drive to relieve stress but one thing is for sure cars will always be in fashion .
The number of cars will be more in future as compared to today .

As evident form the recent news that all the major car making companies in the world , like ford , ferrari , toyota etc. , are expanding their production capacity .
If more cars are being manufactured than they previously were , then how can we expect that there will be a decrease in the number of cars in future .
