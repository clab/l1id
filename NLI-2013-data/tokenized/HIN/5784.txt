I dont personally believe that after twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today .
There can be many claims supporting it .
The world is progressing fast and making advancement in each and every field .
The major advancements are in the field of science and technology .
There has been continuous attempts to improve and develop newer and more cars .

Time is very precious for every individual .
Suppose you have to attend a very important meeting and ypu plan to take a bus or a metro , if you are lucky you get the conveyance the moment you reach , but wat if you just missed the bus .
Then , to your utter dissappointment you will have to wait for the next bus , which obviously means that you 'll reach late at the meeting or will have to miss the meeting , if it happens that that day there all the buses n other conveyance are stopped .
Either of it will put a bad impression on the other staff .
Cars , though not the fastest but are most efficient and easy mode of travel if a person has to travel a short distance .

Now about the long journey like the cross country journey , obviously its not very feasible to use a car for it .
As it will amount to a large petrol consumption and will often be more expensive .
But some people who are nature lover , and enjoy watching nature and greenary prefer using car .
For long distance travel , the flight being cancelled and late can cause a delay and also various other inconvenience to the passengers .
To cater to these needs of a person and most importantly to save time , the demands of the cars are increasing , and thus its number is increasing .

Though we have many efficient and comfortable conveyance like aeroplane , metro train , but at times they may take up more time than cars .
And as the world 's becoming fast day-by-day , our need to save time and thus our need of car is increasing day by day .
The technological development being made also favors and increase to increase profi
