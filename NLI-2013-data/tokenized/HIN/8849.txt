Education is understanding as well as learning .
In my opinioun it is important for students to learn facts and at the same time also understand ideas .
It depends upon the situations and experiences .

Understanding ideas and concepts is important so as to hnow how things could be .
For example , a concept of driving or like traveling faster to a place gives us the idea of a car .
It tells us to use a car for traveling .
But for travelling a car we have to also need to consider the fuel to be used for it , the cost of driving etc .

Hence the students need to relate their ideas with facts needed for it .
Ideas are more imaginery while facts are practical .
But if we dont imagine or think how can we make things happen ?
But to make a practical thing happen we need to learn certain facts that are necessary to realise the ideas .

For instance , a student thinks to make a garment .
It is firstly important for him to have an idea of what kind of garment does s/he wants to make .
S/he must decide the look of the garment like the colour , the lenght , size etc .
But this is not over .
To make the garment s/he has to know the fact that this will need a fabric to make it , a pair of scissors to cut it and then to sew the garment .
Hence a final product can be made .

Therefore the students do need to understand the ideas and concepts but at the same time also learn facts to realise thier ideas .
Only understanding and conceptualising ideas is not enough for a real thing to be made .
A practical knowledge is also required for a student to be successful in his life .
Hence I think a student should give importance to both , understanding ideas and also learning the practicality of life .
