Intro-advertizements-role-media-halo-role models-glamorize -

The role of media has reached its zenith in this age .
Right from a common daily-need item like a toothpaste , to a something more in vogue like a new designer brand apparel , or of technical importance like a new TV , a automobile , or a Computer-all need the media to make them appealing , or to lure people to buy them-irrespective of whether or not people need them .
Infact , these advertisements `` create a need '' rather than catering to the needs of those who are in the process of making a decision on something they already need to buy .

Advertisements , more than often , project a product in a way that the actual effect of the product advertised falls short of the description !
For example , the advertisements on body creams project such flawless , smooth , enticing bodies , although when used , they do not caste the same glow and charisma to the bodies of those who use them !
Another example is of a stain removers .
Most of them are ineffective , and if they are effective , they ruin the very color of the garment itself along with the stain .
What is annoying is the way they are romanticisedLet aside the ideas presented in which using it would mean adding romance to a moment , or finding the right guy !
Such deceptions of adding extra charm to a product entices buyers .

Advertisements cast a halo around an item , adding glamor to it by choosing attractive models to sell for them .
People , especially younger generation to be more precise , get very affected by looks-outer appearance .
They tend to copy models and movie stars etc .
They are in an age that is very influential .
When these individuals watch their favorite model seeling for something , their first impulse is to buy that item .
In the process , they seldom realize whether the product is worth it or not .
At times it is of no use what-so-ever .
For instance , recently there was an advertisement that flashed on the TV screens , which was unnecessarily glamorized , although the product was anything but glamorous or flashy .
It was an advertisement for a pain relieving pill !
Is it necessary to romanticise something like a pain reliever ?
And who is being targetted ?

Unfortunately , the more vulnerable part of the society-the younger generation becomes a victim .
In my view , such deceptions are harmful .
They do nothing to bulid a society , rather making it dependant on items people would never have needed otherwise .
This does n't mean that advertisements do n't have their place at all .
But if they are more discriminative in their depiction , it would be more fair .
