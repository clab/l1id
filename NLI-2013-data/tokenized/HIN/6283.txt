No , i firmly contradict the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Cars are used for the purpose for the travelling from one part to the another and it is considered luxurious and the most important medium of travelling .
So , we can expect a development in the technology to provide more and more cars which will have a very good mileage and will be comfortable with seats and it 's pick-ups , instead of decline in their numbers in the next twenty years .
Say for examples , there were old fashioned maruti cars ( maruti 800 , maruti van ) and ambassador cars in the 1980s but with the recent development in the technology of cars ( like the maruti suzuki swift , scorpio , TATA indica ) , it has improved the vehicles capability very efficiently .
That is accepted from more individuals that maor and more cars will be seen on the roads in the next twenty years .
So revolution is in all the fields and also in the automobile engineering , so that research will make better cars in future and the purchasers will purchase it and so more cars will be seen .

Another important example is that the busyness of the big cities is more increasing day afterday .
So , we can say that there are more and more cars seen on the roads as it was seen twenty years before and so the predictions are accepted with evidences .

From the pollutio 's point of view it is seen that the city gets heavily polluted due to the carbon monoxide and smoke which is more and more enforced into the air by the vehicles but the increase in the vehicles is the obvious thing from this point of view , and the most important factor from this the increase in the number of cars , purchased by the people and runs on the road with more and more in number day by day .

So , I support the development of technology , So I , not only support the increase in the number of the cars in the next twenty years , but firmly agrees it .
So , the above statement is is not at all acceptable from my point of view .
