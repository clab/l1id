This question is making me to think .
Young people are giving enough time to helping their communities .
I belive they dont .
I can explained my view with many points .
Some of them are as below .
Young people in todays world are busy in themselves .
They start working at early age .
Most of them study and work as a part time .
They are mainly focused on study and work .
They don t have time to thing about their community .
They dont consider it is important for them to help their community .
They don t care about others .

They are clueless about their life and their duties towards their communities .
For e g if you ask any young person what he wants to do to the community .
He will replay that they don t have time for that .
Basically they are busy with something which is not valuable .

They are busy with their own interests .
Some of them enjoy going out , traveling every week ends , goining out to parties and spend their weekends doing nothing but enjoyment .
Then they want toclaim that they don t have time .

It is very difficult task to make them understant that they owe some responsibilities towards the community they belong to .
Having not enough time is not the real reason for that .
Basically they don t have helping attitude in them .
We should help them to realize that they can get time if they want .
If there is will they can .
According to my opinion it s parents duty to make them understand their duties towards their community .
They should take out somr tiome from their schedule and use that time to help their communities .
It is their duty and they should do it without any reason .
They are living here .
