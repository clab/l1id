I do agree with the statment that young people enjoy their life more than an older person .
Every individual in more efficient , strong and lively in the earlier span of life , so its quite obvious that anyone with a wish to enjoy , can really enjoy life at the maximum in his/her early age .

Also one main aspect is the responsibility and work load .
These are the two important features that an old individual has truck load on him/her but a young personnel hardly carry such loads .
They are least with the responsibilities and in turn have a handful time to put in something interesting and adventerous .

Other major reason for young to enjoy is that young age is considered to be the `` age of moulding '' , thus he tries to learn more and more of the things which in itself is an interesting affair because gaining anything new is always fun , even though at times it might be leading to the wrong side of the track , but here we are discussing about enjoying life , so anyone in this young age could easily deviate to a path which might be misleading but still enjoying while on the other hand , an old individual is prone to be afraid of going for something new as he has a lot of responsibilities on him and would have to think about it a hundred times before going for it , so he usually sticks to the orthodox schedule which make make him further more reluctant for going for fun filled part .

But everywhere its not that they dont have the oppourtunity to enjoy instead many-a-times they sacrifice their pleasure for their young ones to enjoy as they also feel that they already have had enough and now its their young ones ' turn to capitalize on the life .

In the end , we can conclude that for many physical and mental reasons old people enjoy considerably less than the young ones .
