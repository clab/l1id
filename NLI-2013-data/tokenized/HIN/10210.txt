I agree with the statement that the sucessfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
This is the human nature to find new ways of life .
His intentions are to increase the more and more knowledge and learn more skills .
Right from the evolution of the humanity , they are inventing the new things and bringing the best metods to improve the life .

It is only due to the risk taking ability that we are in the age of the modern technologies .
If no one took risks in the life there will be nothing now .
You can not say that the new technologies are available without risks .
In this era , we can'nt think without the electricity , aeroplane , satalites and the medical facilities .
All these facilities are achieved by taking life risks .

There are sevral stories of the successful persons who achieved all with thier risk taking ability .
For example the Right Brothers who invented the aeroplane .
They become the inventors by taking the risks .

As people say `` satisfaction is death '' .
This means that we have to find the new ways of life .
We should not stagnate with the old methods and skills .
We have improve them or change them .
We can achieve every thing .
Nothing is impossible in this world .
Peoples are trying to find new horizons in the life .
For example now they are trying to find the new planet to live .

Human is different due to his brain power fropm other animals and with this power he eliminates the impossible word from his life All in all , to get the new things you have to take the risk .
This is the human naure to take the risks and find new paths which can lead him to the new heights .
