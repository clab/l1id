I agree with the statement that ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .
In the following paragraphs i will try to defend my stand using various reasons and arguments .

Any learning process is useful only when it has some real world applications and makes a significant contribution to the life and personality of the learner .
Just take an example of any engineering or science subject .
You know that an induction motor produces electricity in such and such way , and that this type of combustion may give this result .
But what is the use of these facts learned ?
The learning is complete only when you see that motor installed anywhere and doing something that is very useful for the individual or community , like drawing water from a deep bore and when you go to any smelting unit and see the same combustion process being used to process metals and make alloys .

So , we can say that to understand concepts and ideas is actually application based learning whereas learning facts is just theoratical learning .
Unless theoratical learning is complemented with application based learning , the entire learning process remains incomplete for an individual .

This does not apply only to science and technology subjects .
Consider a student of dramatics , studying a subject , say `` Shakspear 's Plays '' .
He can very well learn the entire plot and scenes , story of any play , but how will that do any good to him ?
Only when he is able to understand the messages and implications , like what is the emotional aspect of the play , why is a particular character behaving in a particular manner , what were the circumstances in writer 's life under which he wrote the play , that his learning can be said to be complete .

So we can safely conclude that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .
