It is often believed that successful people love to take risks and new challenges than to carry on with their regular routine .
I agree with this statement and feel that success does play an improtant role in accepting challenges in life Success in any field of life , helps one to think more positive and confident about his/her decision making ability .
It urges one to look for something more in life .
I can give an example here .

When I was a kid , I wanted to learn to ride a bicycle .
After many attempts and repeated falling , I finally got grips with my problem .
It made me happy and I was elated at my achievement .
But my urge did not stop here .
Now I wanted to learn riding a bike , because i felt i can take on this challege effectively .
If I was not successful the first time , i might have not taken any step to learn something new .

Even in a professional environment , the things which u already know make it a routine rather than a challenge .
what keeps any successful man/woman going on in his/her field of work is the enthusiasm to find new challenges and his ability to pursue those challenges .

Today there is cure for cancer .
This could have been possible only because of successful solution by various researchers .
There has to be a success step to climb on for future combacts .

There are people like Bill Gates who saw potential in software , got success which enabled him to expand his creative ideas .
So to some it up , being successful not only gives confidence in taking up new challenges , but also helps in exploring the creative side of a person .
It gives an edge from other people there is an assurance that your idea worked in previous effort , the risk involved is conciderably less .
