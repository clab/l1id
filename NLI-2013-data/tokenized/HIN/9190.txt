I agree to the statement proposed .
In my view it is very important that one shoould undersatnd the ideas and concepts before they sit down to learn the facts .

I would like to support this statement by giving a personal example .
I am a student studying in the 12th grade .
Today the concepts and facts that i need to learn are not very easy .
Definately , a lot of hard work goes into learning them !
But , if i sit down and understand why and what i am doing. , then it definately makes it much simpler for me to go through an entire chapter .
I think this is the case with many of my friends too .

I would also like to put down the fact that i am a student who has shifted from the normal C.B.S.E an indian borad to the International Baccalaureate because of one simple reason .
At my earlier school the standard norm was that of rote-learning .
We would just have to mug up the entire text book and regurgirate it on our exam papers ..
but my current school helps us understand what we are doing .
They make us do activities and give us explanantions on what we are going to do and why .
This really helps me and my peers to learn faster .

So , I very strongly believe that what ever we do has to have a great deal of understandingbehindit , before we jump in to learn the facts .

We should always ask ourselves a set of standard questions before we jump into a task or start learning facts that we dont undersatnd or we dont have the basic knowledge about .
Most importantly , WHY ?
why is it that i'am doing this ?
WHAT ?
what is it that i am doin ?
What am i going to gain out of this ?
WHERE ?
where is it going to leed me ?

I think by answering these questions we make a very good and learned individual .
We do understand and definately , learn better !!
