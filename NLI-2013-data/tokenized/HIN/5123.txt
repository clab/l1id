According to me the advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are .
The sole purpose of advertisements are to promote the sale of a product .
In todays competetive society , the advetisers would do anything to attract our attention .
They put famous celebrities in their adds and pay millions of dollars to the T.V .
stations to broadcast their adds .

Almost all adds are different and inovative , however they all have one thing in common - they all highlight only the good points about their product .
They never inform the consumer what their product lacks .

Often , a person finds a difference of day and night between a product seen in the advertisement and the actual product .
The companies usually ameliorate the appearence of the product when they advertise it , through computer graphics .
They make it more appealing than it really is .

Once I saw an advertisement of an acne face wash .
The results of the product seemed amazing .
The interviews of the users were shown in advertisement .
They were all happy with the product and asked everyone to used the product .
Intimidated by the add , I ordered the product .
The product seemed completely inaffective and useless .
I was dissapointed and from that time on I made a resolution of never using a product without personal research .

Hence , we should not fall prey to the tempting advertisments which the companies show us , since they are far from reality
