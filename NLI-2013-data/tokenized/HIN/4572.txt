On one hand , many people feel that the advertisements create an awareness about the product and product 's features , while on the other hand many people feel that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I also agree that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Due to increased competion in this world , all the producers of a particular product wants to make a claim that their product is the best .
For example , in the cola market , both pepsi and coke claims that their product is the best and contains all the features to make a person happy .
While advertising their own product they also go ahead to criticise the other product .
But the choice of each person varies for a particular kind of product , so I feel that the claim that their product is the best , is over advertisement .

Another example I would like to mention here is about the soap products .
Many soap producers show in their advertisement that due to the usage of their product , a person is looking very young and it is very difficult to guess that person 's age etc .
While making this claim they totally ignore other factors that contributes to this appearance .
A person can not look young by just using a particular soap .
To look young , the person has to eat nutritious food , should exercise regularly and should not have much tensions .
It may depends on lot of other factors too .
But these advertisements totally ignore all these factors .

So I feel that the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are due to increased competiton and desire to succeed in the market .
Due to this competion , while advertising the advertiser ignores lot of other factors which contributes to the desired results in the audience .
