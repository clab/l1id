I fervently agree with this futuristic statement that in twenty years , fewer cars will be in use than there are today .

Firstly , I believe that in the absence of effective and economic solutions to the problem of fuel today , with pollution and traffic on the rise , there is a pressing need to revitalise our public tranport system and take appropraite measures to discourage private transport .
Cars , that are the symbol of private conveyance not only heavily contribute heavily to the increasing pollution in every major city of the world , but is also unnecessarily cluttering up the scarce space that we have left on the earth and its roads .
This also is leading to a disastrous number of road accidents that are the cause of more deaths today than any epidemic or war .
Twenty years from now , I do not see the severity of these problems alleviated unless we take some effective steps as reducing private transport , which I think is inevitable .
In countries of Europe , the private transport even today is minimally used .

Secondly , with globalization all around us , with boundaries of distances , cultures and languages rapidly dissolving , I see the car getting obsolete simply because our needs would be larger .
With technology , I believe that local distances would become inconsequential and cars would give way to more advanced form of travel .
Already , the first space tourist has made a successful trip and is back !

With an Orwellian outlook of the world , I have a dystopic vision of the world ; a world where for stability and efficiency , the state would assume power , where perhaps personal expression is rendered unimporant and the society or the community is primary .
In such a society , the car which is basically a symbol of prestige and status has absolutely no space .

Today , where we stand , with the all pervasive Internet growing beyond limits , in twenty years the world would be more of a virtual community .
You and I would have a more predominant virtual existence than a real one .
Our basic needs to survive everyday , chores that require us to move around on a daily basis would be conveniently done away with with the virtual world .
Believe me , we 'd be thriving on our virtual entity a lot more , depending on it for our daily needs without moving an inch !
What does a car have to do in such a scenario ?

With the above points , I have made a cogent and strong statement asserting that cars have no place in our world twenty years from now .
