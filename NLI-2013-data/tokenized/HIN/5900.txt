In todays scanario it seems that cars are the important part of life and driving a car is status simble .
By viewing the growth in production of cars and uses it seems that in future time all the ways are overcrowded by cars .
But I believe that In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because of Some strong reason like Fuel problem , awairness about pollution and health problem causing by cars .

Fuels are limited on the earth .
In world very small regions are known where fuel are found .
Fuel are the main source of cars .
Due to a large quantity of consumption the scarsity of fuel has been generated and the prices are growing up and up .
So when fuel is ended their is no cars on the road and automatically reduces the cars .

Now people are very well known about the harmfull effect of pollution which is causing by cars after the burning of petrol .
It causes severe health problem like Asthama and other breathe related problem .
People do n't want to take risk on their life .
Pollution also causes the environmental changes by which all the inhabitants are affected .

And the last reasion that due to spending more time in car people are affectd with their back problem and getting fat which causes the disease .
I would like to give an example that in recent newspaper study shows that due to using cars and lacking exercise 60 % people have suffering from back pain in the age of 30 .
so when they consult with the doctor and knew about the reason most of them leave the cars and start the uses of bicycle .

Although it is true that it seems very difficult that the cars are decreased in 20 year but most of the people thinking about bicycle which causes no pollution , and also good for health , also reduses the risk of accident are good for them .
They also adappted cycles and certain countries the cars are also decreases due to awairness of people .
So I belive that in twenty year there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
