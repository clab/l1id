I agree with statment made in the question , As we leave in a earth with land of opportunity for everyone .
It is lies on us how we able to grap the oppotunity we get in day to day life with doing things differently .
and always trying with a different way to make things more better and easier rather then doing the same things which we use to do from long time .
Some times we have to take calculated risk to go for the task which we decided .
It has been described with example .

As in the world of competition every person wo wants to grow up better it has to face the different challange .
many people they do the work as they have been asign or they just keep on doing the same work as they use to do from long time , But succesful person always thing about that work like for acheving some task you try different way to do the things you will able to finish the task very fast and more productive with taking some risk .

Likewise with the example of person who selling fast food product like burger or pizza , we see today many franzise store of them are availble common person who is not able to understand the changing needs of market if they keep on trying to sell their product on traditional way they are out of market today , but the person who made change like to epanding their bussiness with more number of store in franzise way with using new scientfic way making their product more advertise and gives more emphasis on their quality and value for many with taking risk like going public limited or investing in bigger way given huge succes on long term .

With the example of mahatma gandhi who has been succesful in his life and today whole world remember him because of he tried the massage of nonviolance to the people when people they just try on violance to achieve their pogition , he take so many risk like to convise he is a right sometime he use put his life on stake without living with food just convey the massage the strength he had , and he made all the way and he was succesful to get the victory and able give the nation democracy , So i belive it is worth doing thing differnetly rather than keep on doing thing same way so it require lot of new initiatve , idea and courage to go for the thing as per the chaning requirement of life .
And to achiver any higher goal one has to take some risk but that is worth doing to make life more simpler .
