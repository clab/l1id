`` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''
I disagree with this statement becasue this is a statistic based statement .
This is just a general idea that somebody has put forth which does not necessarily need to be true .
My opinion is that people can be sucessful only when they work hard and do what they are good at .

People who know their work are better able to succeed that the people who do not know the material .
People who have a University or College degree on a particular area of expertise have a better chance to succeed in life than the people who have not obtained that certain degree .
Of course , there will be few people who want to try the material , but becasue they are just trying new things does not mean that they will become better than the people who already know the material .
Taking risks and trying new things does not mean that they are going to turn out better than what you are already do .
Suppose there is an Art major who wants to `` try new things '' in Buisness .
Due to the fact that she is an Art major , he or she would have to start from the bottom and work their way up .
It would be harder for them to cope in the buisness career .
They may be able to succeed , but they will not be able to give their maximum potential .
They would give their maximum potential in Art .
Therefore , the person would have a greater chance of having a career in Art rather than Buisness .

You can try new things and if you are able to cope up with the work load and if you are able to understand the material , you may become successful .
The chances are , however , that you would be able to succeed in what you do best .
Trying new things is not a bad idea , but it would not take place of what you originally do best .
