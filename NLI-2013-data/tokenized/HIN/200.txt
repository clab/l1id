Nowadays , the world is moving at such a fast pace that it would be very difficult for me to agree or disagree on whether cars can become fewer , since I ca n't predict what kind of turn the future can take .
So many technologies and various inventions are taking place that it is definately possible for the cars to be fewer in another twenty years .

Cars have become such a necessity in our daily lives that , I feel that cars could probably never cease to be fewer as life goes on .
Cars have brought such a big impact on our lives that it would be impossible to think of a life without cars and basic transportation .
Cars are our way of life - a necessity , which we on any given circumstance ca n't live without .

Our life , thesedays , revolves around going from one place to another , transporting goods and other facilities and other various activities connected with transportation .
To think that twenty years from now there could be fewer cars on our roads , than there are today is not impossible , it is definately a possibility as the world is progressing and coming up with so much newer and varied forms of technologies and ideas .
It would definately be a big misinterpretation of the fact - that the world is n't moving on , if I would say that cars cannot be replaced by something much more sophisticated and efficient for our daily lives .

In today 's world , nothing is impossible .
There is always a possibility for the human mind to come up with anything impossible .
So coming up with a replacement mode of transportation would n't be too diffcult .

Therefore , I would say , that maybe not twenty years from now , but definately somewhere in the future there will be a good and efficient replacement for our cars , thus resulting in fewer cars on our roads .
