I am of the view that the number of cars which will be employed in tewnty years from now will be lesser than the amount present on our roads today .

Global fuel price inflation has reached an all time high .
The prices of transport fuels have become exorbidant .
Buying a car will no longer be a provident option .
This inflation will only compound in the next twenty years and hence the idea of buying a car to the common man will no longer be an attractive option .

The environment is decaying by the minute .
People have begun to realize this threatening trend and are inclined towards a more environment friendly existance .
Cars , with the pollution they emanate do not help the environment at all .
With growing awareness , people will recognize ths danger and abstain from buying cars which are sources of great air pollution .

The world 's poplutaion has increased rapidly and will continue to increse over the next twenty years .
Unfortunately , the size of the earth will remain the same .
Thus , traffic congestion will be a major problem and a hurdle in years to come .

The only prudent method to tackle this problem will be to introduce effective public transport systems .
People will prefer to take the bus or the subway rather than having to wait for painfully long periods of time on the road while commuting .
This will therefore lead to a dwindling in the number of cars being purchased .

The cost of raw materials needed to contruct a car has also risen alarmingly and will continue to do so in the next few decades .
For example , metal prices have soared and metal forms an integral part of the cars body .
This will lead to a hike in the car prices ..
Manufacturers will have to increase their prices to accomodate the high cost of raw materials .
The high prices of cars will discourage common people from buying a car .
This is also one of the reasons why people will refrain from buying a costly commodity .

In view of all the above reasons and illustrations , I feel that they will be fewer cars being driven in twenty years from now .
