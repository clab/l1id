I support the notion that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I would like to support this with the following observations from my personal experiences .
With the advent of technology , a greater number of means are available for young people to enjoy life .
When I was kid the aveneues for enjoying were limited in India .
Now kids at young age have different options such as video games which I never had an access to .
This translates to the older people too , who would have no access to these gadgets .
Even if they have access they have to develop the aptitude and zeal to learn how to operate these devices .

In the era of consumerism more and more products are offered for the young generation because they control the spending .
Companies that tailor their offerings to the old people are between far and few .
I feel this also has to do with the age .
As people grow they become more mature , their interests change and they also tend be more appreciative of the needs of the family members .
As a result they curb their activities and go into their own shell .

Last but not the least , with the onset of the old age people start suffering with various ailments that take off their most time .
They have to restrict or avoid outdoor fun activities which they would have done in their younger years .

Having said that young people enjoy life more , I would not like to state that old people do not enjoy life at all .
But as discussed above the means change as the time passes and they start limiting their activities .
