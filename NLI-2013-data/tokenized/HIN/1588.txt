The issue at hand is that whether knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specialization in any one particular subject .
I believe that specialization in a particular subject is a better than having knowledge about many subjects .
I believe so because specialized form of knowledge leads to complete knowledge about the subject at hand .

Firstly , I beleive that specialization in a particular subject is a better option because it involves greater in depth analysis of various details and its influence on other things as well .
For example , consider a Heart Specialist Doctor who has specialization in heart surgery .
Such a doctor is better than other general physicians when it comes to heart related ailments .
Such a specialist is in a better state to advise things related to heart problems .

Additionally , specialization in a subject is better because a specialist can do the research work related to a particular specialized field more effectively and efficiently .
A research done by a specialist is more credible than a research done by a non-specialist .
For example , Newton was a specialist in his field , so his research and discoveries are still considered great works in his fields .
Any one cannot do such a research and lead to great discoveries , but only a specialist like Newton can .

Finally , in my views , a person with specialized knowledge about a particular subject is better able to communicate things and impart knowledge to others .
To bolster this , consider the point that all our professors and lecturers in our schools and colleges are specialists in their fields .
A Physics professor will be able to teach physics more effectively than any a science teacher who has superficial knowledge about that subject .

So , by stating all these points I conclude that specialized form of subject knowledge is better than superficial knowledge about many different academic subjects .
A specialist is the only person whose has great in depth knowledge about the subject at hand .
