In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Yes , I do agree with this statement .
This is the twenty first century , we boast about better living , advanced technology etc .
The use of palm tops , cell phones , better vehicles has all become a matter of mere show off rather than its actual use .
Lets talk about cars ; well we all want this luxury in life .
Nothing can be as exciting as a brand new car , and the number of cars shows how rich you are !

In all this show off and luxuries we tend to forget the enviroment .
Its a topic which has brought concerns .
Its very obviuos , more the people more the number of cars .
People are concerned about the pollution in the environment but equal attention is needed for the non renewable resources like petrol and diesel .
As the name suggests non renewable resources are those which will get over in next few years .
There are not infinite deposits of petrol , natural gases , oil etc in the environment .
There is a danger that these will get used and there will be nothing to substitute it .
These are non renewable because it takes millions of years for these resources to be formed ; and these are the resources used for driving vehicles .

As said earlier we are more concerned about our luxuries .
We have started using vehicles not only for long distances but also for short distances just because we feel lazy .
The number of cars and other vehicles has increased exponentially , and its soon that it will come down in the next twenty years .
As the petrol and oil deposits gets scarce the number of cars will drop down too .
As they say , one thing leads to another .
Thus , depleting fuels will cause depleted number of cars .

If we all realise this problem as soon as possible we will get good results .
Because the more early you know the problem you will be able to solve it before it gets too late .
We can satrt walking the nearby distances ; it will not only help save fuel but also be healthy for the individual .
Apart from this we can start using renewable sources for our fuel purposes .
For example using solar battery operated cars .
We can also use public transprt systems to cut down on the fuel shortage .

Thus all this would help us see a better future with better environment and good amount of cars running on renewable sources
