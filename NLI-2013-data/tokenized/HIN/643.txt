Knowledge is like a sea .
It is so vast that there is no end to it .
Even if you feel you have expertised in the subject there will always be something related to that subject which you are not aware of because in every subject there is always some advancement being brought .
In my opinion it is always good to have knowledge about different subjects rather than a specific subject .
These are the following reasons for which I support this opinion .

Firstly , knowledge of different academic subjects will always give a person better job opportunity when he steps out into the competent world .
He will have different choices available with him from which he can choose the better one for him .
However if he is equipped with just a single subject he has no choice but to go for jobs available in that field which might not be as appealing as he thought it would be .
I had one of my friend who studied geography but then later she ended up realising that she was not in the right place and she wolud rather enjoy better if she was in the field of computers .

Secondly , it avoids boredom .
We become lethargic studying something for a long time .
If we are studying more than one subject we can switch over to the next and get a change .
For instance , if we are studying history for five hours and we have music as our alternative subject switching over to it will always be refreshing .

Thirdly , we obtain an understanding in different areas of study .
By specializing in a single subject we will have knowledge about only that particular field .
However , world is filled with variety of things and if we are to encounter anything else other than our subject we might feel as if lost in a forest .
This is not good because it can keep us away from mingling with others and this can also lead to frustrations in life .

Hence , I feel it is better to obtain bit of knowledge in various subjects because this will help us widen our horizon .
It will help us to find a place in society and also help remain happy .
