We all are interested in reading about cars and dream of owning a car .
It is one of the first few items that we plan to buy if someone asks us what we would do if we win a lottery ?
If we observe the recent trend in car manufacturing , the demand for cars is ever growing .
I dont think there is any chance that people will stop using cars in years to come .
Infact I feel that in twenty more years , this craze of buying a car is going to multiply even further and there will be more cars in use than there are today .

Twenty years is a very less time span to let go off a luxury like owning a car .
Owning a car has become a status symbol .
People want to own a car just beacuse it improves their standing in the society .
In less developed countries , the level of noise and air pollution created by the use cars is unbeleivable .
Laws and regulations have little effect on the demand for cars in these countries .

Car manufacturing industry is a huge industry with a turn over of millions of dollars per month all over the world .
Who would possibly give up such a profitable business ?
Instead we are going to see more number of new and new cars & more number of commercials attracting people to buy these cars in coming years .

People are not going to stop using cars overnight .
So many factors come into play when we talk about not using cars .
The governments will have to improve the public transport to a level wherein people will prefer travelling by public commute rather than using a car .
That looks like a distant possibility in some nations .

Modern technology has invaded our lives to a level where man finds it difficult to survive without it .
Cars , cellfones , television sets , music systems , washing machines , refrigerators and other such things have become a part of our life .
We cannot think about living a life which lacks in the comforts given by these modern machines .
Car is just one of the many things man has created for his own comfort .

Man has failed to realise that these machines are causing more harm than their known uses .
These modern machines have ruined our earth 's atmosphere and oneday will lead us to extinction .
If we want to survive , we will have to take one big step towards minimising the use of these machines specailly cars that cause so much of pollution .
