I will be agree with the specify points .
As i know student graps the ideas and concepts very faster by interactive learning then exposed to the facts .
As i think the experience with the concepts make him to understand it clearly , while facts are the written statement which often makes the student obcure or uncear with basic ideas .

i will like to put forward some reasons to clear the view .
understanding the ideas and the concept behind the idea by the experiece of the student make him alert in future when he exposed to the same situation .
while ideas and concepts can be made clear by demonstration such as visual effects or audio effects .
one of the example i will like to make , if a person is prone to car parts such as cluch , break , accelarator , engine and given a demonstration over it .
He will be confident about to drive it and will make him drive smoothly .
And this basic idea or concept he will never forgot if any difficult situation arise in furture regard car .
For some if the undestand the concept very counsiously they might tackel the difficult situation uncounsiously also as they are previously prone to it .

while the facts are the given statement which are not explanatory , which leaves a negative or positive remark over a person .
Infact he might be not clear of the facts given .
which leads to mislead and aslo loose of some confident over it .
Example over it is , a given satement of fact about the car parts over break , cluch , accelarator or engine will not make him or put him in to reliability to drive a car whiout given demonstration of it .
And their is chances of misleading or damaging a car .

Thus for the students who are learning much of new things should required a basic concept very clear so they can easily and confiently approach the test and also get higher grades .
while if students are been told to refer the library or other materials for the test without giving a explanatory lecture over topic may often confuse them and result will not be expectory .
Thus undestanding the ideas and the concept behind ideas will leave student confidentially to approach .
