It is ofcourse more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I completely agree with the above given statement .

Learning is an imporant part of a person 's life .
Right from the time when a child is born , he learns to eat , to drink , to walk , to play and so on .
After some time , he learns to study and takes the student 's life .
At school , teachers teach him various subjects as a result of which he needs to learn facts .
He mugs up these facts in order to excel as a student .

I , however , think that just learning and mugging up facts is not the requirement attaining success .
This does not serve the purpose of education .
On the other hand , an understanding of the ideas and concepts is what holds importance .
One should get a clear knoledge of the ideas which have been explained in a subject matter .

When a student gathers knoledge and information in this way , he becomes able to successfully apply these concepts in his life .
This not only helps him as a student but also becomes useful in his future .
A successful student then becomes successful in his professional life as well .
This is because he learns to use his knoledge into practicality .

The above stated reasons clearly stress and explain my point of view .
According to me , getting students to learn facts and ideas other than mugging up facts can be encouraged only with the help of the educational institution .
I hence conclude my essay by saying it is only possible when thereis a change in the attitude of the teachers who are a part of the educational institutions such as schools , colleges and universities .
Teachers will have to explain the imporance of understanding ideas instead of learning things nd encourage them to studyin this manner .
