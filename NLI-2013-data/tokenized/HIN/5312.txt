I have mixed feelings about the statement `` mostly advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .

Not all ads are same .
They may be made to lure the people for purchasing the product but may be educative and of help too .

Advertisements are always made fansy and appealling for pulling attention of the general public making them aware about the presence of particular product in d market .
But at times when the products are not advertised it never reaches the customer even though they are there in the market .

I can suggest the above view by the following eg :
My mother always used to complin this creepy sensation in her legs which would keep her from sleeping at night , we did everything even went to the doctor but he also could not help her much , till the time i saw this advertisement on the tv for restless leg syndrome and a specific medicine for curing it .
i went back to see the doctor , spoke about it , got that medicine prescribed to mother and now she has much better relief .
So in short i can say that an advertisement educated me and helped my mother .

They can be deciving too like if it says for eg that a particular will remove all ur scars or marks it may not be completely true though it may help to some degree .

In the end i would like to conclude by saying that advertisements are basically made to market a product but it totally depends on the the wish of the consumer whether to buy one or not .
So be an intelligent buyer and make smart choices , never buy anything by just seeing the ad but buy only when u have reseached about it and are convinced to go for it .
