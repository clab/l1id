I agree with the given statement .
Let us first define what `` fact '' means .
Fact is one which is universallly accepted and which does not have a solid reason for its belief .
for e.g. a day has 24 hours , or the month august was named after Augustus , and so on .
Now these are facts which are accepted by all .

The standout difference between a fact and concepts is : `` A fact is learned and a concept understood '' .
To illustrate this let us take another example ; it is a well known `` fact '' that a gravitational force acts on each object .
But to understand the reason for this fact we net to understand the concept of gravity .
On similar lines it is a fact that the earth revolves round the sun .
But why ?
This can be answered after studying and understanding the ideas and concepts involved in the structure of the solar system .
So we see that a fact is easier to locate and find but it is difficult to understand the reasons for the said fact .
Therefore , a student should focus on the ideaology and conepts involved in the occurance of a fact .
Facts are the more obvious mundane things , things we come to know with time , but never get a chance to analsye the reasons for them .
So , a student should be provided with an opportunity to understand the concepts involved , if any , behind the facts .
Moreover , the basic aim of studies is not only teaching the facts but more importantly providing the understandings of those facts .
