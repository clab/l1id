I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I base my opinion on substantial points favoring the consumers than the business .

One of the important things observed in advertisements these days is that they fail to portray the complete informaiton .
Let us take an example of `` X hair dye '' .
The advertisement for this says that `` You can get a better hair texture , brighter color and stronger hair if you use X hair dye . ''
Some person develops an allergy with the hair dye and builds skin rashes .
It was not the problem with the person but the incomplete information provided to the consumer .
The consumer is entailed to read and verify all the information stated in the package and then could have possibly deciphered its allergy .
Most of the cases , we as consumers , come to know the complete fact only when we buy the product and read the details .
I believe that giving incomplete information is a means of luring the consumer into buying the product .

Various products are available in the market and lot of them compete with each other in the same space .
Advertisements play a significant role of manipulating the fact to overpower its competitor .
Let us take an example of an auto insurance advertisement-Geico for instance .
Geico in the north eastern part of United States advertises that it provides the lowest auto insurance rates .
Any consumer gets easily lured to Geico 's website or customer service to check if he/she can actually lower the rate .
On careful analysis it is observed that some other auto insurance firms prove to be cheaper than Geico , for example Liberty Mutual .
Geico provides low insurance rates to consumers who have a good credit history and fantastic driving records .
This factor is common for all auto insurance companies .
If only , Geico would have advertised `` We sell cheap auto insurances to people with good credit history and great driving record '' !
Thus advertisements manipulate the fact and do not present a true picture .

Under most of the circumstances , cost is major factor for consumers .
Advertisements do a fantastic job in not revealing the hidden costs .
For example , a consumer gets lured to buy a washing machine and reaches the store .
He has almost narrowed down his search and starts talking to the sales representative .
Cost has been a major factor in his decision .
Once he starts talking to the sales representative , he understands that the washing machine requires other components without which it cannot operate .
These other components increase the cost of the washing machine .
If the advertisers would have portrayed the need to buy other components , the consumer would not have wasted his time in buying that machine or would have waited for some more time until he had that money .

To conclude , I believe that advertisers do an amazing job in luring the customers .
Most of the time the advertisers do ensure that the consumer is not duped and has access to all the informaiton required to buy or use the product .
But in all these cases , a decent amount of time and energy needs to be invested by the consumers to decipher if the product actually suits their needs .
