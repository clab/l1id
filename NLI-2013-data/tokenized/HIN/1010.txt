I believe it is better to to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

If you specialize in only one subject your knowledge would be very confined and hence when you face the world out of the academic set up it would be difficult to adjust .
A specific example can be when you study management .
If in a management program you only expertise in Operations and have no knowledge of Finance you would have tough time when you have to work in Operations as it would involve parts of Finance .

Another example can be if you are studing history and do n't have any knowlegde about science you would face difficulty when you need to use science in history , for example , in radio carbon dating of fossils , and hence a knowlegde of science would be useful in such situations .

If you have broad knowledge of various subjects you become more flexible and can diversify in various different areas , while you choice becomes restricted if you are specializing in one particular subject .

Another aspect would be when you move into a business environment you would be considered a more fungilbe resource and hence you can fit in varous kinds of roles .

Broader knowledge about various subjects also broadens your horizons and helps develop integrative thinking in you .

In general the depth to which a subject is taught in academic institutes during specialisation may not be what you would require in normal business settings and hence this specialization would generally be not of much use in future unless you get into research etc .

Hence , I believe that though specialization may help in specific circumstances broader knowledge of many subjects is more useful in general .
