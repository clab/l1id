Cars in these days are seen as an almost indispensable part of life in alomost all the countries .
With the expansion of cities around the globe and with the dependance of life on comfort and luxury , the car production rates as well as their buying rates have increased .
And i think that this trend is going to continue .
So i disagree with the statement that in twenty years from now there will be fewer cars than today .

Next twenty years are destined to see a sudden and great increase in industrilization and a massive and rapid expansion of world in terms of population , income etc .
With a increase in net world income the standard of life of people is going to come up which in turn will help boost the car industry as people would rather prefer expending on car rather than having discomfort .

With the industrilization growth the availibility of time to perform a certain action or say for example delivery of goods from one place to another or for example reaching the office on time and in less time , is gonna decrease so the dependance of people on faster and more reliable of modes of transport ( within a city or country ) is going to increase which is again going to help give car industry a stimulus .

One more reason which can be cited in this regard is the people 's love for high speed and scientifically styled and desgned cars .
This trend will also see an upsurge in the next twenty years with more of the world population entering the youth age .
This trend will be most common in highly developed coutries where people will be able to afford and maintain these kind of cars .

Also in countries like US where the public mode of transport is not that common and where people prefer travelling by rather than by train or bus , with the increase in population the number of cars are going to increase .

Though one of the negative impact of an increase in the number of cars would be the effect on enviornment .
an increase in the number of cars would result in a more polluted enviornment which would further see a rise in enviornment related diseases such as asthma , cancer etc .
It is also probably going to create parking problems with the explosion of world population and the world space being limted and finite .
Another problem associated with an increase in the number or cars is the fuel shortage problem .
with the global oil crisis it has become constantly difficult to meet the increase in oil demands .

But again i dont think that any of this is gonna hinder with the use of cars in the next twenty years .
