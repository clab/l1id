i totally agree with the given statement .
the statement says that an individual or a student should understand the ideas behind a concept rather than just learn the facts about it .
according to the statement if a student has to have overall growth then this ca n't be done just by mugging up the facts that are taught instead they should undergo a thought process to develop ideas and understand the concept thoroughly .
this would help a student to improve in all the aspects of a personality and would rather gain more intelligence .
if two students are compared or tested for example a student with sharp skills who understands the concept and the tries to produce something of this own and a student who just try to learn over things as it is , then the student with more capability of learning would always be a winner .
this can be justified as when a person tries to understand something then he is putting in more efforts to make up his career .
whereas if a student just reads the facts and prepare for exam and then just forget it as part of the curriculum then he himself is at loss .
this would not give any sort of personal as well as academic growth .
he would stand where he was earlier .

considering the fact that it is important to understand ideas and learn the concept we would list the merits that a student would acquire .
when the student starts understanding the concept means he/she is showing interest in whatever he/she is doing .
secondly this improves the knowledge of that particular student .
thirdly the student can gain in more marks and have a successful career certificate for the lifetime .
though the whole of our life we got learn new things that come our way , this would easy only if the basis of our education is strong .
it is as similar as a foundation of a large building .
if the foundation is strong then the building can long last i mean it is strong enough to face adverse conditions and vice versa .
in this way if a student has a more grip on his/her subjects and puts in extra efforts to generate new ideas then the individual is said to flourish in his life and as well as in society in which lives .
thus to conclude my views i would always prefer to have a successful career with my personal growth as well as the organisational growth for which i would work .
this gives you the ultimate satisfaction and you can easily come up in life .
though it goes on a slower pace we would always be a champion .
as the proverb goes `` slow and steady wins the race '' .
