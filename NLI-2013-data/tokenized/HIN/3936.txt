` Community ' is the sole of any civilization .
The stronger the community is the better would be the civilization .
Since community consructs the society and socity has a big impact on the life style of the people living in the society and the literature written , and all these things reflect the progress and prosperity of the nation .
As far as the role of young people in the developmant of the society or community is concern , I am completely agree with the fact that young people are not paying much attentions towards their society now days .
Young people act as the base for any society because thay have the energy and courage .
They are the flag carries of their community .
Any commuinity is reflected by its younger generations .

But now days young people are not understanding their duties towards their community and their nation .
People are geeting more and more self centred and this selfishness is leading them towards this .
People should realize that its only the community that is going to help them .
One cannot live in isolation .
Let us take a example to explain this point .
Suppose if we isolate a person from a community then would the person will servive ?
The answer is definitely negative .
One cannot survive without an environment .
The person is dependent on the community for his basic needs .
All the functions of a community are inter-dependent .
One cannot perform all the fuctions alone .
So here the youths need to understant the fact that they cannot survive without a society .

Secondly , if you are living in an environment then there would be a proper balance between you and the environment .
Your environment must be a developed one in the same way as you are .
To explain this point let us take the example of a tree surrounded by a dirty land then definetly that dirty surroundings are going to hinder the growth of the tree .
So we must learn here the importance of community and its development .

Nowdays youths are not contributing towards the development of their community .
They must reallize the fact that development cannot be made alone .
You wo n't be cosidered as the developed person until unless you belong to a developed nation .

So in conclusion of my view I would like to state that young people , including me as well , should reallize their duties towards their communities and should come forward to uplift it .
I would like to urge them to work for the prosperity and development of their community .
