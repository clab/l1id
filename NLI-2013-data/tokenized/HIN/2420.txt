Whether the young or the old enjoy life more than the other depends on how one would define `` enjoying life '' .
If I keep in mind the physical endurence of the body at young age and the old age , I am of the opinion that the young have more options to try out new activites thereby leading a more enjoyable life .

First reason for my view is that at old age the body does not allow a person do pursue an activity that he/she may be very fond off at young age .
For example , at a young age a person can try activities ranging from scuba-diving or sky diving to glass painting or even etching .
At a young age if there is inclination to be involved in an activity there would be no restrictions .
However as old age draws near , the bodily restrictions may not allow the older people to be able to be involve themselves with the same activities as the young people .
An activitiy like glass painting might sound like an activity very much possible at old age , however , those inflicted with arthirites at old age will not be able to pursue an simple activity such as this .
So a enjoyable activity like glass painting which be possible at young age would no longer be possible for the elderly .
Another example would be of a sport .
A person , who at a young age was very passionate about basketball or squash may no longer be able to play that sport as his body would not allow him/her to do so .
This would lead to less opportunities available to lead an enjoyable life .

Another reason for my view is that , with the fast pace life of today there are much more options available to our generation than what was available to our grandparents .
So an activity like long walks which would be considered a enjoyable activity in past may not be considered one any longer .

Admittedly , older people do enjoy the comfort of living a more relaxed life with less responsibilites , which might be fun in itself .
However , I am still be of the opinion that young people enjoy life more than the older people .

In sum I would agree that defintion of `` enjoying life '' may vary to the young and the old but keeping in mind the very fact that the young are able to do what the older people do and also a lot more , they definately have more options availble to enjoy life and thus lead a more exciting life and enjoyable life .
