Well I strongly agree that for students it is more important to understand ideas and the concepts rather than learning only the Facts .
Firstly , In our daily life , we come across many situations from which we are able to gain knowledge , and thus we learn the concepts and idea from that particular situation .
Just take an example of a school .
I n school every student is suppose to study varieties of topics in various subjects .
When we go on reading , we understand the concept , what that particular lesson implies , and after understanding that lessen we are able to evaluate our own ideas .
We can even clearify all the doubts from our professor and then our mind becomes more clear and we are able to expand our ideas .

But if we just learns just the facts , without even bothering about its concepts , meaning , then how can we develop idea ?
Secondly , Nowdays , every work whether its business work , school work , or college work etc , everywork requires us to understand the concept of work , why is it to be completed , what is the advantage of such and so on .
Then only a person is capable of developing ideas and putting them in use .

Computer now have become the weapon for every work .
Where ever we see , we find people are operating on computer to carry loads of their work .
One cannot understand the facts of using such instrument , if he first does not understand the idea of such neither the concept of using that instrument will be clear .
Only educated . , well advanced in knowledge , whose all concepts are clear can continue working on the computer .

Thirdly , In business , a person should be kept in mind the idea of developing a business .
A successful person is the only one who understands the idea and concept of building up the business .
He has to keep up the records uptodate , transactions have to be regularly checked out , profits and the losses have to be viewed , and so on , after understanding all these concepts of business only , a person can set up his business well otherwise he have to bear losses .

Finally .
students need to understand the IDEA of a CONCEPT , then only he can learn the FACTS for variety of topics in day to day life , not only in studies but must understand the importance oh their lives , as Life teaches them to experience many things , and from there they should learn the ideas , because a person learns more from experiences ...
