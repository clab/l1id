`` Why is someone more successful than others ?
`` .
Many people would say that luck favors him/her , the stars for this individual seem to be glittering but at the end of the day , a critical analysis of a success can be quantified in terms of the magnitude of acknowledgement that the person has drawn from the world .
And the attention commensurates with innovation , an unprecedented action that apparently urges the people to set their eyes on the performer .
The advocates and policy makers somewhat form a decent example of people who have intrinsic abilities to crystalize their risk taking behaviors in to actions .
The placement of the four balls of social justice `` desert , need , right and equality '' requires a critical examination and high level of judgement because an experiment with society and its beliefs can be really threatening at times and might end up dumping the indivdual to a professional death .
But still bolds steps have been taken by individuals who remained die hard fans of constructive criticism that perhaps honed their abilities to take on new ideas and thoughts and use their risk taking abiltities to perfection and produce societal outcomes and reforms .

The success barely comes as an idle incentive but primarily involves trying new things at the expense of risking your present credentials .
The individuals reap the benefits against a solid input of courage and the positive consequences comes with huge vote of applause which is then termed as SUCCESS with an equal opportunities of failure that always run parallel till the last minute of coronation .
Another good example is a pole vaulter `` Sergie B '' who is famous for breaking his own record .
To him every success was determined to add a few more inches to the height of his next action .
This interprets that innovations and risk taking behaviors are somewhat governed by the success itself .
