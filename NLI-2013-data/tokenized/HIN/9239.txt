Unerstanding is must whatever area may be concerned .
Witout understanding one cannot go long .
As fas as students are concernd understanding is necessary for them .
Understanding of ideas and concept play a vital role in a student life .
Many benifits are atteched with understanding ideas rather then learning them .

Firstly consider the development of the mind of student .
Understanding ideas and concept will inculcate the new ideas in the mind of the student .
If he began to understand somthing it will develope his interest in that topic .
The student will then spare his most of the time in thinking about that concept and solve himself many of the problems and quarries .
Whereas a student who oonly lean the concept do not understand that will only get theoritcal knowledge .
Such students always believe in spoonfeeding only .
They never try to give little stress to their mind .

Secondly the things which has been learned from understanding remins in ones mind for lifetime whereas the life span of learned fact is very shor .
understood ideas are stored permanently into the mind where as for learned fact we have to repeat the pratice of learning again and again .

Third and most important thing is that learning will not lead to the logical development of the students whereas who try to learn by understanding has a very good logical power .
Leaner will always get stuck with very small problems and always ask for the help with thers where as those who unerstand the ideas are able to solve big problems .

Those students who understand the facts and ideas has a very bright future and do well in life .
Those who only learn facs
