`` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , I comletly belive in this statement because I think one cannot be successful by following other people .
To be Successful one has to think out of the box , he has to break the cycle of following the same routine over and over again .

In order to be successful in life one has to take risks .
But first he needs to define this term risk for himself .
Risk can be life ending or it can be carrer ending .
For instanse lets say that there is a man working as a stunt co-odinator in hollywood his recoganition in the industry would only be of just another stunt co - odinator .
So in order to be famous and successful he has to do something that somebody has never seen or done before , he has to do something spectacular which will gain him popularity , now that include risk in it because he has to do something that other people has never tried to do .
So performing that kind of stunt would mean risking his life to death but still he has to do it to that one bit extra , to be successful .

And the other kind of risk would be carrer ending however it would not have that life risking element but it can end carrers lets say a bussinessman who is the owner of a pizza restraunt .
lets say till now he is just just another guy with just another pizza shop in the market .
So to be famous and successful he has to do something extra , he has to take that risk so he introduses a new recipie for the pizza .
Ther will only be 2 ways out of it first the coustomer will like the pizza or they will not like the pizza , if they like it he is famous or if they do n't his carrer is ended .

So the conclusion to this part is that to be successful you have to go that one extra bit , you have to think out of the box and you have to try and do things that other have not done .
