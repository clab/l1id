It would be very difficult to say that the cars ' usage will decrease in the years to come so early .
Looking at the present scenario , the rate at which the car production and buying is increasing , it can surely be said that their is increased usage of cars .
But , however , I doubt to this and agree that there will be certainly a decrease in the usage of cars in twenty years and there are many reasons and notions for this concern .

If we see at the awareness of the present population , especially the younger generation , they are more concerned about the environment today than any time before .
their had been a tremendous increase in the pollution levels today that many people have volunteered to not to use cars .
this however doesent mean that they are not using their cars at all but they have decreased their dependence upon them , in turn , their usage has decreased .

Moreover the public transport system today are playing a major role in a our daily life .
The public transport systems like the buses , metros have really improved over many years .
They have become much more efficient have also paced the lives of people commuting by them .
At present the almost all major cities , which form the large portion of people using cars , in world have these transport facilities .
There had been improvements in connectivity among different places which have atrracted people to use them instead of commuting by cars to far off places .

A bitter reality that will result in the less usage of cars in coming years is the slow exhaustion of the non-renewable resources like petroleum , without which these manmade instruments will come to halt .
It has been projected that over the years to come the petroleum supplies will be highly effected in the wake of many oil wells drying up .
Its not only that the exhaustion of the resources is going to effect the usage of cars but its the economic problems associated with it .
With the increase in the buying of cars alongwith the exhaustion of resources the petroleum prices are going up day by day , and a day will come when it would be impossible for common man to affford it .

When considering all these issues regarding the factors affecting the cars ' usage it can be said that over the years it is surely to come down .
Afterall this would be to the benefit of our society which has over the years forgotten and ignored the nature 's way of living .
