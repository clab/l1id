I am agree on this statement that `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many subjects '' .
As per my view looking at present days scinario , it is better to have a lot of knowledge of many subjects .
As science is in a phase of revolution and todays necessities that people should to have an interdisciplinary person .

Another point is that using multydimensonal approach to solve any problem .
Firstly , now a days it 's time for revolution and renovation .
Since , time is changing and we are in 21st century , so we have rebuild many concept because todays the science has achieved so much and technology is also in very good condition .
We have also to find out some answers of many questions which are not solved yet .

Therefore , we have to be gain knowledge of many subjects to improve our ideas .
Secondly , we should try to get enroll in various new and intradisciplinary subjects .
Here I want to say that at present time 's need that we should try to get admisson in various new subjects and it 's much better to take an Interdisciplinary subject .
By studying an interdisciplinary subject , we can gain a knowledge of a variety of subjects .
For example , Applied sciences can provide a vast knowledge of various subjects , which we ca n't get from any specialized subject .
Another example may be of Bioinformatics , where we learn and read various subjects as Biology , Computersciences , Information technology , Maths , Stats , Physics and Chemistry .
So that I think this type of students can work much better and can handle various types of problems .

Thirdly , multydimensinal approach can solve some critical problems .
Present time it is a very nice idea to be an multidimensonal person .
For example , in any research institute 's theres a problem which involves Physics , Mathmatics and Biology , then here is a proplem that not any person knows all the things so here a person having multisubjects knowledge can do well .
So that we can make a model and can solve a problem without any problem .

Therefore , I can say on the basis of these some points that it is better to have a knowledge of varivous subjects .
Means jack of all tra
