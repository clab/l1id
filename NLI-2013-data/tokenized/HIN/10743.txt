I completely agree with the view that taking risks and trying out new things , rather than sticking to known ways , make successful people .

This fact can be simply illustrated with very preliminary examples .
Like for example , had James Watt not tried to innovate a new way of transportation option , the steam engine , and would have been satisfied with the then prevelant transportation options like horse-carts , where would we be today in terms of comfort , cost and time benefits we draw from transportation ?
Same is the case , if the Wright brothers would have stopped after the steam engine revolution .
Continous evolution is always possible , because I think nothing is perfect to be accepted as it is forever .

I will use more technology or business environment related examples to explain this view further .
In order to remain competant and profitable , businesses have to be innovative .
Trying out new things enhances creativity and can lead to either new concepts , processes or products .
It can also result into better ways to do an existing job and lead to most cost and time effective solutions .
For example , when geographically distributed working was not as famous a concept , Chinese and Indian companies pioneered the offshoring concept .
This led to benefits for both the parties , providing opportunities to the developing nations and huge cost savings for the customers , which effectively lowered prices for the developed countries .

Trying to remain in the safe zone by stick to existing known ways and not indulging into risk taking is very harmful for businesses .
For example , if Microsoft would have been satisfied with their Windows operating system product having a huge market share and would not have innovated for improving their product , their market share would have been gobbled up by new products like Linux .

The most direct criticism of taking risks , is that if the existing way is well-established and near-perfect , trying new things would be waste of time .
And it could be a costly venture if trying new things yields nothing , after all it is associated with risks .
But I do not agree to this criticism because I believe , that even if sometimes being innovative just ends up being a cost-overhead , in long term it will definately not be so , because of the dynamic nature of our businesses and environment .
