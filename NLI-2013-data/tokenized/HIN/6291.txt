Personally I agree with the statement that in twenty years there definitely will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
There are quite a few reasons to my opinion .
The most important ones are :

First , the global demand on non-replenishable resources such as petrol and diesel , is ever increasing , Perhaps the overwelhming growth of the world economy , industries , cars , etc has caused such an increase today .
However in twenty these resources will be sparse or too expensive to buy .
Thus , without the necessary ingredient - fuel , I think there would be fewer cars than today .

Second , phenominal advances in technology and communication will defintely give way to other sources of transportation .
Perhaps air travel , fast and efficient metros ( trains ) and other more efficient and cost effective ways of public transportation may be the norm twenty years from now .

Third , the increase in cars and other means of road transportation is a major cause of air and noise pollution today .
This is not only causing serious environmental damage but is the cause of damage to the whole ecology - be it flora , fauna , animals , humans , etc .
Such mis-endeavors are causing the governing bodies of the world to wake up and take notice .
I suppose stringent regional and global laws will either prevent people from buying cars or at the least will restrict them from buying a single car twenty years from now .
Thus unlike today when perhaps a single person owns multiple cars , such a thing will perhaps not be possible in the future .

A lot of people may not agree with my opinion .
Perhaps because today none of the above seems possible i.e. more cars per person , no laws , etc .
However if we all take a pragmatic view and think logically I suppose all of us will come to the same conclusion that there will be fewer cars twenty years from now .
