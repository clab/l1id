Why does a person acquire knowledge ?
I would say , so that it can be used in living a better life , and if possible making that possible for others as well .
Which , then takes us to the question of which is better , a generalistic or specific .

I think the answer is , a mix of both .
It is really very difficult not to grow up acquiring a broad knowledge or understanding of various academic disciplines as we move up through school and college .
We do end up studying different subjects and that is good as it makes us aware of a whole lot of basic information etc. about so many fields of study that have close bearings on our lives .
It is also this stage that prepares us towards understanding what these various subjects deal with and consequently which we find ourselves interested in .
So , some amount of broad broad knowledge is generally built in to our academics .

However , specialisation in a particular subject also invariably happens at a later stage in college or university .
I think that in the world we are living in , it is more and more becoming essential to specialise in a subject so that you have market for your skills in the job market .
With the current levels of specialisation that the advances in science and technology has brought about in our work lives , it is nearly impossible to be very good at two things .
Not only have you to chose early in life whether you want to study medicine , enginering or music but you have to decide soon enough in your chosen stream what specialisations you are interested in .

If we take the example of the field of midicine , till two or three decades back , majority of the doctors start practicing as a generalist after an MBBS degree .
The ones who did go for a specialisation would generally chose from being a physician or a surgeon or gynaecologist and less then a dozen other specialistions .
But todays world of medicine has more than a dozen specialistions each for phisicians and surgeons .

To conclude , i would say that the world today belongs majorly to a specialist and hence the importance of specialising and in fact super specialising in a subject .
We however , should also realise the importance of having people with broad knowldege of things amonst us to fill in key places .
