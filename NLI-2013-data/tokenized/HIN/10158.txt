I definately agree with the point , that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already knw how to do well .
Successful people are not afraid to try new things , as because they are not afraid of faliure , Because faliure is the key to one 's success .
For this i support a pre-proposed theory by Darwin stated as the `` survival of the fittest '' , according to this theory , only the ones how can compete and are the fittest are able to survive in an environment ...
The best habit of successful people is to compete , they compete with other people , not to prove they are smarrter or the other is duller , but they compete to enhance thier skills , take challenges , Learn new things and live life to the fullest ...

Successful people are called successful for taking risks and trying new things ...
A person isint called successful until he has stood up on his on feet and achieved through his hardowrk/pain .
A person who gains his success by cheating/copying/taking help from others , isint really successful .
There is only 1 way to sucess , which is hardwork , There is no easy formula , One has to work towards it , and if u do not expect things to quickly , you will finally find success .

Successful men also do not fear of the impossible , for them the word itself doesnt exist , because IMPOSSIBLE itself says I 'M POSSIBLE !! ...
a person who backs off easily after seeing hurdles , difficulties in his path is a coward and sure not to succed in life

Success is someting one cannot buy/trade .
It has to be attained by one 's self ...
hardwork is the only .

A succeded man never fears of the wrong , because one cannot be successful until he fails ,,, The other important quality of successful men is the quality to continue ahead ...
Successful people do not take faliure as a Road bloack in thier life and stop there for-ever ..
Instead they find ways to over come it , and to proceed in thier live 's ..
Faliure is the begining of success ...
One can never be successful untill he/her hasent failed i life ...
It is from failures what people learn and becomse successful

Hence i comclude this by saying that , Success os written in every ones life ..
it only depends on us to find the means to it ...
And the only means its hardwork ..
No matter what you do , shorcuts always leads to downfall of a person ..
