According to the statement `` If it is better to have knowledge of many acedemic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''
I agree with the the statement to specialize in one specific subject .
The reason for this is if we are involved in specific subject then we have very great opportunities in the future .
why i disagree with having a broad knowledge of many acedemics is because it will involve you in various different issues and you wont be perfect in any of the subjects , as we know half knowledge is always dangerous .

The example why i choose to specialize in one specific subject is , you can become master of that subject , and start with the research orienting to that subject and which will help you in concentrating on one issue rather than many issues and it would end up with a chiotic situation .

Another reason why i believe to be specialized in one subject is , for example if you are in field of architecture , once you are done with your bachlore degree you would definetly like to do your post graduation in a specific subject , which will model you to become a better architect .

For example masters in emergent architecture which is not known in a country like India , and many other countries and construction is boom in this part of country so for us to stand out in this global world we got to be creative and diffferent , the specific subject is not thought in India in a wide range and if we specialize in this particular subject then you stand at top of the world .

Now let me brief about this subject , it gives various options on the morphogenisis of the module of any plane through various softwares , which creates amazing structure or graphics to the contemperory world .

Finally i agree with the statement to specialize in one specific subject .
