`` Human mind has always had the unsatisfying hunger for knowledge '' .
We always try to grasp the things going around him us the nature .
We tried to better understand our environment or surroundings by observing and learning from it .
It is this compulsion to learn everything that lead us to the stage we are now .
Without the spirit of the man to study everything he sees we would not have made the advancement in our social life .

Having the broader knowledge about many academics is better in some ways because knowledge about one subject leads to the better understanding about other subjects .
As in the case of physics and math .
The subject of physics would look like a japanese to an amatuer if he does not have the background of math because every calculation done in physics involves math .
As goes for some other subjects too .

Specialization in one subject involves intensive training in specific area of field .
People taking up specialization only on a particular subject would have limited knowledge about other subjects .
The would be doing research only on the given field and there would be no scope to further increase his knowldge about other fields .

But having the knowledge about other subjects would be quite useless too sometimes .
Such as in the case of students doing their college .
If a history student is asked to gain his knowledge in physics it would be quite useless , because he would be confused about his future , whether he would end up working as a physicist or a historian .
It would rather deviate the mind of the student from his main ambition .
Take for instance many great scientists and researchers who have contributed immensely in their respective fields because of the liking they had for they subjects .

Therefore it is better to have a specialization in only one academic subject because it helps determining the future of the students taking it .
As to what they would really become in the future .
It also generates the interest in the student so as to expand his knowledge to the core of the subject .
