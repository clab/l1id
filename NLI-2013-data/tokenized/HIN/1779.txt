Is it Better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject only ?
This quote finds me interesting and worthy in discussing around .
Having knowledge about many subjects has its own benefits and limitation , similarly for specializing in one specific subject , Let me put forward the idea of having many subjects knowledge .
It will be very beneficial in having those in your school level of studies .
Because during this duration students are unaware of their ineterest and what are their likings ?
So by introducing many subjects like English , Maths , Science , History and many more subjects like will help students get to know about the variety of subjects and its essence in one own 's perspective .
Some students might love English and develop their interest to near future where he can sees himself as a professor in literature .
Same way student 's interest in maths lead him to become Finance consultant for his statistics knowledge .
Last but not the least , most of the students who want to establish themselves as an engineer or scientist goes with their interest in science .
Does n't it find useful in school days ?

Now the time of student 's career comes , where student had developed their interest and has clear idea of what they want to become .
As in person , fortunately I too followed the idea of concentrating on my special liking in specific subject i.e. Science .

Here i can carry forward my ideas of what learnt in school days and furnished the knowledge gained .
This is the Real time to kick in for putting those ideas into practical application .
One can become in developing powerfool tools in communication or in Software coding for security and widespread purpose .

So by having many subjects in school level of studies and specializing one of those subjects does n't find feasible enough to practice on .
It is really advantageus and beneficial by having such academic system .
It is actually practicing in many academic system .
