I would strongly agree with this statement .
In today 's learning environment , a student needs to focus on qualitative learning as opposed to quantitative learning .
A need for comprehension of the concepts and ideas becomes increasingly important for a person to achieve success in his/her life .

As a child , Benjamin Franklin was relieved of studying at junior school since he would not learn up everything that he was required of him , which he believed it to be unnecessary as they were already provided .
He went on to later become one of the greatest inventors of all time .
Now I am do not believe that school is not important , but that these ` facts ' , which are merely clusters of information , are actually derived from ideas that other people once had .
Once a concept is understood , the idea can always be derived .
Once a theorem is known , a derivation can be made .

In contrast , if a student is made to only learn facts with lesser importance given to ideas , then that student may not be able to contribute to many aspects that require thinking in his life .
If everyone were taught to do something but not told why it is done or what principle underlies it , then innovation would become an extinct concept .
I would next like to highlight another important result - innovation .
It is the only thing that has given us what we have today ; this PC that I am operating on , the ETS testing system and countless other things .
Complacency would really bring us back to the stone age .

In conclusion , if we were to only learn facts and figures , then we would not require schools in the first place .
Everyone would be academically equal or based on the capacity of his/her memory , which would be a large encumberance to progress .
This is the reason that all universities stress on concept learning than ` mugging up ' .
To conclude , I would say that this statement is perfectly right and that it should prevail .
