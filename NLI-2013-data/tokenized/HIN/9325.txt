There are always two aspects for learning-one is to understand ideas and concepts and another is learn facts .
Both of these have their own importance .
Some times it is important to learn ideas and concepts than to learn concepts .
In another condition learning facts have dominance over the understanding of ideas and concepts .
Both vary according to the situation .

For a student studying the mathematics it will helpful for him to understand the concepts and ideas .
Learning basic concept will help him a lot .
He can utilize these facts in solving many of his problems .
Another example for importance of learning the facts is here .
A students can utilize a fact as a previous experience in solving a problem .
Suppose he is in a problem of choosing a product from same price .
Then he will utilize the fact of his previous life .
For example one of his friend has puchased the same product one month before .
While the use of this product his friend has problem .
In this condition man will not buy this product as a fact that this product had harmful effect on his friend .

Some times it becomes important for students to pay more attention to ideas and concepts .
If a student has no experience about decision which he is going to take then it will beneficial for him to use his ideas and concepts .
In some subjects untill a student will not understand the ideas and concepts he will not reach to a conclusion .
For example in a music class , if a student use his ideas and concepts he will be able to understand the quality of music in deep .
He will perform better than the previous one .
If he uses different concepts than it will help him a lot .

So understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts has their own importance .
They can also be used simultaneouly .
In some condition idea and concepts are superior and in another condition they may have affect minor .
So all depends on situation and the way in which a student use it .
