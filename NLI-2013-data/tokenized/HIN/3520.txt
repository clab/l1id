I do agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Todays generation is caught up with a lot of other issues which they feel are important and necessary for them to survive in this world and also to be happy in the future .
These things include getting good education which takes up a lot of their time and energy , then they feel the need to earn a lot of money so that they can afford whatever they want in the future and last but not the least to spend the extra or free time enjoying life by attending parties and watching movies .

Present generation has the urge to study more and more so that they can match up to the expectation of the chaging world .
Frankly speaking it is not their fault either .
Every one requires a certain degree of education to support themselves and to be able to interact and communicate with the people of other countries .
This is so because most of the word carried out by our country is in collaboration with the developed countries like the U.S.A. and therefore to match up to their educational requirements it is important to be well educated .
To gain such quality of education one needs to devote full time and energy and so does not get the oppurtuinty to help their communities .

Additional to the educational qualifications a person needs to have a good job in order to support his family .
In the era of increasing prices and low pay structure an individual needs to work like a Pig , as most of them put it , and then alone be able to match to his living standards .
If someone does not do the required amount of work expected from him then he is not given a chance of promotion which inturn decreases the availability of resources with him to live peacefully and happily .
This is another reason why todays generation is not able to give enough time to their communities .

Finally , I think that as the world changes , the priorities of the people living in that generation changes .
Earlier people used to utilize their free and extra time in helping old people or doing some amount of social severvice .
Every one had a feeling of responsibility towatrds the nation and its citizens .
But today if someone has free time they would want to rather go for a movie or party and enjoy themselves , instead of even thinking of the weaker and underpriviledged section of the socity .

In conclusion , I would like to say that everyone in today 's world has become selfish and therefoe wants to think of themselves before others .
Today 's generation has forgot what is `` Service before Self '' .
