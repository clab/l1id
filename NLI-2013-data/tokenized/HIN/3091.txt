Life is worth to live .
Young people live it more lively and older people live it in a more plain way within their physical limits , but they woud have lived it lively when they were young .

I agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more as compared to older people .
Young people are more energetic and more ambitious in their youth .
They have the desire to bring sky down .
Young people have the quality of persistence that is to keep trying to achieve their goal .
This ability of theirs helps them to enjoy life and face all the hardships whatever comes on their way .
For eg. : Youths always try new methods of entertainment which is full of dangers and risks .
Like Bungee Jump , car race etc .
Young people are always open to new ideas and they have the desire to explore the world .
They implement new thoughts in teir way of living and enjoy life to the full .

At the same time old people are not able to enjoy more in life .
They spend most of the time in the memories of what they did in their young age .
They are even not physically fit to do all the activities which a youth can do .
In the old age the ability of persistence reduces .
Old people dont have the desire to compete with the world to get the best .
They always remain happy in what they have and in the way how they live .
They are never open to new modern ideas and are not able to enjoy life as compared to youths .

Finally i would like to say that , i am not against the old people .
These are the people when young developed new ideas which the youg generation of this age is following and enjoying .
