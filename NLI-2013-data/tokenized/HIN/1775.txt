A very famous saying goes as `` BE BEST AT WHAT YOU DO '' .
Having excelled in a particular is more beneficial than having surface knowledge about many subjects .
We will only be respected if we excel in our chosen field .

My first example will be from our academic life .
Even our education system follows the aproach mentioned above .
As we reach eleventh standard we are asked to make choice from many subjects because it is really important that we concentrate our mind one particular field .
At the college level we further need to determine in which subjects we want to do detailed study .
This makes our field of study narrower so that we put the best of our efforts in one particular thing we want to pursue .

My next example is from our social life .
In a group discussion we should be adept at one topic about the issue in consideration rather than guessing little about each topic .
Arguing with people who have expertised in the similar area also increases our knowledge .

Another example is from the world of science .
While doing the research work scientists do not need to know something about every subject but complete knowledge about what they are researching .
This is even true for lawyers .
Fighting a case in a court does not require you to have knowledge about how atoms divide but eveything related to law .

Trying to know about every subject wll lead us to nowhere .
Therefore in light of the examples mentioned above I conclude that it is better to specialize in one specific subjct than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
