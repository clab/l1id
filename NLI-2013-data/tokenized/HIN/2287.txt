I do agree with the point that `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
At this point of time I would like to cite a very famous song ' We will rock you ' that proves to me that youth is full of energy , zeal , mischiefs and livlihood .
These all makes a young person excited and make him ready to take on the world .
When a girl or boy reaches a stage to be called young then his / her parents start giving freedom to them which they welcome and like most .
When they do not work or get married they depend on their parents and study for their aim .
This makes them full of enthusiasm which old people lacks as they had already been to a stage where they can not think of making their career and becomes dispirited .

In young days one has lot many friends to play with , to roam , watching movies and sharing their views which most of the time a person in old age miss .
Parties , sports , gossips , food and excursions are all part of the life in young days .

With old age people start loosing their body strength and they get overloaded with resposibilities which youngs never care in their time .
An earning old person have to think about his family before taking dicisions .
He has to abide of the state laws of tax and has to pay attentions to their youngs for their future .
They need to laid the foundations for the life of their childrens .

Young people work for the things they want and when they achieve they find themselves much more happy than anyone else .
When they reached in their professional life they start earning and with the money they purchase the things which they thought of in childhood .
So young people have an advantage to enjoy life more than anyone else and the reason lies behind the freedom and very few resposibilities .
But as these resposibilities their actions gets affected with them and their freedom starts decreasing .
With age they become resposible and seroius with very less enjoyment in life .
