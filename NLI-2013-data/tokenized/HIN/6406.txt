I agree that there will be fewer cars on the road than before as there are many factors that will lead to the decline , if the population is not changed by migration .
Few factors are , increasing cost of oil , environment pollution , trafffic congestion which leads to delays , parking problems , higher maintenance etc .

The increase in cost of oil recently has made people to look for more efficient modes of travel .
The environmental activists are pressing hard to cut on carbondioxide emissions , and the successful atlernate to hydrocarbon oils are yet to developed .

Now in the present circumstances , the city roads are unable to handle the pool of cars and every commuter is getting frustrated by traffic congestion and has changed his life style to avoid traffic .
They are resorting to public transportation , car pooling or taking up residential units near to the workplace .

One more factor that can contribute to the decline is the less space available in the cities for car parking .
It has become nightmare now to find parking specially near corporate offices and busy market places .

The cost to maintain a car is high and going up when compared to motorcycles , which is prompting many to dump their cars in favour of two wheelers as it is helping them to cut costs on fuel , maintenance , parking and above all reduces a lot of time in conveyance .

Gone are the days when people use to have cars , primarily for their social status , as cars have become increasingly affordable , a person with average income is able to maintain a car .

In my family we use to have three cars a year ago , but with unexpected surge in traffic , parking and maintenance we got rid of one car and the remaining two we are using it only when it is required .

Considering above reasons , I feel there will be less cars on road twenty years after , than it is now .
