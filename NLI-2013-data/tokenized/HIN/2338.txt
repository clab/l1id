I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , mainly because today there are a lot of options available for younger generation for enjoyment .

Young people can get involved in various adventure sports .
They can do scuba diving , trekking without getting too much worried about their health and fatiuge .
However I do n't contend that older people do not get involved in adventure sports , but how many older people do we know who go for adventure sports as compare to the number of young people who participate in that .
Their are various night clubs that are specifically made for younger generation , which likes to chill out there after long working hours .
And the number of young people their is more their as well .

Every generation is more advanced than the previous generation in terms of technology and variety .
Younger people have greater market in front of them , where they can buy things according to their own needs .
Market has become so competitive and shoulders that are responsible for innovation , have become youth centric .
Today 's generation has access to various things that are now made primarily considering the youth of today .
Manufacturers of bike give advertisements of a youth riding attractive bike just to capture attention of younger generation .
And seeing adverisments like this and buying the same product makes life more enjoyable .

Additionally , younger generation has access to all the forms of enjoyment that older generation has .
Some people might state that older people have more time to enjoy life , however , I am of the opinon that it 's the quality time that matters .
Who has n't heard the words : ` work hard and party harder ' .

In the end I would like to conclude that younger people enjoy life more than the older people as the resources and options available to older generation are limited .
