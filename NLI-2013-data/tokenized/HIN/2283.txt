`` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
I would agree to the statement aforesaid although i donot doubt the fact that the older ones have already had their piece of cake in terms of enjoyment since they have had their own lovely moments when they were in their adoloscence , when they were youngsters or can be said when they were parents .

Now gettin back to the point of my favouring the notion here stated , the youngsters have every thing at this particular span of time that they are in be it health , looks or entusiasm to do variuos things , the quest to hunt for the unknown mysteries of life that surround them and lay unfolded in front of them .

Coming to the first point , health of the youngsters is perfect enough to keep them raring to do things and to experiment which sadly is not the case with the aged people since with age the human body cells begine to retard and there are enormous problems to be mentioned that keeps age old people to be active .
For instance , my grand father is 80 years old and i along with my parents had to go on a hill station to celebrate the New Year 's Eve and i really wanted my grand father to accompany me and sadly he couldnot because of a respiratory problem he would suffer being at a high altitude .

Talking of enthusiasm i would say that with no denials to it youngsters have gallons of it stuffed in their nerves .
Another perspective that i would present is that not only age old people instead people who are only a few years older are less likely to enjoy themselves since the maturity level keeps on increasing with time and what i imply by this statement is that even a five year old would enjoy more than a 20 year old person since because the five year old would enjoy to the fullest only by a mear endevour of meeting a friend whereas the same thing is not likely to attract a 20 year old .

Summing it up wiht the notion `` The older you are the wiser you get and less likely you are to be happy with small thing '' .
