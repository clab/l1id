`` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
Or is it ?

To answer this question , first and foremost , one needs to consider the purpose of the academic pursuit that an individual is following .
Whether or not that individual should specialize in his/her line of academics , remains dependent on what the individual plans to do beyond the academics and is not limited to the course of studies only .
Considering the cut-throat competition we face in our everyday lives and in one of its subsets , our careers , `` horses for courses '' is the solution here .

To have a better understanding on the issue , lets take the case of a woman , who is studying Medicinal Chemistry and plans to be a researcher .
In her line of work , to have any kind of success , she 'd need to specialize .
For example , it would do her career a lot of good if she were to focus her research on development of Oncology drugs / anti-retroviral drugs , than merely synthesizing molecules for generic use .
In terms of position , respect , money and career growth , she 'd be better placed when specialized than when she 's not .
Correspondingly , lets take the case of a man who is studying to be a Social Entrepreneur .
In his line of work , issues of business management , information exchange , community development , field research etc are commonly addressed to solve socio-economic problems .
Hypothetically speaking , if his business is of distribution of Oncology / anti-retroviral drugs , then he 'd need to know generically about those too .
It will do his business and his credentials a world of good if he has both theoretical and practical knowledge of these issues on a broad basis , which impact the performance of his business .

Thus , the debate on whether specialization in academics is better or generalization , rests at the doorstep of the purpose of the academic pursuit .
