I agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Most of the things , we enjoy require novelty , travelling and friends .
While young , we have the physical strength to travel around places .
Old people travel little and that too making their travel as least streneous as possible .
Therefore , they avoid exploring new and difficult reaching places .
Travelling becomes much more enjoyeable when it involves physical activity and sports such as trekking , mountaineering etc , which old people are unable to enjoy .

Visiting places may not be as fun to old people because they already have so much experience and stand much higher chance of visiting the same place again .
Youngs , on the other hand , feel the excitement of visting a completely new place and environment never explored earlier .

The normal lives of young is more dynamic as compared to that of the olds .
There are always very special events such as the first date , marriage , first child , first job etc which keeps a young person lively .

Old people are more prone to illness and therefore restrict themselves to a safe and secure environment which keeps them restricted to small vicinity .
Old people in general tend to take little risk in whatever they do , for example , planning on-the-move trips .
Uncertainity adds another diminsion to entertainment , and since young can afford to take such risks they tend to enjoy themselves more than old people do .

Least but not the last , friends are very important element to enjoy life .
Young people usually tend to have a wider friend circle , since they meet much more people during thier daily routine during college , at office place , at clubs etc .
However , old people mostly prefer to stay at home and therefore have a limited frind circle .
Old people have thier old friends but again due to limitation on frequent streneous travel they get o meet them rarely .

So all in all we should try to enjoy as much as possible while we are young .
We never know when we would become physically so weak that we may not be able to enjoy ourselves much .
