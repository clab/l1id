I agree with the statement that `` successful people try new things and take new risks .. ''
.
I firmly believe that ` success is a journey , not a destination ' .
If one spends his entire life doing what he already know show to do well , he is not exploring new avenues and hence , will never know what life has to offer .

A few examples to support my view are as follows .
The first one is a story of a little boy who , out of curiosity and vision turned around his life .
Once , dejected and depressed about things not working with his computer , he put thought into why that might be and tried out a ` new way ' to make things work .
Today , the world knows the man by Bill Gates , one of the richest people and creator of Microsoft .
A lot of great inventions come by accident and one needs to open one 's mind to trying new things in order to run into accidents .
Another example is the popular 3M company which manufactures Post-it .
While trying a `` new way '' to make a glue that sticks so well that it never comes off , a failure to do so , led to the invention of Post it notes which are popularly used world-wide today .

Taking risks exposes a person to failures and makes him a stronger individual , a trait that ironically is the essence of success .
I conclude with a few lines from the famous poem IF written by Rudyard Kipling - `` If you can make a heap of all your winnings , And risk it on one turn of pitch and toss , And lose , and start at the beginning , And never breathe a word about your loss '' ...
then `` yours is the world and everything that 's in it , And which is more , you will be a man , my son '' .
