When we speak of academic generalizatiaon versus specialization I will disagree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

What differenciates a man from an animal .
Its his ability to think and analyse .
Its his mind that differenciates him .
Simailarly what differenciates a student who has done a general MBA from one who has specialised in Financial Engineering .
The answer lies in the fact that specific problems require specific solutions .

Very often in our work environment we are faced with peculiar problems which we are unable to solve .
What do we do ?
We call in the experts .
An expert is one who specialises in solving a particular problem .
He has the knowledge and the experience in that particular field that gives him the competitive advantage that the layman would not possess .

Let me explain this with a simple illustration .
A export house that is expecting certain cash flows in the future is unsure of the currency market and would like to cover his future cash flows .
A friend of his suggests that the best solution would be to book a forward contract and crystalise the amount of inflows .
However what he doesnt realise is that if the market were to move favorably he would end up missing out on a lot of potential gains .
Thats why it would make more sense to be guided by a financial engineer ( the expert ) who would be able to structure a deal for him whereby he would minimise his risk while at the same time have acesss to higher returns .

Another classic example would be in the area of medical science .
In a very simple case of tooth ache I would prefer to see the Dentist rather than a general physician because I know that the dentist will be able to accurately pinpoint the problem and confidently give me a solution for the same .

Experts/Specialists are often those people who will give you that edge over the competition .
This is not to say that I totally disregard people who who have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , its just that specialists are those who help differenciate the the best from the rest of the pack .

In conclusion I would like to say that specialization adds that indepth understanding and analysis to learning the helps professionals to effectively counter problems in their specific field of study .
