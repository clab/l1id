I potentially disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
First , what i feel is that it 's not the age which determines the level of pleasure or enjoyment in life .
It 's basically our attitude toward life which enables us to take the maximum out of what life has to offer .
Our outlook towards life is the determining factor for the parameters that we set for enjoying life .

Secondly , its a matter of committment and perception that wins us points in the game of life .
For example , an old person having an optimistic approach toward everthing what life has to offer would rather enjoy stressless leisurely evenings sitting in the garden or maybe gardening .
In contrast to this a young man having more than half of his life to live could be sitting on a chair in the same very garden and cursing his fate for providing hinderances in his path to success .

Thirdly , it may be assumed that the younger part of life or the youth age demands more of you but it does n't mean that a young man simply cannot enjoy his life because he is has more work / assingments to complete .
It 's a function of mind games that determines individual perception and it is this perception that fuels us to look towards life in a different plain altogether .
I have seen old people like my grandmother enjoy trekking and mountaineering .
History , like all other examples incorporates one in these terms too .
We 've had scientist who were old enough to be counted out as non-exciting in general view but but active enough to invent some of the most exciting things on earth .

Lastly , the fact that the body may be old enough but it is our mind and will power that combine together to give us a rush of adrenaline even at the age of 70 .
