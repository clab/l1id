Young people nowadays are pointed for neglecting their communities since the activities in which the younger generation are in demands much more of thier attention to thier own needs thereby not giving the required amount of time their communities .
Now in general broadly focusing on the issues of the younger generation the major outline we can draw is their survival in this world has become the most difficult challenge for themselves like the pace of the life , to be infront on many ocassion whether its a professional or a personal , the competition which he is forced to be a part of it .

when we say nowadays we mean , earlier people gave their time to help communities because life at that stage was not having that much pace .
But the morals of those younger generation were far better when it comes to help otherswith present generation , why not these generation people give their time because the todays world is a world of technology .
everything travels at a faster rate & in this speed the basic moral values are going away from the present generation since everybody is thinking of himself first then the rest .
But the basic idea should be poured in the present generation that every young of their community is a pillar , if the pillar is not strong then the community wil not grow properly .
for example

Yes , i do agree that nowadays young people are not giving enough time to their communities .
If these continues like this then which ever community it may be will have to pay for the lose they may face in comming years because of thier younger generation negligence .
