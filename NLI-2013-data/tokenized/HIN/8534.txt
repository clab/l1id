The topic given has its own intricacies , and to justify and convinced with a thought , we have to comprehend the rudiments of learning process .
I agree with the point presented that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning the facts .
To understand a subject , one should have strong basics about the idea and concept behind it .
For instace , if we take physics class , students should be well aware of principle of aerodynamics before they learn the facts about a rocket or an aeroplane mechanism .

Nevertheless , argument can be made that learning the ideas and concepts are the gradual steps of learning process and coming to facts .
Learning is a process where an individual has to go through certain steps to master the subject .
Understanding concepts and ideas leads to actual fact .

Subject can be learn in numerous way , if we just know the facts without understanding the actual concept and ideas behind it , it wouldnt master you in subject and knowledge would n't persist for a long .

Therefore , I personally advocate the process of understanding concepts and facts throughly before you come to actual fact .
This way of learning will be efficient for students to learn the subject with a perfection .
Approaching the process of learning is this manner will get depth knowledge which may endure .
