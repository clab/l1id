Ideas and concepts are important and are considered as important base for the development of a child as a human being .
Ideas and concepts can make built a future understanding and prospect for a person .
There is a small line of demarcation between ideas , concepts and facts .
Ideas and concepts are described as , that a person on basis on what is being learnt or his understanding of concept can think of an example to visualise it in a better way .

The ideas and concepts , once understood by a person can make his way to wide view , or imagination and can easily draw out what he or she has understood about the subject .
Example : - a student is told about a tree and is told that it is green in colour , and has wood which is brown in colour and grows from roots .
And that there are stems in wood through which leaves in green colour that can provide with ` shelter and shadow , can grow So , this idea or concept about the tree can help a child to know hat tree is , what are its features , what all benefits of trees are .
And all this can help him to imagine how tree looks like , and when he can see the tree will recognise as to what he has a knowledge about that particular thing .

So , ideas can also help to have rememberance and recoginition .
Wherease , facts are simply stated , but you cannot imply about them .
These facts cannot let one to think To there wide imagination , as to how things can be , and what can be its advantages and disadvantages .
Because its is one basic matter that is imposed on one by being stated as what is called as `` facts '' .
But some facts over duration of time create enthusiasm among one to know about the concept , or logic behind it .
And that is when one uses there ideas and visualise the fact to a concept .

Hence i agree with the statement that students should understand ideas and concepts than to learn simply facts .
Because , it can be difficult for a student in his growing years to understand and pik up the concepts and ideas , and to think about there own views on those ideas .
But it is the best way of teaching and understanding , as can help is overlasting future .
Because there are situations in Colleges that we face whereby self study , and undertading of concept helps a student more than just simply inculcating the facts , without knowing the other important implication and benfits of such a stated facts .

So .
with few difficulties in using brains to a right direction , and visualising of all facts and ideas can help a student with a great future prospect that just simply taking of facts from the teacher .
So its important to question , as to wh'ether its fact or a concept .
