Along with changes in generations , induviuals beliefs , thoughts , and reasoning changes .
I have seen generations right from my great grand mothers age down to my little sister .
For me the defination of enjoyment holds a lot of significance .
Enjoyment according to me is a state in which an induviual attains `` ultimate happiness '' in what ever he or she is performing .

I completely disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
To say that young people do not enjoy life comparitively is false and incorrect .
If the defination of enjoyment remains stationary , then so does its impact on peoples life .
The only difference arises in th eway people percieve and interpret it to be .
Enjoying and relishing life to the fullest can be accomplished in several different methods .
To enjoy life one doe not have to be of any particular age limit .

My sister often asks my grandmother to go and enjoy her life and not sit in front of the television box the whole day and eat .
But my grandmother often tells her that for her the television and food is her ultimate sense of enjoyment .
For my sister to party and go out everyday with her friends is her source of entertainment and enjoyment but for someone whose old may look at it in a different way .
They may say that this girl is spoilt she goes out everyday , but that is her sense of enjoyment .

The difference clearly lies in the way people interpret it .
But according to me my grand mother is enjoying her life as much as my sister is and she loves her life to be the way it is .
By watching television it does not make her inferior , she recieves as much as joy and happiness as my sister does by going out and partying .
there is no consise defination of enjoyment my grandmother is expressing the ultimate sense of happiness she sachieves by doing teh deeds above which is basically her defination of enjoyment .

Yes , the generations have changed , technology and science have advanced a lot into this modern world of ours .
But emotions , feeling and the ways to express it have all remained the same .
It is important that the young generation begins to value and respect the emotions and the methods of expressing them from the older generations .
