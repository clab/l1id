I would rather say that , whether one should have broader knowledge of many academics fields or should have more knowledge in specialized subject , depends upon the age of the person .
Suppose , for the students studying in primary , secondary or pre-university level , should have broad concept of many subjects and students studying in under graduate , graduate level or post professional or doctoral level should have specialization .

Because , student studying up to pre-university level are not on the verge of deciding about their future prospect as they are still younger and need to build up the basic foundation upon which his or her whole carrier depends .
They should have strong basic fundamentals regarding various subjects like maths , physics , biology .
chemistry or any art subject so later on once they get enough sense that , where they should head for their better opportunities base upon their interest , then they will have good , matured , broad mind to decide about it .

Under graduates , graduates or post graduates are the studies where one require to shoot towards mastery in his area of interest so later on , one can avail the good opportunities of employments towards his or her future prospects .
At this stage person requires specialized or specified knowledge of one subject to contribute his share on the perticular field to the society and mankind .
So that he can be the master of one rather than jack of all .

Thus , selection of the numbers of subjects should be based upon the stage of that perticular person in his academic level so the knowledge can be justified
