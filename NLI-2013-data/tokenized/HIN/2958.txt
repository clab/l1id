Everybody enjoys life .
It is not necessary to be young to enjoy life .
Yes it is true that people enjoy life in different manner and different styles .
Everybody has different ways of enjoying life .
There are people who are young physically and there are people people who are young by heart .
In my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Firstly , young people have the physical as well as mental strength to enjoy life more than older people .
The adrelinine in younger people keeps them going .
In todays fast moving world no one has time to wait for the right occasion and for the right time .
Young people are more energetic and lively .
Young people have the physical attributes to enjoy that bit more than older people .

Secondly , the opportunites , the occasions for young people to enjoy are much more than older people .
For enjoyment they can go to parties , clubbing , lounges etc .
They can aslo enjoy on any occasion because they have the time and energy to keep going .
Todays world caters to more hangout places , joints where young people can enjoy themselves .
There are more entertainment places opening for young where they can enjoy themselves to the fullest than there are for older people .
Young people can also find enjoyment at their work places or colleges .

Lastly , Young people have more options than older people .
Young people tend to have more friends collegues etc .
Young people can adapt to places and adjust to places faster which makes it easier for them to enjoy .

However older people also enjoy to an extent .
Older people try to find enjoyment in more subtle things .
They enjoy in a different manner .
For them enjoyment is more quite and calm .
They try to find enjoyment in small things .
Yet according to me younger people enjoy life more than older people since they are full of energy and adrelinine .
