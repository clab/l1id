Each and every person knows how to have fun in his or her own way .
I completely disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more that older people do ''

What is fun ?
All the smartest minds combined on our mother Earth will not be able to answer that question .
Every one has a different idea of fun .
I am ninteen years old and when I was younger I definately thought that my parents were boring and I never wanted to do anything fun with them .
I thought that my friends and I were the end of the world .
While on the other hand my parents went out all the time and had fun too .

Fun is what a lot of people would connect enjoying life too .
In my opinion that 's incorrect .
I like to go out , party and spend most of my time with my friends but on the other hand my aunt prefers sitting at home and watching t.v or talking on the phone or surfing the internet .
She sits at home and I party , to a stranger my aunt would sound really boring but she has fun in her own way .
She 's enjoying life too .

Older people suit the phrase `` been there done that '' perfectly .
They have experienced what the younger generations are going through right now at this moment .
Younger people want more and older people are saturated and want to do different things which would relax them .

To enjoy life we have to do what we like , even if its just sitting and staring into thin air and we have to do these things with the people who we love and who love us .
Spending some quality time with the people who we care about , what more could anyone ask for ?

Enjoying life is a must but how you do it is n't .
Pursue your dreams follow not only your heart but also your mind .
Do it well and dont forget the poeple who have stood by your side along the way .

To enjoy life older people do n't need to be party animals , as long as you do what makes you happy your automatically enjoying life in your own special way ..
