Sucessful people try new thingsand take risk rather that followin the crowd and repeat the things which is already known to him .
i firmly agree with the topic and decide to advocate with the comment .

It is the vision of great eminent people who have taken great risk in life and try to catch their dreams had made humanity to reach the zenith .
their audacious capability in different fields have brought glory to the civilization .

One such example is Wright brothers who invented the aeroplane .
the dreamt that one day man can fly has resulted such a phenomenal discovery and today people and travel from one corner to another in instant time .
same as the case of Galvani , tesla and edison wose efforts and risk have generated electricity In business world taking risk has led to development of of great industries and due to this people economy has flourished .
great business man like Henry Ford , Mittal and Bill gates left their happy contended job and took up the challange to establish great business empires .

ANOther example was Lance Armsstrong who disregard ailments for cancer and went on winning the great cycle race All great indepedance wars are soaked with the blood of matyrs who sacrificed the risk free family life and jumped to fight against authority to free their mother land .
Although i agree that their are factors and high risk of failures .
but without risk one can not reach his dreams to come true .
success is not absence of failures but overcoming of the failure .
Because of men who had tried new things mankind had made such platonic leaps .
man has reached moon , climbed Everest peak Thus the risk taken by people may apparant br pain staking but with time and effort harvest fruits of success .
