I agree with the statement that young people do not spend enough time helping their communities .
I believe from personal observation and experience that social service has much lesser importance amongst the youth of today than what it should ideally be having .
Young people do not seem to think that community service should be an integral part of their lives .

This is unfortunate , because social service has profound impact both on the individual and community levels .
Social service builds personal character , promotes community spirit and develops respondibility in a person .
Hence it is essential for the overall growth and development of the person .
Community service is essential for a functioning society - it promotes the general well-being of the society , encourages responsibility division and delegation and greatly enhances the integration of the community .

One only needs to look around to find examples of youngsters neglecting their societial duties and responsibilities .
They are more busy admiring and aping transient entertainment and fashion icons .
These ` icons ' of today do nothing to instill social responsibility amongst their fans .
A life of hedonism is considered ` cool ' and seems to be the trend to follow for the youngsters .
They do not have enough concern about the welfare of the underprivileged , or the elderly .
They are unaware of pressing issues that their society faces .
Even in my own community - which places immense value on giving respect to elders - I have seen young people ignore the plight of their own parents and grandparents .

It is essential that the reasons for the greatly reducing sense of social responsibility amongst the youth be identified and remedial measures taken .
It should be instilled amongst them that as a part of society people have duties and responsibilities which simply cannot be shirked .
Parents and teachers must take care to instill the values of social service in children from and early age , and must themselves prove to be good role models .
Schools must regularly provide social service and community ethics courses , and atleast a few of them could be made mandatory .

In conclusion , I would like to reitierate the point that the lack of social commitment and responsibility amongst the youth is a trend that is detrimental to both the individual and society .
It is imperative that proper measures be taken to reverse this trend and to make our youth more socially responsible again .
