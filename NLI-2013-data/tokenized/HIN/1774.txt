The growing pace of technology and the ever increasing demand of intellectuals and learned people , in today 's world , is giving way to the traditional mode of acquiring knowledge and educating one 's self .
It is becoming increasingly important to be well versed with a variety of academic subjects , and I very much support this point of view .

A broad knowledge base is very important in tackling problems .
One need to have an overall knowledge relating to various fields to be able to solve the problem efficiently and easily .
A multi disciplinary approach is required in all most all fields now .
It not only quickens up the process , but at the same time saves a lot of man - hours , money and time .
For example , a students working in the field of environemental sciences needs to have a strong academic background on various subjects such as waste management , water conservartion , climate change , environmental pollution , bio diversity and so on .
Environment just does not mean greenery and your surroundings , as is commonly percieved .
thus one needs to a good knowledge base to be working in the feild .

At the same time a , multi - disciplined background doest not limit our thought process .
It enables us to venture into various fields , learn and gather knowledge about them .
It is indirectly helpling us to improve our personality and become an intctllectual and refined person .

A broad knowledge base also ensures professional success .
Today one may be working in the environemtal department of a company but tomorrow because of the field trips , interactions with the people and experience gained by the person he / she may be placed in the social department of another company at a better postion and a well - deserved salary too .

Thus , i would like to conclude by saying that a `` Jack of all trades is better than master on none '' .
