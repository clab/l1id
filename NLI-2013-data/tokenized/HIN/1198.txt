In my opinion , I strongly feel that one should be a specialist in what he/she does and this specialization can only be achieved when he/she undergoes systematic education in that specific subject .

There are lot of pros and cons associated to this topic of discussion .
To begin with , I would like to mention a few advantages of not specializing in one subject .
By having a broad knowledge , the person keeps his options open and waits for the right opportunity to strike at the right time .
As an example , when we apply it to the context of acquiring a job , this leaves him/her with some aspect of certainty that if the job market/behavior changes its orientation because of certain issues , he/she still has the ability to get himself/herself a decent job because of the knowledge gained in many academic subjects .

When it comes to a specialized person , I feel that he has many advantages over his couterpart .
Being focussed in one particular field , one can dedicate lot of `` time & effort '' and be motivated to work in this field .
He gets to learn this from people who have specialized in this field .
He is almost certain that he know the industry causes-needs situation .
He is trained to deal with every possible shortcomings in his filed of specialization .
He has the confidence to independently deal with the problems .
Apart from all these personal advantages , he helps the industry in recruiting the right candidate for the open job position .
This leaves the industry with some sort of relief of finding the right person for the position .

On a person note , I would like to focus on my academic background and discuss the reasons that help me adhere to my opinion .
In the final year of the undergraduate studies , I had to complete a project work .
I developed interest in this field and succesfully completed the project work with good grades .
But at the back of my mind , I had this certain level of incompleteness because during the course of my project work , I came across certain issues which needed more specialized education .
It was at that time , I decided that I should be enrolled for a masters program to get my doubts solved and to gain better perspective into this specific subject .
On the other hand , I could have completed the task and very superficially call myself and expert .
Now my thirst of knowledge has further increased as I feel that I should not leave my education midway and continue with a doctoral degree which will certainly make me an expert in this field .

Therefore , I feel that being perfect in a field helps rather than getting involved into things which you are not very good at .
As its rightly said `` Jack of all trades , master of none '' .
