Yes , I agree with the statement that `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . ''
Infact , in today 's highly competitive world , most young people 's sole focus is personal success and glory .
An aim that they start chasing from a very young age .
From getting into the best college , to getting the best job and making the most money .
These are the priorities that drive the young these days .

Helping the community is never really a pressing concern for the young .
Take for example the `` Brain drain '' in countries like India .
A phenomenon where most young and brilliant people choose to pursue their studies and careers abroad in countries such as the USA and others in Europe .
Their main motivation is a better standard of life and earning more money .
Most of these people never return to their native country and as a result deprive it of their input and the much required help .

Young people who do have strong morals and want to help their communities and country , often feel helpless in doing so and feel that they do n't have enough power to make a change alone and that they would be in a better position to help their community if they were successful and powerful .
As a result they put off helping their communities , while they pursue their careers .
Some of these people do follow their original intentions and work for their community , but most get caught up in their worldy affairs and find that they do n't have the time or the inclination to help their communities .

Well in my opinion , its not really the fault of young people who are driven by their ambitions and ca n't find the time in their very hectic lives to help the community .
You could say that the world is heading towards this situation of apathy because of the ever increasing need to stay ahead of the competition and succeed in the global environm
