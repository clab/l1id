Yes i agree with the statement , because Logic of the car in a city is always based on the fact that there is a fuel present in , on which it can run .
So the basic fact should be that - presence of fuel in abundance .
But that is not the case , as we all know fuel ( petrol , diesel ) are non renewable souces of energy .
The fuel takes thousand of years ro come in to being , but they are reducing faster as compare to their presence with us .
so in return their prices are increasing day by day .
And people have already started taking for different alternatives like CNG ( compressed natural gas ) , LPG ( liquified petroleum gas ) .
But the irony is that these options are also non renewable .
So somewhere down the line the prices of fuel wether in any form which i have talked about will be so high that middle class and upper middel class will not be able to afford it and hence they will use public transport to commute .
SO that class vehicles will not be prent on roads wether car or two weheeler .
After sometime say 10 yrs more the fact will hit the upper class too and we will not have any car or vehicle on road .
The time line about this danger , which i have already given in the above discussion is so predictable that one can have even calculations about it if he/she has both the population and existing fuel count .
They should also have the rate at which fuels are getting depleted .
So the best way to tackle the proablem is to find out renewable source of energy through which one can commute to different places .
Surely the work has already been started , because the affect of this fear is already noticable in the current scenario .
