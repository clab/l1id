I agree to the fact that young generation is increasingly becoming more negligent about their community and ignoring the obligation they on the behalf of their community .
I think that this is mainly because the drastic change that we are facing on the global level .
In this age of globalization .
Every one today need to compete on a world level so one need to be very much target oriented if he wants to make significant progress in his professional life .
And because of this young generation is not able to give enough time to their community .

In earlier days when there were slow mode of transportation and communication were available .
At that time working area of young people was limited and they remained connected with their local land , they faced and observed the problems of their community .
This led to them think about their people and inspired to do something for their betterment .

But today life has become much more complex .
Every one is running restlessly to serve their verious purpose for to make their career , to earn money etc .
And they dont have any motivation which forces them to devout some of their effort for the well being of their community .
Every one has become a little bit self oriented .

Also education burden and the pressure for building their career on the young generation do not provide much time to think about growing problems in their community .
Most of the young people now a days living away from their home land either for the purpose for study or working with some multinational company .
They rarely have time to meet their family and see their home land .
And as the famous saying goes `` out of site is out of mond '' , They rarely find time to think about their community .
