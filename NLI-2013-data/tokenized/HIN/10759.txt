`` Only people who venture into the Sea get the Pearl '' .
So goes an ancient Indian proverb .
And how true ?
I completely agree with the statement that success comes to those who take risks and do n't merely rest on past laurels .
I will present some explanations and examples to support my strong opinion about the issue .

If we stop and think about what will happen if all of us continue to do only the things we are sure of , or things we are best at ?
I shudder to think of such an eventuality .
The whole world would come to a grinding halt .
The world needs innovation and hunger in people to try on new things .
And the people who do that can be called the drivers of the world .
They are the leaders in the true sense .
For example had Gallileo not taken a stand about the earcth being round , had columbus not made that discovery that changed the world order .
What would the world be like ?
The constant need of change and trying on newer and better things may be risky but is certainly worthwhile .

Also in this fast changing world , if people however successful , stop trying new things and taking risks , they will soon find themselves not successful .
Businesses , scientists and governments , in other words all the people need to take risks just to survive .
You can keep on doing what you do best ; but in time you will realise that the thing you do no longer is good enough because the times have changed .

Moreover none of the inventions and discoveries were made without taking risk .
Currently popular management and business procedures were a risk when they were implemented for the first time .
We have only the people to thank who were brave enough to take up the challenge .
We need more such people if we continue our growth in almost any field .

Another important fact about risks and new things is the novelty value and the motivational effect .
New things and risks challenge people which is fodder for most successful people .
They crave for that challenge - they are challenged to out do themselves and this keeps the successful people going on .

Here goes a common joke on Bill Gates .
`` Bill Gates dropped out of school to create the Microsoft empire .
I can bet my last dollar on `` Had he continued in school , he would still be working in Microsoft - just owned by someone else '' .

This aptly concludes that success comes to those who are not averse to taking risks and constantly try newer things .
