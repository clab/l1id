i do agree with the statement .
in todays fast moving world everybody wants to step ahead .
everybody wants succes and make progress .
young people are so busy with their studies that they forgett their responsiblity towards their community .
all are so busy studying that they have no time leftover for extra activities .

they were our parents and grandparents who use to do this job perfectly .
if not studies young people are busy with their college , classes , homework and all .
and if not thae they are busy with their friends , movies , partners , or just freeking out and having fun and enjoying their days , forgetting about their duty towards their community .
this is something called GENERATION GAP .
they are now no more interested in doing such social work .
they find it boring and waste of time .

we all should take some measures towards it to try to explain the young generation that helping to our community is so very important .
we should offer an helping hand and do something beneficial for them .
we should not only help our community but also to our friends family and to all who needs us who needs our help .
we should regularly visit orphanage , blindhome , widowhome , and ask them if they need something from us .
we should spend some time with them and see that their life is so painful and full of sorrows .
we should be responsible towards our community and our people .
we should try to bring SMLIE AND HAPPINESS on their face .
we should talk to them tell them what is going around in the world and advise them to do right things .
share our own experience with them so they feel nice about them .
as we are responsible towards our daily life we should show our responsiblity towards our community too .
as they need us .

afterall , helping is a good deed .
we should also teach our younger generation too to help our community we need to inculcate such values in children so that they can bring a bright future , with flying colours .

we should give sometime from our busy schedule as our duty to such people and help them .
this can bring smile and happiness on tjeir face .
seeing thst we will be happy too and prosper our society .
