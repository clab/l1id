The main purpose of advertisements is to attract potential customers .
Hence they are made in a way that makes the product seem much better than the product actually is .
Advertisements use different ways to make the product very attractive .
They tend to deceive us in some ways .
They also usually highlight only those features that are very appealing to people .

Advertisements are made to market a product and increase its sales .
The main aim of advertisement is to make the product look very suitable to its potential buyers .
For this , the product must look really attractive .
Sometimes , to achieve this fake objects are used .
For example , the bright red strawberry pieces in the advertisement of a cereal may not actually be the real strawberry .
It may be just brightly painted plastic pieces .
When the advertisement looks very appealing , people get interested in it .
No one would want to buy something that looks dull , uninteresting .

Children are specially influenced by the advertisements .
In the advertisements , the toys appear so real and much better than they actually are .
For example , the spiderman toy seems to jump , fly and save the planet from the bad people .
In reality , it is the child actor who is holding the toy , who is making it do wonderful things .
But to the child who is watching the advertisement , it seems as if the toy is doing things on its own .
So advertisements do deceive us in some way which we fail to recognise when we are watching them .

Advertisements usually focus on only those features that are very appealing .
For example , when you see an advertisement on phone services , you will see a list of features like high quality service , great rates , etc. in bold letters .
What you may miss out is , something in small letters that says , `` Conditions may apply '' .
Advertisements tend not to highlight hidden costs or factors that may scare away the potential customer .

Advertisements are made to sell the product and for that they do make the product seem much better than what it actually is .
