As a country progresses , enhances its economic power , it also leads to an increase in the purchasing power of the people in the country .
In twenty years time , people are expected to have higher incomes and purchasing power than at present .
Having a house and a car are basic necessities and it does seem indispensable to most of us .
I totally disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than they are at present .
I will support my opinion in the following paragraphs .

The first reasoning that I would like to put forward is that as a country is moving from an under-developed to being a developing country or a developing country to a developed country , over time it will lead to increase in employment levels , which will subsequently lead to a rise in the income levels and purchasing power of the people .
For instance , in my own country , India , there are a lot of individuals and families who own cars today than the last twenty years .
The traffic for cars in cities like Delhi and Bombay , where the income levels are rising rapidly , there is also evidence of more number of cars in such places .
The statistics show the number of persons owning cars have only been increasing over the years .

The second reason that I would advance for my argument is , that car is a very convenient mode of transportation .
Personally , I feel , it is more convenient for most of us than air planes , bikes , buses and other modes of transportation .
It offers a kind of flexibility which is incomparable .
Its very practical for everyday use .

The third reasoning would be it has a lot of utility for people with families , which all of us do !
A situation where most people are owning their own air planes or buses is not quite palatable to me .
Cars have also become very sophisticated and user-friendly these days .
There are a whole whole of models and prices to choose from .

To conclude , cars , in my opinion , falls under the category of a ` need ' and not a ` luxury ' .
What could possible happen twenty years down , is that the cars could get even more sophisticated .
There could be even more models for cars , much more than what is present today .
