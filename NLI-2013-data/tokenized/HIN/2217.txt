Young people enjoy life more than older people .
There are two aspects of this statement .
Time does not stop for anyone .
Every person faces the every age group of a man 's life .
When a person takes birth it is in his infant stage .
Later he grows and passing through aldolence , young , middle age groups and reached the last age group that is old age group .
So all age groups are indespensible part of man 's life .

One aspect of the statement is that young age is the time when a person gets full freedom in his or her life .
Usually in this age a person leaves away from the home .
So he or she is away from any family tension , restriction etc .
Definately this is the time when a person can enjoy the life maximum .
To enjoy the life young people go to parties and disco every other day .
Young peolple go to different trips for enjoyment .
This is the age where there is no reason for parties .
Reason is just one that is enjoyment .

But I would like to add one thing more that this is the age when a person can learn maximum from his or her life .
Person of young age learn to manage while living in a room with other room mate during college studies .
This is time when a person is also more concern about carrier .
He or she having a lot tension for carrier .

Another aspect of this satemant is that to enjoy the life , depends upon a individaul 's views , way of thinking , attitude towards life .
A person having positive attitude can live happy in any age group .
Old people do have a lot of exprience of life .
They have already seen many ups and downs of the life .
So in this age they like to spend time peacefully .
At this age this a sought enjoyment for them .
So they also feel happy in playing with their grandson and granddaughter in garden , going church , read bible , travelling different hill stations , get togther of old friends , going to club etc .
Another thing is that a young with negative attitude even can not live happy in the age of most enjoyment .

Although young people enjoy life more than older people but it also depends on a individaul 's attitude towards life .
