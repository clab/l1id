Learning and having knowledge are to different things .
learning mainly related to theritical knowledge or we can say , that it means lerning facts .
Understanding an idea and concept is not learing , But in my opinion I think that understanding facts and concept is more better than the learning facts .
as fact and concepts will help me to implenment the idea in more promising way than the learning facts .
For example when i was in my ninth standard i got my exibition , project on solar cooker and in that project i secured A+ and when the same question came on solar cooker was asked on my annual exam i secures only B+.
Although i was having good knoweledge of solar cooker but i better implemented it through using the ideas and conceopts in the project .
and in my opinion in life only the ideas and concepts which you have in mind help and not the facts which you have learned .
it will only provide you with good grades in class .
and to improve your progress reports For getting success a person is asked to implement its idea so to show that he is far more better than his other collegues .
Although in intial stage of life you have to use your acedemic records but they do n't help you for a long run success for long run success you have to perform by your ideas and concepts .

ideas are store in mind for pemanent way but lerning facts remian only till exams .
so in my opinion understanding ideas is more important then learning facts
