`` Better skin starts now ! ''
Catchy phrases like this are banal for the average consumer today .
Newspapers , television commercials , magazines , radio , billboards - all offer a myriad of advertisements that tend to make products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisers utilize a variety of techniques to promote their products ; techniques that often overrate the real value of products .

A prime example of appealing advertising is evident when advertisements are designed to target a specific group of individuals .
For instance , toy makers use cartoons and other animated characters to entice young kids .
They enlarge the actual size of the toys , tricking the children into buying their product .
Commercials animate dolls in order to make them seem realistic .
Such techniques form a false illusion in the childrens ' minds , leading them to think that the dolls can actually walk and talk like regular humans .

A second example of misleading advertisements can be seen in the variety of promotions available for skin care products , specifically targeted at the teenage population .
These days many products claim to treat any kind of acne problems within a period of three to five days .
However , they fail to mention that every teenager has a different skin type , ranging from dry to oily , that responds to skin care products dissimilarly .
For instance , though a face wash might remedy acne for one person , the same product might result in redness or dryness for some other individual .
Therefore , consumers should not be misguided by extravagant commercials but use their judgement wisely before purchasing products from the market .

One should realize that advertisements are paid endorsements for their respective products .
Their purpose is to attract the common public , motivating people to support their product .
Since there are millions of products available to the consumers , advertisements need to make their products seem exceptional .
They need to stress the advantages , while undermining the negative aspects of the products .
Thus , it is our responsibilty to prevent getting caught by the trap of advertisemenst
