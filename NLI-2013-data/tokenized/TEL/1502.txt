I agree with the statement that `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
The reasons that make me feel so are as follows : Firstly , having a broader knowledge in many subjects helps us a lot in our everyday activities .
After all , the subjects we learn are useless unless we know how and where to apply them .
We come accross many aspects in our day to day life where in the need for application of knowledge we gained arises .
People who have specialized knowledge in one subject will not be able to apply it frequently as the issues would n't always involve the same problems regarding the same subject .

We can share our knowledge with many others if we have an idea of all the subjects .
One can involve himself in a discussion among a group of people if he knows few important points about the topic or the subject .
People with specialized knowledge are always less in number considering the fact that there are many subjects and different people may specialize in different subjects .
Discussions often lead to important revelations that one would be unaware of before that .
This is not possible usually when the person has specialized knowledge as it would be very difficult for such a person to find a similar person with the same specialization to involve himself in a discussion with .

Another important advantege for people with broader knowledge of many subjects is that they would be able to think in many ways , in different directions .
These people have greater domain knowledge than those with specialized knowledge whose thinking abilities would be restricted .
People come to conclusions and solve the different problems they face based on what they see , hear and learn .
Their thought would be provoked higher if the domain on which it is based is large .
Hence , people with specialized knowledge have their thinking confined to fewer areas than those with broader knowledge , though not complete and specialized .

The points made above are the reasons on which my decision to agree with the given statement lies upon .
Practical application of knowledge and way of thinking are two important areas which are to be concentrated on .
When these two issues are considered , along with many others , broader knowledge is recomended as it provides the person with opportunities for further development .
