There is a general notion among the older generation that today 's youth are irresponsible and are not socially concious .
They feel that young people do not care about their communities or their nation as a whole .
I disagree .

True , the older generation can proudly boast of all the help that they have done to their communities and their nation .
Take the case of the fight for Indian Independence in the first half of the 20th century .
The youth at that time were very social concious .
They were passionate about their country and involved themselves in various freedom movements .
Some of them were ready to die fighting for their country , such was their vigour and devotion towards their country .
Similar cases can be seen throughout the world at that time when the world was undergoing a change with two world wars and decolonilisation taking place .
But in no way can the older generation assert that the younger generation do not give enough time to help their communities .

Today 's youth may not have the social and political awareness that their parents and grand parents have , but it is incorrect to see today 's youth as irresponsible and bound by consumerism .
Young people are wrongly accused of having a do n't - care attitude towards their communities .
There are many instances that overturn this notion .
For example , in my colony , it is the young people who organize festivals and programs to celebrate and rejoice with their community as a whole .
I can often see college going students give lifts to old people who are too old to travel in public transportation , in their vehicles .
The recent Bollywood movie ` Rang De Basanti ' depicts four young men who eliminate a corrupt politician for the good of the society .

Therefore , it is wrong to believe that young people only think about where their next date will be or when they will see their next movie .
They are very respnsible towards their society .
