In the present scenario , we see how the youth is changing in their behaviour .
They are more advanced and infact many people opine that the youth in this generation is degrading .
The fact that young people of this generation are more advanced does not imply that they do not give enough time to helping communities .
I certainly not agree with the statement , ' Young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities ' .
Some of the supporting examples are explained below .

Many young people form associations which volunteer in social activities like serving the needy , building homes for the old age and the orphans , bringing awareness about dreadful diseases and conducting health campaigns in the slums .

They are the one who feel more responsible as a citizen of their country , in upliftment of their families .
Many young people give tutions to children to earn their living .
This activity is in a way helping the children to learn more and be aware of the things happening .
And thereby helping the society as it is popularly known that ' Today 's children are tomorrow 's citizens ' .
So the youth today is helping out in producing good citizens .
I want to support my opinion by stating another example .
A political association , ` Lok Parithran ' ( which means empowerment of the humans ) , was formed by young graduates in my country .
They campaigned in many villages and volunteered in many social activities .

Despite of hectic schedules , with several courses to learn and several projects to work on , the youth of this generation do spare time for thier communities .
The young students have that zealous to do something substantial which makes them work effectively and spontaneously .
They are the ` architects of the nation ' .
They play an important role in building their communities .
