The given statement is , `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Most of the people agree with this statement as the present generation has much advanced environment for entertainment and lots of new places to hang out in groups .
I like to disagree with the statement .

As i have mentioned in the earlier paragraph , it might seem as if younger people enjoy life more than older one does .
But that is not true according to my concern .
In the present generation one could notice that the technology have been improved and has lead to the next level in advancement .
This , in addition increases the studies in science and in other areas .
In order to compete in the world , young people have to study more and automatically spends more time working , in order to improve the skills .

I would like to add the phrase , Work hard and enjoy later .
If a person enjoys life in his young age , he definitely cannot compete with the future generation and hence suffer in his old age .
But in the case of a person who works hard in the young age , can make good fortune so that he would lead a safe and peaceful life in the later age .
Also .
only at the young age , people would be physically fit compared to to the aged ones and furthermore have good stamina to do hardwork .

I would like to add a real time example to support my statement .
All the personalities whom we have hear 'd and come across in our life would have worked hard in their early ages .
I think everyone would accept this fact .
I would like to point out a person known to me who is leading a happy and fortune life .
In his early age , he use to work at textile factory based on daily wages .
There he studied his work keenly and worked hard so that he became permanent employee and got promoted .
Later with his knowledge , that he gained from his experience he started an individulal unit outside that manufactured the spare part which the company is , frequently in need of .
Now he is one of the major supllier of spare parts for that company .

Any person who lives prosperous life and who is assumed to be one of well known personality would have worked hard in their earlier life .
Thus working hard in early time gives fruitful results that makes people enjoy ther later life period .
