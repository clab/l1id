I think young people definately enjoy life more than old people do or ever did .
In the olden days , there was a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of the younger generation .
However , the more laid-back lifestyle of the 21st century allows youngsters to have more than their share of fun .
Nevertheless , there are always limits as too much of a good thing is also bad .
With all the responsibility on the older generation , the younger generation does not even feel the need to be role models for their siblings .
Children , with all their innocence find joy in the most mundane places .
A tiny chocolate makes a child smile ear to ear whereas an adult striking a million dollar deal is overcome by greed instead of being proud and happy .
Children can enjoy the little aspects of life which go unnoticed by the older generation .

I would like to illustrate an example from my own experiences .
When my family visited Thailand in june 2004 , we were all very enthusiastic as the entire family would be meeting up after five years .
We all had a blast jet sking , parachute sailing etc .
It was only later that we realised that our parents did not get this opportunity as they did not have enough money at that time .
In our merriment we had forgotten about them and they , not wanting to disappoint us did not say a word .
This is a very trifle example but for the first time I realised how much elders do to make our life more enjoyable than theirs .

As we grow more mature , our definition of fun keeps changing .
Initially fun was synonomous to PS 2's and partying but as we grow older we mellow down .
We realise that fun and responsibility are a package deal called life .
When you are dependent on someone , its like your insured and you have no cause for worry .
When you get past being a teenager and people start depending on you , you are their insurance and therefore have responsibility .
This is not necessarily a bad thing as it instills in you a sense of independence and pride .
A little fun is always necessary for anyone - young or old to lead a happy , healthy life .
