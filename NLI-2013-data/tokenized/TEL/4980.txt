I agree with statement that most products seem much better than they really are .
well , commercials about the products are very commoon and really essential for the product to sell in the very compitive market .
but over casting the product and giving the credits to products than really worth it could cause the common man to consume the products that are really less productive and worthless .

The use of media to bring the product near to the public and make it more attractive and intresting is the common and basic idea of the advertisement .
But , missuse of the overal concept will create the problems both at the consumer level and at the production level .

The typical example of this kind is advertising the vaccum cleaner .
The typical commercial will say about their prodct is very best and uses new technology in keeping the environmet very clean .
by watching the advertisment one can go to the store and bring the cleaner home and strart use of it to expect the best out of it .
If the prodcut is not really performing what it was claimed causes the real upset of the product .

Over casting the products does not stop at the products we commonly use at home it has spread in the advertisemant of the drugs that we use .
The recent `` vioox '' the pain killer that made by merk has been withdrawn from the market because it is causing the risks to the heat .
The vioox was over advertised for its usage in the pain management in arthritis .
But , after the facts was reveled this drug will cause serious risks to the heart they taken out of the market .

To summarise , The advertisemets are good in means of reaching to the public about the product and it benifits .
But , overcasting resulting the loss of the trust about the product , maker and the whole concept of advertising .
