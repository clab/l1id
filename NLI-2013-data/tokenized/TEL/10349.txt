yes the above statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
Because if the person is already successed in doing one thing then he will definitely take risks in doing the new thing rather than doing the old thing which is already been successed .
after the one success he should try the new thing and must take risk otherwise he or she will not get success in future .
For example if a person developed a computer software and got successed in his software then the person takes risk and develop a new software which is more usefull than the previous one and takes it as a challanging task .

And suppose for the best example take `` microsoft '' comapy which developed microsoft disk operating system that is ms-dos and after it 's succession then developed later edition as windows-95 and later came windows - 98 , 2000 , ME , XP .
and after all of them are successed the company developed anew and latest operating system that is windows vista which is the latest of all computer operating systems .
which is now competing with machintosh operating system of apple computers owened by `` steve jobs '' .so if the microsoft havent take the risk of developing windows vista after the succession of windows-XP then now we might not using the windows-vista , definitely not .

The reasons behind taking risks are the successful people who is already successed are very good in the society and they cant be fixed to their success so they will try new things and even takes risks for their new success .
Another example is that if a business man running super market if it gets successed then that person will invest his profits to keep another branch in the same city by taking risks rather than looking at the already successed super market .
And also he tries to develop the other branch to earn profits like the other do .

so , finally i agree with the above statement that successful persons take risks and find new things .
