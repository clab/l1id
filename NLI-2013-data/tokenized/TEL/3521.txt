Its a fact , that `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .

The newer generations are at an advantage when you think of the luxuries , comforts .
The new inventions and rapidly developing technologies are resposinble for this .
These are the factors which are very attractive and young people forget their prime duties towards the community which includes their family , school , college , locality and the town or city wherever they live .

World has become very competitive , you ca n't be successful unless you are calibred and you have exceptional talents .
In order to resist this , the adults and parents are busy in their works and not giving enough attention and time to motivate the younger ones to perform their prime duties .
In a way , most of the young people lack in guidance and motivation to help one another .

The influences of certain movies make the young people think wild and a few sports like w.w.f. , gradually turn the young people to start thinking that they are real heroes and thus their thoughts are diverted towards wrong ways .
Internet , its a bliss for this generation - but in the same time , its often misused too .

Young children , thesedays love to spend their time with computer in the form of games , chatting and some kids in browsing the bad websites also , which are easily available .
In the process , the young children are busy with school , homework , time with computer , etc , they spend whole day .
They do not find any time to mingle with the friends of their age and thus they do not develop any kind of attachment to one another .
At times , we get to see some children growing in certain families with least attention and love , who gradually turn very materialistic and help in no way to their community .

Every adult and parents must take up this task as important one and start thinking about the future world .
They must motivate the younger ones to work towards helping their community , starting from home , school in whatever they way they can .
