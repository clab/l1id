The issue stated by the topic is whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to be specialize in one specific subject .
I belive that rather than having broad knowledge about many of our academic subject it is more better to have more knowledge about the one we specialize in .
I would prefer this because having a little knowledge on many academic subjects doesnt lead to success in our life .
so it is better to specialize in one major subject .

I will prefer to specialize in one subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academics because of the following reasons .
The reasons will be that now - a - days most of the companies offering the jobs to the students who are more specailzed according to the requirements of the company ie. , companys are more intrested in the students who are `` specializers '' .

Another reason which dragged me to prefer to be specialized in one specific subject is that when we are trying to have broad knowledge about all the academic subjects we cant able to learn the basics in detail ie. , we are not able get the overall inforamtion about the all the subject which turns to be useless of learing all those .
A famous english professor made a quote related to the above topic which says that `` we should n't be jack of all and master of none '' .
This quote conveys that we are used to learn all the subjects in our academic years but masters of none of these subjects .
many famous scientists like newton , thomas alve edison doesnt had a much broader knowledge but in fact they are specialized in thier own subjects which made them famous through out this world .

Ultimately , i feel that it would be better to be specialized in one subject rather than having knowledge about all the academic subjects .
