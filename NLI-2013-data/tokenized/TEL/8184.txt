According to me , Ideas and concepts form the base for successful understanding of a subject .
Facts are also important for subjects like history or biology .
But having knowledge only of facts , Student cannot fetch much .
Facts can be developed if a student possess an understanding of ideas and facts .

There are many daily life examples that would differentiate the importance between both .
For example , let us consider a pocelin flower vase that is placed on a table at one corner of the house , a child may break it though hearing the fact that the porcelin would break .
but , if a child has the idea regarding the product , if he has a knowledge about the charecteristics of porcelin then he would never break it .
unless and until something happens accidentally .
If students possess a background knowledge about a product or anything they would handle it with care .

Having knowledge of Ideas and concepts would help students in their research work .
With ideas and concepts they can enhance the existing theory and develop a new theory .
facts are also important but possessing facts alone cant help students enhance an existing theory .

Having knowlede of facts holds good for subjects like history and political sciences .
these are the subjects where dates have to be remembered .
when talking about other subjects like computer sciences , it is necessary that students possess idead and concepts about the subject .
For example when a team is woking on a project ( each person allocated different job ) and suppose a person leaves suddenly then it becomes the responsibility of the rest of the team to complete the project .
This can be done if the students possess ideas and concepts regarding that part of the project whick is left by a person .

Hence the above reasons holds good in convaying that facts are important but ideas and concepts are important ,
