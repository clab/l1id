Yes i agree with the statement young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I think in all aspects young people enjoy more than older people .
I think younger people has less responebility than older .
If any one have some responebility they may not enjoy like responebility less persons .
I observed some points in my friends .
Some of my friends are donot have any restrictions or responability .
They enjoy a lot every day life .
It is not possible to older people because mostly they have some responses during old age .
Like their children education on other financial problems .
But these young people dont have such types of problems .

And some more reasons for this is health probelms .
Young people are very active where as older or not .
Young people can enjoy with out taking any rest for so many hours .
Where as olders cannot do this .
Better example for this is every weekend i prefer to go some pubs in my city .
I can found lot of youngers and olders their .
I obseved that youngers dance till the late night .
But it is highly dificult to older people .

Another best example to state this opinion is my life style .
Am very crazy person .
Always i want enjoyment in my life .
I have lot of friends .
Am very crazy about making friends .
I think making friends also enjoyment for me .
Because I can roam with my friends in my city .
We went movies and restarents .
I can found enjoyment with romaing them .
I like to travel .
I feel it is enjoyment .
I make trips frequently .
And i enjoyed a lot in that tirps i visiti historical placec in my country .

I conclude that young people enjoy life more than older people .
