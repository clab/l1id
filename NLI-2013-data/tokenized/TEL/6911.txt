Cars are the most common means of transportation now-a-days especially in cities where reaching the destination in time is of utmost priority .
The number of cars used is always increasing with the increase in population .
But , I strongly believe that after twenty years , the number of cars used will be much less than those being used now .

As the number of cars used keeps increasing , the amount of air pollution caused by them will also be on the rise .
This will cause global warming as a result of which , there would be many coastal areas that will be submerged in the years to come .
I feel that this will cause an awareness among the people and will encourage them to use public mode of transportation in order to reduce the number of vehicles causing pollution .

Another reason that I feel would result in a decrease in the number of cars used is that the increased traffic would cause big delays in reaching the destinations .
The only feasible solution that I see for the traffic problem is the reduction in the number of vehicles .
Widening of roads might help to some extent in solving the traffic problem , but beyond a limit it is not of much use .
I feel that as a result of this , people will be forced to voluntarily give up the use of cars inorder to meet their requirements on time .

Apart from all these reasons , I also feel that there is a lot of risk associated with car journeys .
As an effect of this , more and more people might opt for relatively safer means of transportation like the train .
Furthermore , in most of the cases the train can be relied upon to take us to the destination on time .
This is one of the primary reason for the increased use of local trains in cities where people are in a hurry to reach their offices , schools etc ..

Finally , I wish to conclude stating that the above mentioned reasons are clear indicators that there could be fewer cars used in twenty years when compared to those being used now .
