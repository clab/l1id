Commmuntiy - a word that often reminds us the things like mutual cooperance , unified struggle in developiong the community , good communication between all the people involved in that particular community , so lack of any one of these cannot help in developing it .
When there 's such a strong requirement of mutual cooperance between different people in community , i dont think that its fair to say that young people do not put their efforts or time in developing it In every country we find that young people define their nation they live in , through their activities , so they have their strong impact on the society , its because of their active participation in several kinds of activities .
Young people are more vibrant rather one can say more enegetic than others so they show their involvement more vigourously , one example we can quote here is that if there 's any theft occured in the surrounding houses , we call young people for the help but not the elder people because they cant respond that quickly as the young people do .

These days we can see that young people have heavy schedules of their life because of the increased competition , inspite of this hectic schedule we can find many young people actively partcipating in social services , if we consider the young cricket players , everyone is aware that they have hectic scheule of their practice and tournaments , despite this when there 's a social cause they alll get together , take out time from their daily activity to help the needed .
one such cause was during the tsunami occured during december-05 .

Not only these people , we find many enthusiastic ( young ) people who work for the five days and devote one of the days in their weekend in doing something that leads to ammeliorated comunity like helping in the social oragnaisations , teaching the austic people to do various things .
One such oranisation is National institute for mentally handicaped ( india , hyd ) which opened gates for various young working people who spend most of their vacations in helping them out .
Many such situations prove that young people are never out of their responsiblity in developing their community .
