Yes , I do agree with the statement stated below .
Having a broad knowledge of many subjects is more good than having knowledge ioin one subject .
Because , every subject in the acadmic year are related with the other subject .

As we know that MATHEMATICS is father of all subjects .
It has the major influence on all other subjects .
Ther is no such subject which do not have an influence on it .
having a kowledge on it only one can have the kowledge on the other subjects completely .

For example , in our Bachelor degree , we have the subjects MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS and WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS .
Each have the influence on the other .
The mobile communication is the study of the science on the wireless transmissions where as the wireless transmission is the path for the mobile transmission .
Both have the influence on eachother .
Mobiles includes the telephones or the data transmission devices such as bluetooth , infrared devices which are used in the data transmission .
And the wireless transmission is the study or the process involved in the data transmission .
Not only these both subjects , ther are many other subjects which are very closely related to each other .

That is why I strongly agree with the statement that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialised in other subjects .
As we know the proveb that `` KNOWLEDGE IS DEVINE '' .
No matter what the subject is , having a knowledge on it will surely helps in kowing the other subjects .
