I would certainly agree with the statement that states `` successful people try new things and takes risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' because people are successful only if they could do something which other people does not think or try of doing them .

Successful people are those who dare to try new challanges and takes risk to to achieve desired results .
One example of this can be explained from my college days , my college has a three day festival called `` euphoria '' on the third day an actor agreed to come and perform in our college event for some amount of money .
But on day before his performance he called the management and said he want more money to perform as our rival college was willing to pay him large sum of money so our college management told us that they could not afford that much money to bring that actor to perform .
As we have printed the invitation cards and even distributed them , so we took the risk of using our college lemonaide machine which was not in good shape , we took great pain by staying in campus at night and repaired that machine and from next day itself we started to sell lemonaide to people visiting our college to see the function as it was in the summer season the total lemonaide was sold and we got required money to make the actor perform in our college .
By making the actor to perform in our college without financial help of our college management every one in our campus started to respect us and labeled us as successful candidates who saved our college reputation .

Thus , successful people are those who not only try new things and takes risks but makes there every move in order to help and improve the place or conditions people live in .
