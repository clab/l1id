Most people love to travel to different places .
the question here is whether we have to go alone by ourselves or to go by a group that will led by a tour guide .
my opinion is to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
i agree to this and i will explain you about my opinion .

First if you think you are going by yourselves .
you only planned the trip .
your hotel bookings everything was done through internet .
even though you listed the visiting sites from the internet .
if you travel to that place with out the tour guide , that trip thats not at all going to be fun why because travel guide knows the history of each and every place we are going to visit .
he will explain in you detail .
if any thing happens to you like if you will be sick suddenly what will happen you just imagine this kind of situation .

second is travel in a group that will be led by tour guide .
there are many advantages .
fisrt thing is in a group means you surely will have lot of fun .
travel guide takes to different places , he will explain the history of those visiting places .
one more thing he will fix the timings like at what time you have to get up ? , at what time you have to leave one place and go to another place .
so you wont have much tension about this planning .
travel guide will take care of all these .
one more thing is we will get lot of concessions in lodging because as we are going by a group and travel guide might be knowing some familiar hotels , where he will get some concessions obviously amount of money we need to pay will be less .
one important thing if suddenly we will be sick he will arrange us to go to the hospital as we are new to that place being a travel guide he might have known all the places and facilities what we will get .

As there is a saying in english '' EVERY COIN HAS TWO SIDES '' . there are advantages and disadvantages but my advantages out weigh the disadvantages .
Over all conclusion is every person once in their life time will travel to different places .
if you travel in a group that led by tour guide you surely will enjoy the trip , you are going to have lot of fun .
you are going to meet lot of different people , you can exchange their views , you can know about different cultures provided all this can be done , if we are guided by a travel guide .
travel guide takes care of every thing .
he will take our tensions by making us happy and he will see that we enjoy the trip .
