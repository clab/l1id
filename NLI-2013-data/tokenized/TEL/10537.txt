In business , it is said that `` Change is the only constant '' .
Through out history , examples abound where civilizations have fallen due to lack of change .
This applies equally to people and organizations .
Without a periodic renewal in the way things are done , there is a tendancy to stagnate and in certain cases , deteriorate .

I agree with the statement that successful people do take risks and venture out into new avenues , rather than doing repetitive tasks .
I would add a supporting assumption that the successful people base their work on certain core and fundamental principles that can be applied across various domains .
These principles include work ethics , moral values and judgements along with business and technical fundamentals .

Apple Computer 's CEO Steve Jobs is a prime example of a successful risk taker .
Instead of letting his upheaval from Apple during the 1990s shatter him , he started a new company NeXT , which was subsequently acquired back by Apple .
In parallel , he started Pixar animations , which is a completely different stream from what he was used to doing .
Now , both Pixar , with its animation movies , and Apple , with its iPod , Macintosh Computers , are immensely successful companies with Steve Jobs at their helm .
At the heart of his success lies the drive to do new things and doing the new tasks well instead of sticking with only doing one thing well .
A similar example is that of Lee Iacoca with his time in Chrysler and Ford .

The same statement applies to every professional .
In order to grow within an organization , it is not sufficient to just do ones job .
It is important to take that leap to the next level , which might be a big unknown , in order to show the capacity to grow to that next level and onward .
