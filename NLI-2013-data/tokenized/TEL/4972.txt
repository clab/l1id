Some people might believe that advertisements make products look more than what they really are , but I believe that advertisements make people wise , they help people to make decisions , and most importantly save time .
So I disagree with the statement that advertisements make products look more than they really are .

Advertisements are the source of information to the people , they clearlly explains what they really are .
They clearly mention there adavantages over therecounter parsts .
They cannot just give false information trying to make business , the laws now are really tightned , taking thisinto consideration they cannot make any false statements , and even if they do they are many consumer forums which will help us to guide through .

People are usually confused and out of mind about the various products available in the market , so advertisements helps people in making decisions .
We need not be an expert trying to understand what the advertisement is all about , they are made in such a way that a lay man can understand and make decision about there products .
Nowadays as the competition is increasing they are so many products coming out in the market , so these will help a lot in choosing the product we are looking for .
They give a detail explanation of the various function that product has .

In this busy life where we hardly get time to spend with our family and friends , advertisements come into picture they save a lot of time in choosing the products , when we are trying to purchase a product we need not go and look at the whole rack of products .
Advertisements help us to compare with other products , for example the price , benefits , uses etc ...
So by doing so we save a lot of time .

I do agree that some advertisements may actually see much better than they really are , but considering the issues like they educate people , they help in making decisions and save time , I think that the advertisements are of great help to the society .
End of the day you are the one who makes decisions nobody is forcing you into it .
