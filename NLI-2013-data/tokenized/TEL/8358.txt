I agree withe this statment , that itis important for the students to understand ideas and concepts to learn facts .
every one should pay attention towards the lectures , ideas or concepts .
during his/her acdemic section which helps him more during his career .
for example a grduate student of computer science should learn concepts of programming language so that it will help more in his career .
another example is that a graduate student of mechanical engineering should learn the main concept of mecanical unless he cannot survive in that field .

a student from primary stage should learn the the conepts .
at initial stage if he persue it effectively his academic career becomes an increadable .
if he does't his career may spoil .

if a person understand the ideas and the concepts he can learn more facts for example if a grduate student undrstands the concepts he can learn more facts which makes him better than others .
if he learn the fact he will apply which will gives a good results by understandindig the concepts .

our scientists observe the facts behind the concepts so they are doing meraciles .
the common people not really undrstood the facts behind the the concepts so they were living like that .

by really understanding the facts behind the concept one should do evrything in his own field so it necessary for a student to learn the facts behind the concepts and ideas .
which make him to elivate during his career .

finally i conclude that a student should understand the ideas and concepts to learn real facts which makes him better through out his life .
the concepts and ideas are really needed for a student to learn the real facts .
