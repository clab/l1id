Knowledege is something which we gain everyday .
Thus It should include learning of various subjects equally but not speacializing in one of them only .
According to me speacializing in a single subject is not always useful because of various reasons .

Firstly , it is not helpful in certain difficult situations where knowledge about the specific thing is required .
For example incase of short circuit it is important for the person to know what steps to take .
For this the knowledge of physics is required , It is similar in the case of bleeding or any other physical injury , the basic knowledge in first aid , learnt in human sciences is required .
Hence in practical sense knowledge of various subjects is of great importance .

Secondly , it is more demanding in these mordern days .
People are not really sure of being successful in a particular feild hence it is always safe to have equal knowledge about evrything as it will enable us to take up any proffession in futre .
As according to famous economist Gunnar Myrdal `` Education should be such that it should generate employment in any feild taken up by the educated . ''

Thus broad knowledge ensures employment oppurtunities at a better rate as compared to knowledge gained in a specific feild .
Thirdly , knowledge about a variety of subjects would not bore the person but it will make it interesting for him as he will concentrate on different subjects rather than a single one .

Fourthly , even quiz competitions lay emphasis on equal learning of all the subjects .
The questions asked in such competitions are related to different subjects .
Hence even in knowledge testing and gaining competitions like the quiz competitions show that broad knowledge is better as compare to speacialized knowledge in a specific subject .
