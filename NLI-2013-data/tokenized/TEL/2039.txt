I agree with the statement which says that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
There are different types of reasons and examples i can give for agreeing with the statement .

There are many common reasons , such as we can play for long hours in the playground .
But the old people cannot play for long hours as they do not have suffecient energy .
Young people can work for long time and lift the things that has more weight .
But where as the old people cannot work for long times and they can only lift things that are low in weight due to thier less strength .
Young people can have a lot of food when compared to old people .
Young people enjoy life by travelling to different places and staying there .
Where as old people cannot walk for long hours , so they cannot visit many places but rather sit in home and enjoy watching TV .
Young people can drink beers and dance in discos contuniously .
But this type of activities cannot be done by old people due to thier lack of energy in them .
Young people enjoy thier lifes by attending parties , games , culture programs and many more .
But the old people dont prefer this activities .
Young people do lot of exercises and build thier bodies .
They have the capabaility of doing anything .
As older people have no enough energy to participate in any events like games and compitions .

There are many reason and examples for stating that young people enjoy a lot rather than older people do .
Young people have lot of courage in them to participate in any events .
So the young people enjoy the life more excitingly than older people .
Its a common thing that young people enjoy a lot rather than older people .
So i agree with the statement given .
