In my point of view i would agree that in twenty years from now there will be fewer cars in use than today .
Lack of non renewable fuel , Stress on ecofriendly environments and new technology will perhaps reduce the usage of cars in the future .

The fuel which most of the cars in todays world use is the derivates of crude oil like petrol , diesel , gas etc. these are considered as the non-renewable sources of energy that they cannot be recycled .
Once consumed they are lost for ever .
Keeping in view the current demand of this fuel usage , and the shortage of resources of supply , the production of oil will reduce rapidly .
The price will be increased abnormally which does not fit the budget of most car owners .
hence they have to shift to other means of public transport such as railroads or buses .

The present soceity around us is slowly gaining the `` eco '' feel .
Issues like global warming and the greenhouse effect are increasing the public awareness and thereby less pollution free environment is in continous demand .
Hence people of the future will be forced to use eco friendly means of transport .

Technology Development is an unending process .
Every decade witnesses newer technological developments that benefit the people and society .
The usage of electricity and other eco friendly fuels in means of transport is slowly picking up .
May be advanced versions of the present day cars will come into use .
These new transporters may gain popularity as they comply with the above two reasons of non pollution and also oil and gas free .

Finally as the time advances many more changes can be witnessed which serves in reducing pollution as well as ensure better comfort and efficiency .
Who knows ?
the traditional `` car '' that has become a part and parcel of todays life may be owned by a few and may also decorate the platforms of a many museums !
