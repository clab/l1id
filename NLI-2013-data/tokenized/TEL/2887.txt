According to the specker `` young people areenjoy life more then older people do '' .
I agree the statement .
Becouse of that in the young age we can do any thing with enthuosioum and happly , at the age of peoples are working hard and dedication on the work impliment .

Each and everybody also come from young but the young people are haveing lot of goals , and those are impliment on through physically and mentally also .
Young peoples are very fast comparing then olders .
Young peoples are doing work hard and what those are working on perticular things they will concentrate on one perticular topic .
Those are knowing only how to reach the goals .

like age of group peoples18 to 35 years old peoples can doing lot of enjoying , and those are working time also enjoing each others .
In the perticular movements those will helping to each others .
For example the young peoples like teenegeras getting any job or those are acherve the goals time those can share happy movements with other peoples like friends or relatives and parents .
Atthat time those can went parties and any other special invitation parties like pubs those can totally enjoying with other and as well as possible opposite peoples like women and men .
These time only peoples are enjoying life , after old they can not do any thing .

Becouse of that , the teenage time means that 15 years to 35 years old peoples are having extra energy build in the human body 's .
Its a scientifically those are improving a extra activities .
In the age of above 45 years of the peoples are doing works normally .
They can not particullarly compare with the young peoples .
At the age of time body nature are not supporting to those activities .
Those musules are not supporting to the works .
They are working differnt fields and do more works in the young life .
At the oldage they can not do any thing .

In the young age those peoples are doing very well at any of the perticular fields .
Those can have do work help of the bady nature .
So its depends on the defferent body nature .
