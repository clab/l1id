Yes , i agree with the statement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
According to my knowledge many famous scientists , mathematicians etc had tried to invent new things even after they discovered one task .
A successful man doesnot sit idle after finishing his work he will try to invade new things which depends on his interest and he loves to take more and more risks inorder to acheive his goal .

Let us take an example of a school boy who is in the starting steps of his education .
He will try to improve his academic life by reaching higher studies one after the other , rather he dont like to sit in home and study his kindergarten repeatedly to become masters in that stage .
So in the same way if any human wants to become a successful in his life he should face the different risks and face the outside world to become a successful person .
A boy cannot become an graduate only in one day he has 2 face many consiquences an pass many milestones and had to face many risks in order to become an successfull graduate .
In the similar fashion the people who keepon trying or trying to invade new things become more successfull rather than the people who only do what they already know how to do well .
Let us consider an another example of a politician , any politician cannot become directly president of thier respective country unless they take new risks and face all different people .
The politician starts his career from the small post as an local area leader and then try to fight with the other politician in the assembly and try to win over him an becomes an minister .
So , it can be infered from the above example that the politician cannot become directly the minister unless he faces different risks and stand in elections and win .
Similarly this suites each and every human on the world that if any one want to be successful in his life then he should take as many risks as he can and keep doing them .
