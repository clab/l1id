People travel to different places , to enjoy their vacation or to acquire the knowledge and historical improtance of the place they are going ot visit or to spend time with friends and relatives or to take some time off from their daily routine work .
What ever the purpose of travelling , I think , I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

Travelling with a group and a tour guide makes the trip more enthusiastic than travelling alone or with a partner .
There are several advantages If we travel in a group .
For example , we will be more secured , get more knowledge about the place , interact with different people , share food , play games etc .

For example , If we travel to a different country , absolutely I like to travel in a group , Since it is a long trip and the other reason is that if we does n't know the language of that country , some person or the other in the group will be familiar with the language .
If we travel without a group then it is difficult to survive in the new place and enjoy the trip .
More over , a tour guide knows about that place and he will guide us .

I travelled to Ooty a place in India with my friend and relatives last summer .
Ooty is a hill station , with beautiful senic spots and vegetation .
The temperature is very cool .
Our tour guide suggested us what to bring withus in order to adjust with the cilmate .
It was a three day trip .
As soon as we reached the place , the guide gave a list of hotels which are reasonable in prize and are good to stay .
He took us to improtant places that are worth visiting and explained about them , he also cleared the doubts of some co-travellers .
During night we put the fire and enjoyed eating food in groups .
Childern in one group and elders in another group .
We divided the groups according to ages and had lot of fun .
Those are the most memorable moments for me .
I interacted with lots of friends , even today we discuss about the tour .

Based on my own experiences , I think , one can enjoy a lot , if he/she travel 's in a group with a tour guide rather than travelling without a group .
