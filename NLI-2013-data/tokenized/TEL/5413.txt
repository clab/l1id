I agree with the statement that `` Most advertisements make products seem better than they really are '' .
Most companies advertise products produced using an old technology , cheaper in quality , and selling an old product with a new advertisement .

First , most companies that market new products using an old technology make a very few changes , changes that are irrelevant to the final product , and advertise it as an all together new product .
For example , in the past few years with the buzz around nanotechnology , a lot of companies have been advertising products which are supposed to be using nanotechnology .
The truth is there are very few products that use nanotechnology in the product devlopement in the market .
These companies are trying to cheat customers by using the buzz words , but not actually making an relevant changes in the technology used for making the products .

Second , a lot of companies spend huge amounts of money in designing fancy advertisments and producing products of cheaper quality .
The money that they spend for these costly advertisements could be used for improving the quality of the product .
So , the money is not being channelised in the right direction .
These advertisers are big cheats by selling cheaper quality products with better advertisments .

Third , we must have seen a lot of toothbrush advertisments over years .
These companies really donot make any changes in the functionality of the old product .
All that they do is design a new fancy shape or name and sell it at a higher rate , including the advertisment costs in the price of the product .
So , the customers are being cheated by seeing these advertisments and buying old products with no new functionality .

Finally , I believe there should be stringent set of rules that prevent companies advertising just to improve their market capitalization .
There should be rules which state that no company can advertise a new product unless they have made a certain number of new changes in their products .
If they plan to advertise an old product , they should put a statuary notice saying that this is an old product with a new advertisement .
I would definetly agree that advertisers make products seem much better than they are .
