I agree with the statement : The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

Firstly i agree with it because a tour guide is a one who knows exactly the in and out of the tour plan and where , when and how to go , it is this tour guide who helps us get aware of all the minute nuiances which are part of the tour and not be missed out , the important point being he is a professional trained in that arena than a person who is venturing out himself .

Secondly i have a reason to support it as when i visited golconda fort which is in India , i ventured on my own into the fort without having a clue of how to and where to start off couldnt get to know many of the fort corners where to get out and the history and culture of the place , i was even conned by few people there .
next time i went with a tour guide and it was fabulous i knew the dynasity the culture and living of people and every detail of the emperor , how they lived and the way they ruled the kingdom , minute to minute detail was covered , which made the trip very fulfilling and informative .

thirdly a group could be managed effectively by a tour guide as one person would want to go to right other to left few of them wanna sit and relax , a tour guide would comprehend all the requirements of the group and could suggest effectively what needs to be done and he is the one who could be reliable for every piece of information .

lastly we travel with an ulterior motive to know the place and to enjoy in a group within the time frame .
so if we try to venture on our own we could consume a lot of time and the possibility that the information about the place you gain would be much more less compared to the the group who move around with a guide .
