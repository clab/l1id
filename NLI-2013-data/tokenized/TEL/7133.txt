No , I will not agree with this statement that , `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Because , if we observefrom last twenty years the cars usage has been increased rapidly .
Why it has been increased iwill explain in the below paragraph .

If a person who is working as an software engineer he ca n't wait at bus-stops for buses and railway-stations for trains .
Because he has to spend much more time on that .
So if he has a car he can save much more time .
This is the main reason for increse of cars .

The usage of cars leads to more advantages than disadvantages .
While the `` call centers '' people have to travel from home to office at late mid nights .
So if a car is there it will be well safe than a bike or any other vehicle .

In the coming years also the usage of cars will double or may be triple the times what we have now .
Because this is the fast moving world .
To lead a better life in this fast moving world a good car is needed to move whereever we want to go .

We all know that if the usage of cars have been increased it seems that their country or state is developing .
I say that car users will increase in countries where there are few cars now .
But the growth will decrese in some developed countries like NewYork , London , Australia etc ...
There they will use chartad flights which are now very fewer there .

The advantages while using cars are that we save much more time while by spending for trains and buses .
We can save tht time and spend that with family , friends or in the office .
It leads to lot of convinience by using car .

I will conclude that by the above reasons the car users will increase by the next twenty years in this fast moving world .
