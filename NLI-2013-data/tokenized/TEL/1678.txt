I agree with the statemnt that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Having broad knowledge in one subject confines you only to one field of study .
Not only that but it also confines your mind to not think about anything else except thatsuject .
The other disadvantage is that having in depth knowledge in one subject also confines your future job oppurtunities because of lack of knowledge in other fields .
So it is always beneficial to have knowledge of many academic subjects .
By having knowlege in all sujects the individual is more accomplished to solve any problem in any field .
It also increases the fleibility of the person .
His futue will also be very bright as he will have sound knowledge in all the subjects Though acquiring knowledge is tough and also a time taking process it is definitly worth the hard work as u are presnted with fruitful rewards .
For example jon and smith work in the same office jon has knowlege about all the subjects where as smith only specialized in technical details of the company .
When a prolem arises in the technical department .
Both of them can solve the problem easily .
But when a problem arises in the managemet department only jon can solve the problem .
So jon can solve both the management and the technical problem .
Where as jon can solve only the technical problem .
So jon is more flexible in his work than smith is and has a definite edje over smith Not only this having knowledge in different subjects also increases the efficiency of a human being .
He can definitely do more work if he has sound knowledge in different fields .
So i conclude that it is always better to have broad knowledge of many subjects rather than specializing ione specific subject .
