It is important for the students to to learn facts than understanding ideas and concepts As the students are supposed to observe , study , interpret , analyze and understand the things .
In their day to day life they are exposed to many situations in which they should understand the situation and work on that .
Suppose if a student is facing a problem , he or she should first understand the situation and then work on the problem to come out of that .
Just by sitting in the class mugging up the theories and concepts is not worthworthy .
They should develop a practical approach for life .
We should develop the ability to solve the things we can use the ideas or concepts we know but not to the complete extent .

We should develop our own skills , improve our analyzing abilities and capabilities in every step of our life .
By learning facts they will be prepared to face every hurdle and they will become confident .

Just by learning concepts and without any practical knowledge they cannot live outside .
For example take a computer student , who knows the concept of any of her major but not aware of any problem which she is going to face in her job that is she is not aware of the facts ( i .
e ) the hurdles in her job she will be confused and she may lose confidence .
She may not be ready to face the problem because she never knew that there are such facts in life which she or he should move off and achieve success .
But by knowing only the facts they may not work out the problems , they should have the idea what to do and should understand the idea behind it and then should apply the concept to get success .
They will never depend on others and get cheated by them as they are well aware of the facts .

They will grow mentally strong and develop good analyzing skills .
Practical exposure to the facts makes them strong and confident .
However exposure to facts and knowing them is important in life .
