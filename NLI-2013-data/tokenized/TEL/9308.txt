students will learn more by practical experiences .
the studen will be able to do well only if he had understanded the concepts and ideas of any one rather knowing the facts of it .
i agree with the statement .

if the student is able to understand the concept and ideas well then he could be able to analyze the mater well .
then he could be able to do the every work , assignments assigned to him .

if the students understand the ideas and concepts then he is going to follow them and also trys to implement them in all the possidle ways , which could be a good consideration from his point .

if the student only know the fact and he had not understand the concept of it then there is a possiblity that he is going to implement it in a way that is understand by him , which could makes the students overall decrement todays students are able to make up the coming society a good one only if they are able to understand the ideas and concepts for making good society instead of knowing the facts of good societys which are of no use at all .

it is the duty of the parents in the home to develop the students attitude to understand the ideas and concepts of their culture and tradition well , without stating the facts , the rules of their culture and it is their responsibility to check that his son or daughter is able to understand their culture are they are able to implement them correct are not .
similar works to be done by the teacher also he or she should be able to make the student know their duties well and the behavoiur to maintain in class instead of stating them .

student will be able to give every thing of his efforts , energy so on only if the student is able to understand the ideas and concepts that are to be followed by him well .
like analyzing a cocept are thinking of any mat
