in my view i say that young people enjoy life more than old people do because the young people being at the age of teenage will have have a spicy life which is more colorful and interesting , whre as the life of old will be bored .

for example if we take a human life he or she will be more active and happy at the age of teenage , because that time body will be in a position to react to every response occuring .
at younger age the responsibilities are not known to him like the value of money , thinking the future of his children , having greed on many items , this all situations make the him unhappy and bore his life .
at the younger age we dont have any desires like this just seek the desire of enjoyment .

at younger age there are also problems but compared to older they are less , younger age problems are minor related to his surrounding in schools and colleges .
younger age people are free from mental tensions and they are free birds .
older people give all their responsibilities to the younger one after he becoming a family person , so then the younger one feels happy and interesting in solving all the responsibilities given .
the older wont give up their feelings if younger get suffered due to some reason , they also take the parallely the responsibility of the younger .
but at the same time if the older get a problem the younger may not take that much serious .
in general , older people has much love and effection on the younger but reverse it is not true .

so older people take all the responsibilities of the younger and give happines to them , so i conclude that younger people enyoy a lot in their life then older people .
and the younger has more colorful life than the older .
