I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people .
Young people look at the world in different way when compared to older people .
Young people have the opportunity to mould their life in the way they want .
I feel that young people are persistent and are more confident .

Young people look the world as a sphere containing numerous opportunities .
They have the tendency to prepare for the future and reach their goals through hard work .
Young people are more energitic unlike older people .
This helps young in fulfilling their goals .
For instance , a boy at seventeen can aspire to become a pilot and even accomplish it through his hardwork and energy .
This may be difficult for older people because the resposne to react to any kind of situation like moving the accelerator hard reduces with the passage of time .

Moreover , young people are more persistant .
They think that they should respect their elders and should not hurt their feelings in any kind .
On the other hand , older people need not respect their younger ones and have the rigth to behave as they wish .
Every young person enjoy being persistant .

People at an young stage can plan well for their future because they have lot of life and time infront of them .
Every person at this stage considers this as a big opportunity and will make their life happier by choosing the carrer they wish ti persue .

Another reason is that young people can appear attractive by keeping up with the fashion .
They can wear any kind of outfit they want .
In conclusion , young people are more energitic , fashionable and persistant .
Apart from all these the attention that young people get in the public is one main reason that young people enjoy more .
