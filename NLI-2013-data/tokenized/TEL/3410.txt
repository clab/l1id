In the fast growing society young people are not giving enough time to help thier communty .
I strongly agree to the above statement .

Now a days youngsters are not at all helping there fellow members if they are in help .
If any accident occur on the road no one will bother about that because they are fear if they help and take to hospital it will come to his hands .
If u do like this if come to you it will be the same .
So we should be helpful to the community when ever we need .

As the world growing faster the helping nature is going down .
people are eager to earn money they do not want to help fellow people when they are in need .
I recomend to young people to help people those who in trouble and dont let them tell thanks and ask them to help atleast three people those who are in need and say the thing what i told above .
So that it will be like a chain and one or other day they will be cant see problem people .

By this process we can sevre people those who are really need .
And by doing this it will help our nation be proud and the fellow nation will see us and learn .
And main thing is that now a days young people are seeing that family is nice or not that 's it .
But it is your responsibility to see your fellow community is having problem or not .

I conclude that we the youngster should spend time for people those who really need help .
So that it will be helpful for the nation and it also helps our prosperity .
