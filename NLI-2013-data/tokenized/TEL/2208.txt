I partially agree and dis agree with the authors statement .
firstly the point why i agree is ?
any human being passes through the all the faces of life as his counter parts .
we all know we categorise in to five parts infancy , childhood , teenage , youth and finally old age .

the point i agree and why i agree , no one can deny this point that youth are the face of a nation , why this is said by any one , because as they believe it that youth are more energetic and it is their age a big asset not only to him but also to his nation or state or community he belongs .
for example we can see young people ready go to any country if it is helping in building their career the more they work hard the better they enjoy their life .
another example is we can young people working in different shifts in their work , because their body can permit it i.e the amount of hard work they can put more in young age more over we can see youth participating in the events of his choice like a young person can dare to climd mount everest where as a person who is some 70 or 80 year old cannot do that .

coming to the point that which i dis agree with the author is , how can any one judge the happiness of person by his age .
for example a person who is 30 year old might be suffering from diabetis where as his neighbour who is 80 year old is very healthy with out even a trace of ill health .
what i belive is god has given us a very good opportunity for every one on this planet to go through the same faces of life as others , an infant is definetely going to grow to child , a child to teen to youth to old age .
it is health and attitude which is going to effect our being living with happiness or not .
ofcourse age has a considerable role to play , some times remembering our past memories can be very joyfull .
this is what i observe with some of my grand parents .
