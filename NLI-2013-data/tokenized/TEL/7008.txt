When we look into the present scenario in my country , India , one will find more number of bikes than cars .
This is the case because people here are not inclined towards the luxurious goods , like car .
They are more intrested in possessing those goods which are required to live a normal life .
But as the rate at which the development is taking place in the country , one can expect this to change .

Firstly , when we look into the technological growth taking place aroung the world , one will understand that the humans are not satisfied with what they have .
Each and evry time they come out with a new idea to make human life more simpler .
This is leading us to an age when a luxurious good in present day will be an daily necessity .
People are very lasy to work hard to travel from one place to other .
So they came out with the idea of bikes instead of bicycles .
Then came the four wheeler car .
It had all the features of an bike and it also provided comfort .
But the cost and maintainance of it didnt encourage many to look forward for it .

Nowadays , we have got the technology which can be used to manufacture cars at a cheaper cost and which can be maintained with no extra care .
In future , there will be cars which guarantee more comfort , speed , luxury and efficient fuel consumption .
We can even look forward for models which run with a battry or solar energy , which are renewable sources of energy , than going for petroleum fuels which are on the verge of extinction .
This will encourage more number of people to buy cars .

When we look it from an individual point of view , the economic growth of the country is growing at a faster rate .
People are becoming wealthier and are looking forward for comforts .
As in India , an normal family has four people and when ever they want to travel as a group they have to consider some outside means .
But as the present day Indian can afford to buy a car with his earnings , without a second thought he is going for it .
The present population and the sales of the cars in the country tells the rate at which the the number of cars on the road is increasing .

So , twenty years down the line , we can look forward for an India , when more half of the Indians possess a car .
CAR , WHICH IS A LUXURIOUS PROPERTY NOWADAYS WILL BE A DAILY NECESSITY AT THAT TIME .
