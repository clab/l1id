It is evident from histories and successful people lives that doing something new and taking risks has always resulted in sucess .
One should believe that doing an ordinary thing is not appreciated .
Every one considers it as a job or part of a job .
Only extraordinary things which raises others eyebrows are appreciated and rewarded .
This happens only if someone tries to do something new or something different .
This definately is achieved by taking a risk .

Inventions like television , communication system like telephone are the results of sucessful people .
If they have done their normal routine jobs they might not have invented all these .
They have taken risks and tried to do something new .
Thats the reason they are suceessful .
We can quote research scholars and people working on new topics as an example .
They are doing something new by taking risks .
Due to their efforts we are seeing many advanced and surprising products , inventions , drugs etc .
If we compare us with our granfathers lot has changed .
They used to move from place to place by means of animals whereas we are travelling in air , by road , trains and on water .
Our grandfathers havent dreamt of all these .
All these are the inventions of successful people .
They acheved by trying something new and taking risks .

People do their routine jobs .
They may succeed by doing the job with perfection which is considered as a job or a part of the job .
What are they succeeding ? .
If someone does the same job or same step in less time or with increased productivity than there is success in it .
The success can be achieved only if he tries to do in a different way .
Doing a routine job in a different way alwasys involves risk .

Hence I strongly agree with the opinion that successful peple try new things involving risks rather than only doing what they know how to do with perfection .
