I disagree with this statement as we can see the incerease in traffic day to day .
If we see the graph drawn between number of vechiles on the road year wise , we can see the increase rapidly .
This shows how the people are using the vechiles .
Nowadays we can see every family owns a car and it has become a must-have thing .
Most of the people use their cars to go to the offices or work place , and you can use your own car to travel to different places instead of hiring a cab .
The cost of cars have come down in recent years making it easy for common people to buy them and most banks and financial institutes provide different schemes to purchase a car .
Through these schemes most of the middle class families buy a car for their personal use .
If you own a car , you need not worry in a emergency situations like calling the ambulance for sudden health problems of family members .
The other reason is if a family is planing to go on a vacation to a different state , they can use their own vechile instead of hiring a cab .
They can move around the city and go to any place they wish to .
If they have their own vechile they wo n't be any problem for a late night party .
They wo n't have any problem look for a cab in the late night to get back home .
And as resale markets have come up , people sell their old cars for a new one .
I strongly belive that in the next 20 years , there would be double the amount of cars you find right now on the road .
Every common person use the car for all his activites like goign to the park in the morning , goign to his office or work place , and goign to a late night party , and going out for shopping of household things etc .
So i disagree with the statemen that they would be fewer cars in the next twenty years .
