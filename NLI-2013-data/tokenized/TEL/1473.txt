Over years of experince in human history there is a clear evidence that there is always a good reputation or a need for people who specialise in a particular field or subject of study .
And there is always a need of specialists .

There is always a need for specialists in society rather than people who have no deep knowledge of a particular field .

Here it can be clearly seen that a Doctor who has knowledge of all the areas of medicine cannot treat the patient who has serious problems with his heart So , ther is an obvious need of a specialist .

And in the past you can take examples of scientists such as madam Curie Sir C V Raman and so on So , there is an obvious need of specialists and it is better to
