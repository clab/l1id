I strongly agree that `` young people enjoy life more than than older people do '' for whole lot of reasons .
First of all people at young age are not bothered about any responsibilities .
They are free birds and they like to enjoy their life to fullest .
For example right now I an doing my graduation and I am not at all bothered about anything , I enjoy a lot with my friends , go for parties , have get togethers , we watch lot of movies .

I never think about future , I like to take the life as it comes .
Whereas when I see my parents they are lot more concerned about different issues in life , like they are bothered about their life after retirement , or the burden of their kids .

The next thing is people at young age try to be adventerous , innovative in their thoughts and ideas .
They try out some thing or the other to keep their life intresting .
They expect some kind of thrill in their life .
Whereas the elder people doesnot want to try out new things and they prefer to spend a stable and peaceful life .

People at young age are very healthy compared to the elder people .
They are with full vigor .
The health problems of elderly may keep them away from enjoying the life to the fullest .
Like for example most of the elderly people may have problems with blood pressure or may have cardiac problems or may have arthritis or any kind of problem .
So these people generally tend to keep their life in subtle way and try to avoid all the noises or try to live in peace and serenity .

Finally the elder people may not be knowing the latest innovations because of which they may be deprived of enjoyment .
Like for example my grandparents doesnot know how to use the computers and they are not intrested to know .
So the enjoyment which I get while browsing the internet and knowing whole lot of things , which made my life easier can be defenitely compared to what my grandparents are missing .
So for all these reasons I strongly believe that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .
