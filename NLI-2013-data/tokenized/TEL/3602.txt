I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time for community service and i do not attribute some change in the youngsters character that has brought this undesirable contribution towards their society .

My parents give numerous examples regarding their participation in the betterment of the community and i always feel that iam unable to do as much as they did .
Not only me , all the youngsters of present age are unable to allocate sufficient amount of time for their community .
This may be because of many reasons .
Firstly , because the present day life is like a race .
The competition has been increasing day by day and only the strongest and efficient can survive .
In this race the youngsters are not finding enough time to serve the society .

Secondly , the modern day student has a lot of things to do ; he has a lot to learn within the time .
He has to take care of not only his academics but also exta curricular activities .
This makes clear that he has less time for other things .
For example i had to attend the computer class and also music class which were compulsory for all in our school .
Moreover the concepts what my parents learned in their times , iam learning them at an early age .
So the complexity has increased and requires more time to understand .

We do community service in the short time we are having .
We celebrated all of our friends ' birthdays in the final year of my undergraduate school in an oldage home where we could help them to some extent .

So i think it is logical to say that the present generation yougsters are contributing less time to serve the society than the earlier generation .
It is not because we are not willng to do do but we are forced to some other things .
