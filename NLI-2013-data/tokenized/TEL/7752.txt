I completely agree with the statement of ` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' for several reasons .
The first and foremost one would be the safety and comfort offered by your companiens in group , especially when traveling to new places farwaway from home town .
In case of any unexpected emergencies or untoward events happening on travel , you have a gropu to take care of your needs and shre the burden and sterss .

Secondly , the guided tours would provide right information about theplaces and one can get more precise information about the place visited for the first time .
Also , a guided tour in a gropu is more economical over personal tour with or without a guide .
The guides are trained to perform the tours on a timely manner while explainig the fact in detail .
When you are in a group , you would spend less money on travel , accomodation , and money spent on engaging a travel guide .
Tough it may not be possibl to spend their time as one wishes , while travelling , it provides the opportunity to ineract with other people in group and know more about the places than it would be other wise .

I provide a typical example , to justify my opinion .
It is about my travel in India last year .
I have to spend about $ 150 to go to a historic place all by myself in a taxi , while it costs only a fraction of that , i.e $ 5 if I choose to travel by public transport that was available .
I choose to go by taxi as I was alone and afraid of travelling in publice transport system along with the many locals , for fear of isolation as I do n't under stanfdthe la Thus in conclusion , a guide tour in groups is , safe , economical and time saving .
