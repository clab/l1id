`` I know not how the third world war is going to be , but I know that fourth world war is going to be with stones and sticks '' , this is a famous quote by Sir Albert Einstein .
TODAY is world of rapid technological and industrial advancement , the day is not far when there is a saturation of sources eventually leading to retrogradation of the society .
I would absolutely agree that in the next twenty years ther would be fewer cars than they were today .

I remember reading the poems of William Wordsworth , beautifully describing the countryside and mother nature .
In today 's world it is indeed impossible to find such a place in real .
Right from the inception man is driven by a quest for knowledge .
There is an urge or a curiosity to know and to find out things around him .
This has definitely led to the industrial revolution .
One of the biggest achievements has been the invention of the automobiles .
With the development of cars and other means of trasnport the world had definitely become a smaller place .
conveyeance was made easier and effective .
But one important aspect to this revolution is the traffic congestion it has created .
I would like to state an example , I live in a big city and it takes me one hour to reach my college which is just 8 kilometers away from my house .
I will have plan out things before hand incase i wish to go to a place somewhere far as it literally takes me years to reach my destination .

There has been a significant rise in the awareness about the pollution caused by automobiles .
This pollution not only effects the environment but also to living beings .
The number of cases of asthma and other lung diseases have risen due to the ever increasing traffic and pollution liberated by vehicles .
There are cases of early retardation of child development due to the inhalation of harmful lead components released by the vehicles .

In earlier days , cars were a status issue .
People who were wealthy only could afford a car .
It is no longer so .
Although people are able to buy cars but the maintainance of cars is a difficult task in todays 's wrold .
It is said that buying a car is easier than maintaining it .

Today there is an increasing urge to GO GREEN by reducing the individual contribution to go green .
People are reverting to the use of cycles and bikes which use plants as fuel .
People are becoming more health consious and hence perfer to walk or jog it up to their destinations .

Hence I would like to conclude that although there is a continuous rise in the number of cars , after a span of twenty years the number of cars will reduce due to increasing awareness among people .
