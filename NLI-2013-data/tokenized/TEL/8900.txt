I agree with the statement that , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is them to learn facts .
For example , in science lab it is more important to understand ideas and concepts so that there after we can learn that facts to do the experiments with the concepts that we understand .

In any field , the above sentence matches .
Suppose in games like CRICKET we must first undersdtand the ideas and concepts in the game including foot work , line and length , only after understanding thoroughly the concepts of CRICKET we can learn facts i.e. we can practice .
And also in the field of Engineering , it is more important that the student understand the concept first and than to apply the concept he learned to learn facts about the experiment .

In the field of DESIGN also we have to first understand the concepts behind that design and ideas behind that design and there after we can design a particular object .
For example , take the design of a car .
First the designer will understand the specifications and concepts behind the design af the car and there after he put on the ideas how to design a new car .

so , for most of the areas it is important that we have to understand the ideas and then to learn facts .
Without learning ideas and details we cannot know the facts about the product or a system .
so , it is important for us to understand ideas and concepts to learn facts .
For example , if a new theory is proposed by a scientist , it is more important for us to understand the idea behind that principle and concept of the principle and thereafter we canable to learn facts about that principle .

All above examples will give information that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts , so by using the ideas and concepts we have learnt will help to understand to learn facts about a particular thing or an experiment .
