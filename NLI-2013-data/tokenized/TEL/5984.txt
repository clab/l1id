Yes .
I agree that in the near future the number of cars that are in use will be lesser than that of today 's car count .

The first reason for my agreement with the statement is that the world 's economy is growing at a faster rate and technological innovations are immanent within the system .
This might result in an efficient , cost-effective , superfast railway network which connencts an urban area like a labyrinth .
The main emphasis is given to urban ares in the previous statement because they are the ones that have more number of cars than the rural areas usually do .
The state-of-art technology might drive the communers to use the railways as an alternative to using cars .
This might lead to less number of cars in next twenty years .

There is a general concern over environmental pollution especially on air pollution .
The main contributor to this air pollution is the smoke produced from the exhaust of the car engines .
The awareness toward this pollution might reach all the citizens of the urban areas and make them realize the importance to reduce the pollution .
As a result they might seek alterantive means of transport apart from cars .

Consequently this awareness might urge the citizens not to use cars in the near future .

One of the major concerns in the modern society is the cost of the petroleum or gas .
It is so high that people are hesitating to use cars even now .
As the natural resources of the earth are limited and the use of oil consumption has been very high despite its cost , the situation in twenty years could be marked by lack of enough oil for transporation .
Obvioulsy this would inhibit people from using the cars if there are no other alternative fuels for cars .

In twenty years an exotic , efficient and impressive machine might be invented .
As humanbeings , who always want to try out something new , would feel prestigious if they were possessed with that exotic , impressive machine .
Again this might lead to decrease in number of cars in twenty years .
