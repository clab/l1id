Well , this is an interstiong topic to be written about .
Coming to the point of knowledge , it means that mastering a field of work at study .
And this is divided into many branches like different subjects we take .
Many people try to take a few subjects or a single subject alone for their study .
This also counts for the field out of education system .
This could be for the reason that they are interested in it and like to work on it .
And moreover , people who are job minded , would work inyensively on their subject of choice to master it and a good job based on it , leaving the other subjects unexplored !

According to me , the involvement of a person in a particular type of job is totally need based .
But I would prefer to work on all the areas ad gain knowledge of everything around me , then concentrate on what I need to .
This could be a pretty way to do our job .
You will have the minimum kowledge of everything .
This ought to be followed because , you cannot keep quite when group of your friends is discussing about a particular topic .
You need not be familiar with it so that you can atleast join the discussion .
Or else it would look odd if you dont join the talk .
Afterall our skills are guessed by rthe work we put up .
And we can also advice some person in a familiar topic we know .

For example , lets take a person who is very well aware of a subject in which he is interested , but is unaware of many other things .
And take person who does knows about all the things he is interested , and also the other things .
For instance let us assume an interview conducted for each person .
And in todays world , a person who knows his subject of interest and the other things also , is only accepted .
That would keep him as an allrounder .
Though the other person is a master in his subject of interest , that alone would not help him .

Lastly I conclude that , `` A sight towards the alrounder is always different from that towards a fish in a pond , which , though knows everything about the pond but never knows anything about thje world around it . ''
