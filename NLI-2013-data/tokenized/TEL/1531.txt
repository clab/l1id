Multidisciplinary knowledge always helpful in professional and academic world .
But , this is not always helpful in all the cases specifically in academics .
Specialization in a specific subject is very important in the context of science and technology , where the research is a major point of interest .
Without the specialization it is not possible to built the technological society , in which we are living now and which has been built by efforts of many scietists .
Hence , I disagree with statement which is focusing on broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

If we consider the broad knowledge in many subjects then the student will not be informed completely about any subject .
So , he had very brief knowledge in all the subjects and he will become a generalists in the context of academics .
Specialization in an specific subject will mould the student as a perfectionist in the subject of his interest .
These perfectionists inturn can help the society in their related field .
A science and technology perfectionist can do research and invent new things , which are ultimately intend tp help the society .
Without the specialists or the perfectionists we would not have developed the transportation vehicles such as trucks , cars etc. , communication systems on which we are depended a lot in our daily life in the present world , and the medicines or drugs which are quiet helpful in alleviating the suffereing .
But , only one specialist cannot produced a newthing , he takes help from many other specialists form other related fields so that he make a product in efficient manner .

There are many universities in the which are offering undergraduate honors degrees , which comprises of many academic subjects to give an basic knowledge of different subjects with a major focus on a specific degree , which has been taken by the student .
But , incase of graduate studies , the universities mainly offer specialization programs .
The undergraduate program create an interest of subject in the mind of student so that he choose between a pool of graduate courses by showing the projects in the field of interest he had completed in undergraduate .
So , ultinately the specialization is matters a lot to settle down in a competitive world .

Specialization plays very major role and it is highly respected in the professional world .
For example , if software company got a problem with their server , then they have to call up the service who can able to solve the problem .
Eventhough the functions and working of server are well known by the software engineers , who are employed by the company , they are not the persons to handle and solve the problem .
So , specialist the service engineer here can solve the problem .

To sum I will not agree with the statement and I always support the specialists , who are quiet helpful to the socie
