I have to disagree with the statement because of the numerous points that could be immediately come up with that contradice it .
It is also prudent to consider the point which might disprove my stand , but it also will be falsified in the last paragraph .

The first reason for more cars in twenty years is that the fuel that is necessary to run cars i.e. gasoline , is not going to run out any time soon .
A common misconception is that the world 's fuel supplies will dry up in fifty years to come .
Actually , there are huge deposits of oil in developing and under developed countries which are unexploited .
There are also huge reserve deposits in developed countries , like the reserves in Siberia and Arctic Sea regions of Russia .
With gasoline , the most convenient mode of transportation for people , atleast right now and probably for atleast twenty years to come , would be cars .

Secondly , the developing countries generally consider developed nations as role models in community , economic and industrial development .
This , combined with the fact that most of the people in developed countries would want to drive their own cars , proves that the number of cars in developing countries would definitely increase .

Nowadays cars are introduced in a wide spectrum of models which appeals to all .
Apart from this , the technology and instruments to make cars are gtting cheaper which makes cars available to everyone .
This can be supported by the fact that Tata Motors is on the verge of introduction of a car for just one lakh rupees in India .
This would enable more people to buy cars .

Car sports like rallies and the world famous Formula One make cars even more popular .
Not that anyone is going to buy a Formula one for city use , but the craze is enough for some people to convince themselves to buy some of the meanest machines available .
The famous computer game `` Need for Speed '' is one example of media popularising cars .
In the game , cars are available in the weirdest designs and can be customised .
These ideas promote people to buy cars .

The only reason which might contradict the theme of this passage is fuel costs .
Yes , they are going high .
Despite this , figures suggest that car numbers are increasin in the world .
