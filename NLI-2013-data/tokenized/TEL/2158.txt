` Enjoy the yoke in thy youth ... '
.
I do agree with the statement ' Young people enjoy life more that older people do ' , as the young are filled with energy , zeal to explore life and find ways to have fun and live life to its full extent .
Life is all about living every second that passes by rather than worrying as to what would happen in the very next second that is yet to arrive .

Older people on the other hand carry a lot of responsibilities on their shoulder , that always tend to worry them every minute , thinking of what best they could do now , to make their future secure and this keeps them away from enjoying life .
However by proper planning and spending time in understanding self can lead to a life that is worth living .

Young people are always at the verge of making important decisions that can influence their life .
All the experiences they had in their school and college life , living every moment and having fun , would teach them to grow and be a part of the society in future and pass on their legacy to the younger generation .
