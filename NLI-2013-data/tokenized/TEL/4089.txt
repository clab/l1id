Now a days young people are noy give enough time to helping thir communities .
I agree with this statement .
becoze people are now living in high compitation world .
Thats why there is no time to give any help to thir communicates .

In this compitation world every young people try to get a possition in a society .
And is trying to reach teir goals .
For exampe in the case of education many people tried to provee what he is .
In this way they are trying maximam of 18-20 hours they have concentrated on their educaton .
In this time they do not think about their communities .
And in another way is they are increced thir selfishness along with growing compition world .
I meean that it is not good behaviour but we must do this and continue due to we are live in compitation world .

Souppose he interested on communities he will loose one step towards his goal .
I mean that every people is do not trying to proove them self due to their own problems .
For example the persons who roming on the road side are having no work but they do not try to do help the their communities .
Becoze of their lifes are omited towards the acheeverside .

I agree that the young people only are busy that they view on their side .
But it is very wrong thing that we are neglecting increcing of our Soceity towards growth .
It is very wrong thing that what the youth doing their own works .
But it is the only way to give up that person in the soceity .

Finally i agree that the above mention examples are shows that my oppenian on our comment .
