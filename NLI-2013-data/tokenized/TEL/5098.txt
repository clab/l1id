Introduction : Advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I believe that advertisements make products much better .
Advertisements plays a vital role in developing businesses .
It is a part of business .
Now a days if we start watching tv we will watch more advertisements than what we are watching .
It shows the the product much better than the reality then the consumer will get tempted they will buy immediatly .
Advertisements are every ware .
Suppose one company wants to sell babby products like toys , food , cloths they release the product by advertising .
That advertisement shows that how much the product is usefull ?
what are the results of the product .
Obviously they will shoe good results .
They will target on the consumer needs .
The product will sold .
It often happens every eare not only the babby products .

Now a days people wants do buy new product they will go and watch advertisement for few days than only they will buy .
It shows the popularity of the product .
If the advertisement comes very often on one project people thinks that is good one .
For example resturants wants to reduce prizes to gain the popularity they go and give advertisement on tv like they will show good pictures of food or they will create a little documentry .
people get tempted and go to the resturants .
Media uses advertisement often to gain their popularity on thier tv channals .
sopeople watch their channals .
some times advertisement is very usefull like we can give advertisement on tv if any one is missingIt is usefull in finding the products popularity also .
Now adays every one is using advertisements not in selling products or ganing popularityof channals .
We often seen in elections also political parties use advertisements to gain popularity of their parties .
These are the reasons i strongly agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
