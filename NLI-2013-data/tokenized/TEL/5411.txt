I strongly disagree with the statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
Advertising is the media of mass communication where a large number of people can get to know about a product sitting right at their home .
With out advertising how many people will know about a product and how they will be able to judge with out using or knowing about a product .
Advertisements always show the reality of the product .
All the advantages and disadvantages will be shown in the advertisement leaving the viewer to think about the product and it will be the viewres choice finally to get a product or not .

Through advertisements , we will know the latest technologies being developed and the use of these products which may inturn make the life of humans more easier in this complex world .
It may be in any feild , it can be in medical field or can be about kitchen gadgets or about latest automobiles .
These all inturn will improve the quality of human life .

When we look in to the advertisements made about medicines , through these advertisements we will know about the latest drugs that has been introduced which can cure many diseases .
But at the same time the advertisement mentions about the uses , the side effects of a particular drug and at the same time it tells to consult your doctor before using that drug .
Here advertisements are only educating the people about diferrent products .

In case of latest kitchen gadgets , which we may not have known with out the advertisements .
These latest kitchen gadgets have made life more easier with faster cooking and cleaning which in previous years it used to take hours long .
The advertisements shown on the latest cars will definently give us an oppurtunity to buy which is best for us .
Always we can compare with the other models and can buy ourselves the best .

Finally advertisements will give us a better presentation of products , gives us better choice when we are purchasing anything , we can always compare with other products and make a better choice .
This inturn improves the quality of human life and makes this world a better place to live .

In conclusion , advertisements make the products seem as they are and in real giving more choice to the humankind what they need and how their life can be made easier with different products .
