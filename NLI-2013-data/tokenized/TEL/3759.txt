In today 's world young people are trying to make their career as soon as possible in order to get settlement in their life .
And to achive this task they are working hard to earn good sum .
so now a days young people are so busy that they have no time to help communities .

Young people are really not worried about the community they are living in , all they are worried about their work .
Its because of the stress they are put in to studies to work hard .
To justify this particular point one of the best example is , in today 's world parents are more worried about thier childern future so they are placing their children in those schools which give them education for almost 10-12hrs per day , if that is the case then what would the child position working for so long hours and getting tired for rest of the day .
then how will he be able to help communities infact in some cases he cant help himself also .

Now a days education is so much stressed that young people have no time to look upon communities , atleast those young people even dont know that communites are in search of help .
Even in collages now a days they are given lost of home work to do that these young people are not in a position to do other activities .

I dont say that every young man is of this kind but there are some people who are really helping the communities for example in some college they go for camps to some remote area and draw their problems and they try to sort of their problems by providing some funds to them .
but there are some young people who thinks all these are of no use to them .

So , as this the case about the young people nowadays , its once parents and teachers duty to let their young children know about the communites and let them also know about the goods and bads , and also give them time to think about other things apart from education .
If this is done then iam sure there will be lots of change in the communites because some day the same young man may need help .
