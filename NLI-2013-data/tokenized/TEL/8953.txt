From my point of view it is more important for the student to learn the facts and then start learning the ideas and the concepts .
student must know the facts before he learns the ideas and concepts .
because without the facts he cant easily understand concept and he cant even memorize the ideas which he would have been learnt .
so the facts are very important before we learn annything .
the basic concepts will be learned from the facts and the ideas can be easily learnt .
for example if we want to learn about gravitational laws we would first think about the newtonslaw .
but the fact is that he founde out the gravitational pull by the apple falling from the tree on to his head ..
And thus by this we can easily understand the idea and the concept .
These facts will be easily leraned by the students and they can reproduce them very effectively .
they wont even forget the idea and the concept with taht fact .
thus by these facts we can easily learn the topic very easily and effectively .

Another example for undesrtanding the idea and the concept is that if we want to know how light was evolved there are many theories and the major fact is that light was discovered by thomas edision after his 99th failure thus by this we can easily capture our mind related to the facts so that which can be easily stayed in our mind .

thus i strongly disaagree the above point it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
so students must be first learn the facts relating to what they are studying .
these facts are easily available and thus they should learn them first and they must keeep them in mind .
These facts will surely help the students to increase tgheir memorizing skills and their intrest to the subjects .
