I would only partially agree with the statement since i feel that even though many parts of the world could see fewer cars in use in the future , there are some parts of the world where there could be use of more cars .
i think that , in the developed countries , where there is already a very high cars per person ratio , the use of the number of cars would come down whereas in the underdeveloped parts of the world where this ratio is currently very very less , the number of cars might go up infact .
The passages below explain how .

Firstly there is no doubt that the shortage of fuel is going to be a big problem twenty years from now .
This would contribute to lessening of car numbers and care usage in the future .
Also the increased levels of pollution especially in countries which are highly industrialized , for example many parts of Europe and North America , would lead to the reduction in the number of cars with the objective of reducing pollution .
The governments in these countries would also be able to afford excellent public transport systems that would enable the public at large to commute confortably even without cars .
Also the rising levels of health consciousness could mean people preferring to use more of bycycles and other modes of transport that give some exercise to the body .

However there are parts of the world that are highly underdeveloped for example parts of Africa and Asia and here the levels of industrialisation are very low .
Twenty years from now , these parts would be more developed and hence more money would come into the hands of the people there .
These people would naturally like to enjoy the luxury of a car for the first time in their lives .
Therefore , in these parts the number of cars could go up .
