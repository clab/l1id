I strongly agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Young people enjoy a lot than older people .
Even older people not have patience to enjoy .
The young people enjoy their work also but not the older people .

As the older people are too week they are not able to go out side , even if they stay at home also as they are older they are not able to enjoy as young people .
as the people become older they may get lot of health problems , if they want to enjoy also they not cause of their age .
But unlike th eolder people young people enjoy a lot even in work also .

For example if there is a party going in a home , let us take the older and younger people attend the party .
The young people look more sharp than older people .
They can dance , sing and able to participate in any program unlike older people .
The young people also have so much knowledge than older people , so that they can participate actively in educational programms and they can enjoy the program .
As the people become older they lost knowledge what they are earned when they are in young age , so they are not able to participate even in th eeducational programes .
Not only that one but also as the people becoming older they have so many tensions about their followers , their work and also about thier health , as there is no tensions for the young people nothing than the work tension .
Even though the young people have the work tension they can enjoy the tension also .

As the people become older they loss knowledge , they loss patience , and also they are having the lot of tensions and disturbences .
So the people in the young age that is young people can enjoy a lot than the older people .
