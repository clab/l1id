I do agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how t6o do well '' .
To agree , there many reasons to say .
For example , a scientist allways think better to invent something else that he observes .
If he thinks to do that he knows well he wo n't be able to discover new things .
He always concentrate on new things that may be a task of risk .
In that way he may fail for the first time but later he may get sucessin that aspect .

The other way is that many great people get sucess aftter taking risks in particular aspect .
If we go on doing what we know well , we may get sucess in that particular aspect but we ca n't see other part of life .
We are good at one aspect but poor at other aspects .

A sucess after a hard work & included with risks gives more happyness than that we are expert in that .
I does n't mean that do only risks , but just try to do such type of things sometimes .
To do a work one should have the basic knowledge of it .
Then only he can move on .

So , I finally conclude that people who try to do new things & think in a different way may get more sucessin their career .
Not only scientists , many other people are getting popular by having this type of nature .
Now a days students are discoverring many things by their own by thinking in a different way .
So , Their teachers should guide them in this aspect .
This help their future
