The concept of gaining knowledge is an age old process dating back to centuries .
In those times especially in ancient India , the teachers taught not only in a particular subject but wanted the students to have a broader knowledge in more than one subject .
This as those people believed to be mainly because knowledge is derived only to make a better person altogether .
This is attained by improving the wisdom that a person holds afteer gaining the over all broader knowledge .
This wisdom helps the person to be a good human being .
This kind of concept is still the main thing that is followed through out the world .

In my view i can say that gaining a broad knowledge on many subjects is far more important than gaining the specialized knowledge on one particular subject .
If any person has a broader concept on many academic subjects , then he is sure of applying .
For instance if a person has mastered in computers and doesnt know where to use it and what kind of programs to be made , then all his specialization would be a mere waste of time .

Quoting another example when a person who is say Engineer by occupation , sees a person who is collapsing on the road with a breathing problem , all that he can do is to call an ambulance but if he has any kind of knowledge on how to do a first aid to that kind of a person , then nay be he can really save the life of that dying person .
This is the way the knowledge comes in handy .
You never know when youm need them .

Another illustration that can be given in this context is that when a person is jobless for quite a long time , then he can go and do a job if he has a knowledge on other subjects too .
If a doctor is jobless say after he finished his internship , then if he has a knowledge in computers he can find a job in that field .

Thus having greater knowledge on subjects sometimes saves lives or some times earns you money and make your living .
So it is always best to have it fir a better life and a good settlement .
