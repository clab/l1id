The issue at hand is whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use as compared to today .
The issue is important considering the social , technological and environmental factors governing life on the planet .
I disagree with the statement , as i believe that the cars might increase in number comparitively .

One reason why I disagree is owing to the social factors such as economic conditions of people , standards of living etc ..
people are increasing in number , their tastes and preferenceas are changing , their living conditions are also subjected to continuous change , most importantly the standard of living has been changing .
for example a normal clerk would go for a two wheeler to save for the rainy day but the same person would like to live a luxurious life , purchase a car when he has saved enough and has fulfilled his responsibilities twenty years down the line .

Another factor is the population growth .
As the populations increases more and more people might purchase cars .
M oreover a car provides more safer and secure means of transport as compared to mopeds , autorickshaws etc.keeping in view the growing traffic , road accidents and other mishaps , people who can afford will psychologically tend towards owning a car .

The technologival developments in the field of automobiles will help evolve faster cars , fully automated , eco friendly and thus gear up the purchase of cars as people will try to keep pace with the fast world ahead .
The economic conditons of people will also take a leap twenty years from now and owning a car will no longer be a prerequisite of the rich .

Thus in conclusion I would like to claim that there will be more cars in future than today considering the various factors discussed .
