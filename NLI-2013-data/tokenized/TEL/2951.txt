I agree with statement .
Young people do enjoy there life morethan older people , young people have more energy and more adrenalin which heips them to do whatever they want on the other side older people have less energy and enthusiasm , there bodies are weak and so they have to think twice before they do anything .
For example if a young man wants to go for a tour in his holidays then the first thing that comes to his mind is where to go , whom to take , when etc but when a old persom considers a trip to go somewhere the first thing that comes to his mind is how long will be the journey and what all precautions he needs to take .

young people can freely do whatever they want but older people may have many health problems which will restrict them from doing things which they wuold have liked to do .
Young people can eat , drink do anything they like but older people will have many restrictions .

When it comes to sports young people are encouraged to play many of them where as older people are always cautioned and even they are afraid play to there full potential .

Older peoples mind set is mainly different when compared to younger people like they look at life as journey coming to an end mostly thinking about what they have achieved and feeling satisfied where as young people never think of ther past they always plan their future , they view there life as a beggining of a great journey .

For example older people think about there college times when they were young always thinking of the funny things and there personal experiences and feeling satisfied .
Where as young people think and plan about there how to enjoy there life like planning to go for tour with friends or play games with his friends , constantly thinking how to enjoy there life .

So in the end i conclude that younger people enjoy
