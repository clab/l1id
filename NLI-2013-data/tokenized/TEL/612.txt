The present topic can be well depicted in that broad knowledge can help us to grab our ability in various fields that can help us to know better about different facets .

The main thing about having knowledge in different fields can help us to interrelate our opinion to the maximum extent .
For example Environmental Sciences is an multidisciplinary branch of sciences in which different aspects like air , soil , and the aspects of water can be known .
In addition the changes that are occuring with in the total atmosphere can be well described or well known .
In this branch ther can be great interrelationship between one another in many forms or they can show a graet dependency on one another .
Like wise having knowledge in different academic subjects can help us to react to the the situations that can happen in and around us .
Having specialition can be helpful in knowing the depths in that particular field but cannot gain the knowledge all though the globe or all around in various fields .
One can never stick to a particular aspect in life like wise should never stick to aparticular field of study in the name of specialisation .
Wide range of knowledge can only help any individual to grow to the greater standars in life .
The knowledge can never be stolen or bargained at times when needed and on the other hand cannot gain knowledge at a shorter period so having a broad knowledge can definitely be the better of the things when related to stick our knowledge in the name of specialisation in one specific subject .
Knowledge can be the source of wealth so having knowledge in different fields of academics can definitely be the better source of wealth .
Knowledge in various academics can be broadly shared among different varities of individuals .
Especially knowledge in differnt academic subjects can also help for the better oppourtunities and also can quiet effective .

So having knowledge in many academic subjects can be more worthy than limiting oneself to a particular field of study .
It is definitely a boon to have knowledge in many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
