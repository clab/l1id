I disagree with the statement ' it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ' .
In case of broad knowledge of many academic subjects we need to study all the subjects and become familiar with all the topics in the subject .
It is difficult task to do .
where as in case of the case of specialize in one specific subject is an easy process to know abt the subject .

In specializing one specific subject , we can learn more about the topic and we can learn very deeply about the subject and become a gem in that particular subject .
When a person go to a job he just sees that in which stream or subject the candidate is more intelligent and the interviewer asks the quieries related to that subject only .
Interviewer sees the candidate that how much deep knowledge the candidate has in that subject .
When we would like to do postgraduate courses we will be specizlized in a specific subject .

specializing one specific subject is a good and easy process .
we can get deep knowledge in the subject and do some researsh works related to that subject .
As an example if a person is specialized in artificial intelligence , he can make many programs and make intellegen computer programs .
He can write programs self .

Borad knowledge of academic subjects is we should learn all the subjects in the academic year .
we need to grasp all the topics which is big problem .
It is very hard to graspe all the subjects and a tuff task to remember all the topics and points in the subject .
We cannot be able to specialize in any field .
It is difficult to understand each topic in the subjects and it takes much time to prepare all the subjects .

It is not an easy task to have broad knowledge of academic subjects .
broad knowledge of academic subjects is some what helpfull to shift to differernt streams and also different specializations .
but we cany be perfect in any subject

thus specialization in one specific subject is better an we can deepen knowledge .
broad knowledge doesnt help and we will not be perfectrt in
