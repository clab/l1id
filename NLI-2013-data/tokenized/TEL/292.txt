Both the cases are important for an student for the student , even by learning through the facts and also by the means of understanding the ideas and concepts .
As the understanding the ideas and concepts , he can face any consequences and the problems .
he can solve the problems through the idea and concept he has .
if he has to learn by the fact then he may not think as fast as if he knows the concepts .
he has to learn the ideas and concepts because he may not face every fact in his lifetime .
with the idea and concept he has can improve his knowledge .
he can apply this taughts to some new application .
where he has the chance to learn something new .
ideas and concepts are the facts of others so the can improve his knowledge about that fact and having idea and concept of others fact will improve the students knowledge .
lets us take an example of newtons theory , if you tell the stundent to finds the laws of newtons he may not find on his own .
because his ideas will not reach suddenly to that .
if he has idea and concept about the newtons theory then he can improve that theory on the other by applying it .

If the students as to improve his knowledge by his own experiences will lead him to become the great person in the future .
but some students will come under the stress when they face the problem .
but if the students has the idea about the problem then he may solve the problem without any stress .
if the student learn something by the fact , he will sutre remember it and that will become an idea and concept to others .
as the every idea and concepts are the facts faced by the others .
every fact that student learn will become an idea to his fellowmens .
