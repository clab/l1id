I agree with the given topic .
I think that it better to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects .
I am an engineering student i feel pretty good my subject when i am talking with another engineer .
where as it is very difficult to me , to talk about any other subject with other person .
Recently i went my home town and met my friends .
They are all art students .
At that time i had to talk about history of world richest culture .
They talking well but i could not even talk a single word .
At that moment i feel very bad and thought that if u have knowlege about some other topics i definitely able say something .

We are living in interdependent society that means we have to help others and take help from others , we must know about our duties and responsebilities and some famous persons .
It requires to know about some subjects those are knowlege about history and geography and political sciences and knowledge about some biology .
Last year summer college a big accedent occur .
At that time i and my frined were near by .
we do n't immediately what to do , what i mean is to make a phone call to police station .
At that time we did n't make .
Actually it is a our mistake , this is because of lack outer knowledge .

In conclusion , every student having broad knowledge of many subjects is better .
Then only we can easily manage society and studies .
