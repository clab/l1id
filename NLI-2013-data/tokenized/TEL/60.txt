According to my opinion , specilize in one specific subject is better than the broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Student need knowledge in one specilize subject will give good and positive reaults to him .
He would get confidence on that particular subject .

Specilize subject gives chance to get more knowledge , grip and command on that particular subject .
they mey get more chances to focus on particular thing , it will help to reserch on that specialized subject .
It leads to invent new product , it may help to moderen society .
Also it may give good name and also chances to improve economical position .

For example , I finished my specialization in Pharmaceutical division .
After that I did reaserch work on one particular molecule .
That molecule given positive result against HIV disease .
I got a huge amount of prize money from my country .
And also they awarded in many ways .
With this prized money I started a one large pharmaceutical company .
In other way many people are serviving with my medicine .
This results given good name in my career .

Another example is , One of my frieds also specilize in the computer programm .
He invented a new programm , for that he awarded by the government .
Due to that programm people are enjoying computar games and Internet fecility .
Due to internt the world become a small village .

Finally , my opinion is specialize in many acdemic subjects will not foucus in one particular thing , he may not get satisfaction with all subjects .
Didnt get special recognisation in society .
So specialize in one specific subject is better .
Many scientiest are invented by specialize in one specific subject .
