I agree with the statement that the student must understand the ideas and the concepts rather than the students to know or learn the facts because learning the facts will not help him to know about something practically .

The best example for this is about the flights , you can only drive the flight only when you know the ideas to start the plane and the concepts to take off the flight where as learning facts are only useful to tell to others how the flight use to work .

So this means that ideas and concepts will always help in many ways like when the pilot is in trouble so then you would atleast know that how to land the flight as if you know the concepts of it how to land the flight down on the runway .

Another example is for example if you want to create a hardware device , you can only start when you have a basic idea on it , without that it is impossible to create a hradware device .
Later you need the concepts to develop its features and the perations it needs .
Learning facts is also needed here to make the device complete without any problems which the people who had worked on the other devices before .
This makes the work more easier than getting into the trouble .
But here we give impotance mainly to the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts this facts would only help us to complete the device quickly .

So students have to understand the ideas and the concepts which helps them in future when they want to research anything or they want to develop any product which is already existing .
As they get succeeded they think or get ideas of doing more researches and developments .

So ideas and concepts are more important the learni
