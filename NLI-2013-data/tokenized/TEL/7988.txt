I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

There are certain factors that need to be considered while choosing a travel plan .

First , My idea of a travel is to take off on a vacation to a new place .
From my experience , I realize that during such trips , I spend much time locating the interesting spots and finding my way to them .
On the contrary , traveling in a group with a guide would help minimize the effort required in planning the trip and provide a real sense of holiday .
It also helps explore the places much effectively and hence realize the benefits of such a trip .

Second , I relate travel to fun and excitement .
Traveling in a group is always fun as it gives an opporunity to meet with people from various backgrounds and geographic locations .
Hence , it serves as a platform to make new friends and share experiences .
It also adds to the fun part since we could organize activities and events that promote participation and interaction in the group .

Further , traveling with friends/family in a group is all the more exciting since it provides an opportunity to spend time with the loved ones .
Also , having a travel guide relieves us of any hassles involved in the planning .

Third , I hate to have a stranger feeling when I am traveling , it gives a great comfort feeling to travel in a group as you have people around that you know .

Though there may be certain shortfalls in traveling in a group , the benefits , by far , outweigh the any such shortfalls .

In sum , I prefer to travel in a group with a tour guide since it meets all my expectations of an ideal vacation .
