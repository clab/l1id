Every person is having the different nature .
Some people think that it is their responsibility to spend some time to helping their communities while others think it is not their responsibility to help communities .
I donot agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

Ours is a developed city , it has developed by forming group of people in to community .
Some communities are develop by involment of all members of their community .
In our community every person have to allocate some time on sunday for the development of community .
They will be metting and discuss the solutions for the problems in colony .
By active participation of our community members we developed parks , roads etc .
Our is the only beautiful community in our locality .
In every where they will be forming a community and working betterment of their community .

In educational institutions we will form in a community and strive for the betterment of institution .
In our school every year all students will partcipate in cleaning the school that day all teachers and students work together they will painting the walls and planting trees etc. we will be cleananing our school and understanding will be developed between us .
In making some decisions a group of members form as commitee and they try their best for making the good decision .

Some persons may think that it is not their reponsibility to help their communities .
Because the work they are doing in their job .
Technology has advanced and some of them not find it tight schedule .
When they get some leisure time they think to relax , going out to meet some one .

Thus , I conclude that most of young people nowadays give enough time to help thyeir communities .
Most of the communities are well developed , This shows us they are spending some time for the growth of their community
