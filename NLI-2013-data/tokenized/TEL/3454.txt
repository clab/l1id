I agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' because youngsters nowadays are being a lot of career conscious .
They want to make a respectable position for themselves in the society and inorder to achieve this they are bending their backs by working hard towards acheiving their goal .

This type of thinking by the youngsters is good only upto a certain extent that is upto earning a respectable position in the society , but you have to return something to the the society from which you have taken something and that is your services to the society .

In this age of globalisation , getting a job is very easy if you have the qualification for it .
Most of the working youngsters want to earn more and and enjoy their free time .
They do not care what is happening in their own community , what are the problems and how to resolve these problems all they want to do is to enjoy they do not realise that there is a problem until they face one themselves .
None of the youngsters are willing to do social services and most of them are becoming selfish and they are thinking about themselves .

Even the society does play a part in not teaching youngsters about social values and ethics .
Young people should be taught to help their communities atleast on their holidays with one thing or the other form their childhood .
It should be made as a classroom work to help the community for atleast some hours a week .
For example students can be taught to help elder people in old age homes as it will give happiness to them or other wise help the public park maintain cleanliness with a special cleaning drive involving all the schools in that locality .

It should also be kept in mind that illiterate children be taught education through educated youngsters in a public hall or arena to reduce illiterates as every educated person can teach others what he has learnt .
