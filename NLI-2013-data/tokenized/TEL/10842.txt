Yes , I Agree with the given Statement .
Successful people try to do the new things rather than doing old things or repeated things .
Here Successful people means the people Who got a lot of experience in their job or in their personal problems .
Doing the repeated things didnot give the new ideas and we also do n't get new knowledge .
Rather doing the new things we get the many ideas and these ideas can be used in many of situations .

But old things are also important for begining of a new thing .
This means that Repeated things are fundamentals or basics of Begining new things .
So we ignore the old things in some cases not in all .
Suppose if we neglect the old ideas for starting a new one , some times new things becomes failed .
So we have to take care While doing new things .
These are some DisAdvantages for not taking the old ideas .
