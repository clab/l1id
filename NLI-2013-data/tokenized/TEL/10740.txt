` Failure is the stepping stone of success '' .
Success stands on four pillars .
They are efforts , risk , determination and dedication .
Without these factors it cannot be achieved .
As a coin has two faces , even there are two faces to acheive success .

One face of achieving success is by playing safe .
Look for the companies which have already flourished , became popular .
Obtain farchise of the company and open a new outlet .
By doing this we can not only get out of risk but also make profits as early as possible .
But we need to follow some prerequisites requested by the original company .
The office and the organisational structure should resemble the original company .

For example Maruthi company taking the franchise of Suziki company of japan .
As they used the brand name of Suzuki which was then the most reliable automobile in the world maruthi company bacame successful .
They had introduced Indias first small car Maruthi Suzuki 800 which has beaten all existing models then .
Thus it can be said that successful people can acieve success by not taking risk .

Adding to the above example , one more example can be quoted .
let us take Pizza Hut .
The company is located in The United States .
The franchise has been taken to set up the same in India .
Within two years of time , in all metrpolitan cities branches have been opened and they are running successfully .
So , we can say that franchise is one of the ways to achieve success without taking any risk .

Now the other face of achieving success is by taking risk .
Whenever we enter a new sector in businees arena to flourish risk must be taken .
But there are people who were successful and there are people who couldnt not taste success .
Agressive marketting strategies , best quality products and customer satisfaction are the roots to achieve success in this arena .

Reliance Industries tried to enter communications arena by introducing post pais mobile phones .
They have given the cheapest prices in those times .
Their campaigning strategies were creative .
People got attracted to their system .
Within few years reliance bacame the best mabile in India .

One more example is the founder of hotmail Mr.Bhatia .
He was the first person who introdued Email to the world .
He invested lot of money on his research and came up with fruitful results .
Had he not taken the risk of investing such a huge amount he would hvae not become successful .
RIghtnow he is running in crores .
He even expanded his business .

Hence I would like to be diplomatic with the given statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doin what they already know how to do well .
