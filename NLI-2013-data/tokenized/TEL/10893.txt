successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I agree with this statement because it is from the successful people that we get many things needed in our day today life .
For example , let us consider Billgates who has known very well for the invention of the software microsoft .
He is a successful person in the software field but he may not stop doing the experiments in this field .
One day he might be the leading personality in Computer field .

Like this there will be many successful people who might take risks rather than doing only what they know .
For example , consider scientists .
Scientist will be one the successful person in his field .
He might take risks and invent more things using the latest technologies .
Right brothers invented the aeroplane .
they may be successful in their field but did n't stop taking risks to invent new thing .
It is because of them Airlines came into light .

Successful people might invent new ideas using their own knowledge that is gained through reading books or by their own experience .
If they were trying to discover one thing and if in case it might not come true because of some reasons they will try it in other way by taking new risk .
From the previous knowledge they think what are the causes and defects and they take measure to rectify the defects .
In this way successful people always take risks to invent more and more new things .

Failures may not dissapoint the successful people they take it as a challenge and will try more to recover the mistake and to bring out their product in to life .
Every successful man thinks that `` Failures are the key stones for Success '' .
It is because of the failure one gets strong desire to invent a new thing .
Only Successful people can do this because they will not care for risks .
They care only for their target .
