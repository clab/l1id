On a first glance it may sound politically correct to say that it is better to have a broader perspective on many subjects rather than specializing in a field .
But I feel that it is better to specialize in a field , though a field that interests the person to a great extent .

In olden days when there was no technology to aid the humans , they accumulated whatever information they had on a particular field .
But ultimately the information was not massive .
That is , the information was not of that quantum that it was difficult for the brain to remember .
Lets looks at todays picture .
We know of the advances made in every field of academics .
There is so much to learn and know , but is the human brain capable of that ?
I dont think so .
So it is actually a human shortcoming .

Now , from another point of view .
The most common example of a doctor !
We all know that specialists are an absolute essentiality these days .
The reason for an improved life longevity is not only the machines ( i.e. technology ) but also humans in the form of specialists .
As a specialist knows his field very well he can deal with almost all the situations arising from his field and this ultimately means greater services to the people .

Although people tend to argue that due to so many branches in every field it might become a case of `` too many cooks spoil the broth '' .
But , because to the special fields , the specialist may concentrate more on his field and and work hard to improve his field of work , that is again , better results !
We have many such examples in every field today .
For example , had every engineer been building bridges and houses ( like earlier ) , would there be fields of engineering such as robotics and nano particles ?

But , finally as an exception , it must be left to the individual concerned .
This is because there is a natural tendency in some people to learn everything they like , they are inquisitive .
So it is better to leave the choice to such people .
Of course , ultimately knowledge is also for pleasure and self contentment !

In conclusion , I would say that the need of the hour is specialists in all walks of life for a better tomorrow .
