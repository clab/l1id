`` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . ''

In the present day there are too many cars too less parking spaces and the roads are being crowded because of this reason .
To avoid such disruptions one possible way is to have fewer cars in use after twenty years than there are today .

The main disadvantage of too many cars is pollution both air and noise .
Another problem is accidents involving cars especially have increased over the past few years .
The declining of the fossil fuels and petroleum produst might be another reason for decreasing the number of cars .

Decreasing the number of cars would decrease trafic and people would be able to travel easily .
In future it would enable us to reduce pollution caused by cars mainly air pollution .
This is because air pollution is one of the causes for ozone depletion resulting global warming .
Many trees are cut for increasing parking spaces or making new roads which increases global warming .
But if there are fewer cars more trees can be planted .
Noise pollution will reduce automatically with the use of fewer cars and may infact not exist any more .

Car accidents are increasing because of reckless driving or driving the car under influence of alcohol or drugs .
People who own cars do not feel resposible to anyone and hence some of them do not follw trafic rules such as wearing the seat belts .
Not only the person commiting the mistake is paying but also other people who are on the same road as the person commiting the mistake .
Most of the time these accidents are due to teenagers or students who just got their license ( some may drive without a license ) .
All such things could be avoided if there were fewer cars which belonged only to responsible people .

Fossil fuels and petroleum products have been depleting very rapidly over the past few years in the western countries and it has become very costly to buy it from middle-eastern countries .

Hence limited number of cars would help in saving the remaining fossil fuels and also avert many other disasters caused because of cars .
