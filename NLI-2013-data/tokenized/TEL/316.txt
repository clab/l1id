In my openion successful people try new things and take risk rather than going in the old fashion or method .

There are a number of people who used new ways and helped them to succeed in their life .
If they go with the old fashion as they already familiar with in their life , they may go in same way in the career which may not help in the challenging environment .

Dheerubhai ambani , a great business person in India used to go in the new unconventional way in his life aswell as career .
It worked alot so as a result of it he became a great person from school teacher son .

Let we take about Google founders , they didnot gone in a old fashion .
Even though they are software professionals , they didnot tried as normal employs .
They wanted to go in a new way and wanted to take risk .
They started with a new idea and now we can see the difference .

If all the persons going in the traditional way which already excisted no new inventions will occur .
so people are going in new ways and succeeding in their life and in their career .

Hollywood directors also comes under this same group .
Most of the successful directors used to present their movie in a different manner with new ideas and some people tries to present their movies in the old fashions which already working .
`` Jurasic Park '' came with this policy only .
The producer and direcor knows that they are doing risk but they want prefer to go in the new way and they succeeded .
Eventhough some movies with sory is coming now , we remembered only Sephen Speilberg , who started the way .

Eventhough some people going in the same route and succeding , we can call them as followers not the initiaters .

So I strongly agree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''
