the statement is that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .

i agree with this above statement that is `` more important the ideas and the concepts to a student '' .

because if we have some imagination then we will imagine and we will try to reach that imagine .

if we does n't have any imagination then there is no way to reach some purticular state .

so the imagination is the important thing for the students because using with the alredy developed things they will try to do new things .
like that they can know each and every point where they face the problems and some achievements in there experiment .

so the concepts also take main role in the students life .
if they have good knowledge in the concepts then only he will learn something new otherwise he will not get good knowledge .

if the students wants gain more knowledge then its better to learn understand the ideas of that field and understand the concepts of that perticulal field .

if the students have good basics then they can easily analyse the new things very easily .
and the student can capable to invent new things .

if every student start with some basics and concepts then it is easy to learn and with this students experiences they try to dis cover some more new things in the future .

the the next generation also try to learn the basics and the ideas from the elders or teachers .
and they will implement furtherly .

if the students learn facts then they will not sharpen their minds as well as they dont try to analyse that why that fact is made .

so this is the main disadvatage to a student to learn something new .
