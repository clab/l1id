I agree with the the statement , young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities and are too busy spending time on other things .

The young people of today claim to be very busy and not to have time for idle pastimes .
How much of this is really true ?
Cant a youngster fit in about two hours a week into his busy schedule dedicated to community service ?
Too many questions with not enough answers .

Young people of today do lead more compititive lives .
Compitition today is much more than what it was 10 years back .
With increased compititition , the student has to put in greater amount of work just to get noticed .
However , what youngsters fail to realise is that more leverage is been given nowadays to people who serve the community .
As an example , a company that had come to recruit students from my college had given preferance to those that had done some amount of commuinty work as compared to those that havent .

Moreover , I feel that , the main time spent by a youngster today is in watching movies , spending time with his or her friends or surfing the internet .
The advent of the internet has caused people to become more insulated from one another .
People claim that they are very active on the net .
Some go to the extent that they use the net for `` social '' causes such as creating a blog after a disaster , such as a flood , war or earthquake .
The same youngster goes on to feel very proud of himself .
At some point of time , the young person needs to understand that a blog only helps in voicing opinions but dosent help solving problems .

Thirdly , i feel the one major thing absent in all youngsters today is a concience that tells them to do good for others .
Youngsters seem to have become a selfish lot by caring only about themselves and their comfort .
They seem to lack the enthusiasm to go the extra mile to help other people .
I feel , this is due to a lack of awareness .
Hence , at some time in the school level , all students must be made to do something good for their class or for their friends so that they realise how good it feels to help others .

In conclusion , A young person must give more time to helping the community since , if every young person could do just that , the world would become a better place to live in .
