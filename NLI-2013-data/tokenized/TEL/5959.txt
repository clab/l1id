I completely agree with the statement `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' because the fact that people like to enjoy more comforts and the improment thing is that the technology is increasing enoromously in the day to day life which can make more nu .

I support the statement because of the following considerations which i have taken into consideration .
The first consideration is that man wants to enjoy comforts and is one of my mojor considerations .
It is because the bikes cannot support the driver in all the case , that is in the rainny seacon , winter season .
and the driver wants a him which could help him to take him in any atmoshperic condition .
this is the first a person wants to have a car .
And the second reason is that it would be more safer than bikes because he can keep the temperature of his car according to his will and his comfort while the person riding a bike cannot do .
And the other reason I would to support my statement is that the cost of the car .
The cost of the cars have been decrease now a days because of the growth in the technology .
Now a days the car makers are improving their technology so that the car would of least expenditure , so that there would be more people to by their car .
If we compare the number of the cars present 20 years ago and the cars present now we can see that the number of cars have deen increased , wide variety of cars are now pr4esent in the market and also the feature the the car should have is also improved a lot .
Also the lowest cost of the car in these 20 years have been decreased to a major extent .

So I totally support the above statement and I can say conformly that the rising technology will give the future a better car and also for the cheaper rate so that more people can enjoy the comfort .
