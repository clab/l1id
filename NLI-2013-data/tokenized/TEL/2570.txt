I agree with the prompt .
Young people do enjoy life more than the older ones do .
It is only at a young age that one 's mind is jostling with innovative , imaginative and creative ideas .
A young person is jostling with curiosity to plunge into the outside world and explore the various mysteries it holds .
All the zest to explore life gradually fades away with old age .

Here is an example .
When you ask a teen about what he or she would like to do in life , you would get an answer right away that would sound something like , `` oh !
I want to be successful in what ever that i do ! ...
And have a lot of fun doing that ! ''
.

On asking the same question to an adult , say a middle aged one , can you imagine such an energitic and zealous reply ?
Well , at least I cannot .
At the most , it would be something like , `` I need to get all my insurances settled '' .

From this we can infer that with old age , our attitude towards life begins to change .
One starts to forget that life is something that comes only once and it needs to be lived to the fullest .
And with that I mean , the zeal to face the challeges that come up in life should prevail , whatsoever .

Also , the saying `` ignorance is bliss '' would hold true for a young person ( if taken in the right context , that is ) .
A young person need not worry about the complexities of shares and insurance policies and all the material worries that are ought to haunt them in their old age .
All that would ( and should ) matter in youth would be a positive approach towards life and the zeal to do something good for the society , the willingness to contribute to making the world a better place to live in .
Well , yes , that is the only time that one woud get the time to do good things for the world , like joining an animal welfare association , or helping organisations that work to do some good for the society .

All these factors sum up to one conclusion .
Life can be enjoyed greatly only in young age .
