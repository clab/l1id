I do agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

To learn facts is a tempory solution to a problem while if you understand the ideas and concepts of the problem you can rember it for a life time .
Students who have command over the ideas and concepts of a particular subject perform well in the exams that students with mere information of facts .

By learning facts you can just have one method of solution to a particular problem while if you understand the ideas and concepts you can apply your own knowledge to the situation and may come out with an different way of solution .
Not only this but also if you are through with the ideas and concepts of one situation you can even try to apply them to a different situation .
Text books also support that understanding ideas and concepts is mor e important for students .
Books give examples to various laws , theories and other statement .
Of these examples most af them relate to day to day life so that it is easier for the student to make his own experimentation with what he has understood .

The importance of understanding and conceptualization can be explained by , for example , learn to drive a car .
You go to a driving school and you learn to drive a car .
You can drive the car now but you would do it much better if you have proper understanding of how a car works .
If you learn the basic or very simple concepts of car mechnics you can do your driving much better .
It can also help you when you have breakdowns

Though understanding and conceptualizing is time taking it is worth spending time on such long lasting method whose impact is much stronger on students learning .
