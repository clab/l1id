In my opinion it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts where it could bring out the natural talents in side the student and makes him understand the thing more clearly than it happens in the class room .

Understanding the ideas and concepts make the childern think more scientifically and discover more new thing about a partiucular concept it inculcicate a habit in childern to analyse the things in more broad way and arrive at the results on their own .

Understanding the things rather than learning the things from facts from class room helps the child to remember the things for longer and in inculcicate new ideas in arrive at new ideas which help them in a long way to go .
also learning concepts and ideas rather than learning facts which were written or told by some one helps to develop a sought of inviduality in the childern and to evalvuate the issues in rather broad way standing different form others .

For an example one of my friends with a concept of aerospace in his mind later developed a idea which he implemented in one of his projects ans his project was selected to demonstrated in NASA in untied states of america .
and he also was rewarded by the president my country as the best out standing research student in his age group .

Learning concepts and ideas would also childern in their education where he could he could he could be intrested in fields like research and things do really do matter a lot and even have lots influence on on his/her professional carrer .
concepts and ideas and are not only confined to four walls of a room where these could obtained form many places in nature in books in people and even in him self .

Finally i would conclude knowledge of ideas and concepts is large ocean where it has no age ba revery one is a intelluctutal in him self only thing differs is to understand the concept and implement his ideas in to practice .
