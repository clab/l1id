I agree with the statement which says that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Typically , young people are healthier and thus they have more opportunity to pursue different activities like bungee jumping , parasailing , gliding and others which provide a stimulation and a difference to the usual routine of the lives of people .

Young people are also not usually weighed down with the responsibilites of family life .
Thus they are able to go on adventures and undertake risky projects with complete enthusiasm and lack of fear .
Climbing Mount Everest , going on a jungle safari ride , going racing with friends on cars are some of the activities that older people are scared to undertake as they get on in life .

When people are young , say in college , they usually have a gang of friends with whom pursuing different activities becomes a lot of fun .
But as time goes on , they get married and have children .
Slowly they start losing contact with their college friends and it no longer becomes possible to go on trips as happy-go-lucky bachelors .
Now if they go on trips , they do so with their family and this gives a totally different and more serious outlook compared to going with friends .

When young , people are not concerned a lot about saving money .
So they do n't mind spending money and going on trips frequently .
But older people realize that trips are not essential , but providing for the future of the family is .
So they decide to restrict their activities and spend only on what is essential and save the rest for the future .

Finally one can say that a person is only as old as he thinks he is .
So if a person thinks he is young in mind , he can have fun no matter what the age .
It 's the attitude of the person that counts when you want to have fun , not the actual number of years you 've lived on earth !!

All these reasons thus support the view that the younger you are , the more fun you can have !
