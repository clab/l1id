Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This statement according to me is not appropriate as we can observe in our day to day life many older people enjoying their lives more than younger people .
But of course at an average we see alot of young people enjoy life more than older people .

Young people enjoy alot because they are still at the intial stages of their life and they are not encounterd with any practical problems of their lives .
And at the young age people have less responsibilities , so , they generally dont encounter any problems in day to day life .

People at the young age are generally looked after by their parents and it is their parents who provide all the facilities neede by them .
So people at the young age enjoy life alot .

But this is not the case every time , if a young person from poor financial background may not be able to get all the facilities and therefore it needs for him to work very hard to survive i.e he need to spend more time on working hours and so he may miss all the enjoyment and fun that his fellowmen are having .
So it depends on various factors that are surrounding that particular person .

And coming to older people , as these people have gone through various phases of life they are not easily attracted by the pleasures of enjoyment .
Some people may have gone through the enjoyment phase in their early stages of life , so , they are not that inetrested in enjoyment and rather like to spend their time on the things that give pleasures to them like helping the people who have lost their families in a ntural disasters , that is by doing social service .
Older people with good financial conditions and people who are satisfied with their achivements mat enjoy alot than the average young people .

So concluding , i would like to state that the enjoyment of people whether they are young or older depends on the circumastances and conditions of their lives .
Therefore it is true in some cases but it is bot the case in some other conditions .
Finally i would like to state that the statement given is not always true and so it cannot be agreed or disagreed .
