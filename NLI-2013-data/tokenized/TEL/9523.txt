The definition of a successful person , is that he is an expertise in all fields .
Success always drives people to try out newer avenues and newer fields , doing a mundane , monotonous job will never lead to path of success .
Therefore , I completely agree with the facts that people should try out newer things and take risks to go ahead in life .
We can look at this by taking few examples .

If a person is a science student , who does research work on various kinds of proteins , etc .
And he needs to keep a track of his work and record all his work , then by learning computers he can arrange , save , retrive his data properly .
Even though it costs him some effort and time to learn , the person should go ahead as , it gives him better taste of success in his work .

Another example is that of , of making choice of choosing a career in a newer field , which had not been developed that much presently , example that of stem cell research , but in long run this is going be the major one in curing the genetic disorders .
So the person can take risk of entering this field , which will surely fetch him success .

Furthermore , when it comes to bussiness people , they got to try newer things and take risky decisions , since thats how great bussiness tycoons have grown up .
Coming to investing in share market , is also a risky job , since you never know status of shares the very next minute , but the one trying to take risks never goes back , since he is craving for success .

Finally , by looking at all the above examples , I can confidently state that successful people are always on a try out for newer things and willing to accept risks , since its the taste of success that is more important in ones life .
