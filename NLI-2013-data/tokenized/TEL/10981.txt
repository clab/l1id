We have all kinds of people in our society .
some people are successful and some people wo n't .
But I feel successful are some some maverik they try out new things they take risks in there work to gain success .
I agree to the following statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' I have many examples to explain the above statement but I choose one of that is the maverik actor , director and singer kamal hassan .
he has been successful in his acting career because he tries new things rather repeating story or anything else sometimes he fails to gain profit on introducing movie .
but he never stops to try different things in industry .
for example he introduce a special movie in that they was no speeach or we can call speeachless movie he dare to produce this flim which was a great success in his career and he did not stoped producing different as such as this .
but sometimes he fails to break the box office but he did not stoped producing such movies .
Now he had got 17 flimfare awards and he has called the greatest actor in indian flim industry
