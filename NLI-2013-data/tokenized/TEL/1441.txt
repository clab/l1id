It is better to have broad knowledge of many academicsubjects than to specialize in one specific subject , having a complete knowledge about one subject will not promote to apply the concepts of other subjects , so in order to bulid up perfection in our studies its better to have a thorogh in depth knowledge of all the academic subjects , .
i strongly agree with the statement , to bolster my opinion i shall presents fews examples .

Turnining to the statements threshould claim , one informative example is docters , having a complete knowledge of the all academic subject such as anatomy and many more , will improve the jr.docters to perform the operation to the human bodies , because all the people going to docter will have complete credible on them that the docters cure their illness , there is no exageration that if adocter perform a eye operation he such be well perfect in all the organs funtioning such as brain , nervers etc. so docter should be well practiced with his academic subjects .

Another informative example is in enginering section where , the students learn in the first two years the concepts of the few subjects will be help full them in their final semister , such as materal and energy balance will help full to them to apply in their transport phenomena subjects , such that all the basic principles from one subject will be related to other subject .

soo it will like this , aperson goes to a TV shop to buy a tv , the shopkeeper tells about the TYPES OF TV 's present in his shops , tels that one tv is having sound quality of 50 % and screen quality of 80 % and onther tv is of sound quality 80 % and screen quality of 100 % we choose the second one for better quality thus every student be perfect in all academic subject IN sum , from my perspective its better to have a in depth knowledge of all the subject rather than having specialised in one specific subject ,
