Yong people are enjoy life more than older people do .
I am agree with this statement .
Now in present days young people are enjoyed well with copared to old days .
Because at this present time they have so many entertining equipments and these all are not available that olden days .
And the world is developing rapidly .

At a time the young people also worked hard to reach their goals and to reched their ambitions .
They are doing hardwork and enjoy at a time .
They are seperated their time for working and for enjoying .
Now these present days so many young people are worked in many great companies and corporate companies , then they all are worked weekly five days for company and remaining two days they are enjoyed with their friends and family .
So young people also do hardwork but they make some shedule and follow that .

Now so many young people are worked under some company or worked under some institute , But these companies and institutes are build by old people .
So old people are worked in their young days without enjoyment and without free time then they can run that institutes and companies .
From the above two sentences i can say that old people are worked hard than young people so with that reason they reached higher levels .

And these present days also have some yong managing directors for companies and also have some young industrialists , But they all are get that companies and that industrys from their parents and they run that companies verywell .
For suppose Anil Abani is great indusrialist and great managing director for Relience companies .
But he get them from his father and he also workhard and developing their companies and developing their shares in present market .

So finally i am supporting that the young people are enjoy their life more than older people and also they are workedhard and get good positions in their lifes .
And for hardworking older people one of the best example is Bill Gates .
He is the owner of microsoft company .
But now his child that means his younger child are doing enjoy well and they are get that property from their parents and they are develope that company with hardwork .
