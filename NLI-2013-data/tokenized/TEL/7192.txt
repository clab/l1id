I would very much like to have the diclatony of supporting the argument or rejecting for my question .
what makes a person to agree this statement ?
is it the pollution effect on which any person gives to choose this question or is it the decrease in the car prices that any person bases his answer to agree this statement ?
As far as i am concerned the statement is wrong and instead the number of cars would increase owing to the decrease in car price .

No body would disagree with me if i say that the number of cars would comedown , instead i will say the reason why more number cars would still be in use , which is because there is tremendous amount of competition among the car manufacturers .
Obviously to increase their sales they would come out with various offers as a festival gift .
and also growing economy of the people allow them to buy a car which would automatically increase the no of cars .

To explain my answer i would quote an example of my city where no of car purchasers are getting increased and also as far as the latest data are concerned , each family in india would own car in the next twenty years and also i do not see any reason for the number of cars to comedown in the next twenty years and also as the car provides you much comfort , no people would love to loose that option .

So , that is why i would completely disagree with the statement mentioned above that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
Instead i would tell you that the no .
of cars in usage will be higher than there are now , considering fact that the companies sell the cars at a cheaper rate and also the increasing economy that would allow the people to buy a car and also the comfort that the car provides .
