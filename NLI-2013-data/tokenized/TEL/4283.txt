i agree with the fact that the young people have do not spend sufficient time to help their communities .
In an ultra modern world and a speedy world like this one need to do many things for themselves .
The main aim of an youngster is to get a well settled career .
Inorder to achieve a high career he needs to do that extra bit in every mark of his acticity .

Secondly he does n't find time to do all those community services .
The thing is to find a career as interesing as he likes he need to do many things like going to the college , spending on the materials he has to collect for his college , preparing for the college .
He does that extra bit every where he participates .
This makes him completely enervated by the time he feels that he will help the community .

The youngsters think that its not the right time for them to serve the community .
They may think that they may serve the community after they are well settled in their careers coz that gives them ample time .
A well settled career can give the authority for them to help the community .

Majority of the youngsters has no interest to do all those community services .
The fault lies with the family members .
If an youngster is wasting time for the community services he may get a jerk from his parents what the hell are you doing .
Dont waste your time in serving those people .
Its time to change the attitude of parents rather than youngsters .

If an youngster is to lend their time for helping there is someone 's fault in the administration .
Its the administration 's work to see that everything is fine in the community .
One ca n't blame the youngsters for others responsibility .
