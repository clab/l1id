The given topic that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites is a controversial one .
on one hand young people help their communities .
on the other hand young people do not give enough time to help their communities .
however finally i would like to go with young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .

In the present era most of the young people have become self centered and they are not in a mood to know about the problems of the world .
they are always seeking their own comforts .

for example consider that if robbers has entered into the neighbours house of a man and he comes to know that , first he is taking care of the valuables in his house rather than helping his neighbour .

nowadays the young people are lacking in the moral and ethic values .
they have become worse than the birds.i.e.if a crow is died or wounded then large number of crows gather at that place and shout , but when it come to people if a person met with an accident on a road most of them are passing as if they dont see that incident .
They are not even calling the ambulance .
instead of this they may comment that it is his recklessness .

According to me this system has to change , each human should help others .
One person has to help atleast three persons in his life and instead of seeking thanks from them that person has to ask those three individually to help three others .
now nine people has benifited and these nine has to help to three others each individually .
Like this if the chain has followed the the society will change and all the human beings can live hapilly .

The conclusion is that man is a social animal .
he will depend on others some time .
if he helps others only the others will help hin in his necessities .
So the young people has to spend time to help others and his communities because he is going to rule the world some day .
