Both young and old people could enjoy life .
It entirely depends on the individuals .
This can be better described by explaining the terms ` joy ' and ` happiness ' .

The chief reason for my view is that the way people enjoy their life entirely depends on the way they percieve happiness .
Some people tend to experience happiness even at their bad times .
We see defense personnel of a country showing a lot of pride when they loose their lives in a war .
This is unusual in the case of other individuals .

The other reason for my view is that joys and sorrows are part and parcel of the life , and one has to encounter these two situations in a happy way .
We see great sport persons on the television who , at worst of their times on the field tend to carry a smile on their face .
Some of them , winning matches even out of such situations .
The reason being playing the sport in the true spirit by understanding the complexities of the game .

Others might argue that the way people enjoy their life is influenced by many factors such as their economic status , freedom and liberty .
i.e in making their decisions , ambience , health status etc .
But the point I emphasize in my views is that one cannot have all the mentioned factors which are materialistic .
Every individual lack something .

In sum , I concur that people who learn to get satisfied with what they have and who do n't obsess on what they lack tend to enjoy their life more .
It is not the age factor ( .
i.e young or old ) , but , it is the attitudes of the people which determine how much they enjoy their life .
