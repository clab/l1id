I agree that young people now a days are not giving enough time to develop their communities .
they are not having as much time to help their community because now a days the yong people are more intrested in enjoying their life by simply going to movies and just by roaming .
moreover , every one is seeing their own life style not bothering about the society .
which is very harmfull to the nation .

And life had became more mechenical .
no body is showing intrest to help their communities .
while living in a same place avery body in that place must be communicate each other .
only young people in that particular area have to move by their own to help the community which will show the right path to the next generation .

We have give motivation to others for helping their communties for the better society .
Just by spending 5 % of the day we can acheive a lot , moreover it gives self satisfaction of their own .
From the age of schooling only parents must give right direction to their children to acheive the target .
By this the spirit will also develop more in the children .

The things that we can do in little time to help the community will show the long lasting name .
which will give more spirit and encouragement to do more needfull things in future .

So , the younger people are to be motivated in this way to help their communities just by spending little amont of time that has been wasted by roamin and chatting .
If every body do the same we can acheive better society at a very short time

Thus , the younger people must have to spare some time to halp the community which will be shown right path to the next generation ..
