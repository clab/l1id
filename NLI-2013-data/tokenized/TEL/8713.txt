Yes i do agree that `` it is moer important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .i have many reasons and examples to cite in support of this statement .

There are many advantages if the student understands ideas and concepts .
because the facts are already done known by others and the students have to follow the consepts and ideas of that facts .
for example there are many things like the math problems and theorms which are proved by many other people so the students need to follow the rules like ideas and consepts of the theorm in order to solve that .
but the student cant again take the fact and the experiment on that .
so its good for the students to follow ideas .

By following the ideas we can even solve many more problems .
even by using that ideas we can prove some thing else .
the concepts and ideas are used in order to find the remaning things like proving the problem further and even we can make new meathod of solving the problem .
by using some of our own ideas .
but its not good that we waste our time in knowing the things which are already proved so its better to follow ideas and consepts to move forword .

Even there is a need to know that what the fact because some times we may think the idea is correct and which may even go wrong some times .
so its even necessary that the student should also be aware of this fact so that he dont get in mistake .
similar way there are many advantages and disadvantages about this sentance but there are few disadvantages so i would like to agree the sentance because there are many advantages of this sentance .
