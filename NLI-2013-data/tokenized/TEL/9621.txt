I Agree with the statement .
Successful people take risks at every turn of their lives .
They tend to do the unthinkable because normal people are sometimes afraid , ashamed , shy or feel guilty doing things that others have not done .
In my opinion the one who dreams and does nothing to acheive that dream of his is not successful .
successful people dream and try and try and try to reach their respective goal inspite of the difficulties facing them .

i will give you certain examples regarding that .
A few days back i was watching news about a handicapped woman who couldnot walk since she was young .
she attended college and by her sheer perseverance and hard work , she was able to make it to the basketball team and is representing USA in world cup championship .
when she was interviewed as to how she could do it , she just replied HARD WORK and RISK .

The other example that i can think of is the guys who created YOUTUBE .
who would have thought that these guys ( 3 in all ) would make millions and millions with their NEW innovation .
that is what i call risk .
they risked their future by rejecting job offers from other companies and starting a new innovation called youtube and the results are there for everyone to see .

one more example that i would think of is india 's mittal company .
Indian steel companies never ventured outside india .
But mittal comapany made a bold move of purchasing britain 's premier oil company .
Everybody thought that this move was a big blunder .
But the companys risk proved to be the best deal ( and big too ) and many indian companies now are moving globally .

so , with above examples in mind i really think that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know .
