I agree to the statement `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
In the recent age due to technological advancements many are interested to make their own future better .
In a world of competition the youth is racing towards the improvement of their own skills and they are not bothering about the sorroundings and their community .
I feel that `` Serving people is serving God ''

I feel if we spend atleast an hour of our daily life in serving the community and if everyone do that , the nation will certainly achieve its plans and become the leading of any other in the world .
`` Todays students are tomorrow 's citizens '' .
If we serve our community it is indirectly serving ourselves because we are laying the foundations of the future part of our life .

For example , take a student of age 20 .
He must be having many works , enjoying with his friends , partying every night and lots more .
He can do a lot of work at this age .
And even if he spends a 1/10 th of his time in enjoying to the communal development that would be great of his part .
Imagine the number of the youth .
They must in lakhs and each of them spending 1/10 th of his time there can be lots and lots of work to be done .
Even by doing all this they may improve their own skills and in the other way developing the nation .

The political party leaders and other higher officials are already exhausted and can do a very little work and they may many problems regarding their families and many more tensions .
But in the case of a student he has no tension , no problems and he can generate many more ideas than the older ones .
He can work a lot more and can many works like helping others , providing the basic requirements to the needless and organising some functions to create awareness of the present world and how to tackle their own life in any situation .

In this way they can do many other things which helps the society to move further .

I have a concern that the youth may be busy with their own work .
Because i myself practically face the experience .
Even though i have some time to spend on others in helping them .
I do agree that everyone have some difficulty or something other .
But if he had an idea of offering himself to the community he shall surely do that anytime .
Everyone is not aware of what the problems society is facing .
We need to create awareness among them so that atleast 10 % of the youth would be useful which would help the society to develop further .

I finally conclude that the present youth is not showing interest in such developing activities and there should be some programmes in order to create awareness which may be help the society itself develop to a higher level .
