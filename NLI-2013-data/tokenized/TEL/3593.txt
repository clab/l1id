Survival in the fast moving technological era in today 's world has become a ` Rat Race ' .
Charles Darwin 's theory of ` Survival of the Fittest ' is applied to its maximum in today 's life style .

Man feels that - the more work that a person manages to do , the more he earns , the more he earns , the more his status in society rises .
I strongly agree with the author 's opinion .

The younger generation is pushed into this concept unknowingly .
They are forced from many sides to accept this strategy and to work accordingly .
Thus the young minds are manipulated into accepting things as they are and thus small pleasures of the world are soon forgotten .
Their minds adapt to this very fast and adhere to it too strongly .

Thus they donot find time to contribute and pay back to the very society that led to their success .
There are many reasons for this .
Firstly , the ever demanding nature of trying to prove their mettle in becoming successful leave little time for the young to think about anything else .
The madness of survival has even led to break up of the previously large families into atomic families .
It has led to a mechanical or robotic state of mind where emotions , responsibilites , feelings , leisure have no place in one 's dictionary .

Secondly , as the generations have passed the sense of responsiblity and concern for others has been dwindling down .
It has become an egocentric world where everyone cares only for his well-being and his kith and kin .
Nolonger does anyone feel their duty towards the society and community that has brought them and made them what they are .

Thirdly , there are also situations were young people neither work for themselves nor for their society .
They are a different class of people who lack any moral sense of values and a purpose in life altogether .
Such people need counselling in order to get back on the track of living life purposefully .

This problem can be solved only by increasing the feeling of committment towards the society steadily since childhood .
Meeting elders , interacting with them , growing up among many children instil a sense of sharing and concern for others that will be carried on the later life .
One of the most important things of all is being able to set aside time in any situation , any circumstance to give back to their community by organising welfare projects , adopting those who are less privileged and providing for the needy are various ways of not only helping the community but also to attain a sense of completeness .
