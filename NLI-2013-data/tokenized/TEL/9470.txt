I do agree with the statement that it is very much important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts .
Let 's take a common example of a student listening to a science lecture .
It 's very much important for him to understand what is dealt about before forming an opinion on the topic .
If the lecturer just put the facts infront and ask him to byheart them it wud be of no use .
The student might forget those facts after sometime as that do not create a strong impression in mind .
But rather if he understands the ideas and the concept behind the topic there is a higher chance he can remember that for a longer time .

Another important aspect is that just learning the facts would not lead to the development of the subject .
It 's only when one gets a thourough idea of the complexities involved in that , one would get an idea of how to develop the concepts .
For example let us take a student doing his project work on developing automobile efficiency .
Unless he knows what are the factors involved in developing efficiency he cannot succeed .
It involves the student to learn the ideas and concepts behind the subject apart from learning the facts .
In most of the cases it 's proven that false understanding of a subject would lead to an irrepairable situation .
And knowing the facts without probing into them always leads to a false conclusion .

Secondly probing into the facts and understanding them also helps a student on a personal front .
In one 's daly life one may come across many complex situations , which if one considers only the facts might land oneself into trouble .
Let 's take an example of a student getting angry on his father for not providing him more pocket money .
The father would not give more money as he perhaps feel that his son is involving in illegal activities .
The student should probe why his father 's not giving him the money rather that to blame
