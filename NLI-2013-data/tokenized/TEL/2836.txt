In day to day life we see that people are growing very fast and passing their lives with good and bad things but i agree the statement that young people will enjoy their lives more than old people do .

young people are having lot of energy in them so that they can enjoy a lot more than old people .
In medical terms we can say that young people are fresh because they are having good nerves and blood and their body functions will work with full enthusiasm than old people .
If people grew older and older their body functions cannot work properly .

In my life i saw few situations regarding this .
I will describe some situations over here .
For example , in my street many people play badminton during evenings that is both young and old people .
While playing young people will play for lot of time than old people do .
Old people will easily get tried while playing because they are not having that much energy to play .
This shows that how young people enjoy life more than old people do .

From the statement we can also consider that enjoyment means what kind of enjoyment ?
It depends on situation .
But i can say that whatever the enjoyment is that young people will enjoy a lot than old people do .
Here we can can say one thing that old people are one time young people only so they know everything in their lives because they already passed over that stages and they will also feel that early age in their lives are golden days .

From the statement my conclusion is old people are one time young people only so they know that they are having lot of energy during their early stages and they can also say that they enjoyed a lot while they were young .
So i can say that young people will enjoy a lot than old people do .
