Technology is ever-changing .
A genius is born every now and then , who brings about new inventions into the limelight .
If these inventions are beneficial to mankind then they soon replace the old ones .

One such example is the mode of transport before automobiles were discovered .
People either travelled by foot or they used the help of animals like horses , donkeys etc ..
Then came the invention of the wheel after which carts were made .
These carts were driven by bulls and these bullock carts became the means of travelling .

Further , engines were invented , which led to the production of automobiles i.e. both two wheelers and four wheelers .
Currently many cars have been manufactured and are available in the market .
Every year , a new model is designed , having a better engine efficiency , greater mileage , a different size or simply a different seating arrangement .
These new versions soon become popular in the market .

Just as how we have transformed from a bullock cart to a car for our mode of transport , in the same way twenty years hence there is a possibility for the invention of something else that is novel .
But the question is - `` what next ? ! ''
.
Could it be a car which flies or could it be a locomotive which looks like a spaceship ? .
The design of this new locomotive is left to the imagination and skill of the inventor .

Since , this new invention would then become famous in the market , the demand for cars would eventually reduce .
As a result of this , fewer cars would be used twenty years hence .
