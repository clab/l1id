GETTING THE PROBLEM SOLVED BY YOUR SELF I S APPRICIATED
I take the pleasure of disagreeing with the statement because the student can understand ideas and concepts when he is taught by someone else but not by him self , when he wants to learn he has to workout by himself to learn the facts .
If he is taught by someone else he might not be that able to explain the same thing to the other person that effectively .
He might gho wroung but when he tries to explain the things which he himself had learned he can be more effective and can easily explain what he learnt .
For example :
The person cannot sit on the swmming pool and just understand the idea of swmming , he can learn swmming if and only if he himself get in to water and tries to swim .

In the same manner he ca n't just guide his fellow person to sit beside the pool and understand `` how to swim ? '' they are sometyhings that should be done by learning only , like learning bicycle , swmming , hourse riding etc ..
a person cannot sit on the poolside and measure the depth of the pool he can do this only if he jump and see the depth of the pool .

The things that lags with the concet and ideas are that they dont have the essence of doing the things practically
.
`` THE FIRST PERSON WHO CAME ON THE EARTH DO NOT HAVE ANY CONCEPT OR IDEAS '' the thing is he got the ideas only when he started doings the things .
these works gave birth to the ideas and concepts

.
I would like to discuess one thing here what i fthe scientists would not work out for the things and sit with an idea he cannot go forward and invent these lots of things for us .

Learning facts gave birth to the concepts and ideas .
If fact if the child dont know how to ride a cycle he could sit at a conner and listen to the concepty but cannot ride the cycle unless he try it out .

For emaxple a group of friend go aroung to a racing club there they found that the idea and the concept that they had is diffferent they will be shocked to see the club i fthey r lerned practically they can drive the car in the race .
here i end my topic .
