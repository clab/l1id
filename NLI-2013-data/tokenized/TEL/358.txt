No , i disagree , that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academics subjects than to specialize in one subject Specialization is highly prefered according to me because knoweledge is like a ocean .
What ever we learn will be a drop in the ocean , so it imposiible to persue in many acedamics .
The better way is to take single subject .
We can observe some sort of grip and confidence in people who specialized .
They can even go deeper and study for further research and gain name and fame in less peroid oftime .
They can also share that knowledge to younger generation in a better way because of thier high confidence levels over subject .

After finishing thier studies , it will be easier for specialised person to choose his path .
He will be prefered than others by companies because company people think that he can do work better in that paticular feild .
He get the skills of innovation , work hard , and try to concentrate on his subject .
since he is free to choose subject of intrest he will persue with zeal and eager .

He will be more clear about his future plans .
There was a saying that `` jack of all , master of none '' .this surely happen if person enters in to many academic .
the main reason people forget one if they learn another .
if a person enters in the many feilds there chance of confusion and finally end up in to mess .

researchers also conveyed that people concentrating on different subjects can not gain anything .
the more broader you go the less you will learn .
according tomy opnion it is better to master in the single subject than making all the stuff included in the brain .
by this his undrstands his aim and work to reach goals .
he will get good fame
