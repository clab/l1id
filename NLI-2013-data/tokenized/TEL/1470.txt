I did n't agree with the statement that `` It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. '' why means it was a known fact that `` Knowing every tthing about something is better than Knowing something about everything. '' and also it causes poor knowledge in the fild an individual has to be choosen for sustainment .
It will be clearly dicussed in the following lines .

Firstly , What a person needs is that the term `` Profficiency '' .
Because it would be the thing that the modern world needs .
Every field needs the people to be profficient in that field and a little or no knowledge in other fields .
Even the most famous scientists whose inventions may stick to thir feild .
So every individual needs himself to be expertise in any particular choosen field .
Moreover the former would gives him a lot of confusion towards the respective fields .

Secondly , the process of broadening causes a lot of unemployment apart from developing inadequacy in the theories pertaining to his own field .
On the other hand it gives a sort of uselessness to him in his career objectives .
Ofcourse it gives the broad knowledge to the individual , it creates a lot of disaster to his family members and also to the country .

Nextly , knowledge of many academic subjects may cause loss of individuality .
Moreover the development of any field depends upon the effective utilisation of the sources and their research in those fields .
What it means is that the person needs to show his attitude and concentration for the development of the selected subject .
Because in the era of rapid growing technology the individual may get his identity only in his specialized field .

Finally , for the overall development and for the well-being of the individual , one needs specialization in his respective field .
This gives him ability to promote his identity even in the most unfavorable situations .
