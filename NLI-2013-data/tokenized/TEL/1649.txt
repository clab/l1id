I disagree with the statement that it is better to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Today due to vast expansion of infrastructure and man power , specializing on a particular subject would lead to a positive and creative solutions .
The globalisation which is rapidly growing across the globe requires totally refined finished products unlike expecting for conventional products in the primitive times .

This statement can be clearly explained with the help of an example , lets take civilengineering into account , civil engineering is an unision of 6 areas of specialization namely foundation engineering , structural engineering , environmental engineering , construction planning and management , water resources engineering and transportation engineering .
If we try to gain a broad knowledge of all these subjects it would be difficult for an engineer or a researcher in these fields to deliver a refined design which would suit the present trend .
This is because all the fields of specialisation mentioned above are entirely different from each other .
The foundation engineering deals with foundation design , structural engineering deals with the super structure design and in this way each has its own entity , so a good engineer having a sound knowledge in any one area can excel in that field and would be able to deliver all the requirements needed in that specific field .
Taking highway engineering into consideration , its totally distinct from other fields as it deals with pavement design and harbour design .
Hence for an efficient engineer or a researcher in this field would be able to derive better designs from the knowledge he gained through this specialized field .
In the similar way an environmentalist could give proper suggestions on air , water and marine pollutions more effectively than a person having a broad knowledge in this field .
The branch of civil engineering is just an example to explain why gaining knowledge in a particular specialization is needed rather than gaining broader knowledge in all the fields .

The strong belief which is coming from our primitive ages that , its better to concentrate on one particular thing rather than putting hands in various fields in order to get positive results .
This conceptual belief proves that `` old is gold '' and is very much applicable in the present scenario as each and every individual is aiming for an accurate result in all the fields .
This belief can also be explained by a concept called `` SIX SIGMA '' , this concept is used in firms which produce goods of various kinds , the accuracy level achieved through this concept is that only one part produced is proven to be defective in 1 million parts produced .
This accuracy level is achieved through rigorous research and effort made by technologists in this particular field .

Hence I strongly believe and personally commit to the comment that having specialized in a particular subject fetch excellent and innovative results rather than gaining broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
