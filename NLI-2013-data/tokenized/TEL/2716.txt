It is stated that to agree or disagree with the statement ,, ` young people enjoy life more than older people do ' ,, definetly i would agree that younger people will enjoy more than older people do .. ,

Firstly ,, in order to support , i would give you the few facts that older people are caused with many pains and health problems , so most of the old people must be sticked to the houses or farms ,, and for maximum time , they are said to be alone with no company to share their views or feelings , for example ,, in many houses older people live alone while his/her partner is been dead and many older people today are suffering from health problems ..

Coming to younger people , they have time to spend lot of time with family friends and collegues at work stations , younger people can have most of their time spending outside with the latest outcomings of trends and they seems to be more avtive ,, For example ,, younger people face student life which creates more enjoyable moments , and many other sweat moments ,, other fact is that younger people are not affected with health problems or silly pains like older people have , youger people have chance to share more feelings from many people whom they come accross and have good time spending outside ..

It is more advantageous to the younger people that they can take advises from the older people , who are more experienced with the situations , and get rid of most of the problems which they are facing ,, with these younger people solve their problems very easily and get rid of the tensions and problems and enjoy much ...

But rather than these views , few argue that older people enjoy much as they are not responsible for any works or carry such burdens which wold basically create more tensions , they are tend to enjoy apart from physiacally but mentally ,,,, and younger people rather have more burdens and responsibilities of those situations they face ,, so with these views few people argue that younger people spend their life with all burdens and responsibilities ,,

Finally ,, i conclude that youger people enjoy much time even though they have burdens and responsibilities , reason is that only facing active interactive life , and will be having many great moments related to their achivements along with the enjoymnet they do with lot of friends ...
