i disagree with the statement `` its better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .i personally dont think that posession of broad knowledge in many subjects than specialisation in a single one .
there is a small quote which supports this `` jack of all traits is master in none '' and this is true .

firstly the knowledge of subjects other than those wihich are useful to us are almost useless. `` whats the use of knowledge of sewing clothes to an astronaut ? '' , the astronaut should study astronomical sciences , and other subjects related to it but not subjects which are no way related to it like sewing clothes .
its not a problem to an astronaut that he cant sew .

secondly in this world of unlimited knowledge its very tough to gather all the knowledge , even when you study hundreds of subjects there will always be an oceans proportion left over .
there is a quote `` known is a drop unknown is an ocean .
this accounts for those who are studying on a single subject also .
there is much to learn for even those who specialize on a single subject , then its easy to imagine how knowledge should be gathered when you are studying many subjects .

thirdly specialisation in a single subject helps in the advancement of the subject through research .
specialising on one subject helps in perfong experiments on the latest topics in the subject which leads to the invention and discoveris of new theories , hypothesis etc.this helps in the over all development of the society .

man since his birth developed to this stage only by specialising in single subject and developing it .
as there are somany people on earth each one specializing on one subject will give overa
