Here the question is about having an broad knowledge about many academic subjects we have learnt or by doing the specialization in a particular subject what we have learnt .
I consider doing specilization in a particular subject is mainly necessary .
I give some examples why it is so in below paragraphs .

I consider specilization in a particular subject is good and necessary because , in a particular acedemics we dont concentrate on all off the subjects .
We like only one of the subject .
We learn more about the subject if we do specilization in a particular subject .
It increases my intrests to learn more about the subject .
There is an saying like `` what we have learnt is like a drop in an ocean '' .
This state ment is true because , we have only learnt some amount .
There is lot of thing to learn next .
We can do research in a particular field of intrest and learn more about the subject which we can implement in the society which leads to good results .

We can also go into the researching field of our intrest and into the teaching field by showing our intrests towards our subject .
For example if we have intrests in the general chemesty subjects we must do our specilization in that and do researches and go and experiment on our universe .
If we are intrested in any of the pharmaceutical field we can do our specilization and do Phd program by discovering many drugs on a particular research .
As the present society is filled with many diseases the drug discovery plays an important role .
If we are intreasted in politics or journalism , we must do the specilization in the particular subject and must go into the politics or as an journalists , this is why because in the present societ we are lacking in educated politicians .

Finally , I conclude from my above paragaraphs that the specilization in a particular subject is necessary why because it influnces the society a lot .
As i mentioned that what we have learnt is just a drop in the ocean proves my above examples .
Finally , this is my view about doing specilization in a particular subject .
