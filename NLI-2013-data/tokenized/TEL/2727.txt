I agree that `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
I say this because of the following reasons .

1. Young ones will be having a lot of time to have fun when compared to the older ones .
The older people will be busy in work and they will not be having that much free time which the young ones get .
Even though it sounds rude it is a fact .

2. The Young ones obviously will have less responsibilities and works to do .
But the older ones will be having more responsibilities and works to do .
They have to maintain their houses .
Do their works without rests inorder to survive with the family .
Here the young ones dont feel this responsibility .
They are free they can enjoy in their own ways .
It is obvious that as age increases responsibilities increases and also the burden of work .

3. Statistics say that young ones are very energetic and enthusiastic and its obvious that there is adrenaline rush more when compared to the older ones .
But the older ones are not that energetic and not that enthusiastic just to mention not in all cases .

There are also healthier old ones who are enthuisiastiv and energetic but i mention on an average basis .

4. A older guy will be restricted mostly to office doors , research labs , industries and other organisation 's .
They spend a lot of time over there .
But coming to the young ones they enjoy leaning in school because the education is combined to entertainment to make Edutainment .
In college also the learning would be interesting makes the student to say `` WOW '' where as the older ones say `` oh no '' with the burden of work .
Again i mention many of the old ones enjoy their jobs and work they get involved .

5. Kids enjoy their times in school they play , learn with nothing to feel responsible and they are the free birds they can do what they wish in proper sense .
Teens enjoy their times in college by learning , playing sports , having chat with friends , they make love with people around them .
They have parties , club activities and many more to enjoy .
They have a lot of free time to develop their skills , involve in their subject of interest .
They are free birds .
In the case of older guys they can do this only on one condition `` If there is time '' .

Conclusion :
************** I do believe that anyone can enjoy their life at any age if and only if they have the heart to do so .
I have written in favor of young ones because i felt that it is happenning most in my society .

One should have the heart to enjoy every moment .
One should feel that LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL .
Every moment is precious .
Life is precious gift .
