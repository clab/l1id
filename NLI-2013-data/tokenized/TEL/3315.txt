Nowadays , modern man became very much busy with making money .
He has totally forgotten the morals and ethics and he has forgotten about the importance of inter relation ship between individuals .
Young people now fall under this criterion now .

Young people now are filled with ego .
They are generally egocentric , self centered who have apathy for the other issues which are taking place with out involving him .
So any problem in the community doesnt make him to think about the issue .
young people now adays are doing any work if there is any material gain in their work .

We know that from generation to generation the people have changed and the relationship between them also changed .
As , the world is devoloping lot , there is more competetion in the world .
So , the young people spend much of there time how to evolve victorious or successful in this competitive world .

Young people are generally over ambitious .
so , they fail to understand in the sociable relations and fail to be amicable or convivial .
They spent a lot of time in schools studying over the vast syllabus eating away all the time and energy .
They dont even sometimes have time to do their work properly because of the hectic work schedule .

As many of the young students prefer to be independent rather than depend on adults for money for their expanses .
so , the individualism also have an indirect impact on the young people for helping the community .
So , the people will be busy in getting money by doing part time jobs in the night or any time when they are free .
This keeps them restricted in involving themselves for the community help .

This young people some times have no time to sleep and cannot concentrate in the community help .
We cannot fully blame the young people for that .
it is the life style which changed the relations so , i think strongly that young peo [ ple should concentrarte more on community .
