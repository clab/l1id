i am not in complete congruence with the statement , i believe that in some cases it is more important to understand concepts and ideas rather than to learn facts .
because the feild of education is a vastly diverse and thus u need to bend yourself as per the reqiurements of the subject i opine that in sciences we need to understand the concepts grasp the ideas and also apply them as per the situations , science require you to not only memorise the facts buts also wants you to apply the logical conclusions of the facts or concepts learnt , so as to arrive at a best solution to a problem .
for instance in subjects such as mathematics you need to apply the concepts that you have learnt and bring out a solution for the problem , not only does maths requires this buts also , various sciences related to maths such as computer science which require you to frame programes depending on the the customers problem .
if the scientist in olden dyas were only memorizing the facts but not understanding them then the people living in this modern era would be deprived of the knowledge of gravity , electricity and many more essential concepts .
thus we need to uderstand the ideas and apply them as per the situatuion memorizing facts on the other hand is useful when we study arts and subjects like history , geology and also the other sciences such as biology and zoology , for evidence in olden days people use to caliculate which part of the day is it by looking at the sun 's position , thus to caliculate this we need the knowlegede fo from which side thus the sun rise , since sun rise in the east , people remember this fact and make conclusions about the part of the day .
thus memoization fo facts helps you while innovating a new concept that we nwwd to remember the characterist feature of the thing or object in order to derive a conclusion i would also like to bring otu a point that there is alwasys a case of forgetting things while your are memorizing facts , but there is no case of forgettin concepts or ideas once you memorize them .
thus a biased coin has two sides so does a the apprach to leaarn thing and concepts , in the climax i wolud like to say that learning facts and understnding comncepts heve here own imporatance in there respective fields .
