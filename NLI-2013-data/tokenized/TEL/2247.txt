From the intotality i would like to cite and support it to my position stating young people enjoy life more than oolder people do .
Firstly i would like to make the reliable reasons and examples to support my statement considering it from the religious view point most of the older people obviously like spent more of their time with the prayer beatings .
While most of the young people will be busy with their daily activies including with the responsibilites towards the community and society .
The above statement is also flawless when we deem with the National defense , Sports , etc. , Most of the times young people are compeled to fun and entertainment to relieve their stresses which is an involuntary action .

But despite of being supported to the statement i also found it indefensable and flaws .
If we look back to the history , ethics they were lot of heros are older people who enjoyed what they are when it is characterised to the politics etc. , might be they cant enjoy with the physical presence but they enjoy enciting the situations with their intelluctual minds .
Statistically the percentage of older people is greater in psychological studies and lot more .
If we acquire the statistics of older people and younger it would be obviously older people who enjoy a lot .
Because who does n't go through the hard phase like stresses and theraphy unlike young people and inturn they are in vague calling it as fun .

Inaddition to the statement i also does not agree with both of the statements that only young people enjoy rather than older people .
Supporting it as ` Enjoy ' term is neither inscribed with the frame of rules of dogma it depends from the state of mind and sense of time they could enjoy cause it inferres to the personlity of one self .

Finally i would conclude that the above statement is inappropriate considering the social activities and indefendable from the various directions aspect of one 's sustainability .
