I agree with the statement as facts do n't drive the concept or the idea .
i feel that concept and ideas have more importance than facts .
Without knowing how to implement a concept and how to try an idea knowing facts in not quite needed .
A person with ideas and concept can apply them when he has a problem he cant do that by knowing the facts .
The examples are discussed in detail below .

A student when given a problem in maths can solve the problem only if he understand 's idea of how to start and the concept that he has to use to solve the problem and get the required answer .
Just by knowing the facts on the problem he cannot solve the problem with ease it takes great difficulity to solve the problem without knowing the concept and having an idea of the problem , concept .
For a student to understand a subject he needs to have an idea about the subject and he needs to understand the concept of the subject first , then he can easily understand the facts .
So primary thing is to understand ideas and concepts rather than just facts .
it is the same in case of science subjects like physics and chemistry .
For doing practical knowledge a student or the resercher should understand the idea of the experiment and the concept to deal with the experiment .
Understanding ideas and concepts have a very great importance in life .

There is a need tro understand ideas and concept particularly in the educuation life .
The concepts and ideas are more important for students and reserchers to develop new things and to excel in their feilds .
So i feel that facts have very less importance even by knowing the facts about the subject it would be hard to analyze it just by facts .
The above reasons make me agree with the statement .
