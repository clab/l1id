I agree with the statement that students should understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
Understanding ideas and concepts is important for students to acquire knowledge .
Once if the Student gets idea of the concept he can easily understand the fact .

Let us take an example regaring this statement .
suppose if a student has a brief idea of politics then he can understand what is going on in the present world and presenrt country .
He can even describe how is it going on and what is wrong and right .
I state that understanding concept is the main criteria of the subject or lecture .

If a student understands a concept throughly he can score good marks and he never forgets that concept and ideas in his life time .
This is the way of student to develop in his thinking and he can easily grasp the facts going around .
Ideas and concepts plays an important role in the present education system and present world .
Suppose if a person is having nill knowledge about politics it is difficult for him to understand the facts going around .
If he dont know what is the concept of work and energy he cant understand the common day to day activities .
Let us take english if a student dont know the language and alphabets of english it is difficult for him to learn grammer and spellings .
If a person has nill knowledge about a topic he cant write an essay .

Concepts and facts are very important in all acepts .
If he just learn facts he gets half knowlege of the concept .
He can understand only a part of the theory not totally and completely .

So i conclude that ideas and concepts play important role in understanding facts . ''
As great philospher said that half knowledge is always dangerous '' .
