An Idea , which can change our life , because if have ideas we take decision for a situation .
Concepts are more about the situation , what is the situation , and how it occur .
Facts that are alreday existed or happened in the past .
It is importent to students to understand ideas and concepts , in a way that if they understand the ideas and concepts they will make a decision .
Ideas come from the past experiance where the concept is from the study of situation or subject , by holding ideas and concept we will make a good decision .

For example , if a former having a coflict , that how to develop the prodution of crafts , then he have some ideas how to develop the production , and he have some past experiance that he faced , that means he has a concept on the crafts , that which land is suitable for which crafts , and what fertilizers he has to use , so he can develop the crafts production by using better ideas .

If we learn facts to solve situation , that facts are may not suitable for the situation and it might be failed .
So , learning facts are useful , when we take support of the understanding the ideas and concepts .
we can not separate the facts , ideas and concepts .

Thus , it is more importent to study the situation , make ideas on that , and know the facts then solve the situation .
