I am agreeing with the topic that in twety years there will be fewer cars in use than there are now today , Why because for better convenience , due to less cost , to show status purpose , and needs of the humans .

Day by day the technology is growing and also at the same people also improved technologcally and these people preferring to live better convenience , those convienients are protection from rain and sunlight etc. , and also people can travel longer distances with out suffering than that of other vehicles like two wheelers and three wheellers .

Secondly the costs also shows some reflection on the usage than that of past 20 years back .
At that time people may not be able to put that much money why because at that time he resourses not available properly .
The old people thinks about money not for what they are using for travelling .
day by day cars becoming cheaper and people willing to purchase the car .

Thirdly status purpose .
Some people think that if one have a car he belongs to some higher range , Not only status purpose but also for build-up .

Finally earinings of the people incereasing day by day at the same time living cost of the people also increasing .
If some budy earns more than $ 2000 he must have acar in this tren people changed like that .
People thinking that There is no need of saving money for future , what they have they have to enjoy now it self .
thats why the number of cars increased than than of past twenty years back .

In conclusion definately the number of cars increased due to some of above reasons .
the main reason is accorind to the technology the people modernizing them self , owning the car is also one of the modernization .
So the numer of cars more than what we have twenty years back .
What ever it mat be the usage of cars incresed in these twenty years .
