I believe that , it is never good to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
You always get the best when you specialize in one specific subject .
Specializtion in one particular subject that helps you build your career will not only bring interest during the study but will also give you the satisfaction when working through it .

First let me state that generally all the subjects are vast , and studying these vast subject in which a person is not interested may lead to improper knowledge about the subject .
As an old saying saying says `` HALF KNOWLEDGE IS ALWAYS DANGEROUS '' , it would turn dangerous .
Furthurmore no person could cover all the things in all the subjects in a given academic time .
Practically , a doctor has to go through those subjects that are totally different from what a biologist go through .
A doctor has 5 years of academic time to study and master all the things about the human body and a biologist has around 3-4 years to study about all the animals .
Now if a person thinking to have a broad knowledge and knowing all the subjects in this 5 years , is it possible for the person to master either of these ?
He would neither become a perfect doctor nor a good biologist .

In general keeping academic time aside , interest of person matters a lot .
He must be focused on what he is interested .
Most of the people they will not be interested in all the sujects , say , i never liked math and programming , i always liked biology , now will a person like me , will he be interested in learning all the other sujects effectively say math ?
He will concentrate on only those subjects that yield him benefit , its like when a person goes furthur in his career would the other subjects really help him ?
Its mere waste of time , if this time is utlilized for improving his knowledge in the field he is interested , this would help him better for his career , and in career job satisfaction is always much more important than any other thing .
Let us consider a biotechnologist , his work is discovering new vaccines , relating pathology etc. , if he would have learned law during his academics would that thing really help him in any way ?
There are other people who can do that job efficiently than this person who is not at all interested in doin that job .
So for this reason too i say that having proficiency in a particular subject is always better than wasting time in learning all the unnecessary stuff and having a broad knowledge of the academic subjects .

Finally , the implications in the passage would state clearly that , it is not important for a person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but its really very good for a person to gain profieciency in one particular subject that helps him inbuilding his career and do better in his job , in all required aspects .
Its always good be a master instead of calling ourselves `` THE JACK OF ALL TRADES BUT MASTER OF NONE '' .
