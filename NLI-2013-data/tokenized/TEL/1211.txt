As a graduate , I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
Specializing in one subject gives you a chance to read the subject in depth , gives you ample opportunity to undertake research on the selected subject and will also let you focus on learning specific skills that will compliment your chosen profession .

By specializing in one subject , you can learn that subject in depth .
For example , I have done my Bachelor 's in Physical Therapy .
I have a general idea about all the specialities like orthopedics , neurology , cario-respiratory , pediatrics to name a few .
But my real interest is in Geriatrics which is just a part of a course curriculum .
it does not deal the subject in depth .
If I decide to study this subject , I will not only learn the generalities of it but also the unique features of this speciality .
Things like what kind of exercises suit better , how frequently should the sessions be administerd , what are the special things to be kept in mind during the therapy sessions and also about the psychological aspects .
So as I said it gives you an in-depth knowledge about a subject .

Secondly , you get enough time and also ample opportunity to work on a research .
When you take up a single subject , you concentration is centered on the subject .
You do n't have distractions like lots of assaignments to do , term papers to submit , multiple exams to give .
So you have lots of time in your hand to concentrate only the selected subject .
You can also do some research work , like for example , what is the effect of Ultra-sound therapy on back pain in older people .
Is it the same as in the adults ?

Finally , the skills .
You can learn new skills that will compliment your profession .
For example , I know manipulations of different types , that will help in the treatment of joint problems .
But will these manipulations help the older people .
Will they be effective on them or cause more harm .
If they are not useful , then that means that I have to learn some alternative skills that will help them better ..
This is one such example .
I may learn yoga , because it is very safe and effective .
I will learn those skills that more gentle and more effective , specifically suiting the old people .

To conclude , I can say I like to specilaize in one subject because I am a graduate .
This does not mean that studying many academic subjects is not good .
It is the best if you are an undergraduate .
You get to know the different subjects and what they deal with .
You can also decide as to which subject is more interesting to you and suits you and decide upon your carrer .
Studying many academic subjects has got its own advantages but they do n't suit my needs as I have already passed that part of my life and settled into a profession .
All I need now is to study the subject of my interst and specialize in it .
