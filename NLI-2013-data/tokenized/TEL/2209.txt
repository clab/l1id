I , agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Young children enjoy their life to a full extant .
They dont have any responsibilities on them .
They play and have fun with their friends .
They dont have any burdens and are usually stress free .
They are always with smiling faces and by looking at them any one can be relieved from their tensions .

They are always joyful , they try to entertain others through their fun filled plays .
They always are very creative and quick at imagining things .
They usually pose some questions which parents some times feel in answering .
They try to explore new things with things around them with their creative mind .

They usually like stories of commics , and stories of tales through which they can know what is good and what is bad .
They love watching cartoons because they feel them to be funny , they also learn lot from those cartoons .
Some are very much interested in games .
They play lot of fun filled games .
They can refresh their mind and also do excersice to their brain and body

If they are very good at games , they can also participate in national level games and bring honour to their school and family .
They can also participate in many cultural events that take place in school or in their neighbour hood .
By this they can entertain people .
and also entertain themselves .
They feel very happy for their small success .

But , older people because of their hectic life and too many responsibilities dont have enough time to enjoy to a full extant .
They hardly get time during weekends to enjoy with family .
They can refresh their mind only in the night after coming from their office by listening to music and by watching television .

So , yonger people enjoy life more than older peole , as they have much leisure time and are not usually burdened with too much responsibilities .
