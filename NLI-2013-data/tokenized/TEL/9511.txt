I strongly agree with the speker , yes it is more important for students to understand the main idea and concepts than it is for them to lean facts .
if the student understands the main idea and concept he can think brodly , and widely .
it may leads to research orientation .
leaning the facts is not that much important .

leaning does not improves the thinking .
understaning the concept is important , why because in the case of scientist archemedies , one day hedipped into tub to take his bath , some water poured out he got an idea for formula .
in this case he is having an concept , for that he is storming his barin , so he got an idea .
that leads to invent the great formula .
now a days we all are following that formula .
so understading the concept gives thye basic idea .

everybody leans the facts from childhood onwords , it does't require any thinking , or invention .
in this world even birds gets new ideas to protect them selves .
by seeing newspaper , telivision , redio , interacting with media one can learn facts .
its not that much great , everybody can do trhis .

But for the students to understand the subject is important , because to invent , or introduce new comodity or formula , or any thing to the market or to the world .
so idea maes an invention , but not the learning facts .
by understanding the concept only one can reach to their higher position .
Now a days great countries are ruiling the world in many ares like .
because they got new ideas US If people or not unaderstanding the ideas and concepts at present we may not be here , these much development may not happend to our world .
