According to my point of view , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Because even they do n't know the concept clearly it is not possible to solve any problem regarding topic .

Suppose we have a problem to solve , then first we have to understand the problem clearly and we have to think about ideas to solve the problem .
Then only we can solve the problem easily .
Even we know all facts about that problem , we ca n't do any thing .
For example , if student has given a puzzle to solve , then he knows all the facts about solving puzzle .
He knows all the rules in solving puzzle , without implementing any ideas he ca n't solve the problem .
The main purpose of implementation of ideas is to choose the shortest way and less time to solve that .
Here for the student not only to know the facts within the problem , he has to know the whole concept around the problem then only he would get new ideas which are to be implemented in solving the problem .
After the learning of concept about the problem we have to understand the ideas which have to be implemented insolving problem .

Not only to learn facts , definitely understanding and let them know the concepts .
The students who have learn facts , ca n't do anything without practical implementation .
we have to improve them from the learning stage in practical method in every aspects .
This practical method contains that understanding the concept clearly and thinking about the ideas to solve any thing .
Its better to prepare them mentallyt that they are in practically .
So as far as i concerncerned first thing for students is understanding the concept .
At finally i conclude it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
