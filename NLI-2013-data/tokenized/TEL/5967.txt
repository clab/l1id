Movement or rather transport is an esential part of day to day activity .
Cars are included in one of the many means of road transport .

Coming to the topic proper , i DISAGREE with the statement that there will be fewer cars in the near future to come .
There are many reasons as to why i support my decision .

Firstly , the technology is advancing in leaps and bounds .
So , in the near future , cars would be available at a cheaper rate to the commom people .
The advancing technology would also help in combating the problem of air pollution by devoloping cars that run on electricity or hydro power .
The science can also be used to produce more fuel efficient cars which would inturn help in conserving our limited natural resources .

The present world is becoming more developed and the basic attitude of a developed society is to maintain good status .
Cars indicate the status of a person financially .
Thus more and more people would be inclined to buy cars in the near future .

Coming to the most important factor , `` The safety factor '' .
Travelling in a car is far more safer than travelling on bike .
This fact has been recently prooved .

Last but not the least , when it comes to individual concerns , luxury takes the upper hand .
Cars are far more luxurios than other conventional vehicles .
For example , one would prefer to travel in a car with the AC on , rather than travelling on a bike under the scorching heat of the sun .

Ruling out some facts that cars are robust , and things like that i conclude my topic by saying authentically that there will be more cars in the near future to come .
