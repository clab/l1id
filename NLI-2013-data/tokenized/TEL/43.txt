While man is growing he learns a lot of information about how to behave , how to live , how to survive in the society , which is good and which is bad , because all are essential while growing .

In this way the education is also very important to a person .
Beginning from childhood he learnt several things .
By studying different fields of subjects he can get a variety of knowledge about different topics .
Like if he studies history he knows about past historical stories , and while learning science he have a knowledge about health and reasons for scientifical things , like that if we study different areas then we can get more knowledge related to all fields .
That is the reason childrens are studying in the school days in different subjects .

Upto high school education it gives all the basic principles presented in related subjects , while coming to higher education it is differs and confining to less subjects because we want to specialize in some particular areas which we like most .
Then if a student is interested in maths he takes that subject and studying it , and another student interested in the other subject and takes that subject as a major subject and acquires proficiency in that area .

In my opinion it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects upto graduation level .
Why because upto that level we get some idea about all basic principles behind in it .
as the studies go on as like master 's degree than it is better to take a single subject rather than taking several subjects .
That is the time to be specialize in specific subject .
Why because by studying all the subjects at that time also there is no use , if we become familier with one subject we can find new things which is very useful to us .

Finally i agree with the opinion that it is better have broad knowledge on many academic subjects upto graduation level which results in good results .
