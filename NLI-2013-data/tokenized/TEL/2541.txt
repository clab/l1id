I agree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Youth is the age where the people has fresh blood with more innovations and ideas accompanied with the easy nature to face the hurdles and make them the most joyous situations .
They enjoy the life of that short period with the everything they can afford .
The people falling under teenage are the people we see enjoy mostly leaving about all the risks and pains they are facing in their rootines of life .
They enjoy life in many ways they are gifted with for example they may go with friends to the parties and discos or for movies to get out of their busy life schedule , all these entertainments are growing rapidly with the competition of the todays world keeping in mind the youths requirements .

Young people are the people who got efficient energy to perform their talent by enjoying themselves , for example to dance this can be done only with these people and in contrast the old people cannot dance as they got no sufficient energy with them .
The people of the teenage basks with the friends and their relatives and they make the people around them feel in the seventh heaven with their scilly jokes .
They are the citizens of the country who are the most joyful persons in the country .
The people though come from different cultures and backgrounds , makes their life easy when they come to their teenage , all leaving the hurdles they are facing in their routines life .
As the lifes crucial part is the teenage the youth enjoys more when compared to the other people , they are the people who resemblances the country 's nationality and brotherhood .

Hence in apposite to the above said qualities , the young people enjoys the life more than the older one .
Thus the major crucial part of life is the teenage for every humanbeing who faces and feels not to get end0 that life .
