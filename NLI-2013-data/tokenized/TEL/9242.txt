It is necessary to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because when then cannot understands the ideas and concepts they cannot be able to learn facts .
as the facts mainly based on the different ideas that are in any sutation or anything .
mainly the ideas of any situations or anything are explained clearly first and the concept in the different ideas must be explained clearly .
as both the ideas and concept of a thing or situation is clearly understood the facts will be automatically revealed .
without understanding the ideas and concepts the facts cannot be understood .

Moveover the ideas and concepts must be clearly understood .
first we must think how facts are revealed without having an idea or knowing about situation or thing .
facts are revealed based on the ideas which it had at the situation and the cocept will explain the main things that it had .
it says that the fact present in the situation or thing is correct or not .
without knowing the ideas of the person or a thing that is discussing in a situation the facts cannot be identified .
concept is the logical thincking by taking it into view the facts are decided .

Without having any idea on the situation one cannot decide the fact in that situation .
if one knows the concept in any theory or apractical thihg or situation the facts can be decided .

The over all view about about the above eplained paragraph when there is good understanding of the idaes and concepts of athing or situation the facts can be decided .
if not there is no idea or no concept known about athing or situation the facts cannot be learned or decided .
so ideas and concepts should be understood to learn the facts .
