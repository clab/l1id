Yes , I agree with the following statement because it is more important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
It is the class that which will take the student to higher position in the future .

In support to the above words saying that words like to present an example when the student understand the ideas if he understands the class well he can only build the ideas in their own way .
If he understands the subject deeply then only he can able to express his ideas , feelings etc .
For example the student has a science background then he should concentrate on the ideas than on the facts in it because facts about the nature is inefficient it cannot be determined this was the example i described to support the statement .

The student concentrate on the cocepts this he will understand the total theme of the subject if the student is from science department then by taking concepts of small thinks he could make a fabulous think say for example by lowering the concept of sensors he could develop ideas and could automate his by itself .
The main reason for the statement is developing the habit of thinking in own way and give the ideas of his own this will be possible only for the students who understand the ideas and concepts in depth .

The conclusion is by understanding the ideas and concepts that the student will be successfull in his careerand in search of facts the student cannot acheive success in his life .
This is the reason why i should agree the statement that is more important for the student to understand the ideas and concepts .

These are some of the specific reasons and examples i mentioned in this passage to support my answer .
