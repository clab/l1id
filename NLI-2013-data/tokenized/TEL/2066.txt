Do young people enjoy life more than the older people do .
I do not agree with the given statement because , young people are very immeture to their age and can see things only in one point of view and analise things to a limited extent , in fact will not be able to enjoy anything to the fullest .

In contrast older people analise things in broader way which facilitates them to understand things better ultemately leads to more enjoyment .
for examlpe if any good novel is read by both the young and old people as older people have experienced much more things in life these experiences help them to enjoy the situations in novel better than the young people can do .

As older people have broader knowledge about the wrold around them have better understanding of the things and are able to analise things better secondly when tour is planned by the older people with their maturity in thinking they are able to arrenge the things accordingto the needs and try to take fuul enjoiment of the tour , when it comes to young people in their over enthusiasm they tend to neglect things to plan early ultimately may get into onconviences and problems on the trip .

If we take any relationships into cosideration young people lack understanding about the depth of the relations and will not be able to enjoy the relations emotional affections to the fullest .
for example in a father and son relationship the feeling of immence pleasure a father can enjoy when he spends time with his son , as he treats his son as a invaluable treasure and cherishes every action of a child where as a son may not be able to enjoy the time spent with father as a very plesant as he is not matured enough to understand the depth of the father-son relation as the father does .

thus in my opinion i regard older people can enjoy life pleasures better due to maturity of thoughts and the contribution of rich experiences of their long exposure to the world .
which younger people lacks .
