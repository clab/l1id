I agree with the statement that is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Beacause people are the persons who are not bother about the future .
Future is the only thing make a man in to struggles when we memorize it .
And also the yong people are more active than the older people .
yonger people are enjoyed by facing the day by day challenges in the school and college .
Young people will feel more happy when they achieve the target and they fell very sad when they fail .
Young people do not know how to earn money , because they dont bother about the money .
Older peoples have some limitations to do any activity in the society , because they all are experienced and thay all are already enjoyed the younger stage .
But young people can do any thing what thay want .
One famous scholer says that `` students can make the world and break the world '' .
I am very much intrested about this phrase because i am also a student .
iam also very much enjoying my younger stage .
iam studied up to tenth standard in my own village , i am toally enjoying with my friends at that time by going to school through the greenary plants on cycle .
And in the twelth standard i came to the city , here also i felt very happy by spending with friends .
In my engineering due to the age , i knowing the what happy and what sad .
Young people like me are so enjyoed theire lovely youngerness .
The older people have some responsibilities in the family .
They also enjoy the older stage by spending with the grand sons and grand daughters by sharing the affection and love .

In this way younger people are more enjoy life more than the older people .
