Yes , I would agree with the statement , because it is more important that the student should understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Because students could notnot have sufficient knowledge and exprience to go with their veiws , so they dont know what they are doing and is this is correct or wrong .
ones students get in to the that part they can know what they did is wrong , so that they can clarify this is the wrong method , they can not get in to that method again .
many students think about what they are doing is always correct , because they are in dilema which they can not get out , once they know about that thn they will choose another one .
If one concept can get in to a student mind by telling the idea of that can be dipped in to his mind practically no one can erase from his mind .
so that the facts and ideas can not get the students minds by orally they can reach them practically very effectively .

if student learn about facts ten he can visualize what they are and what they are meant for .
so we may teach them facts they do not take very effectively so that if explain real situation we can correct facts through their minds .
so the idea and concepts are meant for learn by them only iI dont say strictl ; y because the personal learning can not get the all the facts and concepts , so we may co opearate to them to learn about the realities and facts .
so that they can have bouth sides co operation so that can think about their ideas .
so by practically are orally they can get their concepts and ideas .

so that the above are the my opinion on the given statement and the main idea of mamine is they should understand ideas and concepts their own with our co operation
