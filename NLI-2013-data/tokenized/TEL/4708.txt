When a company designs or manufactures a product they need to be advertised .
Advertising is a way which helps people to know about the new product in the market .
When people come to know about the product , the sales increase .
This is the moto of the companies which are manufacturing the product : incresing their sale .
But are these companies advertising the product in the same way as it is to be ?
I do not think so .
To increase sale these companies show their product in a very appealing way so that the customers will buy them .

First , many advertisements we come accross hire a famous personality .
This is one way of getting the attention of customers about the produt .
Usually , when these famous personalites tell about the product many do not actually think about the product rather they psychologically relate themselves getting binded to the famous person .
As , his or her favourite person is shown with the product they think it is best .
Actually it might not be true .

Additionally , the advertisment uses the newer technologies to make the product more visually impressed so that the customer can buy it .
A bowl which is made up of clay can be demonstrated very artistically by placing a beautiful background and on a clean table and flowers beside it .
Even though it is a simple clay bowl , due to this demonstration people think it can give the same impression when they buy it and arrange in the same fashion .
But this might not be true because , they could have used the graphics to get the background of that advertisement .

Finally , sometimes the advertisements do not say about the diasadvantages of a product .
Usually advertisements put the good qualities in front of the coustmer .
So the customer may not be aware of the other face .
For instance when I had bought a rice cooker after seeing an advertisment ( in fact I was very impressed of how it was shown and the advantages of using that ) .
Later I realised that I had bought a bad one because it was n't convinent .
It was difficult to clean .
So somtimes the advertise do not say about the bad qualities of the product as , the reason for advertising is to improve the sale .

In conclussion , advertisements help to get to know about a new product in the market but they are usually shown to impress the customers to increase their sale .
So , people should be able to think about the disadvantages and facts about the product and make their choice .
