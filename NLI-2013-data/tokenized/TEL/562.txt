`` Knowledge is power '' is the great saying that everyone knows it .
One can be succesful if he have wide range of knowledge .
I personally feel that it is better to have knowledge of all the subjects upto high school level and at university level it is better to go for specialization in a single subject area according to the interest of the student .

If a person opt for a single subject he better understands the subject .
He may put all his effort and keen interest in a single subject .
He go deep into the subject and can play with it .
This leads to many innovations in that particular area .
For example a person like CharlesBabbage invented computer which is the popular instrument that world is using today If he had not dedicated to the physical sciences this might may not happen .
If a historian is not dedicated to humanities we might not know the past culture .
Thus opting for a single subject leads to many advantages .

There are also some benefits if people have a broader knowledge of many acadamecis but fundamentals of all subjects are enough to become a master in a paritcular area .
Lots of subjects leads to confusion and one may not adopt a complete knowledge of all subjects .

So what i think is knowledge in one particular subject is more beneficial than to have a broad knowledge in all subjects though there is a necessity of having basic knowledge of all subjects
