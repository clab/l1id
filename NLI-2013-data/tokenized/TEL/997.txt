In my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Having broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects gives us a lot of information about various topics .
This helps us to identify the area or subject in which we are interested .
For example , an individual who has knowledge in Arts , History , Economics and Sciences will have a larger scope to select his interested area of study and pursue his higher education in that domain .
But by specializing in one specific subject , the scope of selection of other interested subjects is lost .

Also , broad knowledge of various subjects gives us a larger scope for inter-disiplinary work .
Having considerable knowledge of two inter-relating topics , can help us understand the subjects much better .
For example , having knowledge of Mathematics can help a lot in studying Physics .
Modern world demands integration of more than one technology .

Also , it would improve the job oppurtunities .
As the world moves towards development , the companies which hire individuals wants them to be flexible enough to work on more than one project at a time .
Individuals who have broad knowledge of various academic subjects are helpful in this regard .
Moreover , having knowledge of more than one subject will always be helpful in job search .
Also there are certain jobs which require the knowledge of more than one subject .
For example , for an effective design of an automobile , it would be better to hire a person who have knowledge of Mechanical Engineering and also who can simulate designs on a Computer system there by reducing the manufacturing costs by a great deal .

From the above facts , I conclude that it is better to have broad knowledge of various academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
We need individuals who are multi-talented to make innovations and make society a better place to live .
