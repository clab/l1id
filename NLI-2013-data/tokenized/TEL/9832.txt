Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already kown how to do well .
This statement is absolutly perfect and i completely agree with it .
Most of the successful people try new things and take risk rather than sticking to the traditional and knows ways of doing things .
All the new things invented in this world were as outcomes of the experimentation of new things , some people try new things to satisfy their natural instinct of experimentation and after experimenting with the new things if the result is productive the person who tried it automatially gets the credit .
Here we have take an account of risk involved trying new things .

Firstly , success comes with effort and not every effort is fruitful .
The success and experimentation is also in same relation .
But people who have already tasted success are more willing to experinment and take risk because they alredy know what happens if they follows the same treditional method .
If they could suceed the expeiment they can get additional accollades .

Secondly , some people with out having sucess in the past are tend to experiment new things to satisfy their natural instincts .
They may suceed if every thing goes as planned .
All the people who are successful are not born successful , but their harwork and tried things came in there way and got success .

Thirdly , if any body tries new things he may loose all his credis this is call risk factor involved in experimenting with new things .
But if the experiment is fruitful he will get patents for his results and lots of money in return .
He can also get the satisfaction of contribution to the modern world .

Finally , success and try new things are directly related but it is not always currect , because all experiments are not fruitful .
We can say thet all the succesful people tend to try new things and get success .
If the experiment fails they may learn from the failure .
