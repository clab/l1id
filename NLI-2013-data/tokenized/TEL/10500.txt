I support that successful people try out new things and take risks than only doing what they have already know how to do well .

I believe that success , in any form gives human being a different way of thinking and doing things .
Success may be in any form i.e. , it may be in the form of money or fame or in any other form .
This gives a man to think in a different way from the usual thinking and trying out things differently .
They try to do things in a new fashion and not in the way that they have already done or in a way that they knew .
There are some characteristics developed in these successful people along with the success .
These successful people dare to take risks and work out things differently .

For an instance , theres a difference in doing the things by a very rich man when compared to a poor man .
Here , success , in the form of wealth changes the thinking of the rich man and he tries doing things in a different manner .
For example , the rich man goes to a very costly restaurant , clothes himself heavily , moves in a costly car and dines at different places .
A middle class man can do all these acts performed by a rich man , but he does not exceed his limits .
This is success in the form of wealth which makes the rich man to work out things differently .

Consider success in the form of fame .
The highly famed people does things differently when compared to the normal people .
They arrive to new ideas of working things out .
In this case , due to the fame of these successful people , they dare to take risks in any form as they are famous .
And if anything undesirable happens , they are backed by their fame .

All the people that are successful , try to work things in a different manner and are prepared to take risks rather than doing things in the manner that they already know .

Their ability of thinking that they can manage the consequences of the things workedout in a different way keeps them going on doing things in a different manner .
They are ready to take risks as they are successful and as they think , they can handle the situation and the results of workingout things differently .
