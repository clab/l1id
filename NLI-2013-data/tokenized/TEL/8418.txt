Educational institutions should train , their students in such away that they can understand ideas and concepts to bulid a better society .
I agree to the topic that , ideas and concepts should be understood than just learning them as facts .
A student should have a clear view of the fact before learning it .
Offcourse some facts like 2 + 2 = 4 need not be understood , but the student should know how to implement it .

In physics like the laws of thermodynamics should be clearly understood , inorder to know where it can be applied in real world .
For example a student should just not learn facts about gravity , but chid should also understand , what actualy it means and how is it related to nature .
The student should understand its concept , to know its importance and value .
The ideas and concepts should be clear , so that the child can think of the concepts which are related to it in a different way , through this he can develop a broaderway of thinking and hence improves imaginative skill .

The concept should be clearly understood , inorder to remember it for a long time .
If a student understand the facts then , there are lesser chances for the child to forget it .
whenever , chids sees something that is related to facts , then the child quickly analyses the fact , and will do necessary actions if required .
In subjects , which are practical like biology , then its very important for the child to understand each and every concept related to the fact , then only the child can get success in that particular feild .

So i feel that students should understand the concepts and ideas than just learning them .
For every facts the student should raise a question , to have a clear knowledge about the fact .
