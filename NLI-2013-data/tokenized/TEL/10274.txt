I agree with the given statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
Successfull people adopt a very good approach to doing things well .
They have more self-belief and confidence that their new ways of doing things will definitely be correct .
Such people believe that it is thrilling to do things in unusual ways .
They do not believe in adopting the same conventional ways of doing things right .
They find it rather boring and stereotyped to do things they already know how to do well .

They believe to take the path less travelled because they find it more challenging to explore such unknown things .
Such people are more adventurous , daring and dashing by nature .
They do not fear the chances of failing when taking up activities that involve lot of risk .

One best exaample that can be cited is of Christhopher Columbus .
He braved the rough seas to discover the continent of America otherwise we would have never known that such a continent ever existed .
He made this invaluable discovery during olden days where the methods of navigation were devoid of the advancements in technology .
All great inventions like the wheel , telephone , electricity , paper etc have been possible only because their inventors took huge risks and faced several challenges in accomplishing them .

It is said that necessity is the mother all inventions .
People who have made great inventions and discoveries had felt such a need which was combined with a burning desire to make inventions to satisfy the need .
But all this would not have been possible if such people did not have the fighting spirit to overcome all obstacles they would have encountered .
Hence successful people always believe in doing things in unconventional ways wherein they dare to face all challenges that come in their way .
