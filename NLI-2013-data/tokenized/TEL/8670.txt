`` Concepts are never change '' According to this concepts and ideas behind any material or immaterial thing never change just they modify but facts will change so in my point of view i would go with to understand the ideas and concepts are ippmortant rather than facts .

In my personal experiance , when i was in a school , taught by a techer how to operate the machine learned about the basic princilpes and concepts in operation but that time i was not used when i grow young accidentally i have to operate it but i done it , so this shows how ipmortant uderstanding concepts .

its lso imporant in moulding career of students , once they get acquiented with concepts and ideas they will never forget for example in colleges they conduct demonstrations , powerpoint presentations these are all driven by concepts and ideas facts may change in addition to this practical experiance which also comes under the category of understanding concepts if we learn on ourselves never forget .

for example in demonstrasins they they demonstrate how to use a particular thing but topic may varies like facts here the demonsttion is ubnderstanding learning facts are not always desirable in some cases , for example Galelio proved that earth resolves around the sun this is fact but according to christian thoery this shoudnt be for he was exceuted but later on years its proved the same .

so facts always change never worried about the facts we should understand the concepts and ideas
