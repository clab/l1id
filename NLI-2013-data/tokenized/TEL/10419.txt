I agree that successful people try new things and take risks than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Trying new things may involve risk but could be more beneficial from financial perspective , fame and recognition .

For example , if a person is currently working for a company as a salaried employee , he or she may draw a predetermined salary for a particular period which is a guaranteed earning .
But , someone trying something new may be at risk of losing the current job .
However , this person is inclined and determined to start up a small parts company .
He or she establishes a company with loans from banks , assistance form legal advisors , collaboration with other firms in the same or similar field .
By doing this , the person gets in contact with various people , agencies and customers through which he or she learns different things at different times from time to time .
Also , this person now provides employment to a small group initially which may eventually become a larger firm .
With the establishment in place , the person strives hard taking new risks on a continuous basis in the process of becoming a bigger firm through diferent expansions using his or her multiple contacts .
To rise to this stage , the person 's determination coupled with risks taken is an important factor .

Having not taken the risk , the person would be still working an 8 hour shift with a small paycheck With huge risk taken and conferring the growth of the firm , the person now contributes to the economy by providing employment for a larger group resulting in more tax dollars to the treasury .
With the personal finacial growth and contribution to the economy , the person is recognised for his or her hard work with instant fame and recognition .
Supporting the statement , US has a number of exmples to state starting from Sears to Bill Gates .
All the famous personalities have proved that they took tons of risk before they were recognised for what they are today .
