I agree with statement young people enjoy life more than the old people .
The young people can enjoy more than the old people due to the following reasons .

First young people have more place to explore when compared to old people .
To explore these new places young have lots of energy and enjoyment by exploring that places .
Incontrast old who might have already visited that places will less entusiasm and excitement when compared to the young people .

second , most of old people will be suffering from chronic diseases like diabates , bloodpressure , and heart related diseases so old people suffering from these disease cannot enjoy as much as young people who are more resistant to these chronic diseases .

Moreover financial problems are more for old people when compared to young people because old people will not have sufficient energy to work so they cant earn money to spend it on different amusements for enjoying thier life .
on the otherhand young people with lots of energy can work more and can earn more so that they can spend on different amusements to enjoy thier life .

so old people cannot enjoy the life as much as the young people because they have financial problems , they may be suffering from chronic diseases moreover they dont have so much energy to enjoy thier life when compared to the energetic young people .
