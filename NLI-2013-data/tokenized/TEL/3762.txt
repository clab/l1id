Young people are the creaters of the upcoming future world .
These days the time is runing fast , so the people have to run with the time to compeate with the compitative world .
So to do that , the young people these days are busy in there work .
Woking day and night to compeate with others .
That does n't mean that they are not helping their communities as a part of social wellfare .
whenever they get atime they are doing services like helping out old people , I totally disagree with the above statment because of the following resons , firstly now a days people are not finding any time to spend time with there parents , espacially old people , so it would be our responsibility to look after them when ever we get time .
it could feach them happiness that they requare in that age .

Secondly many people are sufferring from lack of blood when they met with an accident that come under road , fire accident , etc ..
or when a major operation is done to any pacient there would be nessasary of lot of blood at that time .
It would be a problem if the same group of blood is not found at that time .
To over come this problem recently there is one website oppened called `` support2friends .
com '' .
in this website people should register online prour by giving there details of where they stay ( place & blood group ) .
and people reefer to the required blood group to the desied area when they require it .
this site could be very helpfull to the people when are in need .

Thirdly young people are also coming forward to donaate there eyes to other people after they expire .
This could be the rebirth to the people who are born blind or for the people who lost there eyes in any accident .

Above all , I conclude that the young people are much ahead af there duties instead of haveing busy time with there jobs .
