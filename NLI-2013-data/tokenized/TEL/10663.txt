`` THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR HARDWORK '' this is the praise that the successful people do follow in their life .
So taking these aspects into concern , I strong agree that successful people should try out for new things in their life eventually .

Since I agree that successful people have gained enough knowledge from the society to live through , and at the same time their experience in success would definetly useful to be put up in other aspects , which is very much essential for the people of the next generation , which would pave the paths for them to enlight them in that particular fields .

These people should definetly try out for the new things by handling the risks rather than doing the things which they are familiar with , these people gain a lot of knowledge from their carrer .
If they are failed once they need to try out for that untill they succeed .
Failures are the stepping stones of success so they need to try out for new things , that would give another sought of experience which will be very encouraging for these people .

So what ever may be the project you are going to take take that project as avery worthful for you then you can be succeeded .
If the person is experienced in all the aspects of life then he can come out with flying colours .

So I would conclude by saying that successful people should try out new things rather than handling the things which he already known to him .
`` BE DARE TAKE RISKS NOTHING CAN SUBSTITUTE EXPERIENCE ''
