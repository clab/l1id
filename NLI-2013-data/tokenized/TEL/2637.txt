I agree with the given statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Young people enjoy the life as they experience the new situations coming accross them .
But on other side the older people has experienced almost every situation whether it is difficilt or easy , thrilling or disappointing .

For a young person every thing is new and challanging in this world .
young people has anxiety to do some thing different the other like and they are even stonger than a old one , so he can do many things that a old one can never think off .
A old person has already gone throudh all this situation so there is nothing to do ahead even if he wants to do some thing his physical capability does't allow him tomdo that .
But where as a young person has the required time and strength to work harder and harder to succed .
For a young person the time is very precious and so has to use each and every moment accordingly .
where as most of the old people will be suffering with any of the physical or mental problems for example visibility problems .
Young people are healthy and do have lot of anxiety to do some thing different .
A young person is in learning stage where he faces many difficulties but i thing that the important part of life .
He do lot of mistakes and he learns from it and he really enjoys it .

As the final analysis i conclude saying that young people do enjoy alot when compared to aold people .
One of the main reason i belief is that young people have more stength , anxiety and time to enjoy in what ever they do when compared to old people , who would be suffering from illness and many physical problems .
