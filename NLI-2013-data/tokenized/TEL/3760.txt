I disagree with the topic .
Young people nowadays do give enough time to helping their communities .
Even though the system is becoming more and more mechanical the helping nature of the young is not degrading .
They really show up and help when the time comes for doing that .

Consider the example of Katrina hurricane .
The hurricane left many people homeless and made many children orphans .
During that time students and other young people through out the wourld gave the helping hand .
Students have eshtablished many camps around the victimized areas to help the poeple .
Many people from foreign nations have also helped their best by donating their pocket money .

Even though many of the students are busy in their college schedule , they devote some time for social sevice .
Many students from club in there collge for helping the under privelaged kids and others .
This I am stating from my personal experienced .
I am a member of rotract club in college .
Me along with some other students have arranged a camp in college to encouraged the under privelaged kids .
We went a orphanage and brought few kids to our college and gave them training in sketching , fabric painting , clay modelling etc .
We have this program once in a semester and the members of the group work for two to three days on it .

Even the employs many of companies do have a charity trust to help the community .
These trusts or most commanly called as NGO have a lot of young members .
They are more active and enthusiastic when it comes to some adventerous job helping the piligrims who visit temples which are very difficult to reach , setting up the first aid camps in such locations etc .

The youth even though is getting busy with their daily routine , they are giving enough importance amd time to helping their communities .
Infact it is the youth which thinks less selfishly when it comes to help .
They always want to show their enthusiasm in helping others .
