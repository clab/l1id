I do agree with the statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are '' .
We all have a great infuence on all these advertising items .
There are many means of advertising like the television , newspaper , ads on roads and many more .
so , every one gets an opportinuity to see one or the other .

One example or the reason why i agree with this statement is that , once i brought a cream which says it removes all the blemishes and left over marks in just few days .
The advertisement was soo well that i was just impressed by just seeing it one time .
And it was just not more then a moisturizer , which just did nothing which it had to do , but made my skin so oily .

One more example is that once i brought a solution which says that removes all the dirt in the craks of the legs , and make them smooth , but it removes the dirt by not only removing only the dirt but also removing layes of skin .
i was just shoked and even scared of using new products from that time .

These are not only the examples but they are many more , just take the car insurance company , it says too much but never does all that it says , by saying many rules and conditions for all the instrutions it gave .
We can have one mare example like the calling card it says , which says the voice would be very much clear with so many minutes ..
and many more .
But what we get truely is thatonly the minutes to talk which are are really not worth or useful with out a clear voice .
We can take one more example like the alarms which we use for safety purposes by getting impressed by seeing the advertisements , it do works as it says , but is it taht useful as we heard from that advertisement , we need to just think of that .

There are many more like the clothes , gold , food , restaurents , fast food centers , and many more , whch are just differnt from what is said in the advertisements .
These are few of the reasons which makes me agree with the above statement .
