i agree with the statement that young people will enjoy more rather than old people because young people can move ar can go to any place and can have fun but the old people cant move as fast as the young people the old man will not have sufficient energy to move to some place but a young guy can move very fastly for example if an young planned to enjoy his wekend in resort he can move veery easily to that place without hesitation but the old people must look after so many cases he will think wether he can travel that much distance or not the and he wont be so much engertic to enjoy so if he comes also he cant enjoy look at the disco parties and pubs we can lot of young people rather than oldpeople especially in discos its the fun place for young people to enjoy a lot by dancing in this places its is not possible for lold people to enjoy by dancing because they wont have sufficient energy to dance not only that young can go for swimming and diving where they can enjoy a lot but the old people wont show interest due to lack activeness most of the old people feel to stay at home and taking rest rather than gooing out for enjoyment most of the old people will stay in home in home there wont be any enjoyment but for young people they will plan so many things with their friends to enjoy like going to pinic and tours with the friends where they can enjoy a lot the old people wont prefer for picnic if they pefer also they will get tried after reaching to the spot instead of enjoying they will take rest for young people it is start stage of life so they will be intersted in enjoyment but old people its the ending of life and they had enjoyed alot when their are young and they will look after the family so the old people will become tried at the end of his life so when they were old they will show interest in taking rest rather than enoying for young there are lot of sources to enjoy while compared to the old people so bsaed upon the above points i finally conclude that young people can enjoy more than the older people do
