Yes young people enjoy life mare than older people do because the people in their younger age are capable of everything what they want to do .
The people in the younger age are very active and do what ever they want .
The main thing is that the older people are responsible persons and also support the young people .

The people in the young age are morvolous and they try to intend their knowledge to the high stages .
One thing they enjoy the life so much because the younger age comes only once in a life time so , the people are very very instrinstic .
The older people also want to enjoy their lifes but they can not enjoy their lifes due to some problems like health and some other problems .
For exampe the persons who are hard working their children of younger age are enjoying the life .
But they are not telling them any responsibilities because the age in the people of younger are enjoyable .
The people of younger age are enjoing as they go their favourite places with their friends and enjoy seeing movies playing games and etc .
Where vas older people are not able to do these all as the younger ones dobesause of their age is their main problemdue to some responsibilities .
The people of younger ones enjoy more where as older ones have responsibilities .
The people of younger ones do their work own but the older ones need some one to do their work .
As the the younger ones are active to do their works .
The younger ones also have responsibilities but they take it easy of it as they want to take care of their responsibilities after sonm time .
I agree with this statement because older people can not able to enjoy their life as their age is high and they have many health problems about themselves .
They have to take care of their family and make their family members a responsible person in the community .
The younger people have no responsibilities they enjoy their life as they like and do what they want .
that is why younger people enjoy life more than older people .
