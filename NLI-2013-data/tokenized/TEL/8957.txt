Now a days the ways of gaining knowledge changed verymuch for the students .
Some will prefer to learn by understanding the ideas and concepts .
Some will prefer to learn by facing the facts .
It 's depend upon the age of the students also .
If I were asked I 'll definitely prefer the idea of learning facts .
The reasons for this is , it can last for a long time .
It will be useful to the student in the future field of work .
The students have very less chance to commit the mistakes also .

Learnig the facts makes the students to think practically and also allowed them to think independently .
Now a days if we take any eductaion system it is going on the wrong track in some countries .
The school and colleges are not giving much chances to the students to think practically .
They encourage the spoonfeeding .
Even for the small thing also he need to depend on the their teachers .
Because of competition they forced the students to understand the concepts and ideas .
If a student learn the concept by facing it or experiencing it it will be last very long time in his mind .

Learnig the facts also make students to be very efficent in the future field of work .
Here the students can easily implement whatever he learnt in the student days .
He can distinguish among many people .
Here his job will be very easy to him .
Another thing is that students have very small chances to commit any mistakes .
Because he learned by his own experience he wo n't commit any mistakes .

From the above cited points I conclude that the students who learned by understanding the facts will definitely efficient than the others .
However it may be time taking proces for a studnet to learn by facing the facts I 'll definitely prefer the concept of learning by facing facts .
