I disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
there are several reasons and examples which i would like to cite in support to my position , which can be enlisted as follows .

The young people i.e the group of people between the age groups of eighteen and twenty-five who are mostly graduates and under graduates will have lot of work to be done in the university in terms of assignments , mid term exams , publishing research paper , submitting a thesis at a college or university , etc and it would be unfair on the community people to help them in the social work .
All the young people who are studying at university may not be rich enough to pay their semester fees and those will have to pay the fees by working at part time jobs such as cafetaria , assistantship , etc .

and the most important to say is it is not the unwillingness of the young people to help community that is stopping them to help communitybut it is the time and livelihood factors which influence their attitude towards their community .

Secondly , the community in which the young people live is also an important factor .
If it is a community with diverse religions with frequent quarrels between the religions of the community then it is very difficult to get together the youngsters of the community to work for a single cause that is to work for a single community .
an example of this type of community is any city in countries like india , iran , iraq , etc .

Thirdly , the help the community need also is an important factor i.e the type of help the community needs from the youngsters if the help is small there no need for all the young people to look after it and instead my best opinion wuould be to take the advise of some several senior wiser men of that community instaed of catching hold of young people yo get help .

To sum up , the assertion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is wrong and in my opinion all the problems ( small ) must be looked after by the community head .
