The view presented in the above statement is about the impact of the advertisement on making the products look better than they reallly are .
In the present day scenario where there is a heavy competition among the various manufactures to increase sales of thier product .
The manufacturers have resorted to investing money and time on advertising of thier products beyond thier real value .
I agree with the above statement .

First , the customer is very important to any industry and to attract a customer the manufactures have come up with various ways of advertising thier products using the television , radio and news paper and these has resulted in the advertising industry that solely relies on the manufactures resources and they are not interested to know wether the manufacture is manifucaturing a good product or not .
The advertisers employ the famous movie stars and other imoprtant personalities in the society who are lured by the money and either knowingly or unknowingly they take part in the advertsement that builds the image for the product beyond its market or face value .

Second , there are various examples that show how some advertisers have gone great lengths to increase the sales of the products even with out fully knowing the good and bad effects of using that product .
This happened in india , and in this situation one of the leading movie actor has participated in the advertisement for a manufacturing company that sells the cars and and the people who believed in the adveritesemnt have bought many cars and later on it has been realised that even though the car uses the 800cc engine in its car , it advertises that as a 1000cc car , another example is that of a soap company where it has been advertised as the best soap and after the lab results it has been found that the soap has some harmful chemicals .

Eventhough the advertisement has its own drawbacks , it is a known fact that the advertisement is a powerful tool in the present day world and it has been a accepted fact that advertisement is a necessary tool to even sell a good product .

Advertisement must be used for the better pupose of the society by advertising the true nature of the products that the manufactures manufature , so that the customer will have a better information , so as to choose the better product from a wide range of products .
