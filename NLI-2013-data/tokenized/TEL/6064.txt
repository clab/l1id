The statement in contention is , `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' . i partially agree with the statement .
the reason for my partial agreement being , the nature of the topic that is reasonably hard to predict and open for many alternatives .

Firstly , let us consider the condition where we are now .
assuming the present conditions prevail in the next twenty years , i think we might have a decline in the usage of cars .
this may be attributed to the condition of scarcity of oil reserves and which in turn result in the increase of gas prices all around the world .
which makes it uneconomical to maintain a car .
considering these conditions the chances that a common man may use his car for general purposes may come down significantly .

Secondly , considering the case , where ultra modren subways and metropolitian transits in the urban areas make way for fast , efficient and convinent transport .
the citizens may consider these means economical as well as less strenous than driving their own vehicles to work .
in this probable case , there is a possibility of the reduced usage of cars .

Thirdly , if substantial progress is made in the field of alternate renewable energy sources and hybrid vehicles , which solve the problems due to pollution and the problem of rising fuel prices , then there is a probable chance that ther might be a significant increase in the usage of cars .
and also in the case , where different means of harvesting the energy to drive the cars are developed by some of the technical breakthroughs , it is very much possible that the usage of cars may increase significantly .

To sum up , it is very much possible that the usage of cars in the next twenty years may be reduced if the existing conditions prevail .
even it is also hard to predict for sure that there wo n't be any technical breakthroughs which will help manufacture cars which are efficient enough to make them economic enough .
