I agree to the statement `` Young people enjoy more life than older people do '' .
Even many older people would like to say , i have done this when i was of young age .
This statement clearly states that even older people agree to this statement .

The time when the young people leave their childhood , they got a lot of energies in them which they would definitely try to utilize , unlike in the older age where they cant even have enough energy to walk around .
It is only in the young age , the people can do whatever they want , like for example go to gym , playing sports with much ease .
If these are also the interests of older pleple then they could have done it in their young age only .

Since the young person has something called the young blood flowing in his body he/she will be affected by less diseases because in that age the immunity is at its greatest level , also any injuries they suffer thay have the capability to recover quickly .

Some young people actually take disadvantage of their age and endure themselves in disorderly pleasures like boozing , combating with others if necessary or even enjoy having sex which the older ones may not enjoy .
In case they booze , they cant take in more drinks .

But apart from those unruly pleasures there also diferrent form of pleasures which can be enjoyed in the young age only .
They include travelling long distances , playing sports , working in offices which gives them pleasure and also satisfaction .

Finally i can say that all sorts of people enjoy theis life in some or other way but it is only at young age you wnjoy the most .
This many of them realize in old age only afer having lost their valube time ..
