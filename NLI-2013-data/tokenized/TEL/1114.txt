I disagree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one .
All of us have heard of the quote `` Jack of all trades , Master of none '' .
I think I would like to be the master of atleast one subject .

I believe that unless one has detailed or specialized information regarding a subject , it is difficult to speak challengingly on that subject .
To quote myself as an example , I have a broad knowledge of seven languages .
I speak English at college , Telugu at home which an Indian regional language and have learnt a smattering of French , German , Hindi ( India 's national language ) , Spanish and Italian .
But , I am handicapped when I have to converse in atleast five of the seven languages I learnt which does n't serve the purpose of learning .

I also believe that specialization is required in most fields .
Some of those fields being engineering , medicine and law .
When you have a toothache , you would visit a dentist rather than a general practicioner .
A similar logic would drive you to a cardiologist when you have a heart attack and to an opthamologist when one has a problem with one 's eyes .
Hence , it can be seen that in the above cases , a person with broad knowledge of the ailments would serve no purpose as one requires specialists .

Another area where I want to illustrate the use of specialists is engineering .
Civil engineers are required for building bridges and computer engineers are required to work on computers .
A non-specialized engineer would simply do a bad job or a blotched job .
We could also consider the field of law as an example .
We approach criminal lawyers for fighting our cases in case of crimes such as murder , extortion or kidnapping but we would approach a consumer court lawyer for problems such as adulterated food .
Thus , we infact need specialists all the time and in all walks of life !

Another advantage of being a specialist is that people look up to your opinions much more than if you were un-specialized .
We would much rather believe a person who has obtained his doctor of philosophy degree in a particular subject rather than an undergraduate student .
Hence , i believe a broad knowlegde of several subjects does n't really serve many purposes .
Infact , it might even be dangerous .
Have n't we all heard of the saying `` Half-knowledge is dangerous '' ??
An intern might suggest a wrong course of treatment to a patient which could have a fatal affect .
Such affects are not limited to medicine alone .
Thus , i believe in specialization and aim for that kind of approach in all my endeavours .
