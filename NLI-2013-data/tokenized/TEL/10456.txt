As we know that `` Try and try until you suceed '' a popular thesis .
I think maximum number of successful people will follow the thesis .
Trying to get new things will increase the ability and capabilty of the person rather than sitting doing things the same things that he has done earlier .
there is nothing wrong in doing experiment in inventing new things .

I personally belive in trying new things rather then only doing things what they have already known how to do well because trying nwe things increases our mental abilities and thoughts .
Even the things may go wrong in between even though we have to try for that without depression .
there are many advantages while doing new things we may undergo different circumstences that make us feel exciting .
This may also increase the skills of a person in thinking ability .

Another important thing that i strongly belive in trying is , even though we achieve it or not but we feel satisfactory with that work we have done .
It gives lot of pleasure which make our mind comfotabale .
For instance when iam in my school i have prepared a article for school expo which i have struggled hard for nearly 3 months to get it then it has been a great succeess for that expo and the happiness i got in trying for new thing gave me pleasure for atmost one yearand i continues to try for another article which is very tough to find its solution even though i struggled finally i achieved .

Even there are many reasons going for risks and getting new ones is that even the goverment will look after the projects that are newly done .
Even we get rewards and awards which will give a peculiar imortanceto a person in a societyto those who acheive new things .
The reward we get from the government may also be helpful in the next project that a person is trying .

These are the reasons to agree with the statement that `` sucsessful people try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
