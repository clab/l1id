I strongly disagree with the statement that young people are not having time to help their communities .
We can see many concerts coming up that are managed or coducted by young people for a great cause like below .
They strive hard to help by rasing funds .
For example , take our community we have all together three clubs for helping them ; home for the aged , home for the blind , and orphanage .
These clubs are found by all young people with the help of local authorities around our community .

Firstly , home for the aged was found in May 21 , 2003 .
In this we have 34 club members who not only help the activies of daily living for the aged , but also work partime to help them financially .
They also help them by giving moral support which they are not getting for their children by listening to their agony .

Secondly , home for the blind was found in December 1 , 2004 .
This is a very talented club filled with teachers and musicians .
In this club , we have all together 25 members who help them in many ways .
They teach the blind how to read their notes and help them in palying musical instruments .
They not only help them educating but make them feel the nature by explaning through their eyes .

Thirdly , home for orphans .
This is also a very smart and talented club .
It has around 18 members .
These people go on streets and search for orphans who are child labors , sleep on pavements , railways , bus stands , etc .
They help them to get admitted in some school by recommedations for the local authorities .
They not onlyh do this they educate by helping them in their homeworks .
In our community , we are going to start a new foundation soon .

They do not do this as a pass time or pleasure .
They do with real concern .
If they are not concerned about this , I do not think there is a need for them to do part time jobs , conducting concerts , take help from the local leaders to get charity , etc .
This example shows how young people are spending their time to help the society and spreading awarness to others .
