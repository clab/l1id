The topic at hand states that successful people do not sit back doing the same thins they have achieved , but move ahead by doings newer things .
this topic is very important because it tells the what real successful man is .
I agree that sucessful people try new things .

The first reason is that a successful man knows the essence of success .
he knows how much hard work is required to be a fruitful person .
so this aspect of effort motivates him to steer ahead for reaching new heights .
for example if we consider the success achieved by a gold medalist in the olympics , he will not sit back , but he will always try to perform with much hardwork the year that follows .

Additionalll , the success that the person has ahcieved gives him immense amount of self confidence which is pretty essential for doing any sort of work .
the confidence so established will help him to experiment new things and help him to plunge ahead .
consider the same example as a gold medal winner in olympics .
the gold medal he achived would give him confidence to try for breaking a world record , one that is established by others or improving on the one that he himself eatablished .
so a successful man experiments and waits for the output .

Finally , a successful man will have enough amount of patience to take new risks .
an unsuccessful man may not have that same passion and patience as that of a successful man. now again consider the olympic gold medalist .
if he misses an opportunity of breaking a new world record , he will be surely waiting with ardor for another opportunity .
the moment he arrives on that he will try not to miss on that this time .
consequentially a successful man will always try newer things and dares to achieve a new success
