Community development is one thing that the young people normally assosiate themselves with these days .
By saying this statement i tend to disagree with the notion that young people dont give enough time for their communities .

All the young people of todays world are very well educated and well versed with all the happenings in todays world .
They spare a lot of time for the upliftment of their communities whether it be a religional community or a regional one .
I t does make a huge amount of difference for them what it might be , they normally belive in the concept of returning the favours the community has given them .
This I totally believe in .

One thing i would like to mention here is `` Returning to the Roots '' .
This is something which we keep hearing all round these days , how would this notion be so excessively used if young people would not have spared time for their respective communities .

There are a lot of people who pursue their education abroad , work their for a couple of years and then come back to their natives and help or serve their community .

How many industralists have we seen who have studied in the finest colleges of the world and have come back and started their own industries in their natives .
Another thing which comes to mind is that people who haved a certain postion in their lives have come back to their roots and worked for the upliftment of their community .
The best example i would like to give is of Martin Luther King though a long time ago , worked for the upliftment of his community after attaining a substantial position in his life .
His credentials speak for himself and such is his aura that people of his community still treat him as a demi-god .

Mr.J.R.D
Tata , one of the most renowned people in the field of Aviation was educated in one of the best universties of the world but he came back to India and served his people by building industries in his native place .
There are many examples of people who have come back and served their community .

There are various multi national companies who extensively indulge in helping people of certain communities .
I am sure that there would be a large number of young people involved in such kind of noble deeds .

One more thing i would like to state is that most of the ministers who have been elected as representatives of their communties , would mostly help out their kinsman and their communities first rather than thinking about others .
I guess most of the ministers these days are well educated youngsters who have a zeal to work for their communities .

Returning to the Roots which was mentioned previously , explains the plight of the indutrialists who more often than not concentrate on setting up an industry in their native place thereby providng job oppurtunities to people of his community .

I therefore strongly disagree to the view that Youngsters do not give enough time to their communties and i believe and hope that most of the youngsters would support my view by supporting their respective communities .
