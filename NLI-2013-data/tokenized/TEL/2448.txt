I would agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than old people do .
I believe that younger people are usually less burdened with the hardships and stress of life , that come at a later stage .
Also , younger people have an attitude to not take things too seriously and so , they tend to enjoy life in more situations .
Further , older people usually lose out the patience to enjoy and experience adventures and fun in life like the way youngsters do .

When we take the example of an old man , who becomes weak due to age , its very obvoius that he does not have the stamina to enjoy any adventures in life .
Also , he would tend to become more subdued and mellow .
In drast contrast , a youngster is usually filled up lot of energy and enthusiasm to take on new tasks , adventures , visit interesting places and so on .
Also , younger people tend to hang out a lot with friends and share lot of fun moments together .

For example , if a young couple were to make a pleasure trip , and an old couple comes along too , it is highly possible that their views and sense of fun would n't match .
The older couple will usually prefer to stay indoors even while on tours , whereas the younger couple , I believe , will explore the place , in and out .

I remember an incident when I had to go out on a tour alone , and I asked my grand mother to accompany me .
She just did not want to go with me .
She said she would get exhausted and does n't take interest in travelling anymore .
When I asked the same to a friend of mine , she immediately obliged !
This shows the clear contrast between the views of an old person and a young one .

I believe that we all usually get a matured and proper understanding of life only after facing some serious troubles .
This kind of a view develops over time , and can not be seen among the youngsters .
Youth therefore symbolizes more of energy , idealism , innocence , etc .

Adding to all the above mentioned reasons , I feel that maybe biologically also , younger people have higher levels of adrenalin , which expels higher levels of energy .
This can further explain why youngsters tend to enjoy life more than their older counterparts do .
However , I admit that the same youth will eventually turn out more matured and get more serious about things , and fall in the categoty of old people .
