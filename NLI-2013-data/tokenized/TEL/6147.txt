I disagree with the statement , `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
The following points mentioned below supports my argument that , number of cars will increase in twenty years .

One of the most important thing that contritubuted to the drastic increase in the number of cars is there easy availability in the market .
Fourty years ago in India , only two types cars were available , namelly , Ambassdor and Premeier Padmini .
One has to place and order to buy a car and used to get the car delivered six months later the order was placed .
There was a monopoly existing in the market at that time and and it existed till late 1980's in India .
Once the phenomena Globalisation has been started , it made possible for the customer to have several options when buying a car and has enabled many people were able to buy cars .

The ever increasing banking sector also contributed to the increase in the number of cars since last ten years .
Getting finance from a bank to buy a car is lot easy now than it was some ten years ago .
In a recent survey conducted in Hyderabad , the capital city of State of Andhra Pradesh in India , it was observed the number of cars were increased by 20 % compared to the previous year .
A mojority of people who bought new cars that year had availed finance from banks .
This point corroborates that availability of easy finance to buy cars will help increasing the nubmer of cars being used .

Off late , the booming IT Sector had fetched many people well paid jobs .
Many of these employed people have been purchasing cars .
This factor also contributed the rise in the number of car users .
This has happened in the last ten years and seems to grow more strongly in the coming years with the ever expanding IT industry .

One more thing which also influences the number of cars being purchased is their ever decreasing price as a result of the price war between several manufacturers in the market .
Now in the present scenario , lot of options are available for the customer at a relatively low price compared to earlier .
Which is driving more people to buy cars for their use .

All the points mentioned above had happened over the past ten years and there are no reasons for that trend to go the other way .
I think I am well placed to conclude that number of cars in use will increase in the coming years rather than decreasing .
