The idea in question is that whether young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities or not .
I personally feel that the statement is valid and absolutely true .
The benevolence and the kind of caring that young people posses have dwindled down the years .

Firstly , Young people are faced with stiff competition from their peers nowadays than they previously faced .
This requires them to work very hard in order to earn a decent job and to even have a dignified life .
Young people of late , being over burdened , are obsessed with their own lives and the adage ` the survival of the fittest ' is becoming more and more appropriate and hence they have very little time to devote to the society .
The community matters are clearly second preference subjects for them .

Secondly , set aside the young people , the ethical and moral values and feelings of attachment with society have reduced over the years in all people both young and old .
Today , we boast of internet facilites and other advances of technology that help us to easily keep in touch with a large number of people but we are hardly bothered about the person who lives the next door !
All segments of the society , whether young or old , have become more egotistic and insouciant to the needs of their community .
And hence young people have naturally followed this trend of being indifferent .

Lastly , the communities nowadays are many times larger than the communities that had existed previously .
In older communities , every member of the community knew every other member and they coexisted like the members of the same family .
But in modern times , small communities are replaced by gigantic metros and cosmos where millions of people dwell and hence the community , which is typically a small congregation of people with shared interests , is displaced by huge groups of people that can no longer be logically called communities !
People have diverse interests and thus there is a drastic decrease in their interdependancy and the need to co-operate .
Thus , young people who are a subset of the these people have become naturally inconsiderate about the needs of their communities .

To sum up , I feel that the statement ` young people nowadays do not pay any heed to their communities ' is indubitably true .
Young people in the modern times have become narcissitic and more selfish .
They put themselves first and are more concerned about personal gains rather that progress of the community as a whole .
