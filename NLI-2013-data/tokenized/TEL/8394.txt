A person with good ideas should not be c its very difficult so survive in this world one has to follow the facts one has to '' live an let live '' it is said that `` One cannot change the facts '' .its very important for a person to know that to survive in this world one has to maintain thier relationship an for which their are some rules an regulation to be followed .

If a student want 's to come up in his or her furture they have to maintain some some ideal ideas and concepts .
like they have to maintain some displain in their life to built their career .

As their is change from a person to person .
they ideas of the person also differs .
to acheive a goal in their life their are many differents ways .
so every one cannot go in the same way they may follow different path .
some may say that some are very intelligent an while some others say that some are hard working ..
so but according it differes .
students believe that `` Hard work never goes in vain '' ..

But some of them believe in their luck and the time .
so for reaching a perticular goal one has to agree the facts that hard works is important in life .
if the students put their ideas in proper concepts they can get into their aim easily for which they have to believe in them an the facts that '' where their is will their is way '' an they should `` never ever give up in their life '' therfore i agree to the statement that if the students belive in the facts an put their ideas in practice they can really come up their respective course .
so
