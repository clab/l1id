In the present generation we are aware of learning so many new things .
so i think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
there are several reasons to explain the statement .

For example , if you learning a computer language skill say like ` c ' language .
the tutor will say about all the contents such as pointers , strings , arrays and so on is this mean that you are a proffesional in ` c ' language .
No , not at all it needs lot of practice rather than knowing the facts .
with out generating ideas we can do nothing with the language eventhough , by knowing the facts

Another example is , if you take an experiment in the chemistry lab eventhough , if you know the facts about the chemicals that how they will change their colour it will not be helpfull in answering the questions in the practical exams .
therefore you should know the concept behind the chemical reactions then only you can answer the questions

Finally , in some competative exams they will ask the reason for why you are choosing certain answer ?
so it can be done only the student who is perfect in the concepts rather than knowing the facts

So , the above all points will conclude that ideas and concepts are more important than to learn the facts .
moreover , by learning the concepts it will be more fetching to the student in several aspects .
in some cases it plays a major role in students career
