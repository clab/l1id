`` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , I agree with this statement because young people are more enthusiastic than the older people .
As it is the time for the young people to enjoy they should rock their life , cant find time to enjoy when they are old .

The older people hardly find time to enjoy as they are busy with their work , thus young people enjoy their life .
For example consider young people they have lot of time to enjoy with their cousins and friends , but older people meet with thier cousins when they attend party .
Thus Young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Young people , while they are busy with their academics , still find time to enjoy i.e in holidays .
Young people get holidays after their completion of course ( i.e one or two months ) .
But older people do not get much holidays to enjoy , if they for a leave they get only few day i.e hardly one week .
For example , young people enjoys a lot on their holidays by going to movies , rocking with friends , attending parties and going tour in their vacation , but older cant do this as they dont find time .
Thus young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Hence considering the above points we can say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Thus young people find more time to enjoy their life than older people .
So , young people should enjoy their life to maximum extent as they can not enjoy when they are old .
