Knowledge has no limit , infact it depends on the person what he really wanna know or learn indetail to what it will be helpfull to him or is required for him .
Well , personally i feel its important to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but when i give deeper thuought i stick to having to be specialized in one specific subject .
because it needs greater effort and u need to sacrife all other needs to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Firstly , every person needs some formal education to great extent .
Later it depends on individual interests , in which subject he is really interested and wanna persue his or her specialization .
That specialization in one particular subject is the one which is gonna fetch u a good job , name in soceity , and finally reach pinnacle in that subject .
Onthe other hand it requires a lot of money to persue knowledge .
For example , to do medicine will cost u a lot of amount and great effort in present day situations where the number of seats available is less and a lot of reservation polices .

Secondly , you need to dedicate our whole life or a major part of it to acquire broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
when u think in practical terms its almost impossible to do u r specilization in both engineering and medicine .
at the same you will be missing all the joy in life spending your life learning all the time .
as everyone knows , theres no limit for knowledge .
being a human being you need to dedicate time to your family too , which is part of your life .

To conclude , knowledge is every important for every one , at the same one should know to what extent or what excatly they want to know or helpfull to lead a decent life .
Gaining knowledge can be hobby after certain extent , but cant be the only part of life .
so , i prefer to have deeper knowledge in particular subject i am interested in .
