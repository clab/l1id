I agree with this statement `` In twenty years ther will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
This might be due to increase in population , high traffic and hike in fuel costs .

In current scenario , petrolium products costs are increasing rapidly .
By comparing costs of the same for past 5 years , rates are increased almost double .
This will influence more than any other factor to people to opt for other means of transpotation .

And some people might get think of frequent traffic jams during peak office timings , and find other means of transportation .
From my practical experience i can strongly say that this is very serious problem to think off as I got late to my office , mainly for inportant presentations .

Other factor which we ca n't avoid is increasing in population and roads 'll get conjusted .
This case it will be difficult to find a place to construct new roads in main traffic areas .
Even it ll be little difficult to government to displace the people , who lived nearby main roads to some other place in case of widening of roads .

From other positive side , since all metro cities are opting for MTS ( mass transportation system ) , people can easily change their means of transportation andcan avoid having cars .
And other way to forget cars is by staying in a walkable distance to their working places and other important activity places .

As a conclusion by considering all the mentioned difficulties in current trafic problems and advantegaes in mentiond solutions to avoid traffic , cars may get reduce in next 20 yrs .
