It would not be correct to state that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today .
Car has always been the most widely used mode of transportation while compared to the occasional air , water and rail transport .
The availability of cheaper and eco-friendly fuel , expansion and developement of infra-structure , car 's advantages over public transport , availability of cheaper and better cars in the market strengthen this claim .

Price of fuel , which seems to increase minute by minute , seems to be a valid reason that could stop the increase in the number of cars in the near future .
But extensive research being conducted and other cheap and eco-friendly sources of fuel making their debut into the market suggest that the use of cars will get cheaper and better showing how much more car facilitates the way people commute .

Every city , town and villiage in today 's world are urbanizing and the infra-structure expanding which suggests that there are more facilities vailable to a person at large .
The necessities in the life of a person such as medical care , vacation trips , shopping - to name only a few - are more easily accessible by car .
This along with tomorrow 's cheaper and environment friendly fuel forms a sound practical reason for an individual to use car .

One method of transport that would reduce the rate at which the number of cars increase is the public transport .
Time in today 's world is money .
Everybody seem to want to reach their destinations at the earliest possible time .
With a view on the developement of road ways in the form of broader roads , better connectivity between places , the number of cars , mostly the easiest way of transportaion , can only increase .

There are many car manufacturers and the competitive nature of the car market is extremly high .
This suggests that there will be cheaper , more efficient cars available in the market at the near future .
Thus with this wide array of choice to the buyer , a car , is most definitely the most widely used form of transport and would likely remain so .

Hence car is likely to remain most widely used mode of transportation while compared to other modes of transport .
The availability eco-friendly fuel will improve the current state of our environment .
A car would increase accessibility of everyday requirement and otherthus will increase in number in the next twenty years .
