To specialize in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Firstly i would like to quote a saying `` Half knowledge is dangerous '' .
This explains that having a broad or not perfect knowledge is dangerous than having no knowledge .
We should have broad knowledge of academic subjects only upto a certain stage of education and then a specialized subject .

Secondly consider a person who is planning for his future .
He wants to join in any one of the higher studies through one of these-IIT , AIEEE , EAMCET , BITS .
Having an specialized idea of one will make him get succeeded getting admission in to higher studies .
Stepping him into all ways make lead him not being succeeded in any one atleast .

Next let me state an example .
Consider a person who wants to have a broad knowledge of civil engineering .
He gos through roughly having an idea how houses are constructed , how soil below accounts to the structure , what are requiremenys of house ( like electrical works , sewage distribution , pipeline connection etc .. ) .
He needs the assistance of each and every person specialized in each of these feilds to take an appropriate defination which which suits all the factors .
Rather if he is specialized in one of these he could completely take chance over that .

So , I believe having specialized knowledge of one subject and being perfect in that is advantageous .
One can completely relie on themselves and even defend others while they are misleaded .
Having a broad idea one should always consult others for more details regarding that topic .
The idea of being specialized also helps a person to improve his self confidence because he can perfectly deal effectively .
the state of feeling that `` I can do this '' incorporates a lot self confidence in a person .
The knowledge of specialized subject will also make a person mentally strong .

At last i conclude by saying that it is better to specialize in one subject rather having broad knowledge of all the academic subjects .
