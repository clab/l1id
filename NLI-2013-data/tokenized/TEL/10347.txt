I agree wit hat point tha l people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they aalready know .
If the person is successful them will take oppurtunity and take risk to do some thing new or to create something new .
scuh that it will increase his abilty and it will gain him self confidence .
if he is sucessful he will gain the prestige from other people and his name will incerese and will reach his achievement easily .
so importantly the abilty to take risk wil help him to succed in his achievemnt .

so he will be able to make his own ideas to create new tings exist in his work .
and he will able to create the things masterly and perfectly such that it will help in many ways such that his ability to handle the things which are newer to him will be be solved in profically manner or new preventoins can be handed easily .
so it will increase his abilty to do work .
and most impotantly he will gain self prestige , name , fame , etc. so this will change his whole life .
and dramatically he will reach new heights in his life .
so where as in knowing the work you know will not increase his abilty but remian same for that period and will not increrase his abilty to master the things and he will remain same what he was and he will not gain fame and publicity for doing the job .
and his creativity will be less and he dos'nt have capacity to take risk which will lead him end or not succesful at he end .
And in these he wil be able to gain the self prestige for doing that job .
so this will take him for failure in his life .
so we have to try new things and should be capeble of taking challenges in life .
so it will take him to the way of success .
so more important he will increse his knowledge .
and gain self respect and more importantly he will gain fame , prestige , money in our life .
