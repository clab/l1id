I agree with the statement that `` It 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
Basically many people do not know the facts of certain reason or somthing else .
They agree with the facts only when some others have strong reason to prove it .
But if they are familiar with the concepts and ideas they can think of the and they can decide of it whether it is correct or wrong .

Consider the following example to prove my statement .
In the earlier days when technology was not in the advanced state many people thought earth to be a flat surface and they followed it for a long time .
But later on when a scientist discovered that earth was in spherical in shape the whole world was against him .
He tried to prove it by certain laws and principles .
But the people in those days were not able to understand his ideas and concepts .
So , they argued with him and did not agree with his statement .
Later on when people began to understand his ideas and concepts agreed with him .

Another example is consider the subjects like mathematics or physics .
If the student does not know the concept of the subject or does n't have an idea in it , he will not be to understand anything in it .

suppose in physics we try to prove many facts using certain laws and concepts .
the student should understand the concept to know the fact of that law .
Now a days many students are familar with the ideas and concepts .
So , they try to obtain the fact from tere own concept and knowledge .
Nobody are required for the to prove the fact for them .

So instood of trying to prove the fact for the students make them to know concept and idea of the fact .
So , that they can understand the fact by themshelves without proving for them .

So , if students understand ideas and concepts than knowing the actual fact , they can only conclude of the fact without others tring to prove the fact for them
