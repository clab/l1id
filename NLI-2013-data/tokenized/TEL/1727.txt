I strongly believe that , Its better to have broad knowledge of several acadamic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
the primary reasons of this belief is balance that a broad knowledge is student can develop his interrelationships .
if we have a only one specific subject we cannot speak or argue .

Why the broad knowledge ?
Broad knowledge is most important on student aspect because a student has to know about several subjects , because if he goes on any where at any seminars or some thing like that they might asked broad knowledge .

Firstly , broad knowledge is basically knows about several topics .
we can knows information about several subjects .

The main advantage of several subjects knowledge we can participate at any seminars , quiz compititions at any level .
we can argue at any topic watever they might ask type of questions .
and other advantage of broad knowledge is we can give any type ig essay copitions and also compititive exams .
and mostly compititive exams need broad knowledge .

Here im explaing a example , one of my cousin takes only arts subjest in her course .
one day she attended a seminar regarding her arts .
Every one in that seminar was perfoming there arts .
after performing an art there conducted a test .
but she was unable to answered for those questions because of her one subject knowledge .
so , student need many acadamis subjects .

so finally , im sure that broad knowledge is more helpful for being a good student .
