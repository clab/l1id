Young peoples now a days spend very less time in helping thie communities .

According to the above statement now a days each and every one is very busy with their respective work .
Day by day the techonolgy is increasing very rapidly but still the work load is not getting supressed .
When there is heavy work load there may be no time for others to participate in helping their communities .

For example , a student is given lot of home work at his school .
At this point one may not find time to play or relax .
If one is under pressure of completing their regular work and finding no time to enjoy there they may not be able to communicate with other activites .

Because the student is not only pressurised at his school but also at his home .
Because parents are more concerned with his carreer as they wanted them to be more dedicate towards their work .
There fore if the workload is reduced and if they are encouraged the youngers can try to allocate some time in helping thier communities ,

Secondly , the schools also should allocate certain programmes where the student can realize the importance in helping thier communities .
They should know the importance of helipng their communities , because thebasic programmes the communities consits are keeping the society clean , whether all the facillities are available or not .
Such things make students benefit in various ways .

If schools allocate certain programmes then a student may try find time in helping thier communities .

Therefore I paritially agree that young people now a days are spending very less time in helping their communities .
Not only students in schools , even in colleges and those who are working can contribute their time towards helping their communities if their work load is lowered .
Therefore when the workload is reduced they have enough time to relax and in the mean time they can help their respective communities .
