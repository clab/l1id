As great people say `` Nothing is permanent in this materialistic world '' .
with the change in time there will be rapid change in the technologies and the life style of the humanbeing .
A Car is a immediate next productive invention man made after many other small , less capacity seater , less expensive automobiles .

Cars were considered costly as the mode of transport needed lot of fuel and which was always costly from the ages of automobile invention .
But as the rates of the cars began to decrease simultaneously the fuel rates began to increase .
if the situation can be mathematically expressed it can be done by stating that the price of the vehicle and the fuel rate are inversely proportional to each other .
As fuel increases price of the car decreases .
In the early period of modernisation only the rich people attempted for the maintainance of this vehicle .
But as the cars prices are decreasing day by day , people who are gaining their position financiallly are in the thought of maintaining one .
Though we cant expect a frequent usage of these cars due to the increase in the fuel rates , people are opting for showoff business .
There is no doubt there will be more number of cars than they are in the present year .
It is very clear from the above explanation that the population of cars increase but usage will be nil .

The roads will be widened more for the free movement of the traffic .
Becoz a time comes where each and every person who is earning will be in a state to maintain a four wheeler .

By this wierd behaviour of man it would be difficult for us to come to a conclusion of what exactly man has in his mind and what would be the future of the cars and other automobiles .
