`` Yes '' , I agree to statement which is given as `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .

Now-a-days people looking for such good companies which will stay for long time , because now there are so many people are introducing such new models like `` Accent '' , `` Zen Maruthy '' , and so many other cars model names older and newer , also one company is modifying one companies model and changing a little and releasing it again with their names .

But only few companies will stay for long time because they will not depend on other companies models , public believe that companies too .

I feel how many years it go only the good product companies stay for long time .
Those companies stays for long time their success is in making the goods in convincible manner .
Also they will use only perfect engines , looks for better milage , comfortable steering and sitting arrangements with A.C. includnig in future in all type of cars .

If some cars introducing with better milage ok , what about engine , if engine not much good then the car will not stay for long time and gives so many problems in future .

In the same way some cars will have some other problems then the cars will not stay for long time and gives the troubles too in the future .

Only few companies produce every thing perfectly and they stay for long itme in the future .

By the above points with for and against i can strongly accept the statement `` After twenty years there will be fewer cars i use than there are today '' .
