Today , the number of cars boght every year is staggering and the number keeps increasingyear on year .
However , I believe that the number of cars has peaked and will definitely reduce in the near future .

One of the major reasons for decline in the cars would be the affordibility .
With ever rising oil prices and declinng reserves , it would be hard for many to own and run a car .
Although alternative fuels like Solar and Alchohol cars have been suggested they are still far from feasible .
These technologies would take atelast two decades in implementing and cannot offer any immediate solution .

Also there is lot of concern for pollution and traffic caused by the large number of cars on our streets .
Green activists are calling for special taxes on cars for polluting the environment .
This forced goverments to enforce taxes on the car manufacturing companies .
This would certainly reduce the interest of new car manufacturers .

Public transport facilities like buses and metros will gain wide acceptance not only because thay are much cheaper .
But also because of the advancements in the technology , Government and other organizations are able to provide commuters with comforts which are on par with the ones that cars provide .
Twenty years later there would be further improvement in the commuting technologies which would lead to reduced car users .

Lastly , there are technologies like SEGWAY and personal flying planes that are in prototype stage of testing .
These inventions could replace the cars in the near future .

In sum I believe that cars would be replaced by other forms of transport both for economical and environmetal issues .
