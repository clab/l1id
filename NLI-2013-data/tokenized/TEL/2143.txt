Altough the main aspect of the life is enjoyment and happiness , i strongly agree with the spekers statement .
the enjoyment in the life can change many situations and most part of the life depends on happiness because of the results that come what we have expected .
there are many reasons and examples to strenthen my statement that young people enjoy lot in there life rather than older people .

Firstly , the young people mostly enjoy there life in college education because there will be no burdens on them and they try to spend most of the time to enjoy life .
for example , they offen go to picnic 's or tours when they are free and another is there will no stress or tension in there younger life and most enjoyable time for youger ones is , when the expected results will acheive in there life .

Secondly , the enjoyment will be more in younger people rather than older people .
for example , they frequent go to the tours and go to the pictures because they are not having any burdens and responsibilities like older people .
since i am young i know the enjoyment of life in these stage .
another example is that they enjoy a lot when there is any adventures or any thrilling work they do means , by driving a car or rock climbing persists there enjoyment .

Thirdly , i state that the older people can also enjoy there life but not as much as young people do .
because the older people will have many responsibilities such as , maitain family , office work this excludes them enjoyning most part of the life even though if there is any enjoyment in the older people they will enjoy in much decent manner but the younger ones will enjoy a lot .

Finally , the conclusion that most younger ones are enjoying because they dont have any social responsibilities like older people but the enjoyment and happiness in life will bring a lot of change to make a good life .
