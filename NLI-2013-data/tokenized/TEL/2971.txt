This statement elucidates any sapient persin who is an avid reader into the nitty gritty of this topic .
I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

To buttresss my support i like to quote that young people enjoy most of there times by partying and going to beaches and so , but when it comes to the case of older people they ca n't do it they will not be enjoying in beaches and also they will not be partying .

To further wox on my stand i like to give a pragmatic experience from my grandfather .
On the other day my grand father told me that he used to enjoy a lot when he was in his younger age than he was now .
He used to tell me to enjoy a lot and he told me that the younger age is the age that will not return again enjoy as much as it is possible .

The other experience that my pedagogue told me when he encountered during his study is that , he has done a research work on the styles and patterns of the living of old people and the young people and he told that compared to the old people from his results the young people tends to enjoy a lot .

On the other side i think its not only the enjoyment that comes by partying or so is the only enjoyment , we should also consider the enjoyment from the side of a older people , they also has their own enjoyments , the older persons possibly after their retirement they used to sit and they enjoys by listening to the songs and also reading some books mainly some devotional books , which the young people most of them are not interested .
They also enjoy by having a tour to all the religious places and also they will be satisfied when their children become a good individual .

Finally i like to conclude , without any degressions from the topic that definitely older people enjoy but not to the extent that the younger people enjoy .
