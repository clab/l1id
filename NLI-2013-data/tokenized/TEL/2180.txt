The issue whether `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is a contraversial one .
On the one hand , young people enjoy life because they do n't have enough responsiblites .
On the other hand older people tends to enjoy life in various aspects such as they can relax most of the time , they can do whatever they want because they do n't have any restrictions .
However on the final analysis , i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do because younger people can do whatever they want i mean that their body nature tends them to move faster , showing great energy on everything they do .

one reason for my belief is that , younger people have less responsiblities at the time of studying or even before their marriage younger people mostly spend their time on doing things which may not be useful for them but they think of enjoying life to the fullest , the immaturity in them makes them think life as god gift , but as the people grow older they will have more maturity because they have seen the true colour of life based on their experiences and the responsiblities they have to bear at the higher stages of life .

Another reason for my belief is , Younger people will usually get boredom if they go on studying continously , they tend to relax at that time by watching a movie or by going on a ride with their freinds but older people eventhogh they worker harder there ultimate enjoyement is relaxation which may be in the form of sleep because their bodies did n't permit them to go out frequently and enjoy with freinds .

perhaps , the another contradictory reason is younger people tend to study a lot because most of the individuals will have high aims in their life so they spent most of the time by studying but it mostly depends on an individuals who sees their lifes due to this particular reason we can say that they dont seems to enjoy their life but most of the old people will not have good health to enjoy their life because the body does n't permit them , but if they are looked after by their children , they will spent the rest of the life by enjoying their selves

So finally i believe that Younger students enjoy life more than older people do because they can have less responsiblities and due to the small age the energy in most of the individiduals is very high to do anything they want but older will not have much energy as young people have to do anything they want .
