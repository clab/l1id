no , i wont agree with the statement , in my opinion just simply knowing and understanding ideas and cocepts is not sufficient knowing the facts is very important , just simply knowing concepts doesnot help in all cases , knowing the facts about the thing is very important then only we can know wheather the thing which we understood are correct or not .
in some cases without know the facts we cannot come to the conclusion .
facts should be known .
there is a chance of getting misleaded simply by understanding concepts and agreeing the things , in such cases facts are very useful facts are real things which we can see or taste .
simply uderstanding the concepts will help the students upto some extent only that means upto exams only , but in case of kowing the facts it will be helpful in future when the same problem repeats in future .
the concepts are those that are simply printed in the books or said by the professors in the colleages but facts are those which we see directly in the labs or in daily life .
for example if we take an experiment in a lab if we do it by ourself and the both if the expected and the result matches then we can say that the experiment has passed .
other wise simply listening to the professor about the experiment may or may not give the expected results , there aries lots of doubts , therefore after once if we perform the experiment there is no chance of getting doubts in the whole life time about that experiment .
at some extent understanding is enough but in all cases it wont works .
especially in works of get importance such as civil engineering works , mechanical works doing the test personally and knowing all the facts about all the products and materials only the work can be completed successfully .
understanding the concepts are useful upto the exam point of view , after that we may forget them but about knowing facts they wont never be fogetted .
this is how knowing facts is important when compared to understanding facts and performing them .
