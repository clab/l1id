I would probably disagree with the statement because its more like an opinion stated considering a specific area of interest or pertaining to a particular place in the world .
I say this because cars have , of late , started being affordable to the common man .
They are no longer the prized posssession of the high-class and the elite` .
Cars have become the common mode of conveyance in the recent past and this situation is likely to persist for atleast a while , why not for 20 years .
Cars are nowadays seen to accommodate all kinds of people and have emerged as the economical and faster means of conveyance anywhere in the world .

The idea that there will be fewer cars in the years to come is entirely provincial in my view .
We should not forget the fact that a larger share of the population in any nation still commute by auto-rickshaws , buses and trains even today .
People who are primarily concerned with their financial status prefer travelling by buses to having a car .
Majority of the middle and most of the lower classes do not even consider the option of owning a car .
For instance , a person who plans to spend $ 100 for his monthly conveyance cannot opt for a car which incurs an expenditure of 250 $ as it consumes the lion 's share of his earnings .
Thanks to the ever-rising petroleum and crude oil prices , the option of owning a motor vehicle has gone further down the list of luxuries to be possessed .
But , the wide range of comfort a car offers has been something to think about in the present day situation where time is of essence and the need for speed in life is pronounced .

Cars are the emerging mode of transportation in the present world scenario in a broader sense .
They are no longer a luxury , rather a necessity now .
I would personally like to justify my opinion by saying that any statement made can be acceptable if and only if its applicable to the majority of the population .
Ofcourse , in the United States , travelling by air has proved to be cheaper than that of by air and thus can lead to speculations that ground travel would be less preferred in the future .
Pollution has also been cited as a reason in the case of cars .
But in view of the larger picture of the globe , it can be said that cars would continue to be the most common mode of transport and commutation in the near future .
