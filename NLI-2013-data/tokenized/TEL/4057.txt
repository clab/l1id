Young people contribute themselves in helping out the communities .
Though these people have a very much little time to spend on these communities , they do more .
They stated few programes like collecting funds to orphanages and old age homes .
They move from one organisation to other organisatoin , from one individual to other individual to collect the funds .
The future politics is also in the hands of these young people .
Much to be changed in the feild of politics , especially in the country like India , where the political people are not so beneficial to the society .

Every young man is ofcourse not helpful has they have their own problems .
They have to attend the classes fulltime and he gets frustrated , while some are employed etc .
But , somehow these people should find out minimum time to help thie societies .
Ten out of hundred in india are still illterates and unemployed .
One among us should find the source to eradicate these conditions .

Due to other bad conditions availing is the influence of narcotics i.e drugs .
Many young people are been addicted to the drugs , where they are not in a condition to maintain themselves .
by the influence of these drugs , youth is disturbed .
Besides drugs , even cinemas , telivision sets also disturb the young people .
Everyone should get awarenes on the influence of these drugs and media .

Besides all these things , youth get themselves in active participation for helping out the communities .
The most prevailing problem now a days is AIDS , these awareness programes are actively done by the young people .
