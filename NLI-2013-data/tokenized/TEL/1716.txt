I HAD JUST READ A SAYING `` KNOWLEDGE IS THE ART OF KNOWING THINGS ORGANISEDLY '' I STRONGLY AGREE WITH THIS STATEMENT .
A PERSON MAY HAVE A KNOWLEDGE OF MANY THINGS , BUT ONLY TO A CERTAIN EXTENT .
BUT WHAT IS THE USE IF HE INTENDS TO SPECIALIZE IN A PARTICULAR FIELD . ???

IN THIS CASE HE WILL JUST STRUGGLE IN ALL THE FIELDS .
HE WILL NOT HAVE ANY THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE IN A FIELD .
HE WILL HAVE A MIS - MATCH OPTION AS TO WHAT TO CHOSE AS HIS MAIN STREAM .

CONSIDER A PERSON WHO IS WELL QUALIFIED FOR A PARTICULAR TRAINING .
SIMILARLY ALSO CONSIDER A PERSON WHO IS JUST A PERSON WITH WIDE KNOWLEDGE WITH EVERY FIELD BUT NO SPECIALIZATIONS .
SUPPOSE IF BOTH ATTEND A JOB INTERVIEW , IT WOULD BE A CAKE-WALK DECISION TO CHOSE THE PERON WITH THE RIGHT QUALIFIATIONS FOR THE RIGHT JOB .

IF A PERSON IN HIS CHILDHOOD IS QUESTIONED WHAT HIS PLAN TO DO IN THE FUTURE WAS , HIS SPONTANEOUS ANSWER WOULD BE A DOCTOR , ENGINEER SO FORTH .
BUT NO ONE RESPONDS THAT THEY HAVE PLANS TO HAVE WIDE KNOWLEDGE IN EVERYTHING .

I PREFER THAT LEARNING A SUBJECT WHICH INTERESTS US MOST IS DEFINITELY INCREASING OUR GOALS .
SPECIALISING IN A PARTICULAR SUBJECT HAS ITS OWN ADVANTAGES .
WE GET TO HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE AND FURTHER WORK ON THE SUBJECT MORE KEENLY .

BUT MY IDEA IS NOT TO BE A BOOK WORM !!!!!
WE SHOULD EXPLORE THE WORLD AS IF IT IS OUR OWN .
BUT SPECIALISATION IS ALSO NECCESSARY !
THOUGH A WIDE KNOWLEDGE IN ALL FIELDS IS ALSO ESSENTIAL , SPECIFIC GOALS ALSO OUGHT TO BE PRESENT WITHIN EVERYONE .
