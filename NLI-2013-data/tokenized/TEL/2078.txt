I agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more that older people do '' because the young people will be more active , fast thinking , no tension about the family and the future and emerging of new cultures and technologies .

Firstly , young people will be more active and fast thinkers than old people because they will believe that `` Time is precious '' i.e .. , once the time and age is gone they cant get bact it to enjoy and correct the things according to them .
But the old people will be very slow in taking decisions and theey will very superstitious .

Secondly , younger people will not have any tensions about the future and family problems because they will think that there will be lot of time to think about the family .
But old people will think about the problems of the family members and they will take it as a responsilibity to solve the problems and giving good future to their family members .
For example , if there is any financial problem then young people depends upon the old people to solve that financial problem and they will concentrate on other things which gives free from tensions .
Hence younger people gets more time to enjoy the life than older people .

Lastly , younger generation experiences different type of enertaining cultures and tecnological events to adapt to it and gaining pleasure and happiness from it .
As the older people belongs to older generation they cant adapt the new cultures and they continue to live in the old manner .
For example , younger people go to the different types of movies , functions and other entertainment technicques to make them enjoying the life and fell happy but older people cant show much interest on that events .

So I conclude that younger people will enjoy the life than the older people do because of the interest shown by the older people , emerging of new cultures and using new technologies to lessen the burden , fast thinking and no tensions about the family problems .
They also avoids problems by knowing the experiences of the older to people .
