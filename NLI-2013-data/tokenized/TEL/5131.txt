There is no doubt in saying that advertisements shows products in much impressive than the actual products .
There is a saying in English , `` First impression leaves better impression '' .
Manufactres wants to persuade people with perpetuating impression in the first instance itself .

First , Manufactures of soft drinks spend millions of dollars for promoting their drinks .
Famous actrors or actress serve as brand ambassdor to their products to lure the customers .
They claiam that this is the best possible , energetic drink one can imagine .
Infact it is not true .
Just plane water could be more refreshing , rejuvineating than soft drink .
It is one of the leading cause of Diabetes mellitus , becuase it contains lot of sugar products .
Some studies have shown that there are traces of pesticides in soft drink .
Inspite of all this disadvanates they are promting thier products by attractive packaging and advertising .

Second , now let us consider fast food advertisiments .
Thier advertisements suggests that they are healthiest foods on can imagine .
Howeer that is not the case .
Each sandwitch in a restarant may contain more than 1000 Kcal .
There is some recent strong evidence suggest that schooll children in USA are becoming obese by eating restaurent food .
We can see the pictures of the food on posters .
It looks very appeeling .
However we can not be sure hat are ingriednts , whwre it came from .
How many times did they used same oil .
I beacme ill several times after eating cafteria food .
Single can of tuna and could be much nutrious than high fat food avialable fast food hotels .

Third , Toy manufactures advertises attract lot of children by making wide range of toys .
But mant cases toys would not be up to the eexpecation of child .
Single piece of paper could have been more imaginatve than electronic toy .
Because it might improve child drawing performance or writing ability .
This sort of advanatge , however denied to the toys .

In conclusion , I am of the view that people should consdier adevrtisement as a source of information before before buying product .
They should be carefull .
