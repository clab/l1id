As for as i am concerned , i agree with this statement .
Young people enjoy life more than olderpeople do , because young people have activeness in body , eagerness in mind and health support by the age , which are not related to old people .

As i am a representative to young people , I support my openoin in my words .
Most probably we are like to advantures , from those only we get more enjoy ment .
Try to catch a running bus , get down from a fastmoving van and trecking so on are some examples of the source of enjoyment for young people , which are not possible for the old .
Because these things can be possible only if the muscles of the body cooperate .

Similarly to introduce new things to the world , like by completing more and more projects in lesser time .
Normally young people do n't have the problems like lack of memory , which is a common thing for old .
Completing the projects leads to invention of some new things , from which we get heartful enjoyment as we are part of the leaders of the world , where always `` the new '' can be appreciated .

Health support is another most important facot for enjoyment .
As young people , we can play games and sports , where the most people getting relax and work hard for the next event .
Another important thing is that some people getting their enjoyment by helping to the physically handicapped and very old people by properly let to cross the heavy traffic highways through some societies ( social service ) , this type of enjoyment is not adopted by the old , because they only have to get help from others .

But the old people are very much important to give guidelines for the youth , without the guiding of old people to youth , they cant do things perfectly .
So , i can conclude that youth can enjoy a lot than the oldpeople because of the stamina , activeness and memory power .
