I will agree with the given statement which is given that Young people enjoy more than older people do .
Because the young people are ntrested doing new things that they had never done before .

They will take risks in their life and they think that risks makes man enjoy and happy .
The young man enjoys lots better than older people because they have no tenstions about their family they are always free from family problems .
If they get free time they will think to go tours or bars and restaurants so that they can really enjoy there .

One example i can give that if u see if the young man went to the bars or pubbs there we can observe that he really enjoy their life by dancing by singing loudly by commenting the others .
He will enjoys and entertined the others where as an old man ca n't do all this things because he was having lot of problems and also his age factor because he think that if he do all this things what the others will thinks about him .

The Young man can take some risks but a old man cannot take the risks because he always think about his family .
For example if a young person who had drunked so much he was not control .
At that moment also he wants to drive a car so that thisw risk cannot taken by a old person because first of all he thinks about his family .
But a young man have no tenstions .
they are alway think about how to enjoy the life .

By seeing all the things which are above we can say that an young man can enjoy more and take risk where as the old man ca n't enjoy as if like the young man and he cant take risk .
