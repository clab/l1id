The modern world of technology has changed the life of a common man altogether .
Advertisement technology is at its peak in this centuary creating ripples in the mind of people by forcing to buy the products thats are of substandards .

Newspapers , media , printing technology , door to door advertisement and mouth to mouth adverstising has increased substantially in the recent years .
All the products used by a person from the time he wakes up in the morning till he sleeps are advertised everywhere and anywhere .
The product company invest lot of money into adversitising its products buy paying a huge amount to a celebrity star , designing and redesigning the labels and try to increse there sales of the product and reep the benefits .
Infact these companies are ripping off the poeple .
Millions of money spent for the adverstisement can be diverted towards the maintainance of the stanndars fo the product .
If the product is really good and worthy Neither the advertisement maker or the celebrity participating in the adversitisment many not know the standats of the products are .

For example , the fizz drinks consumed by almost all in the world .
it was proved many times that the cococola or pepsi have pesticised that are harmful to the people .
still the company hires a super star from a film industry andboost the sales of its products .
consumers buy the drinks jus becasuse their favourite star has acted in the advetisement .
many instance of healt hazardous levels of pesticides were found .

After careful observation and sufficent evidence i strongly agree that many products are of less standard than the thwey are advertised .
