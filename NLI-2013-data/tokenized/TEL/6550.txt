No , I do n't agree completely with the statement that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I have many reasons that support my argument .

Firstly , there is no immediate reason why people are going to do away with cars in another twenty years .
Car is one of the most commonly used automobile these days , humans use it for many of their daily purposes and a whole industry thrives on this .
And car is a symbol of status in some of the developing countries even today .
And the way technology is progressing by leaps and bounds , one can only imagine the various levels of comforts and advantages a car provides in contrast to any other vehicle .
But , as any study on the problems plaguing the road transport would rightly indicate , cars are creating some problems that may prompt anyone to suggest their ` extinction ' .
There might be several reasons for the author to give this statement , some positive and the rest indicating the ill effects of usage of car .

One reason that might have prompted the author to state that the fate of cars in use is going to sealed , in the next twenty years , is that nowadays we are trying to find alternate means of road transport , because of various problems a car poses today .
Definitely , a huge amount of research is going on this direction , to find better and better means of transport , that will subside or eliminate the use of cars and their corrent problems .
But noone would disagree that at the same time , lots of efforts are going on to address the current problems cars are posing , and thus making car a better vehicle .

Coming to the problems cars are posing these days , the first thing that evinces is the pollution caused .
Automobiles cause a lot of pollution and cars do form a lion 's share of this .
But , research is giving sufficient attention to this , alternate ways to avoid the use of petrol and deisel as the fuel for cars and other automobiles , are being studied and experimented .
We already have some cars running on the roads using solar energy or biodiesel for fuel , which though are in their infant stages , provide attractive prospects for cars in the future .
Moreover , these alternatives may , who knows , eventually make the car a better vehicle than what it is at present .

Another reason is possibly the traffic problems posed by the increasing cars .
Governments are encouraging people to let their cars rest in the garrages , atleast on some days of a week , so that both pollution and traffic problems can be attenuated .
But even these problems plague the whole of automobile industry , and the only way to control this is by having proper strategy for all the automobile , not cars alone .
Further , an attempt to amelirate the current situtation of road traffic should work towars making the roadways more effective as a whole by better management and other means .
Just trying to avoid the usage of cars wo n't do .

Thus , from some of the plausible reasons put forward in the above argument , it can be said that cars are not going anywhere in the next twenty years , but they are going to have the same dominant role they are playing now in the road transport .
Further , I suggest that if the tone with which the author has given this statement would have helped much more in the analysis .
