CAR-one of the few things which people are proud to posses .
Twenty years are way too small for the cars to leave the roads a bit vacant .
A car is a basic need just as Food , Shelter And Water .
The big guns of car manufacturing industry are spending millions of money to bring out more fuel efficient variants in to the market .
Considering the present situations i dont think that there will be any decrease in the number of cars in coming forty years .

There are countless reasons why people are so enamoured to their cars .
Cars , beside providing an independent and effective mode of transport , provide various other services which inclide both social and personal .
The key of your car is not just a key for the car but for a key for you to travel whereever and whenever you want .
Beside providing privacy cars also prove to be status symbols in the modern society .

Some of the disadvantages of cars which pave way for the discussion of eliminating them are as follows .
Firstly , the pollution emmitted by the cars has put the environment under great threat .

Secondly , with increasing population , the number of cars are soaring high .
Thus resulting in traffic congestion and parking problems .
But the manufacturing industries have been spending huge amount of money to develop more fuel efficient and pollutionless cars .
And some of those efforts have already given positive results .
One such outcome is the hydogen fueled car .
These cars use hydrogen as fuel emit nothing but water which in turn is ased as coolant for raidators .
And Hybrid cars are already on the roads which combine the advantages of fuel cell cars with the traditional petrol cars .
In addition , these cars prove to be space conserving thus solving congestion problems .

Hence thecars will continue to enjoy the throne of the roads till more cost effective and space convenient modes of transport are developed .
And billions are hopeful that they will witness the era of Flying cars , transmitting the dream of every kid behind a window into reality .
