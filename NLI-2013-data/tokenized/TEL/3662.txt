I agree with the statement .
Young people of this generation do not spare enough time helping their communities .
There are various reasons for this .
Firstly , Youngsters of todays world are more inclined towards planning their career .
It has become important for them to make a goal and thrive hard to accomplish it .
They are of general belief that they have many other works to accomplish than working for community .
They rarely spare time for the community .
Earlier days , as we hear from our grand parents , they used to form welfare communities and work hard for it .
scheduling meetings , attended by all youngsters in community and planning things for the betterment of community .
This characteristic virtually lacks in youngsters of today .

Secondly , the other reason might as well be lack of initiation .
the youngsters should be motivated to start programmes that help communities to grow and prosper .
if one takes a step towards helping community , their friends , neigbours will join them too .
Youngsters in colleges , universities and those working in corporates , prefer enjoying their weekends rather doing supportive work .
i feel they should instead think of creative ideas that would improve quality of living in community .

Finally , youngsters to be helpfull for community , the qualities should be inculcated when they are in growing stages .
As the saying goes `` old habits die hard '' .
Helping community , working for it shuld be thought to individuals at a very early stage of life ( proabably from the age of 6 ) , by doing so they grow up to be helpful individuals .
Consider an example , Ashoka , Indian Emporer planted trees by roads , helped the needy , and eventually became a leader .
The helpful nature helped him to be a leader .
History says these qualities were embibed in him by his mother when he was a kid .

The reasons for the youngsters not working towards the community are that they are more career oriented .
they concentrate more on their future .
parents also play a important role in behaviour of younsters .
parents ought make their children understand the importance of society and need to help the communities .
they should encourage children to participate in communities more often .
