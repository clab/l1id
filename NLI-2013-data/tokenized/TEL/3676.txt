A nation 's future is in the hands of the youth .
It is the young people who are responsible for the development of a nation or a community or an organisation .

I agree with the statement that young people are not enough helping their communities .
In this technical world everyone is busy in his own work and is becoming mechanical .
The increase in the IT industry and the Computer field had boosted up so rapidly in the recent years .
To meet the competition and to get succeeded everyone is trying to learn new things , create new work and want to be identified uniquely .
This is good but this competition had posed more stress and strain on the human beings .
Because of this reason the people are so isolated and narrow minded that they do not even care what is happening for our community or society and do not have enough thought to help others .

The small amount of time that they get to relax are been used to make them tension free and relieve from the work pain .
This total situation have to change to make our community better .
Everyone waits for the other person to start any process .
Until and unless one raises the issue no one takes the step .
To change this the youngsters had to take the initiation and to start helping the community .

Apart from being busy they have to feel the responsibility of the community as they are living in and work for its betterment .
Instead of saying busy the young people have to first understand the serious problems that are prevailing in their community and have to think for the solution .
After understanding they have to plan a process which helps them to fix the problem more easily and also in less time .
Once the plan has been thought they have to stick to the principles they have built in helping for the community and had to work hard for it in their free times .

Thus , every youngster have to take the responsibilty and come up with a good idea to help the community in its best , thereby establishing a cleaner and a greater community which leads to the welfare of the whole society .
