Yes i agree with the statement which is given `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .

Young people enjoy more because they have full of energy and enthusiasm compared to the older people .
the body system and emotions of older people do not help for enjoying .
old people do not think for enjoyment at that stage .
the body and feelings helps in enjoying life for young people .
so young people enjoy life compared to old people .

For example young people can go and dance in pub but it is not possible for old people .
young people can eat any food what they like but old people have some restrictions based on their health .
young people can dress in any way but it is not option for old people eventhough if old people wore a fashionable dress it is very akward .

other people will insult them .

Old people enjoyment is different from young people .
living simply without any tentions is old people enjoyment .
but young people enjoy by thrilling life .
young people do not like bored life they always want some thrilling in their life

Old people think in different manner compared to the young people .
young people think very freshly and innovatively .
young people thoughts are like rocking .
they will enjoy by what they want to do .

This is all mainly because the body structure and feelings at that age prevents the old people in enjoying the life .
in this way young people enjoy life more than older people do .
