I agree specialize specialize in one subject is better .

Introduction :

1. know the subject .

2.opportunities are there .

3.dont waste time .

First reason is if a student to take learning on one subject it will be easy to get the score .
for example if a student takes the course of like computer subject in this it can have different subjects are there .
If the student to choose the subject java course .
The student can concentrate on that subject .
so he can get the good score .
Suppose if job is not get he can teach the subject to other students and he can get the salary .
This is other way doing if he ca n't get the job .

Second reason is to create new project if the student take on one subject if we take above example java course .
The student can create new things like if in the based on the java course he can create web sites and quick transactions .
If a student going this way he can get better opportunities and the student get the better salary and he can bright future .
If the student can create new project he can give the presentation on that things .
If the Government to produce in the market and people are used to that project .

Third reason is dont waste time the student can learn on that subject he can not the waste the time .
some students takes different courses so that student can waste the time .
Those student no relief and happiness .
because at the time of end course if the student can not get grip on those subject it will be very difficulty .
if the student on one particular subject he can save the time .
That time he can spend with friends or families or other activities .

So iagree specialize in one subject is better .
