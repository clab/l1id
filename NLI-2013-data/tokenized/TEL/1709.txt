The issue at hand is the `` knowledge one would be interested in acquiring '' .
It is rather difficult to state a single opinion because most of the work conducted in several sections of our lives are based on a particular topic at depth using other topics .
But , I think knowledge about a particular topic to depth will certainly be better .
There are several reasons for stating this opinion .

Firstly , the more the knowledge you have , the better you understand it .
Therefore , knowing more information about the topic helps you to understand it more accurately .
For example , as the information explored from the universe is increasing , we are having better idea of it .
So , i think knowing a particular subject to depth would help a lot in improving our ability in the subject .

Secondly , we are in a world where the inventions and discoveries have led to many revolutions .
So , the information about a particular topic is so abundant that specialising in more than one subject is really difficult .
For example , the information about our body is so huge that no one can know it to the brink .
So , there has been specializations in the medicinal field .
It is better to know a specific subject confidently rather than knowing more without accuracy .

It will be a honour for anyone if your name is stated when the topic is named .
Because , you know everything or to the maximum about it .
For example , some of the professors in the colleges are famous for the subject they teach only because they are excellent at it .
This definitely encourages to know more about that specific subject .

Moreoften , scientists are famous for their inventions and innovations because they make the world quite comfortable .
All these scientists mostly concentrate on a particular topic .
They do researches in a specific topic to demonstrate various experiments .

In conclusion , I believe that specialization in one topic would be a better option rather than broad understanding of many topics .
It can be seen from the reasons stated that better knowledge does enhances the life of the individual and also the society he/she lives in .
