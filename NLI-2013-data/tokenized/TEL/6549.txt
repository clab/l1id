I agree with partly , in twenty year there will be fewer cars in use .
Using cars past twenty years increase rapidly .
now these twenty years cars are not in use because of obsolence and out of fassion .
It could be true in developed country because of their living standards are high as compare to the developing countries .
they are prefer to by new one with more up graded technology and new fassions .
in developing country like india cars use after their life was expried .
These could happen only the economical conditions .

In developed countries like USA their car do not meet their requirement they simply go for another one , which they have provided .

India like countries most of the cars are in use after the twenty years .
Here the people living condition are low as compare to the developed countries .
because of the economical condition not allow to change their vehicles .
Now the IT boom has to give a scope to change their attitude towards their purchasing .
In India after IT revloution and MNC 's people earning power has increased .

Computer professional are looking only to purchage new technology cars .
It 's leads use of car is increase .
In developed country like USA is not big problem to maintain a car , even student are using car .
their get cars cheaply as compare to in india .
fuel avialablity are is there .
there is few disadvantages as well as advantages to use cars .
today every one use car and making fuel consumtion .
after some year there will a problem to face to lack of fuel .
we cannot give better world to our future generation .
now already exit the lacking in oil resources .
my suggestion to my view point is to make better life with effect environment .
using more cars will produce more pollution , please avoid the over pollution as possible as .
