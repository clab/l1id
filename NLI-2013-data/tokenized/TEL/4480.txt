I agree with the statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .

If you pick advertising in health care products like over the counter medications doesnt work up to the extent they advertise or print on the item itself .
For example there are certain medications used for hair growth like Minoxidil which doesnt help in hair growth as they advertise .
There is only one priscription medication for hair growth that is propecia even that will help only up seventy five percent .

There are certain Homeopathic medications like aerborn there is no exact theory how they work for all kind of symptoms they list like cold , cough , and more .
They always advertise for certain over the counter medications they are as good as priscription drugs for example advil , its not exactly same strenth as priscrition it lesser strenth then how can be better than a priscription medication .

In the advertisements they mention the advatages in big letters and disadvantages in very small letters , which are equally important and right to know for a consumer .
By doing such kind of things and increasing their sales companys are making lot of profits .

There is another disadvatage of advertising it also increases the manufacturing cost of the products , which eventually charged to the consumer .
They advertising five uses of the product out of which one or two is correct .

In the past two decades advertising is playing a mazor role in selling new products .
Some advertisements are really good and the best way to know a consumer about the new products in the market and their uses , provided they give us right information through advertising .

My personal opinion on Advertising is I could only realy upto certain extent and you have to be very careful
