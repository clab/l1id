I disagree with the statement made , I strongly feel that young people do spend some time by helping their communities .
they also play a primarilly role in this issue thereby doing the work ethusiastically .

Primarily , i would state that nowadays the young people are advised in their schools and colleges to their communities to grow & they give lots of valuble suggestions based on their experiences .
thus the young people with this information use their creativity to help the community .

Furthermore , the communities & their organisations have started conducting plenty of meetings then previously done .
Thus they also state the current problems in the community and nurture the future generation with valuble suggestions based on their experience and they also encourage the young people to paricipate in these issues .

Consider an example , which i have experienced during my young days .
Once there was meeting arranged by our community and a was problem stated regarding helping of disabled people in the community and adults gave some money to help them .
But we young people helped these disabled people by helping them to cross the roads , and also assisted them whenever the needed some help .

In addition to the example mentioned above , we also had another accasion where we were given some job by the community members , i.e they had problem regarding the increase in pests like mosquitoes & we helped them by pouring sand in places where water tends to stagnate , as stagnant water is the main cause for breeding mosquities .

Finally , I state that Nowadays young people spend enough time to helping their communities than done before .
thus i conclude by saying that the young people play a primary role in the developement of a community
