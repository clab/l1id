yes i agree with the statemet given above .
All the middle class people has going to buy a car in now a days because at now a days the cars are going very cheep and the banks are offering no interist on the some cars of very cheep .
so by taking loans of the banks and there are going to buy a car .
so by going on a car there are more advantages .
those are listed below
1 ) by driving the car we cannot fall on the either sides of balancing
2 ) during the rainy seasons we can rest our heads inside the car
3 ) in the laxuary cars of such as benz we can safe our life by protecting the ballons in the cars
4 ) when we are going to the functions the cars are to be very good startagy of the persons .
5 ) by using the cars a more than ( i.e more than nine members ) can travel at a time to go from one place to the another place .
6 ) by traveling from one place to the aqnother place the time may taken very less because the speed of the car will be very fast .
7 ) in the cars there is a luxury life and we cannot be very struss because if we feel not comfort we will stop the car and we will be relaxed and we go on journey .

so by this there are so many advantages by using the cars .
but the people of the middle class is to offer the cars by using the loans and there are going to buy .
so here there is a propability to grow up the cars in the forwoding of the fast twenty years .
so at present there are many cars and these are going to be on the road .
so i think that the cars in the froword twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in the cities .
