I disagree with the statement `` It is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' Learning ideas and concepts are as important as knowing the facts .
By knowing about the facts , students becomes more practical , they knows what ideas and concepts are been used in this world , by this he comes to know about the real world .
Having knowledge of only ideas and concepts makes students conservative by knowing facts they becomes outstanding .

Learning facts makes students complete .
It increases their knowledge and they become more innovative .
This will improve their performance in studies .
Just knowing the ideas and concepts without facts keep them in the dark .
Facts enlighten them .

By knowing ideas and concepts they can do good in the exams , but facts make them to do better , when they get jobs .
Ideas and concepts educates the mind by telling about the subject how it is invented or discovered but facts educates the soul of the students .
Education , only with ideas and concepts and no facts is waste .

suppose for example we have learnt Darwin 's `` survival for existence '' but later we came to know the fact that it was wrong .
so , I agree that kowing facts is as important as ideas and concepts .
