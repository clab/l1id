Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject may leads to messing up of subjects .
I agree that having a knowledge on one particular subject sticks your knowledge with that particular subject only .
Having knowledge in one particluar subject makes you to concentrate more on that particular subject and it makes you more interesting on other hand .

For example if a student is intrested in doing mathematics and his academics deals with lot of subjects .
He should conecentrate more on other subjects as he find them tough .
Whenever we are not interested in subject we find it 's difficult and more over the tough subject should be given more time to study .
As the student is interested in mathematics he can make it easy but he may not develop more in that as he should concentrate more on other tough subjects .
If subject is more interesting to him then he can find out time to learn more information regarding that subject .
He can get some new ideas regarding his interested subject which may help out in some new discoveries too .
If at all he is having many subjects at a time he may not find sufficient time to leran more about his interested subject .
As the student is more interested in particular subject he can make use of time by learning more about his particluar subject .
He enjoys gathering information on his particluar specified subject which is of his interest .

That is the reason why the universities offer them specialization coures in their academics .
Students can choose their own specilized subject and build their carrier .
Students are given chance to choose their choice of subject .
They will not be messed up with are other subjects .
They can concentrate on one specilaized one and can improve their knowledge in that subject my learning more about the specified subject .
Thats the reason i agree to have specialization in academics .
