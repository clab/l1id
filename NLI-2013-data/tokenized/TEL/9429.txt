I disagree with the following statement that is it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Learning means u gain some experience that helps to provide new skill for you .

students to understand ideas and concepts is not good idea because come to the subjects like physics and chemistry its not provide good understanding and concepts these subjects very difficulty to understand because this subjects very vague from ancient time .
Thats why students perform good at this subjects must be learn facts like must to do labs in laboratorys .
Then only students performs good at this subjects .

we all know about this one `` EXPERIENCE IS LEARNS NEW SKILL '' that means when u got experience that helps to understand ideas and concepsts .
Now a days technology brought up new changes in our life style and this impacts deeprooted in people use available resources in effective way .
Come the point understand ideas and concepts is no use with out learn facts .

Now a days , Students in essential element is computer its brought up considerable changes in they life .
when u r going to write a one computer program on paper then its understand ideas and concepts is very difficulty .
When same program performing in computer student can analyse easily and understand ideas and concepts rather than writing paper .

when i was in childhood my parents had a car .
Every day i am going to school in car .
that car drove the my father .
on day iam asked to my father i want to drive car but my father not accepted the driving car .
Because i dont know abou how drive at that time my father give driving manual for car driving .
I am understanding ideas and concepts on that book after i have taken chance to drive a car but i am not perform driving .
Difficulty to drive read manual .
Finally i am drove my car after a long time when i had learned experience about fact .
when i was studied in secondary schoo math is difficult subject to me .
I leann facts this subjec could easily understand now .

Inspite of several demerits of this choosen topic but the positive aspects give good outweight of choosen selective mode .
Due to this reason i believe that learn facts is m ore important for students .
