Enjoyment means make the life happy .
by satisfying the soul of the body not only physically but also mentally .
if a person can get through both the mental and physical stresses .
Then the person is said to be enjoying his life .
For the enjoyment of the life especially the is no age limit .
both young ang old people can enjoy the life beautifully if they plan there life properly .
if not the person at any age can not enjoy his life .

In my opinon old people enjoy there life more happyily than the Younger ones because , in this morden world people should run with the time they rearly get the time to enjoy .

For instance if u see a school going boy/girl they alway run with the time .
there curriculam schedule is so tight that they are unable even to talk to there own parents .
they are totally missing there sweet time by enjoying with there parent which is necessary for a young child to share his feelings , which is not possible for a young child .
but the older people are spending enjoyable life by doing the things at the time they want to do atleast they are having that liberty .

coming to the young people who are going to jobs they schedule is also not at all planned according to them .
they hav to do hard work to earn money .
The people around him will respect him only if he have money .
So people all over the world is runnig all around to earn money .
Such young people who are at great stress full job are unable even to take care of there health .
so they are also not enjoying the life .
If we see odler people who are out of there jobs are atleast having right food at time .
they are enjoying by taking care of there own grand children .

Thus , i conclude that even youngstrers can enjoy there life if they make some free time sharing there happiness and sadness with there family or friends .
They can really enjoy the full sweetness of life than older ones .
because they have great time to enjoy .
