I agree with the following statement that it is more important for students to undersatnd ideas and concepts .
As becuse ideas and concepts are mainly helpful for a student in his future use .

As a student mainly learns the ideas and the developement of the ideas which will be useful for him in the future and in his studies too .
And also the concept plays a vital role in the learning stage of a student as if a student has a concept then he can do resarches based on his concept and that will give rise to the lots of inventions too .

As now the researches on many fields are going on based on the concepts that our ancestors have left to us thus concept made us to invent the differnt things in the future .

And one more thing that is important is to understand the ideas , these understandings will be helpfull to solve the problems , that is what the souce is given and what we have to do this idea is very important as which will gives the solution to the problem .

As when we think of the inventions made by many inventors gives us an idea to find the new invention . ''
Ideas mainly supports the invention of the new concept '' .
New ideas brings the new concepts in to the field and lots of developments are mainly done by this kind of ideas .

By referring different kinds of books and news papers and puzzles we can easily develope the ideas , idea is nothing but creativity , thus the creativity comprises of many ideas , as by having greater knowlwdge on any aspect then a different ideas can take place .
And again we shall discuss about the concept study it will be very help full for a student because concepts make him work easily and with effectively , as it can be considered as the root for a tree , as root mainly supples food for tree , as in the same way concept helps to develope the extra infermation and for the further developement of the future analysis .

These specific reasons and examples are given to support the statement that is about important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
