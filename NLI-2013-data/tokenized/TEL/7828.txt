In my point of view , i beleive that tours itself are for a purpose .
in order to make them worthful , guidance is necessary .
Overriding reason for my beleive is that , tours teach us more than the books .
Most of the tours are based either on learning something , which is unknown or simply an historic purpose .

Some places of interest may contain different kinds of monuments and articles in the meusum 's that have lasted from our ancestors period .
In such a visit , the tour guides help us understand the importance of it .
They make us deeply learn the facts of each of the articles that were preserved and tha reason behind it .

Moreover , the tours guides also create an environment of fun and joy .
In tours that are for an official purpose , they help us in directing the best ways to reach on time .
Later , they take us to the famous places in the city like shopping malls and multicuisine restaurants etc .

Apart from all this , tours of educational purposes like for instance , study on birds , trees etc , in forests they guide us about the safe and the unsafe locations , so that we can caution ourself while moving around .

Finally , i assume that by travelling with a guide would help us a lot , because they spend their valuable time for us .
And not the least , travelling in a group gives lots of fun and entertainment AND
