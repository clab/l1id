yes i agree with the following statement .
doing what we already know will not gives any knowledge .
trying to do new things will makes the people to learn new thing though they are risky .
with out attempt and risk we cannot get sucess.a proverb specifies that `` something is better than nothing '' .by trying something will be obtain something .

example , a scientists tried to discovered some thing .
at first he felt very risky and he is not familiar .
by trying he gathers some information .
and later he passes away and another will take off his work and continues .
he may discovered the thing .
but starting attempt he made by the person who had passed away .
though he is not succeded but by attemption he had first seeded for discovering the new thing .

all successfull people will face risks .
after taking the risks only they will acheive fame .
doing what we know will be safe but their will not be any growth and improve .
with out any improvement we will be similar a common people .
with out any acheivement in life we will fill bore .
doing what we know will not gather any experience .
and it will not be useful in lifetime .
trying for new things and leaning from the experiences will makes the life cheerful and succesful .
trying for new things will be hard at first but later we will get its fruits .

conclusion , trying to do new things will be useful at anytime .
it may not be immediatlt but later .
