Yes i completely agree with statement that in next twenty years we will defintely have a fewer cars than there today ..
I agree with that statement because i have strong supported reasons for this statement to prove ..

the main reasons for this is nowdays every country and every place on the earth is polluted with harmful gases produced by the cars and other vechiles ..
and this gases can cause lot of damage to to the world ..
so this can damage the environment .
so reductions of cars are necessary to reduce the pollution and if we want to live in this homely planet we have to reduce the cars so by reducing the pollution ..
and the other thing is that all countries are reducing the production of harmful cars in this world .

Another reason is that ther will be less cars than now is .
Every country is developed so another modes of transportion may be changed to this entire planet cars may replace planes or helicopter and etc ..
so in this fast developing era cars may change the common modes of transpotation to other modes of transportation and this developing every thing is uncertain .
to change the mode of transpotation

another reason is that there will be a lesser cars as now is that people want to live a life better life than usuasl than before so they dont to change the modes of transpotation as now that means they dont to change climatic conditions now .
so they strongly feel that cars can damage the world conditions a lot .
if we use cars which can cause pollutoin so they tend to change the habits of the people so i strongly feel that in next decade or two there will be a fewer cars in use than there are now
