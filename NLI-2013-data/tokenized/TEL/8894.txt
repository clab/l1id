Iam of the opinion that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I would like to cite my response on the students who have to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn .

I would like to explain several examples and reasons to the issue .
The students must understand the concepts and ideas .
For example , if we have a mathematical subject in our graduation course , it is very difficult to solve the problems if we are unable to understand the ideas and concepts .
So we would like to work hard on understanding the ideas and concepts even though we are unable to understand .
For better reasons we can consider the more examples in accordance with the issue .
In our daily life the ideas and concepts are more preferable when compared to learn facts .

The more reasons in support to the issue are , we will digest the concepts which are happening in our regular life once we ca n't digest those concepts we have to face more difficulties .
If we are doing a business then first of all we will learn the ideas and also how to form ideas in development of that business .
These concepts and ideas will take a major role in several applications .
If we learned the concepts more effectively , we would done a great job in our applications such as in studies , business and in our department .

In some cases the learning of facts would be a achievable thing in our goals .
Here some examples which support the learning facts , if we are able to learn the facts effectively then we can achieve some better results in the life .
