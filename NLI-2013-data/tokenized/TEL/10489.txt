Succes means to invent new things , which can be done by experiments and taking risks .
It 's not only restricted to succesful people rather than to all people who are failure too .
As succes comes only by experincing opposite results .
It will be new experience if we take risks and invent new things .
This boosts our confidence and gives a new experience .
I agree that succesful people try new things rather than doing what they already knew .

Firstly succesful people try new things because as already they tasted succes in their life this gives confidence to work more by taking risks .
Scientists are good examples for taking risks and trying new things .
If scientists does n't try news things then we wont be able to access the inventions which they made like pencillin , steam engine by james watt , aeroplane by wright brother and so on .

Secondly people try new things in which they get new experience .
If a person is doing a know work for a past few years this not only makes him boring but also losses his interest in that work .

While experimenting new things we can get more knowledge in the subject which gives us soul satisfaction .

Today we recognise scientists by their works , but we do n't recognise a daily worker in a factory .
Experiments are done by taking risks like astromer who take high risks while travelling other planets or solar system , in between they may loose their life 's by having collision with other planets or by some technical problems .
Best example for this is the well know astrnomer Kalpana chawla , who did a various experiments by taking risks .
Her experiments to land in space gave huge information of which a common people is not familiar with .

An intellectual person is well recognised by his works .
A person is seen by his achievements which he had contributed to society Hence , I totally agree that succesful people try new try things and take risks to invent new things for social well being .
