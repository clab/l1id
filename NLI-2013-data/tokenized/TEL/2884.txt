ENJOYMENT can be defined in different ways .
According to me , enjoyment or fun is the way one encounters the journey to achieve something , the satisfaction and pleasure with the people around you , etc .

Eventhough older people enjoy their lives in their own ways , I personally agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
The youth has enormous eagerness or enthusiasm to explore new things in their lives which they did not encounter in their lives and willingness to experience .
Enthusiasm combined with the energy provides them to explore different things in life such as the latest gadgets , technologies , people which makes their lives more adventurous as well as interesting .
The old people having already experienced much of their lives do not show much enthusiasm like the youth do .

The youth also have their big dreams which they fight to fulfill .
So , they plan their steps in such a way to build those dreams .
The journey they take makes their lives more interesting .
Older people , being already fulfilled or failed in their dreams , do not enjoy as much as younger people do as most of their life has been already used .

The other main point is regarding the risk they are ready to take .
The younger people prefer taking risks be it physical , financial or in any matter .
For an example regarding physical activity such as hiking , skiing , rock-climbing , etc are physical exercises which provides immense pleasure .
These activities cannot be done by older people .
In financial sense such as investments , the younger people prefer to take risks to achieve financial freedom as they wish they can resist the risk and can fall back into normal situation after some months or years .
Older people cannot afford these risks .

Lastly , there are many other things such as the communities , accessories , which younger people enjoy better than older people .
The above points show that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
