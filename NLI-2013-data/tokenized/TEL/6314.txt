`` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ''

I completely disagree with the above proposition due to the following points

TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION : The above proposition actually takes a backward step with respect to the world which is evolving technologies at a breathtaking pace .
In the next 20 years the technology would be so advanced that cars would be more efficent , more cheaper and environmental friendly .
With the way automotive innovations are progressing , a time would come when everyone in the world would opt for a car .

INDUSTRIALIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT : Till date the majority of cars are found only in the developed countries .
But with aggressive industrialization and development taking place in the developing countries which constitute a major consumer base , the scenario would completely change .
In the next 20 years , the developing countries would reach a stage where people in these countries would have more earning power and a raised standard of living .
This would naturally translate into more buying capability which would mean that , 20 years from now , majority of the of cars would be driven in these developing countries .
This in effect would increase the already existing number of cars .

EMERGING MARKETS : It has been estimated in the next 20 years , developing countries like India , Brazil and China would increase their economical prowess to the extent comparable to the likes of U.S and the European Union .
As these 3 countries constitute a major chunk of the world 's population , they would naturally form significant market for all kinds of consumer goods which would also include cars .
With the explosive and continuous growth of these developing countries , there is no doubt that there would be a high growth trajectory for the number of cars plying on the roads in future .

Hence the above 3 factors are the principal reasons why the above proposition stated is false .
