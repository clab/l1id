I agree to the statement .
There are considerable advantages and disadvantages to account the statement .
Only understanding ideas and concepts is something condemning , it sounds not true .
But learning ideas and concepts along with facts will lead to more interest for students and make their interests amplified .

As the technology is growing at a jet spead the point of learning concepts is increasing than facts .
For example consider the programing technology used in computers for maintaing its huge databases and processing of it .
We have number of technologies side by side for processing of data bases .
Student needs to learn improved technology faster than knowing its facts and hypothetical reasons .
In order keep pace of the updations one needs to learn more faster and compete with the growing world .
Students are advised to learn or supposed to learn more concepts in little time to meet the course schedule and timings of examinations .
So they have to pay more attention on concepts than facts .

Facts help us to remember the points and theories well .
For example Albert Einstein inventions and laws , without knowing the facts of laws of newton and many other works of Einstein we may not able to understand their inventions and formulas behind the derivation of those .
Considering the issues of relativity among the bodies Einstein gave a nice statement and fact , that is -- `` a boy sitting beside a pretty girl for two hours '' counts only for two minutes where as `` sitting on a stove for two minutes `` counts for two hours '' a Comical statement but a Fact .
Then from that facts Einstein brings the idea of `` relativety between bodies '' .
So there is a support to learn facts before going to learn concepts .
Without which the concept doesnt make sense at all .
Especially when considering the subjects like physics , maths etc .

So learning ideas and concepts also facts are equally important to a student inorder to establish a control over the subject .
