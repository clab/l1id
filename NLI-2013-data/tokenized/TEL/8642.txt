Knowledge is power .
Without knowledge we cannot go higher in education .
It is one of the essential part for every person in the world to take part in it .
I strongly agree with the statement that student should should understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

The main important point is that without undersatanding the ideas the student cannot learn the facts .
Learning facts is the secondary thing for a student and the primary thing is to understand the ideas and the concepts .
For example : While doing the experiment in the ld we would like to have a concept and the idea , what are the specifications what are the input and output of the experiment .
The student can do the experiment by having the priority knowledge of that experiment .
In my 12th standard i did n't attend the class of which the lab had been done the next day .
I directly went into it to do but i am unable to do that expriment .
This example is about the student should understand the idea of the auther and then proceed .

While going to do the facts directly the student should have to keep the face ideal .
Every facts in the envinorment will be related to their concepts and the ideas .
For example a student who is a 7th standard ask me about the planets when iam saing he repetedly asking about every word this is because of lack of idea and dont have concepts about the science .

It is one of the most important to have good idea and the concept about particular subject , if he is not he would have get many doubts and also dissappoints about that facts .
Facts come out from the concepts and the ideas .
without concept and idea the people cannot think about the facts .
Thus students mst have a good ideas and good concept to over come in the new tecnology .
