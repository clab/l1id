I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects is important a student up to his secondary school level , that is up to his ten plus two level .
Becuase we should be familier about all basical scinces .
It is impartent to inculcate body functioning , and body cleaning , so we need biology .
one should learn about the nature and environment in which he living .
Basical mathamatical caliculations are impartent in day-to-day life .
A person should be imported that how he should behave in the society , what are his rights and responsibilities , so he should learn social studies .
there is multidimensional devlopments are occuring in various fields of study .
There are also different interests and talents exist in each person .
It is difficult to decide a careere for a person inthe early age .
so every one should be familier with many acadamic subjects .

On the other hand dealing with many number of subjects at the same time is very difficult thing .
even there are more number of sub fields existing in a group today .
for example let us take technology .
In technology there are many number of branches existing like computer scince , electronics , mechanical and civil .
Each field is different frome other .
One ca n't reach the apex in every field .
To have good knowledge on a perticular field , it is better to devote entire time to get mastery of that perticular subject .
Doing reaserches in order to get practical knowledge is impartent .

So in my opinoin , reading many acadamics in secondary schoole level , and reading a single specialized subject from under graduate level is better to one .
