i disagree this statement .
because the student in broad knowledge will not help a lot in futher studies .
if person take a specialization in particular subject will help him a lot , and he becomes expert in his own subject .
board knowledge is mainly useful for school education only .
when he compelting school education his should have hsi own ideas in specialization course , i think specialization is mainly for graduate student .
every preson has is own specialization in studies from certain ages .
specialization of particular course will help the student a lot specialization in course help the student to become master in his desired field .
student specialization in particular coursr depends mainly on his attitude .
the student should be given a chance to take his specialization course which will mainly heilp in his studies .
ones the student had taken his desired field it will help the society a lot .
if student taken his desired field a new invention can be made .
Invetion and discovery are made by great people in their desired field .
so my opinion is taking specialization in desired field help the students and his country .
