I strongly agree with the statement `` it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
Students are required to understand ideas and concepts .
The main reason for this is the ideas are going to increase the way they think and the concepts help them to implement their taughts .
The lecturers should teach students for getting ideas for new things from there childhood .
They should give some question and tell them to implement their taughts .
Such that their brain gets more ideas when they see or come to know about a perticular point .
Suppose for an example let us take a topic in mathemetics , there are many ways to solve one perticular problem .
Here comes picture of ideas the , student thinks in many different ways to solve a perticular problem any how , these can be implemented only by concepts but not facts .
And puzzles con be solved by implementing different ideas .
Suppose a puzzle has many ways then only idea can help him to find the right way .

Facts are that which have already taken place .
Facts can be learned by there own .
One can gather facts from newspapers , magizines and many other places .
Facts are implemented earlier , before facts ideas and concepts are developed , with these development of ideas and repeatly occuring of the same thing they were recorded as facts .
Some facts may help the student but with out concepts these fact may not be understood clearly .
Facts are those they are already implemented .
These can be read and know about them and can implement only up to a certain level .
But , when an idea is striked it can be implemented by their own knowledge using concepts .
For example , scientists would read facts and keep in mind but they implement or invent new things by their own ideas and the concepts they had learned .

Finally , we can conclude that facts are developed from the implementation of ideas and concepts .
