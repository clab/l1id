Ideas , concepts and facts are very important part of a students curriculum .
A good student always looks for inventing new things or desires for conducting new research in his field of study .
For this he always looks for new ideas and concepts .
I prefer ideas and concepts are more important for student rather than facts .

An IDEA can change ur life .
We all new why NEWTON was famous .
He was sleeping beneath a apple tree when suddenly apple fell from the branch , he thought over it about why apple fell down , why didnt it go up , this concept or this idea led to the famous theory which we know as newtons law of gravity .
see what an idea can do , it created history and those who look for new ideas and concepts wiil definitely create history in their future course .
So understanding the concepts and ideas will help a student drastically .

For any student irrespective of his field of study he has to use his own ideas .
For instance a student who has joined a graduation course in the field of space explorations , he has to produce a thesis on the related subject which should be obviously a new and an intresting one .
For this altough he has to collect data from previous facts , he has to incorporate his own dimensions or views of the subject what he has learned so far .

For example the space scientists have to find out ways and means to preserve food as their expeditions require a 2-3 months stay in space where the conditions doesnt suit for preserving the foods .
The student has the chance to innovate a perfect preserving condition and for this , apart from the data he collects from facts he has to put forward new ideas and concepts to materialise this .
This can be achevied if the student clearly understands the ideas and concepts which hve been taught to him by the professors or wherever he gets information from .

Thats the reason i strongly prefer that students should understand the ideas and concepts very well rather than just learning the facts .
Learning the ideas and concepts will definitely diversify the knowledge of students and they would be capable enough for their future endeavours .
Learning and using ideas are very important in any one 's life .
