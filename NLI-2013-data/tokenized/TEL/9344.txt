I agree with the satement that `` It is more important for students to undersatand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn the facts '' because , a student can also learn easily if he undersatnd the idea and concept on the topic he is being learning .

For example , let us take an example of two students who had attended a lecture in their school .
The first students learn the topic and tries to memorise the topic in the lecture class only whereas , the second student tries to understand the lecture and put his own ideas to learn the topic .
After the few days the first student has many chances to forget the lecture which has been explained in the class whereas the second student does not forget the lecture topic .

Secondly , if a student understands the ideas and concepts of the topic he can do well in implementing his own ideas in his future whereas if a student tries to learn he cannot he might get through the present situation but will not be able pursuade in his future without the concept of understanding .
A person can be success in his life only if he understand the topic which he is learning otherwise it is nothing but saving the data into maching which cannot understand or don any thing without the help of others .

Thirdly , lets us take an example of students who are goin to appear for a competitive test .
In this the student who is understand the subject and get through the test and the student who had learn from the books will not able to succeed in the competitive exam .
One should be through with the topic he is learning .

Thus , i agree and stand with satement since a person can be successful only if he understand the ideas and concept otherwise its highly impossible to a person to successful in his life without basic ideas .
