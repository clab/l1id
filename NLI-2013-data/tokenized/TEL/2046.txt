The main topic is abot when the people enjoying there life , when they are young and old .
People do enjoy there life in every part of there lifes .
Hear we compared two kind of people who are young and the people who are older .

When you take younger one they are new to the world , they dont now what is true and what is wrong they purly depend on there parents .
They majorly have only there works they are eat , play and sleep .
They eat food to gain energy after gaining the energy they spend there energy by playing and after geting week they go for sleep .
These are the main three functions they do in there child hood .
They dont have no tention about there life .
These how children enjoy there child hood .

When you take a person who is old enough , he is totaly independent of him self .
what ever he has earned in his younger life he has rite to spend his money .
But if the person did not saved any money .
His life will become horible , no one takes care of him .
Even in that age he has to work for the daily food .
They might have even some helth prodlems in that ase there is no chance of enjoing .
In countries like U.S.A. they perfer leaving indepertant .
At the age of 15 or 16 they try to de indepatement .
they think of them self when it comes to the old age , that is the time where they need support .

I say that people enjoy there most of the life in child hood compared to old people .
