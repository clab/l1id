I , being a science student completely disagree with the above statement .
I have a couple of self experienced incidents to say this .
A person is generally inhibited with some level of knowledge which he cannot cross over .
Thus taking one subject specialised would be more beneficiary to the candidate .
I would like to quote a jug of water to support my theory .
When a jug of water is placed upto its brim it will be useful for several others to quench thier thirst but when it is overflown then it gets wasted and would be not useful for anyone .
In the same way knowledge gaining would be useful for building up good careers but it becomes unworthy when one is not mastered in any of the subject he planned .
The proverb ` SLOW AND STEADY WINS THE RACE ' can be reminded .
THEREFORE IT IS BETTER TO GET SPECIALIZE IN ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT .
let us consider the world 's greatest scientist SIR ISAAC NEWTON for this .
If he too would have concentrated on many subjects without making any thourough knowledge on anything then we would have lacked the world 's famous LAWS OF GRAVITATIONAL FORCES .
There may be exceptionalists who gain vast knowledge on various subjects but the scientific reason behind this is they possess a greater amount of grey matter in brain and are considered as super humans like EINSTEIN .
Here the fact is that one has to recognise one 's own ability of study and interest and fully justify thier choice .
this comes only through wise thinking and seeking good advices from elders .
I conclude the section that ONE HAS TO BE SELF WORTHY AND CHOOSE LESS , GAIN MORE should be the motto .
May be one 's study field is small but it must be unique and contrast .
It 's not wise to say that only by getting specilized in many would make u creative but finally ` UR UNIQUENESS ' would place one in a better status in the society .
THANK YOU !
