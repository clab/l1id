I agree that is very essential for a student to learn the basic ideas and concepts from an early satge .
Facts about a certain subject can be understood only when a foundation is laid by ideas and concepts .

Ideas and concepts form the fundamental building blocks in the learning process .
It helps one learn and understand a thought process accurately and profoundly .
It helps a person learn important aspects of a subject at an easy pace .
When a student is given the opportunity to think about an idea , a new concept is formed based on the facts .
Facts can not be changed but ideas and concepts can be altered and changed according to the interest of the student .

A student in chemistry will able to perform an experiments with ease only when he or she learns the basic fundamentals .
For instance , only when a student can understand the simple concept of what an acid or base is the , the student will be able to decide the correct steps of an experiment .

Similarly a person who goes to visit a modern art museumcan learn about facts of modern art from books , peers or from lectures .
But only when he initially develops an idea on what modern art is all about , will he enjoy the art that is displayed .

Technology is based on ideas and thoughts and not merely by facts .
Only when different concepts are put together a new product is produced which helps in the economy of a country .

Todays ' generation cannot depend on just facts to learn newer concepts .
Learning through different ideas , keeping in par with today 's current pace will help one mold ideas and thoughts for a better development .

Hence to conclude ideas and concepts are like pillars of a building without which a strong foundation cannot be laid for the developemant of the future .
