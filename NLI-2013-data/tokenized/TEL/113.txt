One need to spend at least few hours to help their communities , which ultimately helps in increasing the living standards .
I agree with the statment that young people are not spending enough time to help their communities .

Why I am holding that opinion is because of these reasons .
First younger people are now more concentrating on their studies , which is mandatory in the modern life .
Because of the cut throat competition in the modern world , they need to be good in their courses , obviously it means that they have to spend more time on their course .
So they have less chances of concentrating on the communities welfare .

Second younger generation people are more attracted towards fashion , which is ruling the campuses now a days .
For that they are spending a lot of time on clothes and jewellery .
It one of the reason why they are not involving in the community work .

Third younger people are more interested in video games and other common sports .
Because sports gives more fun , which might be one of the reason .
Why this phenomena is happening because they are not feeling responsible for the communities welfare .

It happened in my case when I was studying I am not at all intersted in community work , all the time I spent on my university work and sports .
That time I am not aware of the community benefits .
Slowly I realised the benefits of the community work in improving the living standards .

In short , younger people are not spending time on community welfare , but by the guidance they will know the importance .
