I believe that it is better to have a broad knowledge of multiple academic subjects than to be a specialist in only one .
The primary reasons for this belief are the balance a student gains from having broad knowledge and the interrelationships that exist between different subjects .

Lets start by looking at the importance of balanced knowledge .
Being good in multiple subjects such as finance and strategic management will allow a management consultant to give advice taking multiple scenarios into consideration .
On the other hand , a specialist in finance would be able to give a solution solely in terms of bottomlines resulting in a less practical solution for the customer .

The second advantage is that a company needs to hire one student competent in two fields , rather than spend more resources hiring two experts .
In addition , having two experts who do n't understand each other could result in an inferior solution because of the lack of agreement .

The final reason is the interrelationships between subjects .
For example , a physics scientist has to use complex mathematical formulas for proving some of his conclusions .
If he was specialized in physics alone , he may not be able to prove his theories unlike a scientist who is good at physics and math .

In conclusion , while a specialist may have value in certain situations , the better value proposition that a balanced student brings to the table and the multiple options he has in his career outweigh the advantage of specializing in one subject .
