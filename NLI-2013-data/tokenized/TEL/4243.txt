No i donot agree with the statement .
Youngsters are now a days really looking active to spare time for helping their communities .
community may mean by area , by religion , by race and many .
Now a days youngsters have been looking for helping their home countries in a big manner .
I have many reasons to support my statement .
In olden days youngsters used to work hard for themselves and their families .
But its different in the modern case .
youngsters are being in the front row of doing service to all of their communities .
They help them in all the fields .
Donating blood to the people in need , helping old people , ladies in all aspects .
Students are conducting welfare programmes , encouraging poor students by giving scholarships , helping the flood affected people by joining the natural disaster schemes and many to tell .
The young people who are working in corporate jobs having been sparing time on saturdays and sundays in serving the needy .
They are enjoying happiness of helping in such manner .

I had an example to support my staement .
The following example took in my native place guntur .
A small boy who is affected with a viral fever named denguea fever is in need of blood as blood from his body has been completely going out .
So one student gave 2000 rs to that persons father and asked him to give an advertisement regarding the need of blood .
As my blood group too was the same i went to the hospital to donate .
By the time i went there were about 800 students who came there to donate .
The boy in need is not a brother or relative of anybody .
But all the students came there as they had the intention of helping people in their community .

Another best example for supporting my statement is the army of our country .
According to the records of 2005 our army contained 80 % of youngsters who were even ready to offer their lives for their mother land .

Finally i strongly stand by my word that young people of modern times are sparing more time for helping their communities .
