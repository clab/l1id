The entire education system is so planned that an individual first gains knowledge about many academic subjects and then , after deciding his field of interest , he moves towards specialization in a specific subject of his interest .
My opinion is that it is better to specialize in one subject .
Therefore , I disagree with the staement that it is better to have a braod knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

I would define specilization as becoming an expert in whatever field we choose .
The main reason to hold this opinion is that ordinary people rely more on specialists for information about a subject .
When people are more comfortable in one or two subjects , then they can continue with that subject and become specialists .
Also , specialists from different fields can come together and solve a problem better rather than people who lack in-depth knowledge about different fields .

It is better to study the subject in which we are interested rather that try to get knowledge of many subjects which donot interest us .
A jack of all trades will become good for nothing .
A person will be comfortable to study the field in which he is interested .
In this way specialization will make every one do their best and contribute to the society in a better way .

There are various fields of specialization in medicine .
People do go to a general physician when they have small and general problems like fever , head aches and body pains .
The physician does an overall check-up and if he finds some serious problem then he recommends a patient to a specialist who deals with that problem .
If specialists were not there , then it would become difficult for a general physician to deal with the numerous problems that human body can face .
This applies to all other fields such as engineering and research .

There are some situations when a broad idea of different subjects are needed .
In such cases , experts from different fields acn come together and solve the problem .
This applies mainly to research where many factors are to be considered for one specific task .
