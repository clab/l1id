I disagree with the statement , that it is better to have wide knowledge of many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I believe that jack of all will never be master of none .
Broad knowledge over many subjects will never make any person perfect .
In the competetive world people are preferred with specialiation rather than with out any specialiation .

Broader knowledge in many subjects is good but one should have specialiation in his majors , so that he can find a good career in the particular subject .
PhD is the high academic degree , and those with PhD 's are very specialised in a particular subject .
They are considered to be the experts in that particular field .
They have wide oppurtunities due to their expertise .

Most of the higher degrees require to do a specialisation in a particular subject .
It is because to make the student perfect in that particular field which will help him to build a good career .

In the world most the discoveries and inventions are made by the subject experts , who have a good knowledge in the particular field of invension .
All these invensions are possible only because of their specialization .

Usually in schooling we will be learning many academic subjects to get familarize with them and to know in which subject we have interest .
Later we will be choosing interested subjects and will do a specialisation in that particular subject .

All the companies require experts in particular field , a person having a broader knowledge in various subjects will not be considered as a competent person for a particular job .
I believe getting a broader knowledge in various subjects is very difficult , and more over it will not fetch even .
Most of the universities are preferring to produe students with higher degrees who hava a specialisation .
This indicates the importance of having a specialisation .

In conclusion I believe a specialisation in particular subject is very much use ful for career and ultimately for the beterment of life .
