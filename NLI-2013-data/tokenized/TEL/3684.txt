I 'm of the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Firstly , the activities most of the youngsters do are chatting on phones , surfing information , hanging out with friends , going out for movies , restaurants and the list goes on .
They do not even give enough time for their studies too .
The activities they do will not fetch them anything worthful .
Their psychology can be understood easily .
All of them think in the same way .
They like to play games and want to enjoy their teenage life by not taking any responsibilities .
Instead of spending time on watching movies one can utilise the same for a good cause .
Students in primary schools are made to participate in such programs so that they will follow the same later on .
For example many of the schools in my city participated in a program called `` Janmabhoomi '' a program meant for keeping the city clean and green .
But these activities are not followed later by most of the students .
They become reluctant towards doing these activities .

Secondly , they do not show active participation in community activities like keeping it clean and green , improving the existing conditions of the society and working for the welfare of the community .
They are the one who can improve the standard of living of the communities .
I think every teenager should take the responsibility of helping their communities .

In sum , i would like to reiterate myself that youngsters should give out time to helping their communities .
