I agree with the statement .
Young people enjoy life more than older people .
There are several reasons for me to support the statement .

First of all , because they are young , they will have lot of energy and curiosity to try several things in the world .
Most of the young people have very few responsibilites towards their families .
When parents provide all the amenities what all they wanted , they have nothing to worry , so they can enjoy alot .
Most of the time young people will be healthy which give them enthusiasm to enjoy thier lives .
But still not all the young people enjoy lot , some people will have lot of familily burden if his or her parents passed away or cannot looking them properly .
So they will earn their bred and butter their own .
They even provide financial support to the family .
That kind of young people are more matured , so they enjoy and feel happy helping their families .

Older people cannot enjoy as much as young people do , the first reason is , they have more responsibilites towards familily .
They have to look after their children , they have to provide good education to them and they need to earn sufficiently for the survival of the family .
Moreover once they become little older they will concentrate more on the responsibilies , status and their reputation in the society .
So they will have very less interest towards the enjoyment .
In fact they enjoy by looking at their children 's enjoyment .
Another reason is when a person become old , many of the people will suffer from various health problem , even those problems make them dull and hamper their enjoy .

For example , I always observe two of my neighbour 's children .
They always wanted to visit some or the other place to visit .
They never bother for their studies .
Whenever I ask them why do not they bother for studies and always wants to roam here and there , they always give me one answer , this is only the time to enjoy , once we become little older , then need to serious about careen and then marriage , then family extention and then taking care of them , so we never be free of problem to enjoy as we are now .

In a nutshell , I do agree that young people will enjoy lot when compare with older , because they are free from responsibilies and problems .
They are healthy and more energitic .
