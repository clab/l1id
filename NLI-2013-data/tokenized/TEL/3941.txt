`` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . ''
This essay is in defense of this statement .
Youth today are obsessed with making a quick buck .
The youth idolises glamour and success .
The fact that today 's youth icons are rock and movie stars is hard evidence of this fact .
As a result , `` us '' takes a back seat to `` me '' .

Today 's youth is a victim of an economy that is driven by material consumption .
We are programmed to `` need '' material objects .
The media-from magazines to television to cinema , belches out content that is designed to lower self-esteem and , more subtly , put the identity of the youth in jeopardy .
Thus , we get obsessed with defining `` self '' , and tend to forget that `` self '' cannot exist by itself .
It is the community that defines the individual , and not vice-versa .

How many of us are aware of the goings on around the world ?
How about the next door neigbour .
Are we aware of his or her problems ?
Some of today 's youth do n't even know about the problems in their own family , let alone the community .
For example , for those of us who have grandparents , few actually try to get to know them , and the care senior citizen population is one of the most pressing problems in society today .
Society is plagued by problems and we fail to see that it is we who will inherit them .
Ignoring them will not make them go away .

A start would be to open our eyes to problems of this world .
`` Forewarned id forearmed '' , as they say .
