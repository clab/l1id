The technological development today has proved itself also in the fields of automobiles .
So it ca n't be said that there will be fewer cars in use after twenty years than today .
Though there are problems which are faced today due to pollution and resourses decline , our technology has solutions to each and every problem .

There are many technological innovations in the field of automobiles , and year many new designs and varieties of cors are being invented for more comforts .
The cars which are designed today are using less fuels snd they are pollution free , which will be going to improve further in the next twenty years .

The cars which run on biogas are presented in the market , they are creating no pollution , the fuel used is cheap and is available easily in atmosphere too .
Though they are in less use today because of their high cost they may be used in the future in large demand according to the manufacturers assumptions because the costs of production of these cars may decrease in future .

Moreover in the coming years the world will be more developed and will be very busy too .
A fast travelling media is necessary for every one who work away from home or go to colleges etc .
Even the ordinary man can afford the car because their costs will be reduced due to high production and can drive the car too .
Just like the costs of two wheelers have decreased the costs of the cars is also expected to decrease further so that the ordinary man also can afford the car .
because the large population of the world is of the middleclass people .

Also the use of more advanced cars which run on biogas , a pollutionfree fuel will become must to reduce the atmospheric pollutions , the the use of these cars will be more demand among the rich people for the sake of their prestige and pride because they are more expensive cars .

Hence in coming twenty fears tere will be more cars in use than today .
