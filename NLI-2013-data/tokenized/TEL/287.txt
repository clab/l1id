I agree with the statement , because in my view , it is only understanding ideas and concepts for an efficient learning in addition with practicality of the facts .
In childhood we had learnt everything practically .

A student in school or collge should select to his/her interesting subjects , and he/she can even research to invent new things .
Idea an concept behind a thing may seems to routine of any other also , but there would be minor differences which have to be explored by a student and even teachers should help students to do that .

Early mankind , before 15th centuary , was not aware of the practical strategies that are going around him , physically and chemicaly .
In two to three centuries before now people started exploring the world around them to make a better lively-hood for them and their family .
In the same way a student would grasp ideas and concepts with interest of learning facts which seem to be amazing for the student .

Teachers should give much support to the students who seem to be more enthusiastic in learning and would make the country to be proud of the student .
Student should make practical imagination to explore more ideas to enjoy the subject .
