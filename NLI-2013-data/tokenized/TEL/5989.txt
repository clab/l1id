most of people use car as a part of their daily life for travelling .
there are other ways of travelling like moter cycles , aeroplanes and trains but these ways of travelling have its own drawbacks .

consider the case of motercycles :
these are felt useful only when travelling distance less than 10 km .
if the distance increases we feel uncomfortable with motercycles .
moreover people see car as a status symbol
consider the case of travelling by means of trains :
teh train timmings are fixed and are not flexible to our reruirements and the facilities are not htat much good in all trains .
we must be there at station strictly by time if we are littile bit late we will miss required train
consider the case of travelling by means of aeroplane :
though the facilitie s in planes are good it is suitable only for travelling larger distances that is more than 200 km and more over cost of travelling by planes is not affordable to every one and timmings are not flexible to our requirements .
construction of airport requires huge land and capital
now consider the benfits by travelling in our own car :
firstly the timmings are flexible to our requirements .
we fell more comfortable in car than motercycle or train .
it also reflect our status .
in countrys like india people strive for status and most of the people buy cars to show their status .
more over in car around four people can travel at a time saving travelling fares .
we can travel to rural areas were travelling by train or plane is not possible .
we can enjoy reading books magazines novels etc and listening to music sitting in seat behind driver .
we can even watch movies traveling in car .
we can stop at any place we want .
more over complete all our works which are in the route by travelling in car which is not possible in case of travelling by train .

Thats why i agree to the statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer in use than there are today ''
