Yes , I completely agree with the statement `` YOUNGPEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE DO '' .
We live our lifes to our fullest when we are young , leaving behind the worries and the intricasies of old age .
So i feel that young people enjoy life more due to their being more energitic , with young minds fresh from college , with lots of ideas that are trying to creep out .

`` OLD IS GOLD '' is a popular saying the some people advocate .
They think that older people are more experienced and know the ways of the world better that the younger blood .
But I feel that a younger blood has lot of energy to offer and can work for a cause with a greater intensity than a older indivisual can .
Like , a project to be completed with a deadline .
A younger person can work late nights and will finish the project no matter what come in his way .
He will work harder to make a place for him in this world .

The older people have mind that are worn out , by age , by time .
Whereas a younger mind have lot of ideas to offer .
These are fresh brains , that have come right from college , filled with all sorts of new tools and the virgour to put those tools to action .
And also there is no burden of a family to support .
A younger person has more time to finish a job at hand than his older counterpart as he has to spend time with his wife , his chilldren , his home ... , this list can go endless .

Above all the dating of girl , gives you so , divine a feeling that hardly can be expressed by words .
We can date a lot of girls , enjoy parties , go to different clubs , chill out and do whatever we like .
There is none to stop us or brooding over us to get home quickly , as your son is getting late to go to his soccer practice or your daughter has to go to beauty parlour .

I feel that this world is meant for the younger generation , and they have to live life to the fullest in this period only .
