I agree with the topic given that is `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
First of all i agree with the topic because when you have a good knowledge on the academic subjects you can do well in the upcoming future .
Because now-a-days no one is looking for specific task that they has to perform so thats the reason one should have the concepts of all academic subjects .

For example considering an civil engineer he should be able to handle all the problems which will occcur during the desinging , construction and finally during the final estimated cost of the plan which he has to do the project , so he able to handle the problems which are going to occur during soil investigation , planning and desinging of a structure .
This example explains as a part of a civil engineers view .

Another example is that now-a-days the software companies are looking for proffessional students never bothered about to which branch they are related and also they are giving training about the work they had to do for the company and they are selecting on the basis of the academic subjects what they had .

From my point of view everyone should have a overall view about the all academic subjects to improve their sklls regarding and they can furnish knowledge on every subject and they can move relatedly to their work which can improve their living and they can be lived happily whatever resources they are getting from each topic and also they can improve their knowledge about the latest techniqes are going to come and accordingly they can improve their strategies what they had about the latest techniques .

Finally my conclusion regarding to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject is that we can improve our knowledge on each subject and its modifications can also be studied to benefit ourselves and can live a better life which should be foremost important to us .
This makes my conclusion about the topic `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
