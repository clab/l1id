Why only few individuals in the society are successful ?
Why not everyone succed in their career ?
A perfect answer to this question is that not everyone try new things and take risk in their life .
People commonly opt for safe and secured paths of life .
Usually , people follow the most commonly used path and never try to explore new ways and means to get to their destination .
Very few make use of their novel ideas to acheive respective goals .
This emphasises the significance of following creative trends and taking up risky challenges to end in success .

Scientists are the living proof for stating that ` Success results from exploration and risk taking '' .
Very few turn into scientists because of their innovations and research where in they try to find out new procedures by experimenting in a different fashion other than common people who do it in an already known way .
Best example i can ever quote is about a professor in our medical school who tried to cure cancers in a different form of therapy called Brachy therapy rather than the reguraly followed modes of treatment like Chemotherapy or Surgey .
My professor experimented with the new technique built up by his ownknowledge and experience .

Students who take unrelated courses rather than regular ones may land in success soon .
In addition , they have proved that nothing is impossible if you try hard to acheive a goal .
For instance , one of my best friends registered in the courses likeTheatre recording and Video taping as soon as he finished his under graduation which is nothing but taking a risk as he is not sure of his success with his creative idea of taking a different course in his graduate studies .
However , all our classmates found his act to be surprising and concluded that he is going to end up in defeat and can never succed in his career as he opted for an irrelevant course from his undergraduate studies .
To everyones surprise , today my fried is one of the highest earners of the year by working in the Theatre recordings and Videa taping centres .

In conclusion , i personally believe that success is never sought with out exploring novel ideas and involvement of risk .
Infact , i have learnt from my personal experiences of life regarding my professor and my close friend that one has to take risk and try something new rather than following everyone in the society .
