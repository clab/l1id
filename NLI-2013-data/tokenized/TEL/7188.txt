The basic purpose of using a vehicle is to move from one place to other .
Each one of us would like to travel comfortably and reach our destination quickly and safely .
In order to have a comfortable travelling experience people prefer to use a personal vehicle rather than using a public vehicle .
I disagree with the given statement and I personally feel that in the next twenty years , more number of cars would be used than there are today .
As people tend to look for more comfort rather than expences .
In the next twenty years lot of things are going to change in the living style .
With the dovelopment of the science and technology at this rapid pace a lot of luxurius things are going to be invented and the human life tend to become more comfortable and luxurius .
Car is also one of the primary comforts of the man .
Its a medium of transport the allows the person to have a comfortable journey .
As time passes that man tend to grow economically and socially .
A car has become a symbol of social and economic status .

An other reason I would think of more in number if cars in the future is the increase in the standard of automobile technology and the competetion between the automobile manufacturing companies .
Due to this competetion the automobile companies start decreasing the prices of the cars and thus the cars are available at a more cheaper and affordable cost .
The decrease in the prices of the cars and increase in the economic status of the people results in more people buying in cars and the is that more number of cars will be in use in the next twenty years .

Finally , one more reason for people to use a car is to save the time .
If you are using a public a public vehicle they will not be available at your time of need .
There are some fixed timings and they follow that .

Hence , I disagree with the given statement and personally feel that the usage of cars will increase rapidly in the future .
