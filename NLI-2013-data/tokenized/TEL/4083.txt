young people now a days doing a lot of work for their communities by running OLD AGE HOMES , & CHILD HOMES .
many old people in the community are send to the OLD AGE HOMES for their better life .
children in the street are send to their child homes .

practically people are busy in this year , but indirectly the young people are sending money for old age homes .
they are contrubuting 10 % of their income to churches & charity trusts .

mainly people are engaged to earn money for their good lives .
i think contrubuting money to the poor is also a indirect help to the people .
which helps alot for their survival .

my own experience , my uncle 's old grand father used to serve their old parents in their home in olden days .
and he used to serve the community .
but my uncle used to serve their own parents by sending them to old age home .
my uncle used to send money for their expenses to the hostel management .
they were given excellent medical treatment by the 24 hr doctor facility .
they were taken better care & good food i think it is better because my uncle is a job holder. & aunty was expired .
he is not having time to see his parents , so i think it better way for the old people to stay in the hostel , where his son will meet them every day evening .

coming to point my uncle is paying high amount for the hostel , that 6 people can survive with that amount in that hostel .
i think he is indirectly helping community for the improvement .

in olden days many people not having proper jobs & mainly doing agriculture as main occupation in that time the people having more time to serve the community .
but in moderen days people not having sufficient time to sleep also .
in this situation i think helping the community .
throug practical approach is impossible .
so as SATYAM COMPANY people are adopting several villages around their localty , they are providing water , health facilities , schools , etc to the ; people in the village .

it is mainly succesful because by getting profits to that company , by doing hard work by its job holders .
i think by doing their job perfectly they are doing service to the people arround the village , it is indirect help doing by satyam company job holders finally i conclude , involuntary work can also led to service to the community like i stated above .
