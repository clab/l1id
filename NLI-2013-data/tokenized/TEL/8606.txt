The statement given to me is `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' I completely disagree with the statement because without learning facts its mere waste on spending time on ideas and concepts .
Learning facts help us to grow knowldege and to know what is right and what is wrong ...
FACT is a powerful word used in this society .
Without knowing the facts we cannot know or we cannot take a step forward to start anything new until and unless we r told about that fact .
It bulids the curiosity of an induvidual .

For example recently we see that Sunitha Rao an astronomist went into space and she is residing over there for 6 months to know all the so called facts over there in the space ...
she stated that she has seen the planet Earth from the space as that of a small star ...

As such students they should know the facts about everything around themsleves ...
if a fact is known then we can understand the ideas behind it bring out all the concepts in that particular fact ...
They help us in bringing out the universal truths into light .
They help us in buliding up our knowledge and our skills too .
We get interest to invade most of the facts hidden in particular thing in which a fact is there ...

Coming to the part of ideas and concepts of understanding as im aganist to it .
They help in just bringing out the idea or concept behind that ...
thats all .
But knowing the facts is very essential .

Last but not the least FACTS play a very imporant role in ones induvidual life and curiosity is increased for a knowing the fact ...
