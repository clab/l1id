I agree with statement that nowadays young people do not give enough time to help in their communities .
Today the people are busy with their own work and jobs that they have .
They are not showing any interest about their communities .
Mainly young people are not spending time to help their communities , they are just seeking their own tasks and busy with thier necessary and unnecessary works .

Mainly people are not showing much interest in their own communities itself , they are just hiding everything and they are not showing any care of their own communities , I had faced many events , they are just going on their own ways and they never think about the community they live but they are just enjoying what the community provide for them .
Mostly young people have no enough time to help thier communities , they just not showing any interest of community .

Young people are the essential people to spend thier own time to help community , if they spend time on helping communities the natoin and poeple automatically improves .
Young ones have to play major role in helping communities but these days it is quite not going , the younger ones ar spending their much time in enjoying and some other unnecessary things and they are not have enough time to even spend time with their parents .

Nowadays the culture and communities are very much changed , youngers are showing much of thier skills in wrong manners and some of them even they dont know what they are doing , they are wasting much of thier time time by chating with thier friends and participating in unnecessary events and showing thier interests in their own likes and dilikes and no one is thinking and caring about the society and the communities .
