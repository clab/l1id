I do agree with the statement that Young people enjoy life more than older people do because there attitiude is totally different from the older people .

Young people during there college days they spent in studing and playing games and aslo they prefer to go the pary or an some vocation places to spent their time , the young student like spend most amount of their time friends and others which help them to interact with differnt type of people in order to know more about the differnt things but the older people will think in different way they like to sit in a home and think about differnent things such as house hould things , and many many other related things they feel very stressful life .

young people does'nt have a stressfull life they allways think about their carrier related part of the life rather than thinking in different way , they does'nt have the burden of their family that their family have , during thier free time they like to spend most amount of time with friend and with collegemates , they often try to for the tour to the different places , and when a callege camp is there they try to enjoy their life in campus camp and at the same they can gain mor knowledge about different things .
for example paticulary when young people try to go for a long tour to some himalayas they often enjoy the time with an real aspect because they like to do more advanture game like skating , climbing the moutains which they enjoy during that period of that time and most often older people do not wish to do like that .
so this is one of the real ascpect of the enjoyment which they prefer to do it .
the young people will not face more amount of stress because they are more mentally active because they paticipate in the different activity like sports which make them more enjoyable .

Young people are more energetic , they totally think in a differnt wave length and they like to spend most of the time in an enjoyable mood .
