Y do people stick to the one particular entity ?
if it so , it is not the nature of a human being .
As the god has given a brain to think about what he is doing and what to do , he has the choice of doing his own experiments without causing any disturbance to the others .

yes !
I agree with the people who are succesful in doing the thingss ang got succeded in different aspects , will automatically tend to try to do new things , its all depends on his ability to do and way of approaching ideas in doing that thing .
people who are successful in thier previous inventions get more motivated in doing the new inventions , tats himself proves his ability to do and thinks himself to satnd in a high position when compared to others .

The successful tend to do or invent more new things , they doesnot think about the risks that occur at the time of his work , his own expereince gets him out of the risk and encourage him to do invent new things .
For example the people who invented televisions which are black and white , on the successful inventing that telivision poeple are more intrested in inventing the colouredtelevisions , hence because of the succesful people mind , they tend to invent more and more things which are more better than the previouinventions .
hence the people who has ability to take risk can invent more better number of inventions for the world .

The another example is the invention of electric bulb , the person who invented the bulb invented the advanced form of the bulb , hence people who invent the new things with more effective results will be ready to take the risks .
these people are the example for the remaining one , who are the beginning in the invention .
hence the successful people are the who are ready to take the risks and they know how to face the risks rather than doing that of the previous work in a better way .

Hence i strongly agree with the people who try to invent new things .
if the people does not tend to invent new things now the technology we have is not there in front of us , if the successful people are not taken the risks in that particular who would not haveenjoyed the latest technolgy now we have .
hence i strongly agree to the people who are trying to invent new things , we should encourage them rather than dissapointing them in their inventory .
