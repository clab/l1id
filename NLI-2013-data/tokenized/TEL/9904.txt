People try new things and take risks and some people do the things which they already know .
Failures are stepping stones to success .
Some people take the risk and fails but they take it as an example .
They learn the situations where they did mistakes .
They examine the total process and they find the mistakes in that .

In all situation it is not possible because if the person investing the money in a business if he got loss he become helpless .
It is not possible to take risk in all situations it depends on the situation .
Risks are must for to invite the new things .
Right brothers failed in inventing the aeroplane for the first time but they didnot left it .
Atlast they invented the aeroplane .
If people donot take the risk there is no new thing in this world .
For some risks they last their lives also .
Behind the success there may be risk but risk is not the one which gives success .
There are many people who are succeded without the risk .

Risk will not work in all the situations .
People will take up the business which is already established and famous through this there is no problem for them .
It gives more comfort for them .
If the people take the risk there is the probability for their success .
The risk taken by the people must be helpful for the mankind .
People invite the explosives but they are helpful for the mankind .
They destroy the countries .
If the people invented the bombs also it is not the success .
It is a big failure .

People will be succeded if they older things also .
If the already known work is in proper manner then it is much easier them to follow it and they become successful persons very easily .

From this i can conclude that some people take risks and become successful persons and some people do the things which are already known .
