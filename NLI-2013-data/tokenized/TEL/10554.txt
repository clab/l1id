without hardwork and risks , we cant succeed in our life .
I totally agree with the statement .
Only by doing some new things , we can invent something new in this world ..
Alonso was f1 formula race winner last time .
He tried new things in the track , through that he won the tournament .
He got lots of risks but finally he won the touranmentThat is important .
Every field needs news things to done .

In the medicine field , every successful scientist need to do some new things .
Only then they can invent some new drugs .
By doing already known things that will help us to do the particular thing perfectly .
But by trying new things it gives some suceess in our life .
For example , once Michael sczhumager was succesful man in f1 formula race .
But , last time he didnt performed well and he has been replaced by Alonso russian driver .
Main reason for his failure was ferrari formula car , because he havent tried his drive with other engines like mclaren , tata etc .
Thats why he couldnt win last tournament .
Till there is no drug found to cure HIV virus .
People who have completed their doctarate in this domain , they need to research on new things regarding to this disease , only then its possible to find drug for this disease .

Only by trying new things , victories , new invention can be made .
Thats why most of the successful person tries with new things rather than only doing what they already know .
