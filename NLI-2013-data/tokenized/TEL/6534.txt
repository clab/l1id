Even now , there are different types of varieties in a car .
Like ambassador , Maruthi Zen , Indica etc .
Early people use to buy the ambassador cars , at the time the cost of it is very high , but its cost got reduced and a very few people are using it .

Another example , before cars used to produce more sounds during its running and it used to release more amount of posionous gases like cabonmonoxide and some nitrogen gases .
These gases effects not only people who walking on the roads but also the person who is driving it .
