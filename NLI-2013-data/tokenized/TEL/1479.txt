According to me i feel that it is the best thing for a person to have better knowledge about specialized subject rather than seeking knowledge about several subjects for several reasons .

Firstly seeking knowledge about a particular subject can make him a master in that subject .
He can expertise soley in the subject .
for example if you are interested in general science .
You can concentrate on that subject only and know the subject study the subject deeper .

Secondly a person can study the sub jecft and know the deeper strengths and lines of the subject .
the person can get a chance to know and study more details about the subject .
In contrast if we concentrate on all subjects we may not achieve perfecton in any of them .

Thirdly there is a saying that a person can do only one thing at one time .
for example if a person dream is to become a scientist , it is of no use if he concentrate on other subjects such as economics or arts etc .
Although they are only important for him to have a basic idea about this subjects not any thing thing more because they donot contribute him to reach his target or his destination .

fourthly a person may get several opportunities in future which may wecome him or her .
for example if a person attends an interview he or she may be asked that in which subject or area you are specialised , or interested .
Based on his specilization of subject the interviewer may ask the questions .
A person gets an opportunity to be an expert or master of his subject being specialised .

To sum up although other academic subjects are also basically important to seek knowledge but it is always a good idea or beneficiary to be an expert in any particular subject .
It is bette to lspecialize in one rather than mixing of all other subjects .
