The use of cars has been rapidly increasing day by day .
This is because of its convienience and prices which have gone down .
Most of the middle class class people are also able to get the car because of the prices and discounts offered by the manufacturers .
Once car has been a luxury but now it is a common mans vehicle .
Its become easier way to move around and convienient for many to go .

In the coming twenty years the rate of cars in usage will be more .
I completly disagree with the given state ment .
The usage of cars when compared with the past times has increased three times .
And when the prices are going down there will be increase in number of car usagers and numbers of cars in usage .
Cars are more convinient to travel and more number of people can be accomodated at a time .
When comfort is coming in a lower price and in such inexpensive manner people are going to make use of the comfort .

Inpresent day it self a medium class man is able to take a car , in the coming years the bikes which are used now will be replaced by cars .
Once buying a car was rich mans choice .
The price was high and normal man could not effort to get it .
But now it has reached the common man .
In an other twenty years its going to be a need rather .
All the bikes will get replced by cars .

So in future there will be a boom for cars and there will be increased number of cars when compared to present .
This might cause some negative effects but people look for convinience and easier way for transportation which is the general tendency of people .
