Always its helpful to learn and understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
i agree with this statement , because ideas and concepts form the basic building blocks of any subject .
Learning i deas and concepts lot of expertise what do we need in any particular field , for example , if we consider a child trying learn how to ride byscle .
In this process if we taught him the key ideas and concepts of riding a byscle , which are fristly blancing ofbyscle in order not fell from byscle on to ground .

secondly about how to move the byscle forward , which is done by paddling the byscle in a cyclic maner .
if the child coherently does the paddling and balancing of byscle , he may ride the byscle with out anybodys help .
The child may drive a motro bike with little help from his friends or parents he knows the basics of riding a byscle .

If we consider ideas and concepts for students carrier , they are also important in thire life .
for example , if student dont understands the key ideas and concepts from his class work its difficult for him to write the end exams as wel as to particxipate any type of quizs conducted on the basis of the concepts and ideas .

if a student is best at understanding ideas and concepts in a subject , he will be getting good grade in his examination .
on the other hand if he undersatnds only facts which are asscociated with that subject , consequently routing to a end which is quite dangerous for his carrier .

But in some cases facts are more important than that of ideas and concepts in order to live a pleascent life .
so according to me i whish to learn ideas and concepts asscociated with any sort of subject .
which will lead to a better understanding of the subject .
so i prefer learning ideas rather than knowing facts .
