I agree with the statement that '' most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are '' .
Usually the products in the advertisements are shown to be more good looking , elegant , tasty , good texture , and all the higher qualities , for which most of the times they do n't possess all those qualities .

For example take an advertisement of suiting 's and shirtings , the dress they show seems to be very beautiful and attractive , elegantly coloured , but the same when you see truely may not be so good , the stiching may not be so perfect , the colour shades may not be appropriate and it may not fit well .

The other example , if we take the advertisements regarding the food products , they show them to be very tasty and delicious and they also shows that they can be prepared within few minutes , but actually when we really taste them they may not be that delicious , or it may even take long time for preparing it .

Even the advertisements on variuos medical products show that the medicine works really faster , in a more efficient way , and they show all the things that make us appeal that the product is of superior quality , but in real they may be associated with various side effects and may act differently on different individuals or even the costs may be higher .

For example once i was watching an advertisement over the television which was an equipment use for reducing weight .
The advertisement said that we got to workout only for 15minutes on that equipment and no diet necessary and it would make you lose about 5 pounds per week , and even they were showing some of the people and their experiences who used that product and by looking at all those i was so tempted to buy the product and ordered it , but once when i got the product and started using for few days , i could n't see any lose in my weight but i also notice knee pain problems by using that equipment .
So , with that i clearly came to know that never beleive in advertisements as they usually make the products seem better that they really are to increase their sales .

So , atlast I strongly agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem better as , that this the primary job of advertising in order to increase their sales and benefits , and it 's our duty to carefully judge the true characteristics of the product and decide whether to buy or not .
