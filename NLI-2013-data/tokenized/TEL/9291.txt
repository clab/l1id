The concepts and the ideas that a person has developed in a particular subject is a direct implication of the amount of profound knowledge that he has acquired in that subject .
In my view understanding the ideas and the concepts is more important for a student that to learn the facts .
Facts just act as the supporting information to the concepts and the ideas , but they do not play a major role in learning about the subject .

In any major stream , the person who knows the concepts and who is capable of understanding the ideas will have the leading voice .
For example , in a software industry the facts are not at all considered .
They just act as the background information for the work that should be done .
The main thing that matters is the concepts and the ideas .
Furthermore , if we take any entrance exam or any academic examination the main emphasis is on the type of the ideas that student is capable of generating for a particular problem .
A minor importance is given to the facts .

Fact just support the ideas and the concepts .
They act as the evidences only .
For example , many of the scholars and the scientists had a firm believe in their concepts and the ideas and moved forward but they never considered the facts .
Only after they arrive at a conclusion about the study upon which they are working , then they co-relate this result with the facts .
Fact are not reliable .
Generally facts change when a new discovery has been made .
But the concepts and the ideas will not change .
They are the building blocks of the subject .
Facts just support the concepts and the ideas .

Further , when a person has a strong knowledge about the facts about a particular subject , which generally tend to change then he may not have a profound knowledge about the subject .
The amount and the depth of the concept that an individual has in any core subject is a basis on which his knowledge in the subject is measured .
And also , a person who has the keen and the depth knowledge is likely to get fruitful results than to a person whose main emphasis is on the facts .

Furthermore , in an elementary school and in the high when the students are at a tender age the main emphasis is upon the concept but not on the facts .
Facts are given minor importance there .

In sum , i think that the ideas and the concepts play a major role for a student than when compared to the facts .
