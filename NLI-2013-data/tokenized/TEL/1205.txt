I agree with the statement , It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Broad knoledge on many accademic subjects play an imortant role in the future as ample exposure to all the profficional subject , get an analytical sills , know all the things about the society .
In my view broad nowledge get only taking many accademic subjects offered by the university .

Knowledge is gain only by learning more things in the world .
Todays world is globaliged one thats why we learn more things .
we grip on many subject we get ample exopsure greatly and easily .

Secondly , analyticall sills are use full for every person in the society they get by learning different subjects .
They give broad variety of knowledge to communicate easily with the others .

All accademic subbjects are related to the our proffictional programming .
Those are use full in the future .
Those subjects give thining ability to your mind .
Besides specialization subjects they give stenth to your mind .

Some times i thin that many of the academic subjects for upto undergraduate level are more usefull to get wide varitey of knowledge , after complition of undergradute , concentrate on the specialized subject that is related to our proffectional academics that time its gives an more information about specialize subgect and accuire good knowledge easily and quickly .
More evere concentration also play an important role in specialized subjet .

In sum of all the above important points , many academic subjects give broad nowledge than the single specialized subject .
many accademics provide skills , good knowledge thinking , strenthen his education period .
so it is better to take many subjects .
