In this world there are three kinds of people who are very much responsible for their own happiness , problems .
They do not want to take advises from the others .
They do n't want to share their problems with the others .
The three kinds of people are young people , middle age people and old people .
Here we discuss about the young people and the old people .
Is young people are enjoying the life or the old people are enjoing the life .

From the statement , I agree with it that young people enjoy life more than older people do because the young people are in the right age to enjoy .
They can go anywhere they want but the older people cannot .
From the morning till night the young people are enjoying a lot in sleeping .
i.e. wake up late in the morning some people wake up early in the morning so that they can do some work outs where as old people cannot .

The young people own there personal bike and cars through which they can enjoy the whole roads while travelling and they can also travell to long distances with their friends .

In the third reason I want to discuss about how the young people are enjoying in the night .
After the college hours and in weekends i.e. in the evening hours the young people enjoy a lot in going to movies , pubs , discos , and some weekend programs or functions .
Where as the old people connot enjoy all these parties in the evening hours and in the weekends , They just call upon their friends to their homes and can just have gettogether in a closed rooms .

Finally I would like to say that older people are not much energitic that the young ones .
In their days i.e. when the older people were young they used to enjoy a lot , here it dos n't matter .
Here we are just discussing about how the young people are enjoying than the older ones .

In conclusion , I would rather like to say that young people are dynamic , energitic , and can enjoy the life more than older people .
In every aspect of life young people are enjoying the l
