I strongly disagree with the statement made that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to help the communities .
I agree that the times have changed and people have become more busy and mechanical in their routines , but still people are taking time out of their schedules to help the charities , or the under-previleged communities .

Youth is a prime-time in any individual 's life , where he/she has to concentrate on making a good career and pursue their interests at the same time .
But I would also like to add that it is `` the '' time where one realizes his/her responsibility towards the society .
Many successful sportsmen , musicians , actors have started working towards the devlopment of the society when they realized that it was the time to give-back to the society .
In-fact the Miss Universe and Miss World paegents also have the same theme `` Beauty with Purpose '' .

Young people across the world are actively participating in movements like WWF , Green peace , UNICEF etc to make this place better .
I would like to add that many successful young people like Bill Gates , Michael Jackson , David Beckham have donated huge amounts of their fortune to the charities .
There are few people who do not care about the society and are self-centred .
But it is the way one is brought up , that makes an individual more socially responsible .

To help others around you gives us the great feeling of purpose and satisfaction .
People when they realize it , they will surely help the community in one way or the other .
I would like to give the example of Mother Theresa who moved out of her country while she was young and reached India to help the poverty-stricken and the under-previleged .
She led a great life of example which I think everyone should remember and give back to the society , in our own possible ways .
