Young guns of today are more determined then ever and the courage , the determination shown by this generation is by far greater .
I dont agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

Times have changed , but the will to be helpful to fellow communities has definitely not withered away .
Take for instance the various political parties both regional and national that have over the time being completely overpowered by youth domination .
The youth movements like NSUI , and various NGOS have been recruiting bright students from top universities like JNU , DELHI and the pace at which the students participate in the social activities is heartening to say the least .

All these organisations of international stature involve community services that are more or less dominated by the young people .
Its a misconceived notion that youth dont give enough time for their communities but a deeper analysis shows that there are very good and educated people who have devoted to making their lives of some consequence to others .

A study at the grass roots level namely the village panchayats and the muncipalities have gradually been the foundation grounds for future leaders of immense potential .
Many new NGOS are being started by young people who are at times educated at top notch universities , INDIA and ABROAD .
They sacrifice their attractive career options to serve the people and make a difference .

The youth have gradually tried to do their bit in the fields of literacy , improving sanitation , and provide better social and economic amenities in collaboartion both with government and private sector .
In today 's world globalisation is the word , what with the private sector and software boom providing immense career growth and are highly remunerative , inspits of this many young people are opting for a career in the civil services .

Thus , people especially youth are devoting adequate time and its high time the society takes note of it .
