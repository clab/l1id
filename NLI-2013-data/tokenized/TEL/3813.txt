I do not agree in total with the statement mentioned because there are two sides of the coin associted with issue .
Let us discuss those issues in agreement with the topic .
The world has been transformed in to a global village .
Life seems to getting busier and busier everyday with the youth playing a pivotal role in any organisation thay work ..
People especially , the younger ones are occupied with their jobs and other trivial commitments associated with the jobs .
It is clear that they donate a chunk of their time to their jobs working for the success in their careers fantasing a real comfortable life ..
With the development of science and technology ( which indeed reflects in media ) , the social responsibilty towards the community is lacking .
People no longer feel it is their duty to have a clean community .
Let us begin at the elementary level .
Keeping a street in a good condition is seen as a duty of the government organistions and all the blame goes to them for not keeping the street neat .
While a deeper probe in to the issue may seem to lead to a funny situation as the citizen especially the younger ones are very irresponsible to it .

The young people no longer feel that the duties towards the community are to be fulfilled rather than the rights which they demand for .
So , duties should always outweigh rights .
The establishment of social-service communities especially to enhance a feeiling of duty towards the communities clearly asserts the fact .

Now let us deal with the statement that Young people have enough time to help their communities .
It can be described a the insensitivity of the author to look at the issue from a different facet .
What does community helping mean ?
It simply means having and donating time to a better , efficient and prosperous community .
I believe that even though the direct approach is lacking to help and participate in the community help programmes , what the youth are doing is indeed going to improve their own community by and large .
illustrating this ,, just think of as situation where the division of labour does not seem to exist .
The butcher , Milkman , Vendors selling awide range of things , blacksmith , gold smith do not start doing their duty .
The community would be literally in chaos and this would led to inefficient functuioning of the society .
Not to forget the central fact that the order in society is basically bulit on the type of jobs the youth who comprise a substantial amount to the soceity .
