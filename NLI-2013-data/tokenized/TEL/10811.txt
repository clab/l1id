Nor fate nor chance nor any star commands
Success and failiure not but lies in your hands

This is the mantra that seems have driven successful people over the year .
Continuous improvement and the quest for it is the single most important factor that drives people to achieve the impossible .

How much ever a person likes a particular thing and however brilliant he might be at it , if the need to improve continuously is lacking he would ultimately be bored of such a job and will fail to give his best .

The very fundamental truth of life revolves around the fact `` no risk no return . ''
The leading example of a successful man is Mahatma Gandhi , a person who could have easily chosen to lead a simple and happy life as a lawyer in South Africa .
However , he chose to come back to India and fight for freedom of his people against all odds .
Without his determination and guidance India would not have been freed .

Another example would be Mother Teresa who worked day after day to help the poor and the underprivelaged .
As any other human being she could have chosen to lead a normal and happy life but that would have made all of us call her a mother To explore new opportunities one needs to go out of his way and face uncertain circumstances and figure out ways to emerge victorious .
Only when one believes that failiure is not an option in an uncertain environment would he actually give his cent percent and emerge successful .
As necessity is the mother of all invention taking risks and being exposed to an uncertain atmosphere is the main element necessary to becoming succesful .

However , taking on new risks and challenges is not the only ingredient in making a successful man .
It should be combined with other qualities like willingness to learn , courage and above all belief in himself .
This stresses on an important concept called calculated risks , which effectively mean risks which a person needs to take in a planned way .
The problem should be analyzed and then broken down into components , and each component should then be individually attacked .
