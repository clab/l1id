I do not agree in toto with the above statement that YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY IFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE DO .
Older people will complete their duty and will be in the stage of relaxation and free from the tensions .
they did all the struggle to settle their lives and will be in the stage of receiving fruits to all the struggle they made during their age .

young people attend parties , plays games both indoor and outdoor , actively participate in all the feilds he is willing .

so according to my view enjoyment is not the thing that is related to age .
every one can enjoy more and more in their life if it does not cross the barriers , so enjoyment within the limits is the key point which decides the life .
then only we can really enjoy the freedom of enjoyment .
too much enjoyment at any stage may cause pr
