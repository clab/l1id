I completely agree that successful people try new things in contrast to failure peple who are put in by somebody else to face new things .
It is the successful people who lead the front .
These people try to enhance the capabilities of which they have already tasted success , explore new manners of doing something or even develop a whole new perspective .

Success allows a person to think more , do more .
It inspires him to stand one step ahead of already achieved bench mark .
It calls for more concious effort .
At the same time the risk involved in such efforts is sure to increase .

Citing an example , the person who commercialized Star TV is was at the peak of his success as a buisiness man when te came up with the idea .
Taking an amount of risk he invested huge amounts .
But that was again an immediate success .

The successful people may play a different role to suit the circumstances as in case of sachin tendulkar .
He is one of the best batsmen of cricketing history .
As he became successful , he started changing roles from a person who is only interested in making runs as quickly as possible to someone who stands all through the innings .
This would n't have been afforded by any body else because there is great chance of him be out of the team .

Also there might be people who may give an all over new definition to sucess .
Bill Gates , for example is working today for charity giving a new meaning to success .
According to me he has taken a risk by retiring because his inputs to microsoft might be missing .

In fact a complete organization may put itself into risk .
Indian Space Research Organization ( ISRO ) after successful testing of PSLV ventured again to construct GSLV at a point where failure mean disaster to the whole organization and which may question its existence also .

The examples above clearly depict the manner successful people or organizations have taken carried their sucess ahead even after critical risk factors .
But it can be clearly concluded that successful people try new things .
