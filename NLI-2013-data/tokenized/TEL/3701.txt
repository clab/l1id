I agree to the statement that young people do not have enough time to help out their communities .
There are many reasons attached to this statement .
The modern world has become very busy and commercial .
people work for time , the more time they work the more they are paid , This is directly proportional .

Let us start the discussion from root level .
at a very tender age children are sent to the schools , where they go in the morning and come back in the evening .
Slowly the student gets habituated to living that his / her parents show .
when they finish their metriculation they are joined in higher studies and this goes on for five to six years .
After his completion of the graduation he is placed in any big company or in any field that he is interested in .

From the above metioned data it clear that the people do not get enough time to their personal time for the community .
most of the young people work for the multi national companies which do not provide you the time to spare for extra curricular activities .

The people of this generation have become workaholic .
No body cares for the society .
they do their things money oriented which for them is the primary thing .
People of this generation think that there is governmant to look after the things about the community .
But they do not understand the simple fact that `` TEAM WORK MEANS MORE WE AND LESS ME '' .

There are very few people who you can count on your fingers who care for the society and their community .
it is because of these people that the world is still alive .
the young generation has become more family oriented and care least for their community .

I here by conclude my discussion that the corporate culture has slowly but surely imbibed into every one of us which has given less chance to serve their community .
I sincerely hope that people would realise the fact that every body should live happily .
This only happens when you serve your community atleast inch to its success .
