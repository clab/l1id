Accoding to the adage `` IN THE MIDDLE OF RISK 'S THERE WILL BE A SUCCESS '' success ful people will try new things and take risks .

When we call a person is successful ?
If a person achieves his goals , tagets , destity by overcomming all the problems , risks , difficulties that he had face then we call that person as a successful person .
Trying new things is the common characteristic of a successful person .

As an instance Mahatma Gandhi who is called Father of the nation is a big successfull man .
He is the person who achieved his goal of getting independence for country between lot of risks .
one will be surprised by knowing him how he faught for the country .
He had done many new things during the freedom fight for the country .

Another instance is Mr.Murthy who is the founder of company `` infosys '' he is the successful person who achieved his goal of establishing the multinational company , which had changed the structure of the indian market , and had given chance to evolve the computer industry in india .
with out doing any risks , or with out trying any new things he would not achieved this status .

success is always with risks , if any one who wants to get success in life he should definitely do some kind of risk .
In the modren world we are having many sophiticated technology which would not happen with out doing any risk .

Innovation is another key for the success .
trying new things will give the person a chance to open in that field and create a new thing which can change the life .
By trying new things one can experince a lot more in the life and also will become forerunner for others .
we all achieved this modren world by trying new things for instance advent of INTERNET had changed the world , i think no one would not expected this drastic change because of the INTERNET .

Finally , In my opinion successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
