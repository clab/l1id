Learning facts makes the students to understand ideas easily .
Facts act as a foundation to any subject .
Any subject lies in the boundaries of facts .
So i think that leaning facts improves the ability of a student to understand the ideas and learn the concepts .

Water changes its state from one form to another form i.e water is a liquid state and ice is a solid state of water and this is considered as a fact .
If students are not aware with this fact how can they understand the concepts of transforming the state of water and methods used to transform .
The student cannot understand or develop the idea of changing the state of the water .

When the foundation of the building is not laid properly then it collapes as the time passes .
In the same way if the students are not perfect in the basic concepts of the theories they my face problems when they go deeper into their subject .

Understanding ideas and concepts come into picture if the student is perfect with their basics , those are facts .
When the student want to develop new ideas or concepts they should check whether their concepts obey the facts proposed earlier in that feild .

When a new concept or theory is proposed , it is accepted by the people only if it obeys the basic rules .
The concept is verfied by testing it at several conditions and is checked whether the concept obeys the basic facts at all conditions .
The concept is then accepted if it satisfies the conditions .

Facts are never misleaded but ideas have a chance to mislead or can be proved wrong at different conditions , but facts cannot be changed or misleaded at any costs .
Facts are as true as the earth is sperical , but in ancient time a concept of earth being flat was proposed , later it proved wrong and a fact that the earth is sperical was stated .
Thus learning facts plays an important role in learning than understanding ideas and concepts .
