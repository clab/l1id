Yes , i agree the following statement `` in twenty years ther will be fewer car in use then today '' .the usege of car depend uponpopulation .
bcoz population is one factor to increesing the use of the car .
today man life is very tight with his schudule here time factor is most importent , so many peple are prepfer to buy car .
this has somany advantages are there one is to travel with his family with out facing any problem .

Today public transpotatoin line bus , train etc are avialaba but the problem is in this trans potation we have face somany people .
it will take time also some time we will miss our work .
thats way suppose we r haveing car we travel anyware in cirrect time .
one disadvatage having many cars is trafic .
so we fallow the trafic rules correctly .
and we haveing car will save lot of time .
after twenty years the population nis defnatley incresed so fewer car5s in use there are today .

Today every person life busy with his work and schudle .
and ever man prefer change in his lifestyle .
so ever body prefer to buy a car becausethe car rate are very chep .
and the market annouce so many offers .
so every body prefer to buy a car .
so every to take cre about the pollution .
if we take some care about pollution is must .
use of good gas we will reduce pollution some what .
in twenty years the population is increseed then need of wil , l also incresed .

So in my opinion In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
