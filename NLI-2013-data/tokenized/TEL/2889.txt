I completely agree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Younger people enjoy their life more than older people because of the fact that they have to take care of lesser responsbilities than the older ones do .

Younger people need not worry much about their future they need to worry mostly about their subjects , while the older people have to worry about a lot of things ranging from tensions in the office to what to cook tonight .
Younger people enjoy life with their friends they go out for parties and clubs with their friends more frequently then the older ones do , even though older ones go out to party their mind is always preoccupied by tensions .

For older people the burdens keep on increasing day by day and they find little time to enjoy , but for youngsters every second is for enjoyment and they enjoy their nlife to the fullest .
Older people also have the problem of taking care of their children .
Older people also are worried about their future the time after they retire .
Younger people also have the privelage of being taken care of by their parents whenever they have a problem and need not have any worries .
Younger people have the privelege of a number of holidays when they have plenty of time to enjoy their life .

Though most of the younger people enjoy their life more then the older ones there are older people who enjoy life more then the younger ones do , for example Dr. Vijay Mallya who enjoys his life more than any youngster does .

I feel that younger people enjoy more than older people do because they have lesser burdens than the older ones .
They have the privelage of being taken care of by their parents and need not worry much but only have to enjoy .
