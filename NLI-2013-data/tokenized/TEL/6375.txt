In twenty years from now , there is a high possibility that there will be an increase in the number of cars in use than there are today .
The car even though was considered a luxury item earlier , has now become household .
The main reasons that can be cited are the average per capita has been on an increase over the past few years .

The people from the middle class families are growing richer and many of these families are of the opinion that there many uses of buying a car .
The average cost of a journey comes to very less when the entire family goes on a trip .
Instead of going and hiring cars or waiting in the queue to get the seats reserved in trains and which some times may go invain , owning a car is much better option .
The prices of the cars had also dropped to a large extent attracting the people even from normal qualities to buy a car .
Now a days most of the cars can also be made to run on natural gas which also saves lots of money on travelling .
In addition to all these the cars also provide employment to many people and as the population is evergrowing many people might show interest in driving taxis for their livelihood .

The cars can come very handy when both the husband and wife are working in near by places when one can drop the other on their way towards their office and dropping their children on their way to schools .

There has been also been an observed decrease in the cars causing pollution to environment with the improved technologies such as zero engine noises that reduces sound pollution many a times .
In addition to it the use of alternate sources of fuel has brought down the environmental pollution .
Thus not causing any threat to environment .

Also the chance of getting injured during accidents are comparatively less while driving cars when compared with two wheelers owing to the fact that they have safety belts and are protected from all sides .
thus car provides a much safer travel .

Now a days cars are coming in new designs and are also becoming easier to handle and are coming with such sophistications that many get attracted to .

The reduction in pollution and new models of cars coming everyday with ultimate satisfaction to customers and the costs also getting lowered and the growth of the percapita income will mainly cause an increase in the usage of cars in the coming twenty years
