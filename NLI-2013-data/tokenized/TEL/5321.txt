Its true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
It is the marketing skills of the companies in making profits .

Most of the advertisements are so well designed and presented that they attract large part of audience .
People tend to buy those products .
When it comes to reality the product does'nt seem better .
For example , women tend to buy various kinds of cosmetics with out actually knowing how well they suit them .

So customer should be very discerning in purchasing products .
Its better not to be simply carried away by advertisements rather check the statistics of the product before purchasing .
Consulting and taking others ' ( who might have already used the product ) opinion would help to purchase better products .
