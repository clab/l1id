This is the age of modern science and technology .
So there will be many changes taking place with in our world in the near future .
While some set of the students disagree with the given statement and others do not .
I agree with the following statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewers cars in use than there are today '' due to the following reasons .

Nowadays the population is growing a bit faster than the past .
Due to this growth of population in a limited area like our earth , so there will be automatically a rise in the use of vehicles for their transportation .
For example nowadays privacy is considered as the major element .
Due to this reason people are preferring for buying cars than using public transport like buses , taxis etc .
The scientists are in search for possible solutions for solving these problems and also humans are also concerned about the growing pollution mainly smoke pollution .

They were trying to reduce this pollution and traffic problems by inventing cars which will not cause any smoke pollution .
For example , they invented some sort of hydrogen as fuel in place of petrol in order to reduce the smoke pollution .

In order to reduce the traffic problems they are ought to invent space cars which will ply in the air instead of on the road .
This will surely reduce the traffic jams .
Mainly people are concerned about their health nowadays .
They think that their health will get spoiled if they are exposed to such sort of pollutions .
So they are also in a great need to reduce pollutions and traffic jams .

So in the near future there may not be any cars and there may be only space cars which will ply in the atmosphere rather than on the road .
And due to their great concern about their health they will prefer to walk and ride bicycles for reaching their offices .
For example , in developed countries like Japan and China , people already began to use bicycles and walk to reach their offices , schools and any other work they wanteded to do .
They believe that it not only reduces the pollutions and traffic jams but also makes them healthy by reducing obesity problems .

From the discussions made in the passage , we can come to a conclusion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
