The student has studied lot of subjects in the school stage .
I belive that the it is the better to student have the knowledge in academic subjects while you are choosing the specialization in one spocific subject .
Because if the student does n't have the knowledge of the specialization .
he will not under standing any thing .
He will face the problem in the futher .

They have the better knowledge to choose the specialization because the student has to know that if he choose that .
What will be the gain to get .
In the form of like jobs , like proffesionals .
if the student choose the write way to choose the specialization that students will sucess in a great way .
Because he know about the subject and he know that what is advantages .

If we take for example the student studied if the is good in maths he will choose the MPC in the inter .
After inter the student will do eng in the college he will choose the the specialization CS means he is good in the computers .
He will good for the computers jobs .

If the student is good in the science in his school stage he will choose the BPC inthe inter .
He write the emcet if he collified in that he will bacome a doctor .
inthat he choose the specialization for that .

If the student is good in the social he will choose the CEC in the inter after like to do degree and some one like to do the MBA program .
Means the student has the knowledge to which subject is better to me and the student should think that which one is sutiable to my profile .
First the student will decide and take the step other wise the student will suffer in the future .

The student have the knowledge for academic subjects than the to select the specialization it is the better way to student for sucess in the life .
