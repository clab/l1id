Yes , I agree withn the statement that the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what already know how to do well .
Without trying new things we cannot establish or invent any .
so by trying the things that no one can do by this we get name and fame .
moreover name and fame we may give the newthing to the world .
without taking risks we cannot get a new thing .
So many scientists created things that are new to the world that we are usng now .
they work hard for the new inventions .
without new inventions the world may not move in progressive way .
so , by the inventions only we can more .

For example if take a computer at first time when it is created it was very larger than building .
so , by the new thougts and risks only the size of the computer is reduced .
Not only computer many things that we are now using are came out by trying the new things and taking risks .

But in some cases trying new things may create so many problems and at it is more risk to moderate the thing properly .
but try new things may not that much effective in every case .
we can learn more by taking risks .
so many new projects are invented by try new things .

If it success we will get so many congratulations by others .
All the time trying new things is not much essential .
But with out trying new thing we can learn more things about what we are doing .
so , In my view trying new things may invent so many things that we are not supossed by not taking risks .
So i agree with my conclus
