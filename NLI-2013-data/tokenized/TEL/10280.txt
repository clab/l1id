i agree with the statement as successful people try new things and risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
according to my opinion every where successful people means hardworking peoples are try to find the new things .
because of they were knowen where the risks and prolems are generated .
thats the resone the successful people done every thing at where ever .

and also hardworking people try to know about new things such as to find new type of products and make it where ever any risks .
then publised into market .
now a days the information technology was growing day by day .
one company released one type of product and onther company released that type but with more features .
why because in those companies were type of empyoement .
in one company had the normal eployees and the other had the successful or hardworking empyoee .
this is the majore example of the successful people and othes .

hardworking people knowen where the conflicts are rised or generated .
examples of successful peoples in the world are rathan tata , mittal and somany are there .
they are all successful in thier life and also they are thaught that to produce new type of products in to world market .
the hardworkig was come from their families and from teachers they learned in to their instututes .

successful means when ever a man or women got happy or got victory from their job .
there are somany scientists are successful in their experiments , then they whould successful on that experiment .

successful people always thinging about the new topics from the socity .
successful people got the full relax and happy from their work .
and the people do ndt happy those are normal people .
