from a wheel to a cart to a car to a plane and finally to a rocket man has acheived every thing he want .
but in the process his life has become more mechanical and he began to do things for his own happiness than to the cause for the cause of others now coming to the case of young people .
i agree upon the fact that they are not giving enough time to help out the communities and the society in which they live .
young people beacuse of their hectic schedule and their outlook towards the society has changed many of them are not willing to help the communities .
instead they like to enjoy their life in partying flurting > they have reached to such a stage that they had stopped giving birth for the coming generations in the look for their own enjoyment .
every thing is becoming readymade in this modern world and the young people are becoming more sluggish and lethargic > young people are becoming more selfish day by day .
the environment in which they are brought up is also one of the factor for the above cause .
mass medias like telivisions music and computer are also distracting the young people from the way they used to think earlier .
they are more willing to watch telivision or listen to music than helping out the society .
the educational institutions are also becoming a cause .
they are not including courses such as humanities in the regular courses which helps them to take the young people nearer to the community .
young people are lacking ethical values in the case of helping a community .
every thing they work is becoming so mechanical that they are lossing interest in helping mankind .
another main cause is internet .
young people instead of using it properly are exploiting it like they are addicted to watchj porn sites < porn films .
chatting has also become one of the major cause with all these ultra modern facilities young people are becoming more vulnerable to get addicted to all bad habits .
in order to avoid this in future they must be taken care properly from the childhood itself .
they must be taught on moral values principles .
special organizations should come up to teach all these and educational institutes must also play a viotal role in helping the young people to inculcate good habits .
parents who are not worrying about their children these days must learn to teach the children some basic moral values .
