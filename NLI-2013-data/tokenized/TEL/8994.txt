I agree that students should understand ideas and concepts , because if they learn the concepts they will be familiar with that particular topic .
And they should also develop the ideas it is also as important as concepts .
Nowadays , if we have concept we are easily getting jobs .

For ex .. , if a student do his lab work in particular experiment and which is also important for his theory examination if he do his experiment with concentration and with concept then if that particular question comes in the theory examination without preparation also he will be able to write that question .
If he goes for any interview by chance if he ask about that particular topic he can easily answer that question eventhough if he asks in depth also that is the main advantage of concept .

The ideas are not knoen when they come to our mind but its better to develop from our childhood by getting ideas only many people are succeding .
For ex. , one of my friend like to drive cycle and he thought that everybody are riding the cycle but i have to drive in a different manner .
He thought lot but suddenly he got an idea to drive cycle with scating shoes then he brought the rope and he tied it to the handle with balancing the cycle he use to drive the cycle , then slowly he developed by riding on bikes he is now succesfull in that .
I gave the ex for such idea he got and he entered in to the `` Gunniess book of world record '' and all the friends and family members were very happy because of that idea now he became vaery famous thatwhat idea is important .

I conclude , that if concept and ideas are developed that we will make the person to in huge hights .
A person may definetely get job if he concept but it may be late but he definetely get job .
Nowadays companies are looking for the people having concept .
If suppose we dont get jobe but using our ideas we can earn better salary then person earning through jobs .
