`` Being young at heart is more important than being young in age '' .
I disagree to the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Lots of young people of late do not look at life the way it is supposed to be taken rather are carried away something that is unreralistic and is only depicted in certain views .

The older people who have seen the hardships of life as well as the unexpecting situations of life and lived up to the expectationsof themselves as well those relying on them at that time , are more likely to enjoy their life as they have lived up to their duties and have passed the test of life in hardship and endeavouring times that the unpredicting future has had in store for them , on the other hand a younger person in the present third world where competition is the very word for survival .
The young who is now at the crucial stage of the life with lots of demanding responsibilities resting on his shoulders and the dreams to be realised and pinnacles to be reached , goals to be accomplished to save his face in his view as well as those who count on him , looks at the life and the obstacles in the path only with the view of overcoming them but not with a view of apprecitaion that the troubles and tough times are not forever .

In the attitude to win the situation the young often fail to appreciate the beauty of very trivial things which indeed have in them a abundance of happiness which rather the smart and patient old would view and appreciate it for what it is .

A research scholar who has seen a lot of work in his time and been through testing time of lack of results probably enjoy his work with a more optimistic view and would device more ways to make it work rather than to sulk and lose interest and patience in work as most of the young are most likely to do .

A old person for example consider a dextrous surgeon who has understood the real meaning of life and the importance of the role he is playing in saving a life enjoys the work he does due to the perfection he has achieved of late and also the underlying role he plays , where as a young and new learning and practising surgeon looks at the situation only in terms on his development and fails to realise the hidden satisfaction and happyness of work that a aged surgeon gains in a similar situation .

Thus the real meaning of enjoying life is existant in the very minute details it brings in front of us , which when viewed with a optimistic and a patient view appear more meaningful than with a pessimistic view .

Age definitely is not the criteria that determines whether who has fun or who enjoys life but its the importance of appreciating things and looking for positives in every little thing is the real enjoyment of life .
