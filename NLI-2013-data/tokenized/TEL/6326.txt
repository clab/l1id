I Personally feel that this kind of situation will never occur in next twenty years .
Because of the rapid development in technology and in the machinery goods and gadgets , which are expecting more materialiastic gains from such kind of development .
In our day to day life every thing is becoming so easy and fast .
Comparing with the older generations , cars are rapidly changing in their mechanisms as well in their outer apperance .
due to which there is a great change in human life .
For example , previously cars were used only for transport so that they can easily reach their destinations .
but slowly they started adding luxurious comforts to this system by adding various elements such as A/C , music system , lavish seats ..
it goes on ...
And due to the rapid development in the countries with the competetion there are adding more and more comforts to the simple ones .
Now a days due to the availaibilty of cars in economic price every one are having access to buy a car .
So there will be healthier comptetion between the cars marketting companies , as they try in different ways to attract the customer by giving additional facilities which is lacking in other cars .
Due to this kind of competition there is a launch of many cars per year with different names and different models , which is proved in a research .
Few companies started manufacturing the car to get the publicity and to show their intresting innovations which will attract the customers and can simply remember the brand name ex : { ferrari } In other cases the cars which are very costlier and can never be affordable to the common man are increasing day by day .
And buying these kind of cars give more importance to their social status .
So people work hardly and vigorously to buy these kind of cars and can have a prestigious symbol or a tag with them .
Wenever these people go out for a drive it grabs the attention of the others which makes the car owner feel happy and makes vivacious .
i personally feel due to this kind of tremendous effort by the engineers they will improve a lot in the mechanism which makes the customer very easy to drive as well to enjoy the comfort and luxury provided by them and there will be more number of cars in the next generation .
