I always believe that one of the biggest trait for a successful person would definetly be his ability to try out new things rather than persisting doing things he knew best .
So i would definetly agree with given the statement .

Lets take an example to better illustrate the stand on the topic , Thomas Edison was the one who invented the bulb .
He would never have invented the bulb if he did not take the risk and try some thing different .
what could the effect of this be ?
we would have still be sitting with candles in between us for lighting .
So it was this ability of his to try new theores and thoughts made him successful .

Secondly i would like to take the example of the father of my nation Mahatma Ghandhi who was greatly successful because of his new ways to fight the british rule .
He came up with what they call now the ghandian principles of non - violent way of fighting aginest the British rule .
His new and risky ways helped to win the independence to our country , much againest the more established ways of using violence for freedom fighting .
Ghandhi for one an established lawer in south africa when he started his new non violent ways of protesting againest the harsh authorities .

Fur better understanding take for instance a student who is good at his achademics but not very good in his communication skills , if he wants to get placed in a good company after his study it would be really hard for him to be successful .
So here although the person is good at his achademicshe needs to concentrate on his communication skills in order to be successful .

This stament greatly works in the case of computer programmers , computer programmers are always confronted with the task of finding newer ways to program in order to increase the efficiency and throughput of the target systems , and so the most successful men for instance microsoft have always been ones those who did things differently .

So to sum it up , though it is important to do well what you know , you always need to have the desire to try out new thigs and the pluck to take risks to come out on top and be successful .
This has always been the case with most of the successful men in history .
