I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree to this because young people nowdays have more work than what they used to have in the past .
There are more responsibilities for the young people nowadays though helping communities is one .

Modernisation is one factor which is responsible for the gradual change in the attitude of the people .
There are so many technological developements that people can evade their responsiblties from their daily work .
Young people are more aware of these technolgies through their educational system .
Young people make the maximum use of these technologies to evade responsibilities .
For example young people need not take advice from people of their community anymore as they consider that all the information is already available which they can have it by themselves .

Another factor for young people not helping their communities is the work load which is given to them .
Universities and Colleges give the students so much work that they have to spend all their free time in completing the work .
Many families can be pointed out where the youngsters work to support their families .
Some youngsters have to also take care of their siblings in some families .
With all this responsibilities which have to be given proir importance how can the youngsters worry about not helping their communities .

Furthermore , the modern day parents are slowly losing time to teach their kids important things .
Many families are there where both the mother and father are working .
So while working how can the parents teach their kids the necassary values which are very much needed in the society .
We can say that schools do teach students the values but can these values be taught individually like how the parents teach .

To conclude there are many responsibilities for the younger people to take care of .
It is necassary for the adults and senior citizen to help them realise their resposibilities amid all the development .
