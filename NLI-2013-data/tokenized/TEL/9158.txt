Education is a perfect amalgation of understanding of learned facts and their application .
This is the essence of education .
No theory states education is learning facts blindly .
If learning facts matter a parrot can speak learnt rubbish. a lot better than a man can .
It is understanding of the ideas and their application which make a good student and distinguish him from an ordinary graduate .

Education does not mean learning facts by heart or reading lit of text books .
I was taken by surprise when I accidentally noticed paintings by small kids .
One of them was named ` Flowers ' and the child drew blue colour for rose and black colour for sunflower .
Later when I was going to my house I noticed a streeboy smaller than that age drawing flowers in the ground using chalk pieces and colouring them perfectly .

Not all things are taght in the book , some are taught by life .
Personal experiences value more than reading ` rose is red ' .
If Sir Issac Newton have had learnt the facts there would be no ` Theory of gravity ' .
Innovative thinking adds a lot to the vision of understanding facts .

Learn trade rather than remember what is trade .
If Albert Instein would have learnt the fact that atom has electrons , the fact goes to the next generation as atom has electrons ; but because he understood what is atom we today enjoy atomic energy through Theory of Relativity .

If mere learning of facts is education , then that education fetches nothing but only useless graduation degrees to our back .
If we understand facts then we know how to manipulate the lnowledge we know for a better work .

With the modern busy life many dont have time to understannd ideas .
What all they have is time to learn facts .
If learning facts blindly is education then that education is useless .
If a student learns what a machine is and has never seen a machine or never seen a machine at work , he only remembers the formulae of working of the machine and nothing else .
In practical life he is not more than a fool or a numbskull .
