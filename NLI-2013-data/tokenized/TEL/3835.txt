I disagree with the statement .
I believe that youngsters nowadays spend enough time ( and more ) to help their communities .
Let us define what a community is .
For most people , a community is a group where the members interact , are interdependant , and where they live in harmony .
The young people of the world realise that they are part and parcel of this community and that the development of themselves is dependant on the development of the community and vice versa .

The younger generation is more aware of community welfare , helping people in need , the environment , and its development .
One area which the youngsters have identified is charity work .
Not only do they visit charity organisations and donate to them , they also organise free medical camps for poor children , corrective surgery for people who cant afford it , and in general spread the word .
Campaigns where people can donate or pledge their future contribution are organised by these youngsters .
They are conciously allocating time for community welfare activites .
Proactively thinking about how much more improvement is possible is the trend .

Also , people nowadays , especially youngsters , are more aware of the dangers to the environment from deforestation , the ozone layer depletion , etc .
These concepts have been imbibed in them from a very small age , because of which they are very aware of the situation .
Hence , they make sure they dont cause more damage than they can help .
Some of them have pledged to not use plastics after they have understood the harmful nature of it .

Another aspect of ` community ' could be the work environment .
Having a pleasant work environment is every employee 's dream .
This can be acieved only by the cooperation of all the people involved .
Realising this , the youngsters make sure they have a nice place to work .

It is very easy to mould young minds and they will be more than willing to help the community and in turn help themselves .
This way , they realise , they are giving back to the community that they got from .
