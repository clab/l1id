I strongly disagree with the notion that having a broad knowledge of many subjects is better than specializing in one .
I feel that in today 's world , where competition for jobs is increasing , one who specializes in a particular field is the one who stands out in the crowd of men and women who have a knowledge of many subjects .
Also , the person becomes passionate about the subject that he decides to specialize in and that gives him enormous satisfaction .
Great personalities testify the fact that specializing in one field always the better option .

Da Vinci , one of the most famous artists of all times was also an accomplished physicist .
Although he had no formal education in the field , he had a great wealth of knowledge about it .
However , this was detrimental to him in a way as he always used to think of his paintings in a scientific way rather than a purely artistic one .
So although he created masterpieces , he left many more projects unfinished as he felt that those projects were lacking in some detail scientifically .
For example , he thought that a painting should contain no element of ethreal fantasy and that it must obey the laws of physics .
In this way , his choice was limited and he did not access his full potential .
Had he been a little less rigid in his principles , we would have seen many more of his wonderful works .

Another example would be my uncle who switched his majors no less than four times while doing his undergraduation .
When he tried to get a good job in one of the fields he had studied , he found none .
To his dismay , he discovered that each of the jobs needed an extensive knowledge on the subject , a specialisation of some kind .
After the incident , he finally settled for medicine and went to graduate school .
He specialized in Nephrology and needless to say , is a successful surgeon now .

In conclusion I strongly feel that being a jack of all trades and master of none diffuses one 's talents and prevents one from reaching the highest potential .
An individual can carve a niche for himself in the world if he has his own identity , in this case , the one subject he takes up and specializes in .
