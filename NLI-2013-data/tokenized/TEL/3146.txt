Well in this topic we see a narrow line between youngers and the olders .
Everyone thinks of the young people in this topic but probably they are not the one and it goes to the olders .

Young people will enjoy but comparing with the olders life they didnt even see the whole ways in the life or the experiences which these olders get in their life .
Ok i agree that young people are the fastest and most brilliant in thinking compared to the olders .
From these youngers when we ask them to face a situtation or to face a panic problem we get those answers or steps in them only by depended on their mood or by their interest , but if we ask these olders to judge the same situation , they show us the right way or right step in that .
This all not depends up on the person or not by the situation , but it all depends upon the great experience what they secured from their life and from all the situations what the faced and got through them .

The young generation always thinks about the beneifits of the source but we wont get any thoughts about the disadvantages until someone explains about them , but this habit develops to the olders from their experiences and from their wroung steps what they made in their young stages .

Here the main enjoy in life is not those freakouts or not those hangouts but its all about the sucess in the life or happy movings in the life , probably in this old and weak hands of these olders rise in this competition .

The olders are the mines from which we can extract alot of the valuable things and we can also learn alot from which help these youngers not only to move in right steps but also how to enjoy the life .
