I completely agree with the statement .
Successful people try new things and take risks because they want to invent new things .
For example Indian President `` Abdul kalam '' he is a great scientist , he invented nuclear weapon but still he does not give up his researches in his 80's .

Success does not totally based on economy .
For example `` Mother Thersa '' who came from other country to India to serve the people .
She took risk all over her life to serve the people .
now she is called as `` MOTHER '' by the whole world .
I dont think that any one call her unsuccessful .

Successful people try to get success in almost all of the businesses .
They are not satisfied by doing only one business .
For example Ambani who came from a poor farmer family , he did a small garments business .
He was successful in that business , but he was not satisfied with that .
He took risk in his life and did couple of businesses .
Now he became famous world wide as we well known him as `` RELIANCE . ''
If he would not take risk he would become famous in India not in world wide .

Therefore i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
