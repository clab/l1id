The thesis of the given topic is sucessful people are intrested to try new things instead of doing they already know .
Although some people disagree with the given topic I agree with the topic : sucessful people try new things and takes risksrather than doing old because of several reasons .
All the reasons are explained below .

The first reason to support my point of view is : Since they taste the sucess they can try for new things .
Without inventing new things there is no world .
Since this people know how to do thing , it is better to try for new one .
let us consider an example of early human being .
At the first he knows only how to produce fire by using stones , this is a great sucess in early mans life .
And then he takes risk and inventes the whell , clothing Etc .
From this we can say sucessful people try new things and takes risk rather than doing old one .
So according to this example we can say sucessful try for new things and take risks .

Another reason to support my point of view : if a sucessful persons thinks this sucees is enough means there is no development in the world .
So inorder to develop the world they try for new thing .
Another example to support my point of view is-if THOMAS .
A , .
adesen satisfies with the invention of electric bulb means we may miss his other so many invention like `` theory of electro magnetic '' .
Since he knows the basics things he intrested to try for new things and taking risks instead of doing the same old thing .

Finall reason to support my point view is its is good for sucessful persons to try for new things .
Because of these things they may get good name and fame in the society because of inventing new things .
More over they get huge amounts of money by selling new thins to the people in the siciety .
So they try for new thins and takes risks insead of olsd thing .

So in conclusion these reasons are enough to support my point of view .
so agree with the given topic .
