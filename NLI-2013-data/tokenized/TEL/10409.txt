I beleive that , it is only people who will to take risk would become sucessful .
Once a person is sucessful he would always want to increse his popularity by trying out new things .
He would never want his business or company to be stagnant .
In todays competitive world , people are paid for their creativity and creativity is nothing but trying or finding new ways and things .

First of all let us consider the field of acting .
A moviestar would become sucessful because of a particular kind of role .
For example Shah Rukh Khan , became popular for the role of a lover .
But he doesnt portray the same role in all his movies .
He has acted as a villian , an action hereo etc , and still he is the number one hero in India .
His sucess in the role of a lover boy did not constrain him from trying other roles .
Infact he is one of the most versatile actors in India .
Let us take up industries as another example .
A company would become sucessful for a particular produt say a chocolate .
The people of the company would not stop at this point by selling only their popular product .
Instead they would try to venture other areas like ice creams or even soap or shampoo .
Carrying out the same technique may always not lead to sucess as many other people could have copied the same technique .

Well it is always safe to carry out things the way one already knows and there may be no fear of loss or failurewhile taking a new way may end up in a problem .
I feel it is better to take risks and enjoy the sucess it brings .

Thus taking risk and trying out new ways has its own advantages and disadvantages , one needs to be daring enough to take the risk .
