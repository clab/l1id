I completely disagree with the statement given and i dont even find any sort of idea like that .
i dont understand if there is decline of cars with in the next twenty years , then what the people are going to use after twenty years ?
bus , train , bike or plane ?

all of them have disadvantages compared to cars .
compared to all the vehicals available today cars are the most efficient vehicals to meet the requirements of all the people .
if people are going to stop to use the cars , then how are going to travel ?
either by buses , trains and even planes .
all these cannot be efficiently used by the people .
even if people have decided to travel by other means of public transport then also they should have a own vehicle to got a station , airport or bus stop .

if the people should go by buses or other they should get ready very early , go to nearby stop , wait for the bus , get down at the destination and then go to the office by other means or by walking .
is this process better or getting into a car at home and getting down in front of the office is better ?
definitely the second one .
now a days people are looking for vehicles which gives them a lot of advantage and cars are one of them .
every one should have a own vehicle for their daily things to go on without problem and car is best of them .
like other vehicles ( like bike ) there is no need to expose to sun and it is a comfortable way of travelling .
as it is not much expensive to buy a car , every one could efford to buy a car .
in times of emergency we cant wait for a outside vehicle to come and car means a lot at that time .
so it is the best way to travel at any time to any place comfartably .

the only disadvantage of using the car is probability of accidents .
we sholud be very careful while driving and have to keep the whole attention on that .
but if we go by public transport there is no need to worry and can sit in a relaxed state till the destination comes .
but inspite of this disadvantage cars serve as the more efficient way to find the needs of the people .
