Definitly advertisements make products seem much better , they have to , otherwise who will be willing to buy products .
The purpose of advertisements is intended to do so .
I strogly agree with the statement , espeacially for selling their product , earn profits & so on .

First of all , if the company has to sell a new product , they have to work on how to attract consumers .
Though the product may be not so good .
For example , when I see an advetisement on any medication , espeatially for cold I look for how it is different from other medication & buy the medicine to try out , then it totally depends on me if I want to take it or not .

Secondly , buy making the advetisement look better from the product will help the company earn profit .
If people are attracted by the ad then only they may buy the product .
It will bring people to atleast give a try .
That will benifit the company , but latter it all depends on how the product actually is .
For instance , I saw an ad on weight loss program , using pills make you slim & trim .
I was so attracted to it that I just wanted to go & try it out .
I did , but when I took the medication with no diet control I lost so much weight , that was incredable .
But once I stoped it I stared to gain weight .
It was profitable for the company but not worked for me .
Not even that I gave suggestion to all my other friends too .
But later realesed that it does n't work .
By my suggession all my friends bought the product .

To conclude , all ads are made attractive inorder to attract consumers & sell their products to earn money , but it boils down to one point that we have to decide to buy or not .
Your judgement is the best .
Every one sees thier own profit but we are at loss so be careful
