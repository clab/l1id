In modern day cars are very important transport mode in peoples life .
The car had become intigral part of humen life .
so , i disagree in the satement `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .

Cars nowdays are very important then we think .
In most of the developed countries the people are preffering a car as transport rather than other conventional transportation modes , like train , buses etc .
Therefore on can say that the car became a vital part in their day to day life .

Cars are may causing many envionmental problems , but that can be avioded by using pollution free fuels .
For example , we know that many car companies are developing new fuels that will not harm the atmosphere , like hydrogen fuel which in turn leave water as a waste product rather than harmfull gases .

Many economies in the world are depend on the manufacturing sector where car industry is the one of the important onr to generate money to the countries .
There may be differents kinds of transportation mode after tweny years but , there will be cars which are more sophisticated and may not use convetional fuels Car industry has not streach its wings greatly to some countries which are developing now .
For example , take India .
Indian economy is rising asever before .
so , there is untapped potential in different industries .
One of the market in India is cars .
Many top companies are entering to India to tap the vast market .
For India also their is oppurtunity in generating new jobs in that market .
To cater the cars forcountries like China and India , it will take long years .
Infact we may see large number of cars than today .
an after twenty We may say that there can be less cars after twenty years which are on roads now .
The concept may enter in desigining , and the fuel that they use , but there may be alteratered to some designs of present cars .

Therefore Cars will remai
