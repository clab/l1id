Yes , I agree to the statement that is given above .
There are many reasons and examples , I would like to cite in support of my opinion .

In everyones life , ideas and concepts are very important to learn the subject .
Concepts help them to understand and know the subject how it is developed .
Ideas help them to get logical reasoning on the subject .

For example , In consideration of my life , Firstly `` I will give importance to undersatnd ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts '' .
The reasons are concepts are key role and important to get the sunject well and good , Without concept there is no subject , if we know the concept of the subject we can go any where to its advanced levels .
In this way concept play key to the subject .
Secondly `` Ideas also helps in understanding the subject .
Ingeneral , the subject is basically depends on the ideas .
The person is well recognised on the subject based on his thinking ability , logical reasoning , and creativity .
Ideas and creativity helps the people to reach advanced levels on the subject .
Not only on the subject , if we concentrate on concepts and ideas on any thing we can reach the acme stage on that specific thing .

But in some cases , for example `` To develop or to get advanced level or to add accessories of any product in the market it is compulsory to learn some facts about that previous product '' .
It is secondary preference only , it is better to know because `` We can attain the best on the product '' .
The reasons are `` We can know the demand , publicity , value of the product in the market '' .

So , to reach success in ones lives understanding ideas and concepts are very important .
Therefore , everyone should concentrate on those topics .
However , beyond concepts and ideas it is also important to learn facts as i had given example .

Insum , I would like to reiterate my opinion that the statement is agreeable from the above reasons and examples .
