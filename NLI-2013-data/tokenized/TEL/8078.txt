The issue at hand to understanding the ideas and concepts are more important than to learn facts .
This issue is important because it is related to the student 's life .
I belive that the understanded ideas and concepts are the better option because it is useful in their furestudies , they look more confident in their subjects and they can do well in the exames .

First , understand ideas and concepts are more important fir students is more preferable because students further studies is important .
For example if the studen intrested to do the medicine if he doe n't undestand the concept and ideas of biology they ca n't studt medical school .
understan ideas and concept .
I think it is superior than learn facts .

addionally , it is more important for student understand ideas and concepts is a better because when they look in the class is more confident in that subject .
For instance , if I understand the concept of subject I can learn more subject and intrested to concentate more concepts .
Based on students to understand ideas and concepts are the better than the to learn facts .

Finally , i feel understand ideas and concepts is right one because we can write on the exams well .
such as when i take the chemistry test concepts are very useful in the test .
after finshing exxam I thougt if I do n't understand the concept I could n't write thw exam Ultimately my choice is correct
