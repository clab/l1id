People are doing things in different way and they learn new things and face the consequences from that things .
Different people are doing in different manners .
Successful people try new things and take risks .

Some people are doing what they know and how to do well .
These people are not taking any advices from other people .
Those people are not fairly success in their careers .
But successful people are always trying new things and take risks from that and get well on that .
For example successful people are always trying the new things and take risks from that experience and from that experience they will try again and finally they succeed on that .

Some times these people are trying new things and risks are more from that .
These risks are some times giving the negative results and will give the negative consequences also .
But these consequences will give the good lesson for doing again that experiment .
They know the where it is the mistake and where it is correct for getting the good results .

I agree with this statement successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
For example i have seen one of my professor he was doing always the new crossings in different crops .
He always try to do that which characters are crossed with characters and how it improve the yield parameters in that crops .
He always try this crossings and face some of the risks in that crossing programmes and finally his release the varities of Rice .
From this onwards i thought successful people are always trying new things and face the riska and finally they get on well that experiments .
