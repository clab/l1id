I agree with the statement mentioned .
Beyond every success there is a risk associated with it .
If we consider our renowed scientists and researchers , behind their every success there is a risk .
They keep on doing risks in finding out new inventions and new discoveries .

Successful people probably will not wish to do the things which are well known to them because they think in a different way , aiming high to achieve something which is new .
In these aspects they do greater risks to find out new things .
They are very much dare enough to do any sort of risk in achieving a positive result .

For example i consider Madam Curie to be the most risk taking and a most successful scientist .
As she laid path in the discovery of `` radium '' , a radio active material she took a greater risk in the discovery of radium .
She had done a lot of experiments in finding the radio active material .
Her experiments involved many risk taking factors in which they are very dangerous .
At last she found out the radium after a series of experiments and reasearch .
The discovery of radium thus involved many risk factors and atlast she has tasted the success .
If she would not had taken the risk means the radium would not have been found till now .

In the same way as mentioned above , successful people always try for new things rather than doing the things which are already very well known to them .
Successful people always try new things and new tasks .
Its incorporated in them to try for a new one .
In this process many scientists have laid path to many inventions such as Marconie invented a radio , Grahambell invented a telephone and so on .

So i conclude the essay by stating that risk must be taken by every individual in achieving success and try out for a new thing rather than doing the thing which is known to us .
