`` IT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND IDEAS AND CONCEPTS THAN IT IS FOR THEM TO LEARN FACTS ''

wel ..
there is a lot of difference in learning a fact and understnding ideas and concepts ..
its like knowing what happens if u take a medicine when you are sick and actually taking one when you are really sick ..

its just the same like you can take a horse to the pool but you cannot make it drink water ..
learning facts just ignites the enthusiasim in the students and it draws him or her more close to actually trying to master the fact by understanding the idea and the concept that lie in it .

For instance if we can assume we are in a biology class the students are intially exposed to the facts about the concepts that they are going to learn and this alone doesnt help them ..
if they have to use this in their daily routine then the sole idea of knowing the facts doesnt alone help the person ..
so he has to learn it ..
understand it , and master the concept ..
the facts that a microorganism can be viewed under the microscope , the very fact is very exciting but if the student fails to actually use the microscope and watch the microorganism then wats fun in just knowing the facts ..

but at the same time apart from studies where one has to practically understand the concept , most of the time it is beneficial in our daily rouitne to learn the facts , for example by reading a news paper you will be enlightened with many new facts that most of the time we must have never come across but down the line that bit of information might serve very handy by just learning the fact ..
for example for people who smoke they learn the fact that smoking can cause cancer if smoken extensively so this fact will limit most of the smoking population to limit their daily intake of nicotine .

But for students it is a must to understand ideas and concepts than barely being amused by knowing the facts .

PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE WILL ALWAYS BE STORED IN THE LONGTERM MEMORY IN COMPARISON TO JUST LEARNING THE FACTS .

`` So , i finally conclude that it is always more important for students to understand the idea and the concepts than it is just learning the facts , '' and so i agree to this thought .
