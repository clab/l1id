I agree with the above statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .why means ?
the reasons are as follows .
Now itself the fuel price has been come to the peak value and moreover in the future traffic might increase and every gets risk of using the cars and they get wexed of the traffic .
And the government might increase the tax for the usage of car due to the main cause for the traffic .
And not only that in the future we may get fuel crisis i.e .
we may not get a fuel for the cars i.e. petrol to run the cars .
And another thing is that people may get very less leisure time to use cars .
And only the fewer people uses the cars like government officials , and big landlords , businessmen and the people who were much use of it only can use .
These factors leads to the usage of less cars in the coming twenty years .
