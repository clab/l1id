I strongly agree that , it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
It is very difficult and there is not much use in memorizing the facts .

In olden days teaching methods they trained in learning facts but now due to latest technology development all facts are on computer internet available in seconds of button switch so we dont need to memorize facts .
For example if a student memorizes dates and events took place in 18 century they may not be beneficial .
but the concepts and ideas are trained they will develop new inventions , create wonderful things .

Young minds are creative with full of enthusiasm so filling these valuable brains with dead curriculum and dead facts in this 21 century , I dont agree .
Humanbeings have already developed computer which can store facts .
so students dont need to learn them .
Computer cannot generate ideas only humanbeings can think as they have a marvel brain which is equal to millions of computers .

Students should understand the concepts and they should relate and generate new ideas .
This process will take place only when we stop filling the brain with facts .
Through out my education I have experienced learning so many facts like in Social science historical revolts .
In science invention and discovery dates , in Maths multiples of tables more than 15 .
in Languages remembering characters of plays , all the facts I learned were never useful in my life but they scored me low grades .
So why not we learn things which are more useful and beneficial to man kind .
So train young generation in developng , understanding new ideas creating wonderful things
