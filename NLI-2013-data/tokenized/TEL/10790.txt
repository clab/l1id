I agree with the statement , `` successful peolpe try new things and take risks rather than doing things what they already know how to do well '' .
I believe that successful people are the ones , who have reached new heights and a stage which others believe is difficullt and hard to obtain .
The idea of being new has always attracted the crowds and only sustained for short time .
If it was not appealing for a long time .
I believe that successful people have always tried to keep the concept of new alive by taking risk and sustanining for long period .

The idea of taking risks to succed has always been repeated in history and in present .
For example GRAYS , the persons who has written the book of human antomy .
Ages ago , during his time it was considerd a sin to dig the corpse and study on it and was not allowed .
He with the passion has risked to go to the graves at night and dig the corpse and get it to his lab and work on it , His book of anatomy is considerd even today the best book of human anatomy ever written .
Thus , making him a successful person , This only happened as he has taken the risk of trying new things than being convential .
sticking to old medicine taught to him at that time .

history has repaeted this kind of examples over and again , for example a buisness man named Mithal , one of the richest person in the world and an owner of the largest steel industries in the world .
He hailed from a family which was very poor and was taught to do buisness only in a small scale but with an envision of new concepts he risked to buy a small steel industry and after that with a new concept of not making a stell industry , insted aquiring industries which are not doing good buisness in the form of colabration has led him to become the owner of largest buisness in the world .
This is only possible by taking a risk of applying a new concept with a vision .

The idea of taking risk and being successful has alsways been constanly rewarding to all the succesful people .
thus i strongly belive that a person taking a risk with agood vision would succed and become a successful person than by sticking to what he knows .
