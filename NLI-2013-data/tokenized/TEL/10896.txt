It is better to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what we know how to perfoem well .
I agree with the statement and I belivetrying new things may lead to discoveries .
society has developed a lot only because of the trying new things by many people .

Although there is a lot of risk involved in the trying new thing , but that may lead to many discoveries .
When I was studying in the college , all of my team in the class discovered a new thing about an antibiotic .
we tried many experiments in the lab and later we succeded and that new antibiotic got patent rights also .
we faced so many risks in our work , but at last we succeded .
Like wise many discoveries , for ex : medicines , cell phones , internet , etc , made our lives more sofisticated and changed our way of lives in an unbelievable manner .
All this discoveries have may risks involved in their work .

By trying many new thing by the succesful people , they remained as a role model for the next generation .
They will also involed in learning new thing from the school age onwards and they will try to imply that .
weather a person may succed or failed , but trying is important .
consider an example , computer was invented by charless babbage , which is very useful instrument in this century .
Later so many scientists developed the computer and mde that easy to every one .
In this century , we can not imagine our lives with out computer .
so many scients may have faced too many risks in developing a computer .
They are all role models to this generation people .
so now people are inventing I-pod 's , lap tops , etc.trying new thing would not stopped at one stage .
It is passing from one generation to the next

In ancients times , farmers tried to cultivate a variety of crops , which improved our standard of life today .
Now people are trying to developenew biotechnology products to improve the quality of the food .
Like wise trying in every field lead to the change in the society .

In the conclusion , eventhough many risks may involve in trying new things , but that many lead to succesful things .
I suggest every one to try some thing new , sothat the society or thenext generation people may benefit about that .
That fruit-ful results may change our lives .
