I am in total agreement with the statement , `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
Although many might object to this opinion of mine by simply giving the example of the huge increase in the production of the cars the world has witnessed in the last few decades , I would like to draw their attention to the reasons behind my backing the statement .

First and foremost , the industrial revolution that has first introduced the concept of faster and comfortable travel by means of cars has also led to an increased rate of depletion of the planet 's non renewable energy sources and not to mention an increased state of anxiety among the environmentalists regarding the way the pollution - air , water , land has been slowly eating up the planet .
This has resulted in an increasing number of ventures every day by various nations and their respective governments to tackle these issues .
For example , Japan has asked its citizens to use the older means of transport like bicycle to commute to their offices if they are nearby and now it has made a significant break through in designing cycles that are run by solar power and are as comfortable as driving a car to the work place .
It is these inventions that offer an alternative to stall the present energy crises and it can only be concluded that such desings are going to increase in number in the coming years owing to the fact that all graduate and professional colleges are encouraging their students to continue research in such fields .

Secondly , the population boom which many countries are witnessing would hardly leave any more space to build new roads .
The fact that skyscrapers were first built to conserve space makes me believe that even in developing countires like India , which incidentally has the secong highest population in the world , a day would come where commuters would have to travel from their residential places by means of fast moving , solar powered trains that run in between the residential quarters but at an elevated level .
And my belief is further supplemented by the huge technological leaps the world has made in the last five years alone .
To exemplify this point , I would say the communcations sector .
Who would have thought that within ten years of their introduction the cell phones have come a long way from their humble beginnings to their moders state-of-the-art sophistication .

Finally , my last but point that hugely weighs in making me stick to the statement is the underlying changes in the attitude of the people .
The last five to six decades have made people see the downfall of living a fast life and people have been showing a marked tendency to slow down the pace of their life .
People are turning to yoga and family support more than they previously did which makes me believe that inspite of more and rapid technological advencements in the years to come people have started showing more care for the mother nature and this will lead to a reduction in the number of cars that will be put on the roads in the future .
