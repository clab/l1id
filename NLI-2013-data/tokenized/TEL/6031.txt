The issue at hand is that whether in the next twenty years the use of cars is going to be reduced or not .
I believe that the use of cars is going to be reduced .

The first reason is that travelling in car is not safe .
You need to concentrate on the driving .
One should not get distracted while driving .
Where as travelling through other means like bus is much safe .
The drivers are very experienced and well trained .
Many people know this and many are still learning that travelling by car is not safe .
So i feel that cars are not safe .

The other reason is that cars are less ecomomical .
We need to spend a lot of money for petrol .
Presently there is a hike in the petrol charges and it is going to increase further .
For example i go to college daily by bus .
My college is around 30 km from my house and going by car costs me more .
so , i feel that cars will be reduced in the future .

The other reason is that we may have new inventions which may reduce accidents and be more economical .
Technology is improving at a much faster rate .
So definetly we will have new inventions which dominate cars in many aspects .
So i feel that use of cars willl be reduced in the future .

Every one is busy in this world .
while driving a car we waste our time in driving and need to concentrate more .
By travelling by other means if we can do some other work .
This is going to save time which is the most valuable thing in this world .

In conclusion i strongly believe that there will be fewer cars in the future .
