I disagree with the statement that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because in my opinion the youth today are much more involved in various activities than before and there involvement shows that they do have the time for the community .
they are more aware of the conditions and are more responsible and are doing everything they can .
this statement can be justified by the following examples .

firstly , the youth today are more aware of the conditons of the society and are willing to make a difference and do there bit to be a part of the difference not considering the time factor .
this is understood by studying the statistics of the number of young students signing up for the volunteer organisations today which are only invovled in actually working on the underdeveloped parts of the communities and various other activities on those lines , inspite of this involing some really menial work the youth are not stopped from enrolling into it .

secouldly , records of the number of donations coming from universities for improving the society also tells us something about them .
the students especially when a calamity strikes take time out and not being selfish , are seen playing full out to restore the conditions of there community .
the example of the hurricane khathrina can be taken when students from universities all over the US got to together by forming groups in there respective universities to gather everthing they can to help the victims in all possible ways .

finally the youth are also observed taking up community services performing services to clean up there own community .
they involve al the youth and make it a more fun activity rather than a time consuming one .
all these above examples justify me disagreeing with the statement of the youth not having time for helping the community .
yes the students today do have more challenges than they did and have many more things to do in there hands to survive in the competitive world but inspite that they do realise the resposibility and being resposible citizens in there respective countries all around the world work towards making a difference keeping the time constraint but using it efficiently by not allowing it to come in the way as a reason .

thus i would like to conclude by saying that youth today do give time to helping the communities because they understand the importance of it more than anybody else .
