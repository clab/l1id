The future and prosperity of any nation lies in the hands of the youth .
Young people are more dynamic and actlve than the old people .
The are srrong physically which gives them scope to enjoy life more than the older people .

If we take teenagers into account they are very keen and enthusiastic about their lives , as they have just stared with it .
The posses the zeal and interest to to do adventures where as the older people cannot .
For example my brother was 18 years old when he decided that he would become apilot i future .
He was very excited to take up the training classes .
My grandfather opposed his decision as he was scared to imagine that his decision may risk his life in future .
Eventhough he could appreciate his decision he could not dare to send him for training .
After several heated discussions my brother finally won over and got trained to be a pilot .
It invovled lot of hardwork and darring .
He could not have taken this job If he really liked to do it when he turns old .

Young people tend to make their lives adventurous and try out new things .
They dont bother about the consequences .
They enjoy thing like dating girls , which the old people hesitate to do as they think about their responsibilities .
When we are young our health permits us to taste a wide varieties of tasty dishes which the older people cannot relish due to their health limitations .
When we are young we can take the chance to experiment new things like bussiness or career and even if we fail we can still start up from the initial piont as we have the time and patience in our life .
Where as the old people cannot dare to venture as life does not permit them with sufficient time .

One cannot always state that the old people dont enjoy they enjoy thing but in a different way .
Expierience had taught them lessons and they do things cautiously .
They cannot always do what they want to do .
As per my view it is at the young age we live up to our own choice .
