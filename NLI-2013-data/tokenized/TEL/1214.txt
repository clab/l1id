It is said that `` knowledge is power '' .
But I believe that knowledge is power if it is used in an efficient way .
We acquire knowledge on different subjects around us .
But most of us get interested in a particular subject and try to learn more about that .
I prefer to say that it is better to have broad knowledge on many subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I feel so because with broad knowledge of many subjects we can become multiskilled .

Having broad knowledge of many subjects is always helpful .
Every science we deal is related to other sciences .
Even the technologies that are getting developed now a days are also demanding knowledge of other subjects to cope with the situations .

For example an electronics student need to have knowledge of computer , to analyze and make his work easy on chip design .

The world around us is made of many things which are related to physics , biology , mathematics and many other subjects .
If we focus on a particular subject and leave others it will be difficult for us when we may suddenly have to face a situation that needs knowledge of other subjects other than our subject of specialization .

For example one of my friend specialized in botany , he doesnot know anything about electricity .
He once kept his hand in bucket of water in which a heating water coil was placed and when power was passing .
He got a sudden shock because of that and he took two days to recover from that experience .
When I asked him about this , he was saying he was not aware of the fact that he will get shock if he places his hand in bucket containing water heater .
He is very good at botany , but this didnot help him out , to face the situation that dealt with electricity .

Finally considering all these issues and examples , I prefer to say broad knowledge of subjects is needed .
Ofcourse specialization in particular subject gives us a proper career , makes us learn deeply and have good knowledge of that subjectBut broad knowledge of subjects helps us to live in the society comfortably which is even more important .
