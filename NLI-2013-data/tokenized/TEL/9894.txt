Yes , ido agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
Generally people do things about they know and about what is familiar and if it becomes hard or difficult they try to shift to the other one after trying it for two to three times .
But , successful people wo n't stop doing that .
They will continue doing it until they will succed in it .
They contact many other people or do anything for obtaining the result .

Normal people also stops doing the work if they completed it doing or solving it .
But , successful people try 's to do they same work in a different or new manner .
They use their own way of thinking to solve the same problem .
They may think every matter in another way and try to solve it .
Successful people also dares to do anything .
They take risks without hesitation .

They love to take risks .
they trys very hard for doing anything .
For example , a person might think of keeping a restaurant .
Firstly , he should take a risk over that business .
Because , it may raise the prices or low down the prices .
Normally people starts a work and if it goes down they will stop it continuing and goes to another one .
But , successful people doesnt stop it they even try to do some more improvements and start doing the work .

Once it might go wrong but , latter they will definetly succed .
Because , hard worker does n't gets the failure .
successful people not only succed they even go to higher position because , once if the business goes nicely they wont stop looking at them , they think of improving it in another way by extending their business to further more what people needed .
Thus , the successful people take risks in everything they do .
