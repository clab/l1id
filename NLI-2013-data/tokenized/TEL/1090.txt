Having broad knowledge is always better than having specialization in one specific subject .
But , this doesnot apply to every student .
We can classify this for students based on their level of education in two categories .
One is a undergraduate level student and the other is a graduate level student .

For an undergraduate student , it is recommened to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Having so helps him to know what fileld he is his intrested in .
He can choose the area of subject , in which he wants to specialize in graduation .
Moreover , any person should have minimun knowledge on different fileds .

Like if we take an engineer , if he does n't have minimun knowledge about human body , then he may face problems in his life .
Like he cannot explain well enough to doctor like an illeterate , if there is any problem with his health .
Also important is some political and general information for students who comes from enginnering , medical or any other filed .
Any citizen of a county needs to know atleast some history about his country .
He may be a big doctor , but if he doenot know how his country got indepence or who are the great leaders or atleast the geographical structure of his countrty .
There is no point saying that , i am a medical student and i do n't require any history knowledge .
He should have atleast some basic knowledge related to any field .

Where as in the case of a graduate student , it is better if he specializes in one subject .
He needs to concentrate on one subject and specialize in it .
Most probaly , a graduate student , like one after completing his masters will go for a job .
So , he needs to specialize in one specific subject , where he is dreaming to work .

A doctor needs to specialize in one particular field , like an eye specialist or become a cardioligist by specializing in heart related problems .

In short , we can say that a undergraduate level student needs to have broad knowledge of many subjects and a graduate level student can specialize in one specific subject .
