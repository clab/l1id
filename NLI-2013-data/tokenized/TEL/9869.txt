I agree with this statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they alredy know how to do well '' .
I support my answer by giving a simple example .
Consider the case of Micheal Faraday , the person responsible for todays electricity we are enjoying .
If he thinks like a common man that the light we get from the candle is enough , we would not have enjoyed all the benifits we enjoying today to lead a comfortable and a peaceful life in this present IT world .
He started his assumptions that oppositely charged electrons can travel towards each and finally he struggled a lot and shown the world that electons can travel and enlightened us not only with the his theories but also with his innovations .
Without faraday there is no electricity today .
He crossed all his way from the abuses of the critics to a person who has become a FATHER OF ALL ELECTRICAL ENGINEERS and who made all the lives of the world comfortable today .
So can you disagree with above statement after coming across Faradays life ?
Is it not risky working with all the electrical elements as a play toy ?

Look at another example of Yuri Gaugarin , who is the first person to step on to the moon .
Is he not adventures by totally taking risk and going to the space which is a lot and lot of million kilometers away from the earth ?
I think in this way he could easily recorded as a successful by taking risk of his life .
I think by this example you can totally agree with above statement that `` Successful persons takes risks to do innovative things .

These people dont do the things what we do , they simple do things what they feel like doing and finally they are the people who leads the world .
If you the example of a successful business techniques now adays they simple do advantures or take risks in introducing new innovative products that are likely to be welcomed by the customers .

So i conclude by saying that now adays people welcome changes than the regular stuff we use everyday from the clothes we use to the eatables we use .
So i feel like sussful people are in major proportions in people who do things in not a regular the others do .
