I donot agree that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communties .
Youth are very enthustiastic about helping other people .
I can prove my point with real life examples of me and friends are giving our best effort to improve our communities in all sort of ways .
It is a big misconception that youth is inactive in community service today .

First , I have a friend called Ravi .
He is a very busy and diligent student .
He very normal and contemporary .
But , he never allows these reasons to overshadow he ability to perform community service .
He went a eye hospital `` AMG '' in Rajavolu in Rajahmundry .
This is free hospital for the health needs of the poor and needy .
He wanted to give his best effort to support the cause of the hospital eventhough he is very busy .

During holidays for the 9th summer , He became involved in eye screening of the poor school children .
After receving the guidance of a establisted opthamologist he went to screen the children for vitamin A deficiency .
He made a check list of each symptomes for individual child and reported it to the doctor for more medical care .
Next summer he became involved in Glacoma awareness camp .
In this camp he counselled patients and explained the importance of medication for the serious disease such as Glacoma .
These were few for his many accomplishments .

He told his friends including me the joy in giving a `` hand of help '' for our community .
His expriences had a huge influence on us .
We too became involved in various voluntary services .
I became involved in adult education campaign .
Here I taught some illiterate adults basic reading and writing skills .
This experience had huge influence on me .
I could access how valuble education is when I saw the plight of the illiterate adults .
I will never forget this experience .

Finally , All these experiences show that youth definetly involves in community service .
Youth need encouragement and good support from thier family and friends to make this possible .
Youth will realise that community service give a kind of self satisfaction that very valuble .
In conclusion , young people realise that this society is ours and we have responsibility to serve for our societies .
