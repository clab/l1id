Pollution is the majorfactor now a days .
people realised about the importance of protecting the environment from pollution .
fuels which we use to run cars are non renewable sources .
in twenty years these fuels may be less in available so iagree with the statement that usage of cars will be decreased in twenty years .

Firstly environment is being polluted by burning of fossil fuels .
due to this many people are suffering from diseases .
to decrease the pollution the only way is to stop burning fossil fuels .
for this you need to stop using cars and automobiles .
for example in chaina the people started using bicycles insted of cars .
this shows that how people are realising the importance of pollution .
people may alternate ways for their transport in feature .

People are all ready realised and using bicycles .
usage of bicycle is a form of exercise .
it helps to keeps the body fit and healthy and it also helps to keeps fresh and active all the day .
it is also one means of transport .
i hope usage of bicycles will helps in two ways one being healthy and another one is transport .

Cars use fossil fuels like petrol and diesel to run .
these are nonrenewable sourses .
because of more usage of cars now a days there will be decrease in fossil fuels in feature .
because of this the cost of fuels will increase automatically .
because of increase in cost most people of middle class people will stop using cars .

By consedering these , many people will stop using cars in feature .
and i think people will try alternative for transport by considering above facts and reasons i conclude that usage of cars will be decreased in twenty years .
