The question being given is whether i accept that fewer cars only be used after twenty years than we use now .
I disagree with statement .

The reasons I would like to mention is tecnology is growing day by day people expect changes in all their fields

Tecnhnology advancement had made many canges with people .
Normally people wants see everything new in their life they do n't do tgo with their routine work in life .
If a person has a scorpio car then he/she will aim for a benze car if they have a benze car they prefer a car which has more advantages than a benze car .
Human expectations has no satisfaction limit .

Secondly car is more comfortable compared with any other mode of transportation .
It provides more comfort .
For example a bike ride is not as comort when compared with a car it cause pain to shoulders

Car travelling is the one among the easier mode of transpotation For example , for our daily life we cannot depend a train or flight to travel .
With cars we can also have more convinent features we can also listen music by playing audio in our car it makes our drive more interesting .

Car is one among the fastest mode of land tranpotration it more convinient for all types of people for example , it takes less time to reach our destination with a car when compared to train

Finally , I prefer car because it is more comfortable and luxurious it
