I do agree with the statement - Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
High risk , High returns .
Taking high risk in a planned way and executing the risk according to the plan will surely give high returns .
Every person needs returns and high returns definitely make a person popular and successful .

Entrepreneurs are one of the examples .
Entrepreneurs are the risk bearers and try for the new things .
Its obvious for an entrepreneur to bring in a new thing into the market and which is of very high risk .
If the planning and execution of the work is perfect than the risk can be minimised and can earn high returns .
Returns are the main objective of any Entrepreneur .
If returns are achieved then he/she will be successfull .

Imitative entrepreneurs are the one who imitate the existing product .
Imitating the product which is already existing product is of very high risk , so the entrepreneur tries to bring the product in a new way and comes with a better one .

Trying new things is definetly taking risk and acheving success makes the person successfull .
Doing the things in a common way will bring success but it wont be as recognised as the one who tries it in a different way .
This statement will be more suitable for the business people .
All the companies / firms try to come out with a product in a new way .
For example , mobile phones .
Mobile phone main purpose is to communicate , but the research and development had designed the mobile phone in a new way by including camera .
all the multimedia features , etc in it .
Some mobile phones click in the market and some are out of the market with in a short span .
All mobile companies have tried with new things instead of doing what they already know how to do well .
Nokia is the one mobile company which tries new things and is in number one position .
