I completely agree with this statement .
People become successful if they try different jobs and attain success in them .
But trying different jobs involves risk .
Hence to become successful tring different risky jobs is essential to any person .

Anyone have to try differet jobs to know in which they are talented as well as interested .
If we go on doing the same things which we know , there is no further gain .
We as well as lose the interest in what we are doing and finally get bored .
Then we cant move further .
We just dont know the destination .

If we go on trying new things we will certainly reach our destination one day or the other .
Then we can develop ourselves in that task .
Few of the scientists have invented the best things which we are using today by experimenting in different fields or tasks .
According to me without experimenting and taking risk one cannot achieve the best of what he can .
Though not experimenting may not make the person a failure .

Enjoying life somewhat involves in attempting various tasks .
Actually , the law of life is to face new tasks day-by-day .
this law is just implemented to attain success .
We see in our day to day life , many people in different fields are trying new tasks .
few examples are - actors trying in different concepts and themes to show their versatality , bussiness-man introducing new products and new advertising techniques , software engineers tring to work out and invent new soft wares etc ...
Trying on different jobs may lead people to failure many-a times but this should not become a break to their experimental nature .
They should recover from the failures and rise to success as said in the following proverb - `` Failures are stepping stones for success '' .this means that a person can learn a lot from failure about what to do and not to do .
This experience makes the person more and more perfect as the time progresses .

So according to me everyone should try new tasks and accept challenges in life not only to attain success but also to enjoy the life in various aspects .
