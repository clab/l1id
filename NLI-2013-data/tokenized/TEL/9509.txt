I agree this point that it is more important for students to undestand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Because understanding concepts make them to deal with the problems which are occured with that particular concept .

Let us take one example by learning the concept of computers we may able to use it in an efficient way .
we are also able to deal the probles found with it .
Only the person who knows about the computers can only deal with it .
By knowing the concepts we are able to have good ideas about developing that concept .
And we can creat a new concept .
We are well experienced by knowing the concept

Concept undertanding makes us to have more command and control over a concept than learning facts .
We do not get experienced by learning facts .
we only know about the thing and working about it .
But knowing the concept we know the process of it and internal structure of it .
By understanding the concept we can even try to work with the other fields for example .
If a person knows about the programming language ` C ' he can also try to work with ` JAVA ' because some syntax are same in both of the languages .

We cannnot have an idea by learning facts .
they remain unchanged even after the many years .
We may have new ideas by understanding concepts .
We also become experts in taht particular field .
By understanding the concept there is no scope of forgetting it .

So i suggest students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
