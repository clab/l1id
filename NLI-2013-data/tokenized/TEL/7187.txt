I totally agree withe statement because , due to following reasons :

1. As the population increases , the usage of cars is increased day by day and one day it will reach to peak level where there is no space to park or drive the car .

2. Secondarily , as the pollution increases usage of cars may be reduced and also avilability and price of the fuel has also been raised which may lead to fewer cars in use .

3. As the traffic increases public prefer to travel by public transport inspite of taking stress and strain to travel by cars in the traffic .
4. Due to increased production of variety of cars year by year and increase in the price of the car , public may not afford to buy the car .

5. Many people who would like to travel long distance they dont usually prefer travelling by cars instead they take public transport system to travel .
6. There may be other reason which can be guessed of less car usage is , if the cars are affordable to buy by the middle class families it may become a traffic problem as more public tend to buy the cars instead .

7. Nowadays , buying a car is easy , but due to higher growing fuel price .
Maintenance of the car has become expensive .

8. Due to higher usage of cars there may be shortage of parking space in the offices for the employees to park their cars .

9. There may be higher risk of road accidents .

So , may be in twenty years there will be surely less usage of cars as compared today .
