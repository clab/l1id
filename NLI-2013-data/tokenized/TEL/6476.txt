The mans need for decrease in time for travelling has resulted in increased number of vehicals .
The most common means of transport is through public .
But , with growing needs of man this is not the case .
Man has started to buy his own vehicals mostly cars as they provide a convenient mode of transportation .
The one of the reasons behind this is that a car provides a perfect mode of transportation for the whole family .
The car is more benificial as it provides a lot of space sit and provides a lot of space to carry things that are required to make a perfect holiday .
this is unlike public transportation were you will have to carry your own luggage where ever you go thus , leaving your belongings to their own fate .

There is an increase in number of cars used now a days .
As they not only provide total satisfaction but also provide an image in the society .
Today we distinguish people by their clothing , their social behaviour and their social status .
Thus , in a race to prove their social status men have bought cars and bikes that are real expensive .
Not only that the modern day youth is obssesed by the fastest cars available thus leading to increase in motor sports like formula 1 and etc .

The advancement in technology has drasticaly effected the requirements to built a car that fits the modern day world .
The companies like hundai etc ; have made techincal advancements like introducing microprocessor chips inside a vehical feul system .
Have made the youth crazy them .
unlike the past there are a lot of companies that offer quality products thus insearch of a good marketing stratagie these motor vehicals were made more technically equiped .
Thus leading to technical advancements where one could automat his vehical to reach his destination , he could find which hotel is nearby and can even access internet and could see where he is .
This is made possible through satellite communication known as gps .
thus all these advancements in technologies would lure even a common man to buy a car rather than travelling through public transportation .
Thus i see a growth in increase in number of cars rather than a decrease .
