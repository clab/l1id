According to my opnien on argumrnt evolves an approch int he direction of supporting the that Sucessful people try new things and takes riks the said aspects that title there by illustrating some factors that are seginificent to the points put forroward as stated below .

Most of the sucessful people try new things and take riscks .
Because sucessful people mind is very shorp they think differently compared with others .
If they see ant new things suddenly asks him self 3QUESTIONS what ? , why ? , when ? .
then they start thing about the newly seened objest then they keep patents to learn about that .
We know that `` Room was not built in one day '' and they take risks for that .
As we know that `` Where ther is a way There is a will '' .
They not live inthe middle they research up to end .

Form past we learn lot of things sintests discover every thing now we are engoying what hey discover .
Sintests are always sucessors they do not leave any one in the middle they fight up to reach the goal .
Thats way they deisover alot .
They do not stop at the discovery off one thing , theysearch for next time morre accurate one or else for any new discoverys .

sucessors or god gifted people teir mind always think about new things and resesrch for now ones .
As they do like that now we enjoy all leaxury things .
Every one thing for new things but some peoples fight till end of the battle they are the Sucessors .

Try for new thing have lot of benifites than only doing already kown to do well .
for Example Robbrt didnt think about plain now we cant move from one city to another .
search for new things gives more leaxuories life for the next generations .
at the ame time doing already know we can improve the performans in more acuurate manner .

Rearching for new things govern ment gives more encoragement as it benifies to socity .
Altho elabration if argument has sreveral sucess aspects and few draw backs over weight give
