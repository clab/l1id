Whenever there is a lecture beign given , the students often get involved with the subject that they start implementing the ideas and start developing few analyzstions regarding the teachings , but hardly try to understand the facts behind them , basically the originality of the subject .
even though the facts are retold most of them try to repose them and concentrate on the concept .
the fact is that both the concepts and theory of the facts are important .
it is thinking and implementing some ideas about what is beign understood and developing the idea to make it real , this theory drives behind the knowledge of understanding and knowing facts .

many of them are interested in knowing the facts behind everything ( afterall , who does n't want to know the reason behind each matter or say topic ) .
this also may depend on the persons desire to use the facts in understanding the topic .
the differences in a study may be figured out due to the lack of facts known regarding that particular field .
though the reasons may be figured out , the fact is that learning through the new ideeas and the concepts are very much preferred by most of the future students , may be this ids the like of the newer generation .

for example , when a theory of pendulum is taught in a class the students do try to learn the principle of it but are least interested ( atleast Galileo ) in how it happened to be seen light , and again it is a different story .
the students start developing their ideas on the concept taught to them and start working to create or say invent something that is based on the principle of pendulum .
the same goes with the very popular Newton-apple tree story .
many theories have seen light after the principle of gravity is given byt he great Newton .
thereb are many instances that go in the same path , likeBohrs atomic theory , Rutherfords .
not only in the field of learning but also in the field of research these things do apply .
although the research feild require sthe students to remember the names of thescientists they do it for the namesake , but are rather interested in their researches .

finally , not only me but most of them would agree that the students are intended to get to nstudy the concepts , undersatnd them and thus leading to the better results .
although there may be a piont raised that the facts are a must for experiecing the situations and circumctances , it may be obvious that it goes thgrough the old saying `` failure ( s ) are the steps to success '' , wherein the students do try out getting new things and fail but rejuvinate with a roaring success .
I think for such things the need of facts to be known is not a of great help but finding out something new does make the joy double , encouraging , therefore , the future studentd
