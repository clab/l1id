yes , I agree with the given statement that `` young people enjoy life more than the older people do '' .
I justify this by giving and example related to health , patience and etc ..

young people can play many sports , eat well , thats the time to them to enjoy .
but the older cannot do that .
Old people like be decent and calm during their age .
thats obviously their nature because by that age every body will loose their patience and energy and want to lead a peaceful life .
And they are the who experienced every thing and they know whats good and whats bad and what to do and what what not to do .
and they will be very careful while they are doing some thing .

But comming to the young people its time for them to enjoy , they have to taste every thing in their life .
even it may be with their friends , in the techinical section , and for the young people have their own ideas and their own ways of enjoying .
after they do what they want to do they will be recognising the positives and negatives from what they have done and gain certain knowledge by their own .

If the older one restrict them to do something then they will feel some bad about them .
if they know whats bad and whats good by their own practically then they will take care of that incident or situiation in future .

If , there is any festival at our house the older people doesn , t come forward to enjoy , but the younger ones will be very much intersted in doing and enjoying .
the thing the older people and younger people differ in enjoying is depending upon their experience and also it depends upon their mentality .

For the older people there will be some restrictions for each and every thing .
for example that the older one cannot enjoy with his friends by going out and party .
because he will be in such a position that it will ristrict him but the younger one doesnt .
he surely and definetly go out with his friend and enjoy alot and party .

As the coin has two sides , we can support only one person that he is right and he is worng .
it mainly depends on their mentallity also .
some young people may not enjoy everything and the older ones may not restrict everything .
some may differ but moreover , most of the young people will prefer to enjoy every movement in life rather than the old people .
