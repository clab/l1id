Yes I do agree to the statement hat young peopleenjoy life more than older people do .
This is because of the fact that age withers body and an ageing person is laden with more number of problems than a person in his youth .
A younger person has less responsibilities comparitively .
Younger people tend to enjoy the technology and the happenings in the world around them more than the older people .
This is because of the problem that older people find it more difficult to adapt themselves to the changes around the world compared to a younger person .

Family problems and crisis add to the woes of older people .
The fear of being rejected by their children is always on the back of their mind and the tensions that the age brings with it seems to make older people more and more devoid of entertainment and enjoyment .

Health problems in the older age are the primary causes for older people to enjoy less than the younger ones .
With the increasing pollution and the rapid growth of diseases and the appearance of newer diseases day by day , older people are devoid of their joy .
A stamina and the resistance power of an older person is comparitively less than a younger person .
The older person is more vulnerable than a younger chap .

The pleasure that youngsters derive in spending their time with friends and frolicking is immense which is not so in case of the older people .
There may be some cases wherein even the older people might meet their friends and have some fun time but in practical sense and especially in the present day scenario , how far is that possible and how many such older people are really enjoying their life ?

Thus the health problems and being more and more burdened with problems with increasing age , older people find it more difficult to enjoy than younger people .
