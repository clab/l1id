As we are staying in a world which is changing from day to day they are many new things that has been invented and this is because people are trying to invent new things even though there is risk invovled in doing it .

It is true that successful people try newthings they take risk to achieve new things .
They will not stay out of trying new things even they face failure and if they face risk also .
For example i knew my brother who will not keep away trying even if it is involved with risk , he is very interested mainly in things like playing in fire , making the bicycle go threw the fire even though he had been burned in fire he did not stop trying it at last he succed in what he tought .

Some people make adventure things like playing with fire and climbing mountains and hills .
I think if they stay away with doing what they had already know how to do well there is no use in it .
If they do in that way there may be no technology development and the the world may be the same how it is thousands of years ago .
mainly scientists make many things like atombombs though it is risky for them , tey do it for the sake of country and they will succed in doing that things .

Aeroplanes which flow through rivers though it is very dangerous they did not stop inventing it , now it is very important to us it saves our time , many other things like missles , rockets etc have been invented without those people our life would not be so safe .

I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
There is proverb saying that `` Risks are the stepping stones for success '' and this is the one they are following .
