In my point of view i agree with the following statement that , in twenty years ther will be a fewer cars which will come in use than there are today .

I agree with the statement that , in twenty years ther will be a fewer cars which will come in use than there are today , because in this persent period there is a lot of computations between different companies of cars for example Maruthi , Tata , etc ; and there are many kinds of cars at persent like small cars , medium cars , and large cars .
these cars are made of different metals , different engines , different mechanicsm , different horse powers , etc ; as there are lots of compines comming from U.S.A , london , etc ; to india because they want to inprove their busniss .

For example , before there was only petrol engine cars and then the technology as improved , and then the people found out about diseal , and then the diseal engines cars were found .
and finally there is a third stage which came into existance that is an electric car .
by this rapid increase in the technology , we can see the increase in the models of the cars with respect to technology .

Hence because of this reason , that is a rapid increase in the technology , and the rapid increase in different varity of cars in this period , we can say that by twenty years ther will be a fewer cars which will come in use than there are today .
so looking at this point i would agree to the statement that , intwenty years ther will be a fewer cars in use thatn there are today .
