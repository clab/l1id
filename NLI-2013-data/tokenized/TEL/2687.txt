I strongly disagree with the statement .
old people enjoy their life as much as old people .
What i feel is enjoyment is a subjective perception and does not depend on age at all .
An older person can enjoy more than a young person also .
I feel enjoyment depends largely on few things like individual psycology , socio economic status , family circumstances and friendsand health ..

For example an old person of 70 yrs old , his mode of enjoyment is different .
he enjoys more with family his or her children and grand children or by reading spiritual things or doing things of his or her own intrest like reading books , listening to music or by going for a tour .
if an old person has all this facilities he can enjoy more than a young person .

If you select a young person his or her mode of enjoyment may be comlpletly different .
he or she may be enjoying his or her life by buying a sports car , going out with friends , shopping , dancing doing things of his or her own intrest .

what i would say is , enjoyment depends on how u are receiving things surrounding person and persons responce to that situation .
Young person may not enjoy at all if he depressed with his perfomance in education and because of his poor economic status and lacking good friends and having no family life .
and old person may not enjoy because of his health and family problems and physical uncoperativeness .

I would like to end this passage saying again that enjoyment does not depend on how old are you but it largely depends on people mentality , socio economic status and surrounings .
As far as i know their is no study saying young people enjoy more than elder people .
