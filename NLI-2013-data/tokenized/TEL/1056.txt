The first quote that comes to my mind when i read the statement is `` Jack of all , master of none '' .
I do not support incomplete knowledge not only because of its non reliabilty , also because it is harmful to a certain extent .
There has always been a difference in `` knowing '' some things about many things and `` mastering '' everything about something .
A specialization on a specific subject matter not only enhances ones ability to excel in that field , but it also creates some great oppurtunities for the person to make a mark in his field .
Having a broad knowledge in more than one subject does not complete the any of the above purposes .
The highest one can probably do is have a general talk about it and nothing more .
But thats not one can do all his life !!!
just talk a little about many things he knows .

Specialization is an achievement in itself .
It not only gives the student a satisfaction of achievemnt but also a sense of pride to have gained the kind of knowledge he has always craved for .
It gives us a kind of security within .
A kind of peace .
One becomes reliable on his most trusted knowledge on a certain subject .
One begins to trust himself and becomes confident of his actions , and CONFIDENCE IS THE ARCHITECT OF ONE 'S BRIGHT FUTURE .

Specialization does a lot more than just keeping one occupied proffesionally .
It increases the knowledge base of a person and also makes the person crave for more knowledge in that area and in this way he outsmarts himself everyday .
It makes ones life a challenge each day .
It makes ones life more and more exciting !!!
Area of expertise is not just appreciated proffesionally but also in the long run it is appreciated as a gathered amount of information on a subject matter .
It is not useful for the person alone but for the society , friends , family as well .
And hence i believe in mastering in what one is passionate about than broad knowledge of wide range of subjects .
