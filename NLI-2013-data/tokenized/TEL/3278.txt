That the point is young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities These is the computer generations .
Now a days the people are very busy and have no time to help their communities .
Today people are became bussiness mind and the young people seeing there own .
By helping the communities very good habit , by helping the communities we become a good for all .
By helping the communities we can also learn something .
and any help we want then they also help us .
The young people have much budden in studies or in job the people also have less time to think other persons .

Now a days the people have no time to think others .
The young people are busy there studies and jobs .
Now a days they have the compitition each and every were not in helping their communities The not have time to enjoy themself also .
From childwood they have no time the young people also messing alot of enjoyment .
but in that time also they helping to their communities .

In my opinion that the young people was given time to helping communities .
