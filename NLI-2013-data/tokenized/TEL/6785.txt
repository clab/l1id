Cars an efficent and comfortable mode of transport available to people today .
I do not believe that in twenty years time , the number of cars will reduce .
Their usefulness is immense and thus it is improbable that they will be replaced by alternative modes of transport .

However , it is quite likely that cars as we know them today may not be quite so popular twenty years from now .
This could be on account of several reasons .
Of course , human need for better and better products will drive invention and cars will become smaller , faster and more efficient .
However , the fuel prices might also have a major role to play in determining the types of cars in existence .
With petroleum prices going through the roof , it is quite likely that the major fuel would shift from being petroleum to electricity or some other renewable resource .
It may be argued that public transport being cheaper , would become the preferred mode of transport on account of rising running cost of cars .
However , it would not do to underestimate human ingenuity .
I believe that we are innovative enough to find new and better ways of running our cars so that they still remain an attractive proposition .

Also , the population of the world is increasing .
Also , it is increasing most rapidly in developing countries like China and India where the buying power is also simulaneously increasing .
With increasing population and buying power , the demand for the number of cars would rise .
Therefore , I think it is very unlikely that the number of cars twenty years from now would be fewer than today .

There is also the issue of infrastructure required to run cars .
Many people might argue that with increasing number of cars , the existing infrastructure of roads , highways etc. would become overloaded and thus dissuade people from buying cars .
However , I believe that with the developed world , the issue of infrastrucutre is not major and in the developing world , infrastructure projects are just taking off .
Therefore , twenty years from now , the developing countries are going to be much better equipped to handle the increased number of cars .
Hence , this would not be a major issue to car buyers .

Thus , I believe that all factors indicate that the number of cars is going to see a steady increase .
Therefore , I think that it is quite unlikely that the number of cars in twenty yeras will be fewer than there are today .
