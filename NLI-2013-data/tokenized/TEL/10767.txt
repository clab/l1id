`` successful people try to new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , I agree with this statement because that the person cannot get success without doing new things .
If he do the same thing that already done there is no anything special between the others and the successfull person .

I strongly agrre with this statement .
Example in our country there is one successfull person in the bussiness that he created many revolutions in the bussiness system .
He is the one of the gretest person 's in our country .
He use to do the new things istead of doing the same things .
He started with small firm and developed many types of products , He was not satisfied with the bussiness with the same products he strated many types of bussiness in different feilds and established a big group of companies .

He is very successful person in that feild eventhough he was ot satisfied with that .
He use to invent new one and start that firm , With that capability he started many small products and became a successfull person .
He started many firms in all feilds like in the feild cell phones , petro chemicals , cotton firms and finance groups and got success .
He is not satisfied with that same bussiness he wants to invent somany things mean the new things by that he became a successful person .
He also took somany risks to get succeed .

I conclude that it is correct statement that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well '' .
By using the above examples i can state that the person should have guts to start the bussiness in other feild rather than in the same feild he known well , It is also a risk to do new things but eventhough they know it is risk they use to do the new things that is the successfull person 's secret to success in life .
