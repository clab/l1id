As from years scientific technology has lot of impact on living conditions of people .
They emerged with new inventions to make life easier not only in communication but in safety also .
I strongly agree that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .

As technology made most of articles like electronic goods due to VLSI , Embeded sys and many other technologies they are less expensive as compared to olden days .
So there increase in utility and hence ease in living standards .
In olden days they dont have many ideas as they used by this new generations as .
There was one saying father wants his child start his living from where he stops , ie he expects him to live more extent than he used to .
He provide more care and entratainment than he enjoyed .

Due to increase in living standards there increased luxorious buildings and emerged new ways of living standards .
For examples in this year ie 2007 Arab country built a massive exploration of highest man made Palm Island .
It was built only with rocks and sand with use of advent GPS technology .
They have even take care of natural calamities .

By using artificial technology man has invented every kind like food , music , games , shopping mals , clubs , communities today youngh people enjoy a bit more than older people do .
There by emerging new thought of living and exploration , now growth rate of living people is increased .

As though prices of commodities reduced the remunerations of people salary was escalting .
So by this they enjoy better living than before .
Due to invention of internet the communication was increased as though now made world global , to be nearer and they enjoy many trips .

As due emerging technology and increase in safety measures of people livings , I personally believe that Young people enjoy more than older people do .
