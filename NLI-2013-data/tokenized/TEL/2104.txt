In my opinion , older people enjoy life more than young people do , although both of them have their own unique ways of enjoyment .
Young people mostly spend their time away from home enjoying outside , whereas older people enjoy most of their time spendind at home itself .
One reason may be that they are not strong enough to move around at that age or may be they have enough spent their time outside during their young age .
Younger generations are involved with studying and career development , where most of their teenage is runs off .
In contrast , older people must have either retired by then and so they can enjoy without any thinking for the future .

Moreover , responsibilities arrest the younger generations from enjoying their own life .
This does not happen with older people as all their responsibilities might have been finished by then .
For example , a younger person working has support his family finacially and should be responsible towards everyone in the family .
so , most of his time has been spent in accomplishing his goals and supporting the family .
Older people enjoy more because of lack of obligations at their age .

Although , younger people pass their time with friends , they do only occasionally .
First few years of teenage is spent in studying , after graduating jod search starts .
Later , work tensions builts up stressing in all aspects .
So , there is hardly anytime left over for joy in life .
In contrast , as the older people have already passed through these stages of life , they are absolutely free of such work pressures and hence enjoy their life to the maximum extent .

Another factor is money .
Older people are financially more strong than young people and so spend as much as they can because , they dont need to give explanation for the money they spent as do the young people .

To conclude , older people enjoy more than the young people .
