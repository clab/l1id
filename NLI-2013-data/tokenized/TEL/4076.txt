I disagree with the statement that `` Young people nowadays do not give time to helping their communities '' .
Because the young people of nowadays have become very responsible and honest towards their commumities .

The young people of present days are working more and they earnig high salaries , but they are always first in helping the communities the best example is the helping of the people , who are victims of occured sunami .
The students community and graduates colleted the money and the clothesand distributed to effected peoples .

All over the world the people say that furture of any country or place liesin the hands of the young , it seems to me that it is correct .
Expecially in the developing countries the educated young people are palying major in the elections , and they are always ready to help the uneducated people .

The young people are working very hard to get in to this highly compettive world , they are having less time to help the society .
But they always take responsibility to help their own community , in maintaing it clean and green .

The young people in different fields already helping their countries , specilly working in the millatry , research fiel
