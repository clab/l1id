The author suggests the young people enjoy life more than older poeple .
I neither agree nor disagree with the statement .
I believe it purely depends on the mind-set and the personality of the individual himself than it does on his age when it comes to enjoying life .
A pessimist in his prime would surely not enjoy life as much as an optimist who is in his old age .

Generally considering , a young person is not burdened with responsibilities and thus has a carefree life compared to the one led by older ones .
Thus , he would enjoy his life more than does a older one .
Also , enjoyment is an abstract word .
One may find enjoyment in partying , hanging out with friends doing all sorts of carefree stuff while others may find enjoyment in their work .
Thus , it is hard to say a person is fully happy when he is in a community gathering enjoying himself .
Also .
it would be incorrect to say that a person is not enjoying when he is seriously involved in work .
It just depends on what one thinks is enjoyment .

As it is , young age is the most enjoyable part of one 's life as a man is healthy without any ailments or diseases .
Thus , even in medical terms , he is well equipped in young age and thus , can enjoy life more .

When one grows older , one may find fulfiling his responsibilities to be a happiness .
Thus , he will be happy and may be more happy than a young person as he has no more responsibilities to fulfil .

Some people enjoy challenges .
Thus , when such a person encounters challenges and finds all possible ways to win the situation and starts applying these to his problem , he may find his life more joyful and more enjoyable .

I will conclude this essay by reiterating my stand that , enjoyment of life depends on the perspective of the individual than it does on his age .
