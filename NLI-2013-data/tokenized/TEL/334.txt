There is no doubt in saying that successful people try new things and take risks .
I agree with this statement cent percent .
In my view success comes when we try out something new .
Doing the things what we already know does not pave way to success .

For example , scientists try out new things in order to invent or discover things .
For instance , take the example of Mr. Thomas Alva Edison who is a successful scientist .
He took many risks and tried new things thereby inventing a lot of things we use today .
Likewise Madam Curie who took great risk in discovering radium was a very successful scientist in this world .

The reason for taking risks , in my view , is to reach out for new things and innovation there by getting success .
By doing the same things does not give us a chance to grow .
Another field which we can imply this statement is the field of business .
The basic rule of the business as far as I know is the ability to take risks at required times .
Without taking risks the business will not develop .
The entire commercial field and advertising field rely mostly upon the new things and risks .
The successful business persons in the past and present support this statement because they must have taken risk at some point of time .

In the field of information technology also innovation is very important and it is the basis of that field because it is a ever changing field .
We can add the space technology , biology , genetics and lot more fields in this list .
Whatever field and whatever conditions may be one has to take risks and try out new things in order to get success .
