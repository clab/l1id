people who are in successful in their lifes , will try new things to do and take risks in their jobs and find new things to develop thier ideas .
This suggest that people who are successful in their field will try alot things in their field , rather than doing what they already know how to do well in the perticular field .

Let us take an example : who is famous person in sports , who always win the 100mts distance .
All the time and he will not try to participate in100mts but he will participate in 200mts track .
Thus he wants to take risks rather than only participating the 100mts race , this is the way sucessful people try new things and get succeded in their lifes .

let us take an another example : who is a great scientist and he invented the things which are helpful to the people , and inventing things like that he will not keep quiet , he will try to invent another sort of things which are helpfull to the people .
A successfull person will not stop to invent new things .
Rather he want to take chances to do things .

In any field , people who are successful in their lifes will take some sort of dare to do new things .
Let us take about the business man who starts with small capital , if he get profit in that business he will not stop to expand his business dealings , rather he will take risks while expanding his business and make new events to elaborate his dealings .

Finally , I agree with the people who are successful try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to deal with in their respective fields
