I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I believe this because the students in an academic field will not have grassping knowledge to get the entire knowledge on one specific subject and its the teachers responsibility to explain the futures tasks which are going to be there in the subjects mind .

One reason , the students in an academic subjects will not require a specialize in one specific subject because the students will get a brief idea about all the subjects in the academic field .
And this will in turn give a good idea about the future goals , students can decide which will give a better idea of the subjects .

Second reason , the students in an academic subjects will not require a specialize in one specific subject because the students will get a broad knowledge of every subject in the academic subjects .
From this broad knowledge in a academic subject , the students in the future will know whats happening in the society and cultural activities in theie own place .

Lastly , the students in an academic subjects will not require a specialize in one specific subject because the students will be exposed to different type of environments which the students may face in the future and teachers should explain the students about the exploration and understanding of the subjects which are going to face in the future by the students .

Finally i conclude that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because a broad knowledge in every subject will give a better idea of all the subjects and students will have a bettter idea about the future goals .
