Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
i strongly agree with this statement because i strongly credible that without risk and coming up with new things there is no success in any field .

Firstly consider the example of film industry , in the film industry we always look for new things because people will not accept the old concepts .
the successfull director of the film will always shows intrest to take the risks and try new things in order to satisfy the people , then only he can be appreciated by the people and can be successful person in the industry .
if the director of the film is not willing to take risks and not intrested in trying new things , people get bored of his films and after 2 films his films will not be seen by the people .

Secondly for example consider the student .
if the student keep on studying books and and books and producing the same thing what he read in the exams he may get marks at that time but he cannot be a successful person and he cannot come up in life .
but student who always try newthings eventhough he is getting failed will come up in life and acheives grand success .
moreover he learns a lot things while trying new things .

Thirdly for example consider the good business person.a good business person wills to try new things and takes risks to improve his business .
he try and try new things eventhough he is getting loss in his business and finally het gets success in his business .
but the business man who dont try new things will not come up in life to the maximum .
whereas business people who try new things by taking risks will come up in life maximum .

Finally i conclude by saying that people can do well by implementing what they know but they cannot get maximum success in life .
but successfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know will get maximum success in life and these people will be the successful people in the society
