iam dis agreeing with the statement that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
the students more eager to learn through the experimenting the facts than the learning by understanding the facts .

because understanding facts is just theoritical .
learning facts is the practical .
so , i prefer experimenting than theoritical explanation .
when the student told by theoritically he may not understand .
where as if he showed practically surely he will understand .

for eg ; fact is water flows from height to the lower place .
if the teacher told him orally he may understand or not understand .
but if he showed the water flow once he wo n't forget .
so that fact should be proved practically then only every one understands .

ideas and concepts are told by some one .
the learn facts are by the student his own by in the learning process .
ideas and concepts are helpful in the academic wise .
the learn concepts are useful in leading life comfortably .
facts and concepts of all are not practicable .
so that along with the facts and concepts the learning facts are got equal importance .
initially student will understand the ideas and concepts .
as age grows he learns through the learning facts .

for eg ; in younger age what teacher tells in the class that student will grasp .
as he grow up he will like to impliment the facts by his own .
he starts think by his own .
so learning facts got the importance in application of own ideas .
