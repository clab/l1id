Yes , i strongly agree with the statement .
Successful people always try news things , implementing them at a great risk .
These people will always try to develop new ideas , implement them and create them incredible to the world .
In the process , they keep an eye on the previous experiences they had , rather than the people who just think about how to do , what to do and what not to do .

For example , the person who organise & co-ordinate the events for the first time , does n't get good appreciation for the work he did due to lack of experience .
But , he is successful because he has done the program to his best and even gets lot of satisfaction .
Moreover , he even gains the managerials skills , responsibilty to face the failures , communication skills interacting with other people around the world like getting sponors for the event , as a part of process .
Moreover , he can even get the managerial skills like managing the things effeciently and do the things in time with consistence .

Later on , he goes with the same project next year with all his previous expericenes and oragnises the event successful making an incredible work , none yet done ever before .
He even gets lot of support and encouragement from his fellow humans who guide him all the way along motivating him to the desired field of his interest .

The successful people are the only people who takes responsibilty and risk factors beyond the imagiantion .

Moreover , the positive attitude , zeal to work hard for long hours and getting pratice in that particular course of study gives much detail information , knowledge , expericence and satisfaction .
Thus , he is the successfull person rather than the person who doesnt do anything and doesnt work hard to get success and progress .
Instead , the unsuccessful people just thinks about what to do ? , how to do ?
and what not to do ?
The unseccessful people doesnt get progress as they are not interested and concern with that particular program or event being irresponsibility .

Finally , the successful people get much appreciation for their incredible work , implementing new things with a major risk factor .
whereas the unsuccessful people never get progress in their lifetime .
