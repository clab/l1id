The issue at the hand is whether the advertisements make products much better than really are .
This issue is very important because advertisement has become important part in everybody life .
I agree with the statement because they attract people to spend money whcih is offf no use .

The first reason , advertisements are one way of communicating the inforamtion about a product .
Advertisements convey information about the product in a way to attract people by infering the false information .
As a result the people who watched the advertisement tend to buy the product and comes to know it 's of no use after spending a plenty of money on it .
It may not affect the rich people but the middle class people would have spend this money on some other useful purpose .

Second reason , advertisements are important attraction to the people of different ages .
So people try to imitate the actions seens in the advertisements which affects person performing it and also their family who depend upon him/her .
This is happening because the advertisements gives only the advantage of it than explaining the disadvantages .

Finally the companies advertise for increase their buisiness than thinking of the people .
For example most of the drinks like soda : are harmful to the people health in many ways due to toxic present in them .
But they advertise these products with famous film actress or actor which attracts the people to buy the soda .
So in this way advertisements will not convey the complete information about the product to the society .
If the advertisements infers the complete information about theproduct the sales of it will decrease which will effects the company profit .
Now - a - days drinking of soda became a adiction to most of the people .

In conclusion i think commercials will not convey the complete and better information because to gain profits .
