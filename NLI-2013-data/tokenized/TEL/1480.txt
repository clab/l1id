Education is something which increases the self-esteem and improves knowledge of the one who tries to pursue that .
It also increases stature , which is of primary concern in today 's society .
Given the two options , it would not be a good idea to deal these two options in the same way .
So , I would like to view this topic in two different ways :

1. Undergraduate level
2. Graduate level

First , during undergraduate studies , a student has to learn a wide variety of subjects because it is the high time for him to learn the basics .
If he does not study many subjects , there wont be a difference between him and uneducated person .
After all , everybody expects him to be familiar with all the related subjects present in a stream .

For example , a Mechanical Engineer is assumed to have knowledge about thermal , production , design , material sciences and many more subjects related to his mechanical stream .
Because all these depend upon one another , it becomes absolute necessity to learn the fundamentals of all these in order to excel in mechanical field .
And the same is true about all the remaining streams too .
There is one more disadvantage , If he studies only one subject at this part of his life , he would probably find it boring and insipid as time passes , and would definitely end up becoming nothing in his life .

Secondly , during graduate level , it would be a better option to select any one of the subjects he is familiar with , and deal with that particular subject in detail .
Then , he will gain in-depth knowledge about a subject and that can help him in achieving a good job in his respective domain .
Later on , even if he finds the domain boring , he can drift towards different subject because he has the fundamental knowledge of many subjects .

keeping these two choices in view , I would suggest to gain basic fundamentals in your undergraduate level and then go on search for a topic which fascinates you and then pursue in-depth knowledge of that particular subject in your graduate and doctoral level .
In this way , you can become a jack of all trades , and , indeed a master of few too .
