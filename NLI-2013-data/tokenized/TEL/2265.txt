Being young is the reason of being active for a long time and being active would naturally imply to be in a state to enjoy for a longer time .
But there are some exceptions where even older people show their activeness for a long time which is in rare situations .
Young people can easily do the activities which the older people struggle for .
But even there are some old people who do the things easily .

Older people usually never dare for the adventures in their life for enjoyment where as most of the young people will not hesitate to go for adventures for enjoyments .
The old people probabaly will lose the interest of enjoying the life as they would put their interest more on the family matters , careers , future life etc , .
The young people having the plans for their future will more concentrate on enjoying the part of their lives .

Watching movies , going to beach , enjoying the beaties of the nature are mostly done by the Young peolpe as it can be clearly seen in any tourist place that most of the visitors will be the younger people .
Old people lack the interest in doing so because most of them doesnot have the strength to travel for a long time .
There are also some old people who never think of their pains for enjoyment .

Old people usually select the actvities for enjoyment only at the times of some ocassion whereas the Young people will always try to find the reasons for enjoyment .
There are also old people who leave the responsibilites aside and spend more time in enjoyment of life .

Hence I strongly feel that , its not the matter of age which decides the enjoyment but it is the matter of the attitude of the people towards life .
