I agree with the statement that there might be less number of cars in the future than they are in the present .

Firstly , I think global warming will play a major role in revising the transport modalities of the people .
Climate changes being reported by various environmental authorities are forcing people to think about the future .
Already lot of fuel effiecient cars are coming into the market and also cars which are using alternative fuels other than petrol which have less harmful emissions .
If research goes on in the same direction cars may be replaced with some other alternatives .

Secondly , growing population in the urban and rural areas and the number of people driving vehicles has become unregulated in many countries like india .
Narrow roads , traffic blocks especially during the rush hours is forcing people to use mass transport .
People are looking for alternative means of transport as they cannot afford to be late to work .
In twenty years time things might become worse and cars might not have anymore place on roads .

Thirdly , The growing costs of fuel day by day is making people think each time they drive a car .
In the future resouses might not be sufficient enough to meet the demands of growing vehicles .
In the past , people used bicycles , horses , etc as means of transport .
Now science and technology have led to the invention of cars , buses , aeroplanes etc according to the needs and supply of the present generation .
Where there is a need or demand for a particular commodity in the market , there will always be a supply .
As the demand comes down , manufactures might stop supplying cars but may shift to newer inventions .

People in the present are definitely relying more on cars and newer models and also the number of cars are increasing day by day .
Fuel efficient and environment friendly vehicles like hybrid cars might still have a place on the roads .
But in the future things might change .
Attitudes of people might change according to circumstances and changing times .
Growing stress levels , unsafety , accidents etc might be factors which might force cars out of roads .
Mass transport might play a pivotal role in the coming generations .
