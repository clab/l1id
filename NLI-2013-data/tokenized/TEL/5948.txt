Cars , which are considered as means of necessity now a days , were considered as luxury in 1950's and 1970's .
People since 1970 has increased using cars because they stand for prestige .
The present topic is use of cars in twenty years , whether there will be more or few cars in use .

There are both advantages as well as disadvantages of using car .
Advantages could be 1 ) economical , as the whole family could travel at the same time and costs less when compared to the expenses of travelling by train or bus .
2 )
Second advatnage could be halting or taking rest when wanted .
The disadvanatges could be 1 ) pollution , 2 ) increasing traffic , 3 ) more accidents .

Now-a-days , people in cities like london , tend to leave their cars at home and prefer travelling by train to their destinations and this probably could be due to INCREASED TRAFFIC , which delays people from commitments .
So I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use .

The second point that inclines me to take the side of the statement is POLLUTION .
Most of the people are suffering with respiratory diseases like asthma , chonic bronchitis and for this pollution could be blamed partly .
People who lived all their lives working in bigger cities tend to retire in country side to avoid air and sound pollution .

So this could be one of the reason that in future use of cars will be lowered .

The third point which supports my decision regarding fewer cars in use in twenty years is obesity and physical fitness .
People are more bothered about their physical fitness as they are busy with the work and ca n't exercise in leisure time .
So as a matter of fact most people to improve and maintain physical fitness ride bikes to work than using cars .

So to conclude , with all the above reasons there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
