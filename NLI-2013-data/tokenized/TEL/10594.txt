I beleive that a person faces all sorts of risks to become a successful man .
Without taking any risk it is impossible to achieve greater heights and become a successful person .
Therefore I strongly agree with the statement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well . ''

Today we are enjoying a lot of inventions and discoveries made by successful people who took risks and even sacrificed their lives .
For example aeroplanes , space crafts etc .
If the Right brothers would have thought why to take risk and invent an aircraft , we would not have travelled from one country to other country .
Same thing with aircraft people would never been landed on moon .
All these we are enjoying today are the risks taken by successful people to invent new things rather than doing what they already know .

I have my own experience regarding this , I have a stage fear and I do n't participate in any tasks that involve a large group of audience .
When Iam doing my graduation , there was a science fare competitions going on in my city , the one who stands first will be given scolarship for graduation .
I was inspired by my father , he is very courageous , infact he worked for the army .
I took risk and participated in the fare by displaying and explaining how various stimulants like agonists and antagonists act on frog 's heart .
I stood first in the competition and from then onwards , I started participating in all competitions .
I beleive one should take risk and enjoy the fruit of success .

Taking risk also involves money .
Investing a huge amount of money in a business , for which success is unpredictable is a type of risk .
My uncle invested a huge amount on his software business .
He worked very hard to invent new softwares and became a successful man in notime .
Now he is able to provide jobs for hundered 's of people .

I finally conclude that , success depends on trying new things by taking risks rather than doing what we know .
