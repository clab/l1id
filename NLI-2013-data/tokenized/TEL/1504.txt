It is definitely beneficial to have broad knowlegde of many acadamic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are many reasons and examplpes to support this , from history of past centuries to the day today .

Having broad knowledge about many subjects leads to a broader scope of developement both for the individual and for the society .
It helps to solve certain problems which involve complexities and interrelation of two or more subjects .

From the past history we can relate many persons who have been successful in their work because of having a broader knowlege about other subjects .
For example , Leonardo Da Vinci was an artist , a philosopher , a scientist , an inventor and a sculptor .
Many of the historians believe that his paintings and his sculptures had a great resemblense with the true humans .
And they state that this special resemblense came because of his interest in anatomy of the human body .
It may be noted that science and arts are two different subjects .

Also there was a misconception in the earlier days of development of science that few subjects or propeties were independent , like mathematics and physics ; electricity and magnetism .
But they were proved to be wrong .
Mathematics was invented for counting and developed for its applications in science .

Surely one would not desire to use integration , differenciation and geometry for counting .
Even today , the technology is being changed rapidly and many subjects are becoming interrelated .
For example , computing and electronics .
Thus it is often good to have much knowledge about many academic subjects , rather than to specialize in one specific subject .
