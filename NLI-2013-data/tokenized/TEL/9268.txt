I agree with the statement that `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts '' .
It is mainly because by understanding the main idea and the concept we can try answer a few questions rather than keep learning the facts .

Like for example in Mathematics there are several problems that we go through and there might be many other ways in order to solve these problems .
It all depends on the person who is solving the problem .
Every person might have a different idea for solving the same problem .
For example in a class of 30 students if a question is given and the students are asked to solve that question then all the students might be able to solve the question and also get the answer but the method in which they solve is different .

If we just understand how to solve the problem thats more than enough we need not learn the different ways in which we can solve the problems .
Just understanding the problem is enough .

Even in the exams if we have just started a topic and cant remember even a single thing that we have learned then just understand what that topic is mainly about and write what you have understood about the topic .

Another example can be in seminars .
We cannot everything and anything that the speaker says on the stage but just understand the main idea and concepts that are being covered in the seminar .
In this way it will be easy for us to understand the seminar topic in a better way and if have any doubts also they can be clarified .

If the main idea of the problem is understood then everything else is easy to handle .
So it is definitely better for us to just understand the ideas and concepts instead of learning the facts .
Sometimes it might be too late for us to learn facts about something rather to understand the main ideas and concepts about the same thing .
Like in the example of exams we cannot learn everything and remember everything while we are writing the exam .
Instead it is better that we understand the main idea and concept of the topic .
In this way we can remember the topic for a longer time and can also recollect points about that particular topic where ever it is needed for us to and also give our opinions about the topic .

So in my opinion `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts '' .
So it is better for a student to understand the main idea of the problem and work towards that problem rather than sit and learn about the problem .
Who knows it might be too late to solve that particular problem .
