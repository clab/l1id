Now a days young people are affected by many aspects of the society , so that they ca n't able to help their communites .
I agree with the statement by the following reasons that , because of their education system , extra curricular activities and affect of media etc .

Firstly , I could discuss about education system .
In my country our education system makes all students so busy all the day .
They are busy with their tight schedules of classes and study hours .
They do n't even have a minute to spend time with their parents .
As a graduate student I am also facing the same problem .
So that they do n't have time to help the communities .

Secondly , young people are used to spend their time by extra caricular activities , for example playing sports , participating in seminars , giving paper presentations and attending conferences that are realted to their education .
All these factors makes them so busy .
I also used to attend the seminars and conferences when I get a free time .

Finally , media has its great impact on youth .
For example television , internet , magazines and TV channels .
All these factors are attracting the youth .
So that they are wasting their time by spending their lot of valuable time to watch TV , using internet etc .
One of my friends , who was also my classmate , addicted to internet browsing and chatting .
He spent most of his time by chatting with his friends .
Therefore he spoiled his carrier by neglecting his studies .
This incident shows how the youth are inclined to unnecessary things and not showing their interest in helping communities .

All these factors indicates that youth are spending their time for their personal activities .
However , some of them used to participate in some social welfare activities , such as helping poor people and orphans .

I conclude , that most of the youth use their time for their own purposes rather than helping their communities .
So that I agree with the statement that , `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
