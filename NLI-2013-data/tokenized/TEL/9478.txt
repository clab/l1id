I agree that students should understand ideas and concepts than learning the facts alone .
With out understanding of an idea or concept , the application of a fact doesnt happen .
If you just learn the fact , you may memorise it but do not know where to exactly apply it .
Practical application requires understanding of a concept .
For example If a child simply learns the fact that `` Telling lies is bad '' with out understanding the importance associated with the statement , it may end up in dilemma in many situations .
On the other hand if the child is explained and given proper idea or concept of what happens when you tell lies , using real life simple examples , it may confidently avoid telling lies and adhere to habit of speaking truth .
Also you can take an instance of a student who memorised the whole theory but unable to demonstrate a practical technique because of lack of understanding of the concept .
So understanding the concept or idea is required to know its importance and to enable them to apply it in practical situations .

Furthermore , learning a fact is better if you understand it in a right way .
In other words , if you understand the concept or idea involved , learning a fact is simple .
It can be illustrated with an example of child learning Fractions in Mathematics .
If child simply memorises that 1/2 is greater than 1/4 , it may get confused while taking test .
But if you make the child understand the concept using a cookie by dividing one cookie into 4 parts and explaining that each part represents a fraction .
So the three parts are more than two which inturn is more than one part .
So child can understand that 1/3 is greater than 1/2 which is in turn more than 1/4 and be confident solving fractions on exam .

Also understanding a fact or concept promotes deeper understanding .
For eg a child who memorised the fact may not be able to answer if a question about a topic which he/she memorised is asked in a different way .
But one who knows it 's application or understood the concept answers without hesitation .
Learning only promotes short term memory , which is susceptible for getting lost .
But the ideas and concepts we understand enter the longterm memory and henceforth sustain forever .
Moreover while doing things , the concept of which is understood , we can act spontaneously .

In short developing concept or understanding ideas about things will make learning more easy , permanent and logical .
Henceforth students should develop understanding of a fact before learning them .
