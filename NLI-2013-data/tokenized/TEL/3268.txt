I do believe that the young people nowadays give enough time to help their communities .
I am making this statement based on severel experiences which I have described below .

Recently there was a proposal for reservation of seats in leading educational institutions for few sections of the community in India .
Lots of young people opposed to this law .
There were protests in several cities against this law .
I also took part in a protest in the city I lived .
We protested by carryout a peaceful rally in the city .
In all these protests it was observed that the majority of the protesters were young people in the age group of 20 to 25 .
It is intersting to note that these young people donot gain anything from this protest but they knew that the law would kill the merit and affect the next generation of students .
This was their was of helping the community and they were successful at it .

Another instance in which I was involved and where I felt that the young people were doing their part to help their communities is described below .
About a year back I was involved with a voluntary organisation which worked towards the upliftment of poor construction worker kids .
We had planned to organise a party for these poor kids and we needed volunteers to organise some games and sports for the kids and also raise some money for the event .
We made a call for the volunteers and its was great to see that lots of young people turned up .
The volunteers not only helped in organising the event but also raised money for the event by donating from their pockets .
The event was a great success .

Also I see lots of young people involved in creating AIDS awareness India .

I do agree that in this age of fast life , people find it difficult to take some time out of their busy schedule to contribute to the society .
But I do feel that all the young people are doing thier part by spending money or effort to help their comminities .
