I 'm agreeing with author , that the younger people hwo are brought up in this generation they are not giving enough time to help the communities which they are leaving , they are enjoying the time & the environment which there parents are giving to them and they are enjoying with there friends and having chit chating and wasting there time and not seeing outside world which they are presently leaving .

The people are so blindly following the rules which they are kept by there own for the sake of tehre enjoyment and not helping to the communities which they are in need of help and the help which they can effort they can give there hands to the people who are very need of them like denoting there old clothes to the childrens who they do n't have to wear also , they can give some money by buying the product and it help the childern who do n't have the money to go to school and they can donate some money to the hospitals for the heart problem children by doing this type of things they can save the one single life of the children , for this also the younger generation people do n't have time to spent the for this type of activities they will send the money to those things which are useless and they will not get any thing from it they will just wasting of there time by watching movies and spending the money for parties and enjoying with some body and getting some harmfull disease like HIV & AIDS , they most of the people are getting effetecd to this type of disease so are just spoiling there life at the begining of the life .
The can join the communities whch the government had intorduced for the sack of th samll children and the old age people they can help the people which were there in there hands .

The younger generation people who are leaving in this genertion are not giving the enough time to help their communities which were there at their sourounding they are help-ing to the people and they are not even looking at them also they are thinking that by helping them they will be joked by there fiends and they will looking form top to bottom so they are comming forward to help them , so my suggestion is that do n't feel shy and help the communities which are going to help .

So please help the communities which are present in our city on give the helping hand to the people who are in need of us , by giving the hand they can also come in this beautiful world and they can also enjoy like you which you are enjoying today .
