I strongly agree with this statement that there were very few cars in use twenty years before when compare to today .
Earlier there was very less population in the world , the number of people use the cars also very less at that time .
The wages of the public or employees also very less , ways of income is very less because of lack of resources .
there was lack of technology .
in olden days even though they are financially strong enough the does not want to buy a car because they feel it makes them lazy .
since the time of increasing the population all over the country the usage of the cars also increasing because as the years are passing away the technology is increasing , the resources are increasing and the wages of the employee also getting increasing .
Now a days there are somany ways to earn the money .
in olden days cost of the car is very high but now it is came very much loe and it is with in the reach of a middle class family .
sSo most of the middle class families also buying the cars .
this rate increasing rapidly in the cities mainly because of pollution .
this is true that so many people in the cities are buying the cars because of heavy pollution from the vehicles .
the other reason is to live their life luxuriously with their families .
There are some other reasons those are the travel agencies .
Most of the travel agencies are using the cars to provide transport fecilities to the public .
Local taxies also one of the reasons to use more number of classes now a days .
To conclude it , this difference is mainly because of change in the way of lifestyle from the earlier time to now and the developing the technology which getting down the prices of the cars .
