I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
i think successful person is one who had done many risky thinks in his life time thats why we called him as an successful person , we dont achive great things if we ar n't take risk .

For example if we consider MADUM CURY she was on of the great women scientest 's , she discovered RADIUM ELEMENT , it is one of the natural element which emmites radiation , at the time of reasearching she knew that radiations from the radium could cause a very seviour dammage to her body , even though she knew it she has taken the risk , which led to the finding of radium , radium is use to generate electricity , and is also used to cure the some of cancer deasess , at the time of her experiments is she does want to take risk of her life now we probabuly may not know radium and there may not be cure of some of the cancer deasess .

Another example is WRIGHT BROTERS who were the invention of the aeroplane , they ar n't invented aeroplane but they have invented the blue print of aeroplane and they have showed proof that humans can also fly like a bird , from their imaginations and their inspiration let into the invention of aeroplane .
if they think that it is risk in doing experiments in flying , it is different from the way we see the world now .

with this invention it make us easy to travell place to place and thier risk factor changed our way off seeing the world so with these specific reasons and example i think that there is no other way of getting success by try new things and taking risks .
