According to a recent survey conducted in the colleges of India , maximum number of students have Mother Teresa , who believed `` Service to man kind is service to god '' as their role model .
This very clearly shows what the present day youth feels about their responsibilities in helping others .
The fact that students are organising public marathons like the great Mumbai marathon for social causes , relief funds can serve as clear evidences to refute that statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities '' .

Youth , infact are being creative and finding out new ways of solving the problems of the community .
For example , the idea of selling wrist bands , which have become a style statement , worth rupees ten for twenty five and using the profits for the rehabilitaion of AIDS affected shows the innovation and also the response with which the youth has accepted the idea .
The exposure to international culture , more awareness of the existing problems are driving the youth to think and work towards the solution .
The craving for a better and enriched life for everyone is the logo of many youth unions today .

Although , the present day requires to be more competitive at work place , studies or any field in general , youth have their priorities clear and they do have the schedule planned in which they have fixed time for their social work .
For example , I am an undergraduate student but i have my weekends to work for the organisation CRY , which is an organisation working to abolish child labour in the country .
Though i cannot call this two day work for my society enough , but I believe this definitely is no lesser than what previous generations used to do .

The present day youth is infact taking one step ahead .
There are a good number of students who have taken up social activity as their full time work , as a profession not to make money but only to serve the needy .
I , can strongly say that we , youth are giving our share of work for the society and will continue to do it so in future .
