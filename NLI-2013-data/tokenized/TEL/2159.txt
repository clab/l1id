I think that young people would enjoy more than old .
I didnot want to stick upon it .
older people are once young only , so they have enoy their teenage life .
young ones have no responsibility about the family .
they will have no tensions .

older ones have family tensions and they are now aged , so they donot have that zeal anymore .
For young ones they will try to do everything new and which is intersting .
The examples for such situations are they just take part in rock climbing and they participitate on having a roadies show .
They are many things student or young ones perform in day to day life .
Enjoying life does seem to participitate in cultural activities .
some may prefer having as many as girlfriends as a meaningful one to their position etc .
The older ones will get so much tired and they probably have several health problems .
Taking guidance to their children about stiudies and different persecptives of them and to look about their health .
They probably will have no time in doing other activites othe than these which are enjoyable .

young ones have no certain problems in it .
But they have to study as well as enjoying .
The family responsibilities would depend on him so much .
BY experience I noticed t older ones also enjoy , but to a little extent rather than young ones .
