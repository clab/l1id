I agree with that , the successful people will try new things and take risks rather than doing only what they already know how to do well because he can get into learn new things which may be useful for his future life with good knowledge , these people put all the effort inorder to try new things with good determination and great hardwork they enjoy the risk when they fed with some sort of problem by which they come to knowledge of the problem and overcome it .
A successful businessman in the market in his field can overcome with the success in other field because of his knowledge and keen interest in the business experiences he had faced .
this happens in every successful person where a person when reached to his goals in life should not quit with that but set the new and try to achieve it .
For example , one of my friend who moved US to pursue his higher studies .
He is not so familier with the american english but with an interest to learn he joined the english program at kaplan and succeded well in american english , now he can understand the conversation in the class and can speak to anyone , before this he dont know what they say after he ask something .
When he was here he worked in hospital whenever he finds someforeigners he go to them and tries to speak in english to learn from them which can be useful for his higher studies abroad .

I agree with the people who try to learn new things rather than they know well to do are successful people where they can acquire different fields of knowledge which had happened in my friend matter .
I agree the statement that explained here which is relevant with my friend .
