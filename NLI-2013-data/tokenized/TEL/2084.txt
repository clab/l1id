The issue at hand is `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' .
I agree with this statement that young people enjoy life more than older people in so many ways .
I want to give some of the examples why i agree with this statement .

The first reason that i agree young people enjoy life more than older people is because young people have lot of energy than older people .
For enjoying life it is not suffient having money , enregy also require a lot .
For example travelling different countries gives so much of enjoy to us .
For travelling different countries money will not sufficient , lot of energy also required .
But in older people they have less energy and they cannot travel such long journies .
In this way young people have more advantages to the older people .

Another reason that i agree young people enjoy life more than older people is that younger people can get lot of entertainment in so many ways which older people cannot enjoy .
For example going to the discos and watching late night movies and playing games .
But the older people are not intersted in watching late night movies , going to discos and playing games .
This is the other way that older people miss alot .

Furthermore , some young people are enjoying life by concentrating on his job or any bussines work .
some people are enjoying life by developing their companys and bussines development .
Inorder to develop their growth for their work , so much of concentation , patience could require .
The advantages for young people is they can produce lot of concentration , patience .
But in older people , they have very less patience and they cannot concentrate for long time .
In this way also young people are more advantage than older people to enjoy life .

Finally , for all the above reasons i have mentoined , i want to say that i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people in many ways , however i mentoined some of these advantages to younger people for enjoying life .
