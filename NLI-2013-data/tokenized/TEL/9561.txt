I do agree with the statement ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' .
By doing so , they also bring about a change in the way of how things carry go on conventionally .

We do have well renowed people in each field say cricket , art or music who have given it a new definition by trying out things differently .
Let us consider the example of ` Abraham Lincoln ' .

During those days , when blacks were discrimated .
It was he who fought against it by taking numerous risks and stood for them and became one of the most famous presidents who ruled America .

We do have several business who have started their career with hardly a few penny in their pockets and did eventually turn out to be of the most successful and richest people .
By doing so , they do increase the economic growth of the country by giving new ideas but also do stand as a paragon for others to follow their footsteps .

Apart from the business field , we can also consider great personalities who have renounced their life for the sake of humanity .
For example , let us consider the example of Mother Theresa .
She could have always let her own life in luxury and peace rather than spending her entire life for a different country and leading an austure life .
She has taken various pains in helping out the needful .
She has also contributed so much to the society by building many santoriums and homes for the poor and old aged people .
