I disagree with this statement to some extent .
Young people are more enthusiastic for doing such type of work than the older ones since the latter have a family and also concentrate on their careers to support their family wher as young peole are at the start of their careers and they have less pressure .
You can also take the example of many universities having community service as their course .
in these courses although there are no grades they provide great pleasure for younger people to go outside the university and help a community .
Also young people should not be expected of only doing community service since they have an important decisions to make regarding their career .

One such experience to support the statement i have made is occured on the date which is celebrated as mahatma gandhi 's birthday .
On that day many of my colleagues at a local call center and many other software professionals participated in helping out to clean a community nearby which is full of slums .
the reward which we got for it is a great deal of happiness .
From then on we helped out that community on saturdays of every week by conducting calsses on health and hygiene and even conducte the classes for elders who dont know how to read and write .
For me this is a perfect example to show that younger generations can do such stuff in modern times too .
You can also take the example crisis situations like during war time .
Here young ones are the first to take responsibility in providing any kind of support the army or even helping out the injured .

In summary people should not judge young people on just observing some section who are not that great at community work and also this judgemen
