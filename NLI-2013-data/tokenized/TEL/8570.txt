I agree with the statement `` it is more important to students to understand than it is for them to learn facts '' .
As we can need some prior knowledge likeconstruction , working , advatages and disadavntages of a particular instrument to handle and operate a highly sophisticated instrument other wise it can cause either false results or some times it may also effect the working condition of the instrument .

Not only in practicals but also in theory of various subjects like mathematics we require the basic concepts and ideas as without knowing the concept of right formula in right situation we never get an appropriate result .

when we take an example of a medical student if he does n't know about the basic anatomical terms like superior , inferior , posterior , anterior , dorsal , ventral , superficicial , deeper , distal , proximal , phrenology , cardiology , heamatology , dermatology , like basic concepts are basics for understanding the physiology and also the pathological conditions of a particular part or organ .

Coming to the pharmacy without having the basic knoledge about formulation we never develope a new formula where we need the concept of ingredients present in the formulation .
In physics we never understand the how to solve a problem in force or work or power chaper until we have a basic knowledge of the concept of newton 's law of motion .

Not in only in a particular subject like physic , chemistry , biology we need basics of the subject in every field .
Even though it is easy to understand and remember the facts very easily than learning the the main ideas and concepts it is suggestable learn the basic ideas and concepts .
