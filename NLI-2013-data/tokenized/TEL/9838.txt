i agree with the statement that successful people will defenetly try new things and take risks due to the following reasons .

one reason to agree with the above statement is that success is out come of several trails and hard ships , success is result of sweat and labour .
one must be ready to face the troubles and hurdles in the way of acheiving success , and more over there is no guarantee that success comes from single trail it self .
in certain cases luck does not favour us even though we worked hardly to achive our goals , though we trust our hard work and self confidence some times things go wrong when we were trying to achieve success by single trail it self .

another reason why successful people take risks and try new things is to gain new experiences from challanges and that comes to them , they test thier mettle against them and assess themselves whether they will be cope up with that challange or not and judge thier performance against new problems and chalanges they faced in thier life .

more over the imporatnt lesson one can learn from trying out new things and taking risks is that gaining experince and paractical knowledge from past failures and its out comes .
with this practical knowledge he gained he will definitly have a chance to progress in his life .
he also gain ample exposure to new things and new experiences .

another reason is if we do things already know how to do well we can attain perfection in that field but we are not up to the mark when we face new things and new challanges , so it is better to try new things all over our life ,

finally it can be better illustrated with an example by considering an employee in an organization , if the employee do the things he already done , he attains perfection but when he was given a new work to do or he attains new position , definitly he wiil struggle while adapting to the new situation .

with this factors i conclude my essay
