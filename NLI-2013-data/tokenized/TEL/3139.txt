Yes I agree with the topic that YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAN OLDER PEOPLE .
Well , I agree with this topic because young people are very energytic , enthusiastic and can enjoy to the fullest where as old people cannot do that as their body is not as active as a young persons , perhaps it cannot be as active as a young persons .
It cannot be as active as a young persons because it is now that that old persons body needs to take rest because he has been enjoying allmost all the time when he was young .

FOR EXAMPLE :
Young person : A , old person : B ; A is aged between 20 to 25 years and he has gone to a disco tech to party with all is friend an he has enjoyed continuosly for 4 full hours .
And then B also goes to that same disco tech and he could not even dance for 1 hour .

Well , the difference between the 2 is that A is still a young person and he is very enthusiastic and energytic to dance and party all night where as speaking about the old person that is B is an old man and he cannot strain his body .
If he does he will get exausted .
His body will run out of energy .
If he wants to dance like A did then he should be having lots of energy and enthusiasm .

THERE FORE I CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE ENJOY LIFE MORE THAT OLD PEOPLE .
