The world is having the things that is more enjoyable .
In my view there is no difference between the old age people and the young age people to enjoy there life .
Moreover i think young people are doing more enjoy than old people .
I support my openion in the folowing ways .

Young people are going to college in there regular life they had lot of friends .
In the college they chat with the friends and eat a meal in the restaurent .
They play games with the friends .
For exampls some of the games like basket ball .
Which needs a lot of strenth .
I think young people having that strenth rather than the old people .

Always young peoples are having an habbit to drive a bikes .
It also needs a lot of musscle strenth .
Always the young people are having that strenth so , they are enjoyed a lot .
For example they go out side of the city along with their girl friends .
This is also one type of enjoyment .

Moreover the main important difference among young people and the old people is experience .
The young people are not experienced and the old people are experienced .
There experience does not allow them to spend a lot of money for enjoyment .
The young people are not like that .
They spend more money for enjoyment .
In my view there is no enjoyment without money .

On the other hand the old people also enjoy a lot .
They are playing with there grand children .
they are playing a soft games like in door games .
In this way the grand parents are enjoying .

By seeing all of the above expressions .
I conclude that young people are doing more enjoy than older people .
