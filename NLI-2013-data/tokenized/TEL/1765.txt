I partially agree to the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
This is very much true and applicable to the present day situation as knowledge of only one subject is going to reduce the number of options a person has in his career .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will help a person view a particular situation or issue in different angles and can be more careful in taking a decision after taking into consideration all the ins and outs of that situation or issue .
For example , if we consider a marketing executive trying to sell a washing machine , he should have knowledge though not in detail on the different small electrical systems that make up the total machine , also he needs to have knowledge on different kinds of textile fabrics and how the washing machine should be used in case of each fabric .
He can be successful only if he convinces the customer and to convince he needs to have broad based knowledge on all the those discussed .

People with broad based knowledge can easily shift careers according to what the industry demands and have a great flexibility to work in any area of specialization .

On the contrary , the world would not have developed so much if there were no people with specialization in one subject .
Only if one understands each and every concepts , can he implement them and bring out a new product .
There would not have been new discoveries if there are no specialists in this world .
Referring to the washing machine example , only a specialist and not generalist can build such a machine and can improve the features of it .
Specialists are very important when it comes to the technology development and advancement .

Concluding this , having specialization is also important but what i feel is there should be a good mixture of complementing each other .
