Yeh , it is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , because it will help them to have a grip on the concept .
Studying the concept with out any idea will not develop the knowledge of the student , the student knowledge develops only when he thinks on the topic .
How he/she get that thinking ?
once if they are having some grip or idea on the topic .
The student knowledge will develop based on their understanding capability and also their thinking capacity .
I am agreeing to the concept because I have a practical experience once up on a time .

Two students of my class attended to an exam with full of practise .
I am explaining the practise module of both of the students , one student had got a text book and memorised through out the day with out breakage and also without any idea .
And the other person who also studying the same text book but he is not reading , he is understanding the concept .
After they arrival after the exam one of the person who prepared whole night without any brakage told me that the question papper is very hard and I didnt understood the concept of the papper .
But the other person told me that the question papper is very easiy to answer , I answered with in 1 hour out of 2hours .
That much of easy the exam is ...
he told like that I cant get first why they are telling like that , when asked both of them how u studied I got the answer for my question .
On that day itself I understood that the instead of memorising the words we will go for understanding which will be very help full to the person to develop in any way .

FInally I conclude in such a way that people must understand the concept or idea , instead of studying that first we have to study and we have to understood , without that we ca n't achieve any thing .
