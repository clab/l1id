It is widely believed that Young people enjoy their lives more than older people do .
It is widley belived and we all know that the wider the beliefs can not be the truths all the time .
This is one such instance .

It is a popular notion because we , the most people , associate enjoyment with physical activity .
As the old people can not move fastly or most of the time they are confined to a place we tend to believe that they are not enjoying .
It is because we start comparing ourselves with them .
And it is even strengthened by `` Young-ones - play-old-see '' .

But the argument holds no water at all .
Because , enjoyment is not a mere activity of jumping around or moving vigorously .
It is more than that .
Most old one may not play the foot ball but they enjoy a lot seeing the young ones playing .
Like we do watching foot ball on the TV .
We are not on the national sides or clubs but we do enjoy the success of the our favorite club star .
Are n't we enjoying the success of our `` rolemodel '' .
Yes we do .
Like us they do .

Enjoyment has a lot do to with meantal activity , how one perceives the things and he takes them into his / her stride .
For example , Take the instance of my neighbouring old couple they enjoy a lot by reading novels , watching TV , listening music , Oh !
that envious cosy evening walks .
When asked about it their comment was in unision `` We are enjoying like never before '' .
Reason was simple when they were young they never had that leisure time .
They were either busy with the jobs or raising their children .
Can anybody dare say its not enjoyment .

Another similar instance is My own grandfather enjoys a lot by catching up with his old friends .
Whcih he could n't do when he was young because of his packed schedule .
Another great example is my grandfather enjoys , may be defeating me , hands down most of the time , chess as much as I do .
Even the research has come out with the great findings that are `` Happier ones live long '' .

On the lighter side , they do n't have exams to write big problem to the so called enjoying young ones .
Enjoyment is all in the mind not the body , It has to do with mental activity rather than physical activity .
Its how one feels not others .
