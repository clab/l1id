The issue at hand is whether broad knowledge on many subjects is bettar than specialization in one specific subject .
The issue is important because specialization on a specific subject is a major aspect for students during thier graduation and higher studies .
In my opinion to specialize on a particular subject is much better than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Firstly , if the student specializes on a specific subject , he will be focussed and concentrated in his field of study .
Trying to have knowledge of all academic studies might overburden the student and it might leave him in disarray and in a choatic condition .
Sometimes it may lead to serious consequences of getting very low grades .
Furthermore a subject will have lot of topics related to it .
So a specializtion on such a topic will give an entire knowledge of that subject to the student .
He is definetely going to master the entire subject .

Specialization on a particular topic will lead to research , as many thing are yet to be unravelled in this world .
If the student pays specific attention to the specialization subject in case of higher studies like post graduation , he may face new problem in that subject and result in research related activities which is very good .
Take for example if no one tries to pay particuler attention on a specific field , there might have been no inventions and discoveries by the scientists .
If Einstein had not paid specific attention to his specialization subject of physics , there would have been no development because all human creations of this date are based on his many thoeries like three laws of motion , theory of relativity , quantum physics etc .

Finally I want to conclude by supporting that specialization ona specific sunject is much better than having knowledge of many academic subjects .
As the saying goes `` Jack of all trades master of none '' ; a student focussed on specific subject will be called a master of specific subject .
So students should be advised right from their secondary schooling to pay particular attention on subjects they are intrested in and go for higher studies .
