Success is the fruitful result that a person gets after a job has been accomplished correctly and in the manner it has to be done .
Failures are a stepping stones to success and one must try and try until he succeeds in doing his things in the right manner that is needed .
For instance an ant who wanted to climb a wall tried several times but failed .
though not fairing in climbing the wall the ant did n't lose the zeal to get to the top of the wall .
Later it succeded in climbing the wall .
Likewise one must have persevarance to try and try until they succeed in doing the job they wish to accomplish .

Another person named Mc milan who invented cycle could not have invented it unless he tried several times .
In our day to day lives famous doctors would not have become surgeons simply by sitting and starring .
They needed to pick up the scalpel and do the surgery .
Bypass surgery was done in a person and when the person had the problem with the heart the doctors had to come up with a new technique .
Later they ended up in doing heart transplantation .
All these would not have been achieved if the person simply did n't try During my childhood i thought i couldnot ride a cycle but later on i got courage and learnt cycling , later id did n't stop with that i learnt a motor bike .
if i would not have tried riding motor bike i would have ende up by simply learning cycling .
later i managed to learn the car .
from these examples i conclude saying that one should not end up by getting a result for a job that he has done rather he has to take risk in his life and keep on trying to get new things done .
