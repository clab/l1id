The topic in disguise deals with , a person being generalist or a specialist .
A generalist is a perosn who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
A specialist is a person who has deep knowledge in one subject .

I think it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects rather than having specific knowledge in a single subject .
A person with broad knowledge in many subjects , a generalist , can deal with any kind of subject thought he cannot go deep into the subject he has good amount of knowledge about the subject .
So he can deal with any of the subjects .
Where as a person with deep knowledge about a single subject cannot deal with different subjects as he has no idea about other subjects .
It is must to have knowledge of all the subjects to get through the exams and attain grades .
Even in case of getting a job , a generalist has more chances of getting a job rather than a specialist as a generalist can deal any kind of subject that is given to him .
Where as a specialist has to keep mum when asked about any other subject .
The companies would definately require a multi-talented person rather than a person who has great talent in a single subject .

`` As every coin has two sides '' .
We cannot always say that having broad knowledge is vital .
Hence there is a saying `` Jack of all trades but master in none '' .
A multi talented person with no deep knowledge in any subject cannot acheive success all the time .

Knowledge in depth is required when it comes to certain areas of science such as astronomy , medicine etc .
In these areas a person cannot sustain with vauge knowledge .
It is crucial for a person to have knowledge in depth .
Else these proffesions would turn out to be disasters .

Hence what I would like to conclude is , a person must have minimum knowldge about all the academic subjects and must excel in one atleast to acheive success .
