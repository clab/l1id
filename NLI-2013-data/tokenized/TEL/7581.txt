I do not agree that the best way to travel is to be a part of group which is led by a tour guide , i feel so because i do not enjoy much when i travel in groups with more peopleand led by a tour guide , especially with people who i do n't know much .

Eventhough travelling with groups led by tour guides is quite comfortableand have lot of advantages , i feel it has many other drawbacks .
first of all time is an important factor , i feel that travelling in group with a tour guide will not give us enough time to spend in all places we visit , more over they follow a schedule which may not be always acceptable to all people .
recently i went to nigara falls there we contacted a tour guide and we were asked to join a large group who also were visiting the same palce , he was so quick and did not allow us to spend more time in certain places which we really liked , we felt that we really missed a lot of fun by joining the group .

the second reason that i perefer to travel alone is that i find it challenging to fine my self variuos places to be watched , i really enjoy it .
furthermore if we travel in a group led by tour guide , he provides a lot of un interesting information which i really do not enjoy and feel as waste of my valuble time , if i were travelling myself i would have avoided it and would have spent more time in certain places i really liked .

The other factor that makes me to prefer travelling alone is food , if we travel in group the tour guide will suggest some restuarants for having food during tour which may not include my choice of a particular place and is not possible because it will delay the schedule of the tour guide or out of reach during the time alloted by the tour guide , for example in my tour to nigara falls we want to have good food at a particular indian restaurant , we could not have that as he stopped his tourin vehicle some where else which cannot be reached with in the time alloted by the tour guide overall i prefer to travel alone
