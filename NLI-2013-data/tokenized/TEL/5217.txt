I agree with statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .
Advertisement is main used to promote a product .
and also to reach the public .
reasons why advertisements made like that because to promote the sales of the products .
for an example if u take an automobile advertisment .
They show the paticular vechicle in different angles with you of sophiscated digital camera 's to attract custmers .
if they could not do these how can they sale their products .

Advertisement deptartment was one of the greater creative field the subject taker should greater anyalsis capabality .
because the subect has desiened like these .
when a paticular product has to be advertised by a director he had paticular specification by the manufacture of the product .
wat we called a draft .
he has to fellow the draft and features of the product which should be highligted in videos .
they use three techinques in making a advertisements .
whether it should be used to advertise as a audio , or printed on big boards , or video .
depending on that they decide a draft and they should fallow these instructions .

since advertisements are you used to promote the product .
it is nothing wrong in showing the product much better .
unless he is not effecting any one 's personal feelings or religious feelings .
they use these techinque to reach the people and communicate about their product .
for example if you want make a pizza advertise .
They uses world class chef 's to cook and to desiegn it .
when you go to eat pizza it not be look like but you can satifies with taste .
from above reason i can claer state that it is not at wrong to show the produts much better than really look .
except to medical products .
the false may once health .
so , I agree with statement
