I do agree with statement i.e successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

Iam of the opinion that because of there are several reasons and example , to support my opinion .
Man is a gregarious person and greedy person man has no satis faction with his already achievements .
He is raedy to take risks and pains to invent new things .
For example in early stages scientists are invented bycycle , and then invented automobiles , planes etc .

There is no end for invention , because technology has developed day by day .
Great people are always thinking and thinking they are always look for some progress .

Compared to olden days now technologyhad developed more .
Great people are think there is no end for success , it is going on going on there is no end .

If there is end no meaning , because great people are searching for better to best now days population are increasing like temperature increases , if there is no place for humanbeings on land people can live on moon also .

So i strongly support the statement , people want changes in life it will be help ful to better living .
If great people are also thinking like this .
They have no rest , if they are taken rest there is no further improvement in our lives .
