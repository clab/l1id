What is fun ?
Is it having no care in the world or is it having responsibilities that you enjoy ?
There are differences in opinion of what fun is for various people .
Usually , the age at which one is young , free and ready to face the world is considered exciting and more fun .
The question is , are we ready to say that older people cannot enjoy life ?
I do n't think so .

When we are younger , in most cases , we have no responsibilities and only ourselves to think about .
This leads to concentrating on only our needs and goals and hence attaining happiness out of it .
But also , at this point in life , we need to think about the future and plan accordingly .
This may lead to intense competition in academic life and a general stress .
This is definitely not true always , but in most cases it usually tends to have a balancing effect on the fun , challenging the notion that we have more fun when we are young .

Once we grow older , have a career and family , our responsibilities are increased .
This does not mean we cannot have fun .
By weighing all factors and getting into a career we love , we can do something we enjoy .
And having a family can only be a good thing because you will have people who love you and care about you .
Sometimes we wonder how it is possible for many people to be so active and remain happy inspite of busy schedules .
It is mainly because they enjoy what they do and love facing challenges .

Even after retiring and getting old , we can do those things in life that we always wanted to do , like reading our favorite books , going to our favorite places and experiencing life as never before .
I think that the fun is in enjoying the little things in life that bring happiness , and having a positive attitude .

Therefore , if we finally define fun as enjoying what one does , I do n't think there is any difference whether we 're young or old as long as we experience life in the way we should .
