The writing is about usage of cars in coming twenty years .
This four wheeled machine is widely used mode of transport all around the world .

The technology is evolving with a zooming speed that with we frequently find a new car on roads that promises more speed and more comfort with the best performance assured .
With the increasing usage of cars even the demand for fuel has also increased .

To counter the scarce of the fuel cars are being manufactured with a technology to be driven with out use of any petroleum fuel instead can be driven by electric power and other sources .
For example , Reva .

We have number of manufactures like Ferrari , Lamborgini , Maybach , Mercedes , Hyundai , Fiat , Opel etc. are competing everyday in the automobile industry to manufacture or to produce a new car with all the amenities or luxuries along with the performance .
One who buys a car considers parameters such as speed , performance , comfort , capacity , availability of service centers etc .

Many Research and development centers are being developed to make a car which is different from the existing and which is unimaginable .

There are many machine geeks in this world who love to own the latest car which has almost everything that they always dream about .

Car are being manufactured considering the position or status of the people .
For example , In India , companies like Maruthi motors , Hyundai motors , Tata motors etc.have launched different ranges of car .

Cars have become a part of our day-to-day life .
For example , in colder countries like US , UK , Swiss etc. life is quite difficult to travel with out a car .

If time comes when the car cannot be driven easily on the roads due to the traffic conjestions or because of availability any alien machine which can replace cars with its best features which are not available with car .
Or , if cost of flying machine comes down then probably we may possibly take a look at it .

Therefore , I disagree that the usage of cars could comedown down the lane in coming twenty years .
