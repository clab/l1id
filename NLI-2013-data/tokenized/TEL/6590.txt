Cars are one of the major means of transportnow a days .
Many people use cars as they are more convienient means of transport .
they save time and energy in reaching our destiny .
But in my opinion in comming twenty years their will be fewer cars than they are now .

Firstly now a days most cars run on petrol , desiel , gasoline .
these are fossile fuels .
Due to increase in the population over past 20 years , more cars came into market there is a great demand for the fuel .
BUt the fuel reserves are limited .
This leads to the shortage of the fuel in the comming years .
more over due to high demand for the fuel the fuel prises will go up .
The rise in the fuel prices cannot be afforded by the common man. this will make him look for other means of transportation may be public transportation such as buses , trams .

Due to advancement of technology the prices of the cars decreased rapidly , this decrease in the price made comman man to own a car .
As the population is increasing many people started owning a cars , this leads to the traffic congestion in the cities and towns .
The presents roads may not be sufficient to accomodate the cars present , and it is difficult to expand the roads to the reqirement of the people owning the car .
This leads to traffic jams and takes lots of time reaches their destination which was the advantage of owning a car .
So most people will avoid cars in the comming years .

Due to increase in cars the pollutions increases rapidly .
there will be a lot of air pollution and noise pollution .
this leads to the global warming .
To avoid damange there is no other option than controlling the polution .

Taking these effects into consideration the goverment may concentrate on the public means on transportation , as this saves fuel , pollution and traffic congestion .
Earlier people thogth that having a car is prestige but in future they feel its head ache to own a car and maintain it , they will move for other better means of transportation in comming years .
