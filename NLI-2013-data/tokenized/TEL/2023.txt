I agree :
1 : Have alot of fun with friends .
2 : Do not have any mental tensoins .
3 : They are the freshers of the world .

Conclusion :
In this fantastic world the young people are the back bones of every country they enjoy alot in roaming here and there .
The young people have alot of fun with their friends as they chit chatting , making jokes on others , going to picnics and they are physically strong to do what ever they want .

These youngsters do not have any mental tensions as they are not at the level of thinking about their families they enjoy themselves living with their parents and doing their job in fresh world with alot of satisfaction .

In this fast moving world there are many things to enjoy the life so that these young people are freshers to the world which have not yet started to see the nature 's beauty etc. so that they roam here and there with their parents or relatives or friends and enjoys by seeing all of these .

where as the old people cannot enjoy all these as they have not enough energy to do all the things that youngsters do .
The old people have all these enjoyments in their young age itself so that they simply enjoys bye seeing the enjoyment of young people .

Disagree :
1 : Alot of peace .
2 : Not bothered about the future .

The old people too enjoy but not as the young people as they have alot of peace because they have done all the work that they have to do it just remains to take rest and not botherd about the future as there is nothing to do for nation or to thier family in that age .

Hence i conclude that young people enjoys alot than the old people .
