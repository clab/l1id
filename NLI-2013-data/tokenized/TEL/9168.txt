Here the topic is about , is it more important to the students to understand ideas and conceots than it is for them to learn the facts .
I strongly agree with the point of understanding the ideas and concepts .

Every student should have the concept and understand the ideas rather than learning the facts about that .
By lerning the concept the student can understand the subject very well and can be easy with that subject .
If we understand the ideas of the subject the student can proceed with the subject very well , and go deeper into the subject of which he is understanding .
For example if we take the mathematics we need to have concept in the maths than the facts regarding that , the ideas are more important in mathematics than the facts .
If we have the facts knowing about the mathematics then the real concept is not concentrated .
Because in mathematics practice is more important than knowing the facts .

The student who is concerned about the facts it is of no use , because if he concentrated on facts he cannot be in the competitive world , as the oter students are going fast by knowing the concepts and ideas .
If you take a class room in which a student is intrested in knowing the facts rather than the concept and the ideas then he will certainly loosing something which other students are gaining , being a conceptual and knowing the ideas is the encoureged way then knowing the facts .

At last i state that be a conceptual person and understand the ideas rather than to be knowing the facts .
understanding the ideas will not featch a lot in the student life
