Some of the students try to understand the ideas and concepts rather than in learning the facts .
And some of them feel that facts are important than the ideas and concepts .
The ideas has importance in his own way as they are important when you are in a dilama and the concept of idea is o.k.And when comes to the fact it tells the truth that had happenned in the past .

Ideas and concept are important to the students where they can react to the situation in a few minutes and overcome to solve the problem which we are in .
The ideas and concept they try to improve our ability of thinking and helps in the research process which is the main thing that is cosidered one of the important thing that has to be remembered .

Facts these tell about the things that are goi happened and is going to be happened in the future .
this also is important for the students to learn .
I agree with the ideas and the concept than learning the facts .
It helps in developing the student individually in thinking and decision making As we observe in today society the things are changing rapidly , So inorder to over come the ideas and the concept plays a very much important in students carrer .
Sharp ideas and the concept makes a student to settle in a better position rather than facts .

I conclude that from the above disscussion that both are important in there own way .
some think that ideas are important where some think facts are important for the student .
