Knowledge is a very important part of our daily routine .
Gaining knowledge may be a very imprtant part of a students career .
Students gaining knowlede are offered jobs in view of their knowledge towards a particular subject .
It may be a point that it is essential to have a minimum grip over the remaining subjects rather than just having broad knowledge about a single acadamic subject .

So by the following we can say that it is better to have a broad knowledge about many acadamic subjects rather that just a single or specific subject .
There may arise different situations by which the broad knowledge ove a specific acadamic subject would be sufficient .
Just consider a software engineer who has a broad knowledge about the software part of his system is not capable of solving the hjardware issues arising .
In the same way a person who is good at computers cannot work for a company where mechanical engineers are required .
Hence if a person is capable of having broader knowledge about the various acadamic subjects there may be chance that he mey even jump from one sector to the other just like a person findin softaware jobs more interesting thjan the mechanical jobs .
He can change his platform only if he has a broader knowledge about the software concepts .

Having broad knowledge over various acadamic subjects would help us out in various situations .
Let us even consider a person attending an interview in a huge establishment .
Ther is no gaurantee that the inteview may contain questions relating to his subject , rather the interview may even consisit of questions over various issues relating to various other subjects .
A person who is capable of containing broader knbowledge over just one issue may not be able to get through the interview to get the job .

We can even consider the part of quiz competetion that include the subject of various other subjects rather than just a single subject .
A person with broader knowledge over various subjects may only be capable of clearing the quiz competetion .

Hence we can say that `` IT IS BETTER TO HAVE BROAD KNOWLEDGE OVER MANY ACADAMIC SUBJECTS RATHER THAN JUST SPECIALIZE IN ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT '' .
