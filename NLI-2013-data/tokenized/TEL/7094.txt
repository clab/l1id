I clearly disagree with the statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .

The only constant thing in this world is `` change '' .
Things are changing from the way they used to be before .
Man is also changing .
The phase of his life , when he used to find it difficult to earn his daily bread has almost come to an end .
The living conditions have been improving .
Man is able to earn enough to support his , as well as , his families needs .

Man has become a very busy animal with his appointments , meetings , business and many more issues which demand most of his time , caliber , intellengence and effeciency .
He also has his daily chores which he has to finish before calling it a day .
To keep up with all this he needs fast and convinent transport to help him reach his destination on time .

Car is a convinent mode of transport for him .
It is no more a status symbol .
It has become a necessity .
It a very common thing , nowadays , to own a car .
The advancing technology and the need for fast transportation result in more people owing cars .
Apart from fossils being the primary source of fuels to ignite the engins , new forms of energy are also being developed .
One among them is , trapping of the solar energy .
Cars can now be run on solar energy .
This eco friendly development is a boon to man .
He need not spent mpre money to just fill his cars tank with gas .

Hence , I opine that there will be an increase in the number of cars rather than a decrease .
