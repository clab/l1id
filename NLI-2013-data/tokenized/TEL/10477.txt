yes i agree with the statement because they will have the dare to implement their innovative skills after one success .
They always try to do0 something better and useful than the others .
They will never go with the things which have done before but they will change or add some more features for those which have done by them earlier .

The succesful people will also take the ideas of the others which will be useful for them .
They always goes with the concept `` TRY AND TRY UNTIL YOU SUCCEED '' .
This is the major concept used by many of the successful person because they wont leave the thing what they want to do .

For example i would like to consider Mr. DARREN BUFFET , one the of the richest person in the world .
At first he was a cool drink seller after that he invested some money in stock market he went into loss side .
Even though he was in the loss side he didnot changed the track in which he was really interested .
Now he became second richest person in the world .
He had only view in his mind is he want to succeed in his field he made it possible without diverting .

There are many people whom we can take into consideration .
Even many of them were not from rich families they became a worlds important persons .
We have to think in many ways for one thing then only we can succeed .
Every one is having some of the ideas in different feilds they have to implement their ideas in their interested field they will definetly succeed in their future .
The people who are very innovative in thoughts will succeed and also become inspiration to the others also .

I would like to conclude that be confidential in what ever we do then only we can succeed and be as inspiration to the next generation .
