The best way of travelling with a group of people is very funny and i really enjoy that trip .
Actually we do n't know the places we are going to visit at that time we really need a person who guides us .
But we are going in a group at that time we do n't want a guid .
In our group some people knew about the place , and someone in the group have some information about the place then no need to worry .
For example , i went to hawaii with my friends , in my friends group one girl already visited the hawaii and she knew the place which is more beautiful and which place we can really enjoy and she also knows some resturant .
At that time we went to hawaii and we really enjoyed the trip .
We do n't need any guide .
If iam going alone at that time i really do n't know the place then i need a guide .
If i can not take a guide then i wo n't enjoy the trip .
But in my opinon i enjoyed the trips when i went with my friends in group .
group trip with friends is really enjoyableand i could still remember those trips .
For example my home twon is in india , one time i went to agra to see the tajmahal .
That is really a beautiful place i do n't know anybody in that place at that time i paid to a person who is guided me .
And that person is very nice he showed me all the places around the tajmahal and he is also stated telling stories about the tajmahal and i like that information he gaved me .
That is also a nice thing about a guide .
That time i did not realize that i came alone .
either of the ways we go with friends or we go alone what is most important is we really enjoyed or not .
