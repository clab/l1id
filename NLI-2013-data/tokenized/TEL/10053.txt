Some people may be called successful when they do new things and get success .
whatever they do for success such as taking risks , putting a great effort , working continously without rest can be listed as a reason for their success .
I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and i stongly believe this .

When people try new things they might face some problems .
To solve those problems they should take risk for one or other reason .
For example take a student who is doing his basics in maths .
Suppose he is well known with the addition and subraction and to go further that is to know about multiplication he has to take risk .
This may include spending more time in studying or caluclating because it is a new topic and he needs more practice in that .
And coming to a project leader he guides his students about the same project for years .
He may find it easy and also perfect to in doing that .
when he goes for other project that is new to him he should take risk in doing that .
It includes studying the project , finding a solution for that , and to teach his students in an efficient manner .
this makes him successful .

I can give another example of a successful person .
he was dhirubhai ambani one of the famous industriliasts in India .
He cam from a village to city and started cloth bussiness .
He got success in that because he know how to do well in that bussinees .
But he was not consiered successful untill he tried some other business other than his cloth business .
He shifted to petroleum industry and he offered a low price of petrol that others didnt give .
And also he started a telecom industry and he gave the lowest prices of mobiles and aslo the calling rates when compared to others .
This signifies the risk taken by him and then he became a successful person and also an inspiration to others .

so doing the same thing makes u perfect in that perticular task but not a successful person .
To be a successful person u should try new things and take risks in acheiving them .
