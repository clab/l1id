yes i agree with thish statment it is more importet for students to lea understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts when things going on ideas and concepts are understood in my practical reason giving that in any subject when we learn ideas and concepts then we can learn facts about that subject .
for example in my physics subject concept of perabola .
in this topic when we have some idea and some concept than we can learn facts about thet topic and second reason is about working and doing job .
for example when we know some what about working idea and concept then we can do some work in any where and then knowing and learn facts finally i am agreeing with this statment that is it is more importen for students to learn facts
