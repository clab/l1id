Ofcourse , I agree with the statement that , `` advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
The main point of an advertisement is to attract people into buying the product .
To achieve that , the producers of the advertisement program go to any extent to make their product look outstanding .
Even if the good products are not advertised , they will be on sale but an average or a bad product do need a good advertisement to make itself appeal to the customer .

What happens during the February end ?
Its the time for Super Bowl Ads .
These advertisements are worth about 10 million dollars .
That 's a lot of money into the ads but if the ads clicked in the `` people 's '' market , the owner of the ad would make lots of money .
I was watching a television channel and there was an advertisement about a face clearing lotion .
I asked my friend if she watched the advertisement .
She said that she already bought the product which is worth about 20 dollars .
But she was frustrated at the product because it made her skin look worse .
In the advertisement , there were 3 average looking girls who tranformed their skin to an attractive one using this product .
It was nothing like it appeared .

Few days back , I was in the mall trying to get some stuff for my soccer practice .
I went to the Modell 's Sporting Goods , there was a packet with baseball cards on it .
On the cover , there were about 10 cards , so i decided to buy it .
I went to my house and opened the cover and found only 3 cards .
i was very frustrated at this .
Although , its my fault , I felt it was n't right .

In the above examples , it was evidenced that advertisements make products look better .
There was a saying , `` Not to judge a book by its cover . ''
In the same way , we products seem much better in their advertisements .
