In my opinon travelling with a tour guide is good then going alone The three reasons why I prefer the tour guide are more information about the places , can see new more places and safety .

In first by travelling with a tour guide we can t get more information about the places .
Recently I vistied a place for the first time .
I hired a tour guide by which I got more information about the places and monuments which I had seen during the visit .
He had told about the history , specifications , etc .
He also helps us by translating the local language which we cant understand .
So hiring give us more information about the places .

In second we can see new more places because he would have the details about the places like how much time it would take , about the accomidation , etc .
Because his agents , by which they can hire room very easily .
They would not be any loss of time for going and waiting for a mean of transportation .
We will enjoy a lot , which we cannot do with out a tour guide .

The last one is abouth the safety because when we visit a new place we dose n't know about the crime rate .
By hiring a tour guide he would be taking us to the places which are safety .
He also helps us by contacting with the local people when we are in trouble .
When we are affected with a fever or some sort of health problem he will be knowing the best doctor in that town .
Visting a place means a happy thing , so hiring will helps us to have safety trip

In conclusion touring a new place with a tour guide gives us more information about the place , we can see new more places and safety .
I recoomend to travel with a tour guide when you visit a new place .
