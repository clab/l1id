I agree with the statement provided that the word in the statement `` cars '' is qualified to mean only `` road-cars '' .
This is to distinguish road-cars from other automotives , like space-cars , which may be a thing of the future .
I will hence-forth call such automobiles as personal-flights , to distinguish them from `` road-cars '' .

As a science student , I am totally convinced that twenty years is sufficient for technological advancements to progress to such an extent , so as to enable the the usage of personal flights by many people .
In those years , people will be able to purchase personal-flights , and hence the usage of road cars will become outmoded .
Twenty years may be short to produce such personal-flights at low rates .
However although all people may not have luxuries to such high end automobiles , a significant portion of the population , especially in developed countries may start using them regularly .
Besides , the government of those days might introduce other sophisticated public transport systems , like space buses or space trains .
Considering the heavy pollution that is caused by the today 's cars and the great commotion caused in today 's roads because of these cars , people then may start exploring other options , such as space - buses .
That would not only be convenient to most people , but also be environment friendly .
In fact , some environment friendly countries , might totally abandon the usage of powered vehicles on roads of that day .
People who wish to go on roads on those days might go on cycles , and it is entirely possible that cycles might be in vogue then .
The usage of road-cars may be restricted to luxury sports like Formula 1 , Nascar etc .

The other important factor that may influence people to consider other attractive alternate means of transport is petrol and other gas reserves .
The acute shortage of petrol , diesel etc in coming years may increase their prices so much that people wil start abandoning road-cars .

Even as of today , trains in Japan and in few other countries can move almost on the air , enabling them to travel as fast as sound .
Current research indicates that space cars may be manufactured without the usage of petrol .
They also do not cause enviroment problems , and traffic jams will be a thing of past .
In twenty years , the advent of space cars and space buses is looking highly possible .
