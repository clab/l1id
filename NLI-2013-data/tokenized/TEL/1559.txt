I disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Rather , I am of the opinion that it is better to specialize in one subject than to have a broad overview of different academic subjects .

Having a broad knowledge would give an individual a superficial understanding of different topics which he may not be able to put to effective use for the society .
Specializing in a field gives greater insight into the particular field and an individual can explore further and create new wealth of information .
This way he would be contributing to the society and the civilization .

Different academic subjects base themselves on different concepts and it would also consume more time of the individual in trying to get a grasp of the fundamentals of different academic subjects .
We can draw water from a well only by selecting a right place and by continuing digging at that point rather than by starting digging at different locations .
Similarly , an individual would be more productive if he spends the same amount of time in exploring a single subject and specializing in it .

A civilization needs new ideas to advance itself .
Looking at the collective , if everyone tries to gain a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we would all the sustaining only on the information wealth created already and there would not be any improvement in the status quo .
To futher itself , the society has to have different individuals specializing in different subjects , exploring the new topics in their specialization and create or discover new information for futher generations .
