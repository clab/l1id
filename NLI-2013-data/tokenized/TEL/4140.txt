Young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities , i agree with this statement .
I feel Young people nowadays have no time to spend in helping communities there are given work by the college and schools after that they have to work for their pocket money .
However young people have several interests in pratcipating in these kind of activities but have now time .
I feel that school and colleges must provide some kind of helping communities during the period of college .
If the colleges would provide this kind of facility students can easly parcipate .
Young people are busy with homeworks given by their institutions they always think helping communities , after they finsihed their work they feel tried feel to rest .
Their is no enough time to spend in these activities .
Every young person have to think about they should help communities whatever they can do .
Nowadays its totaly a busy life now one is showing such an interest towards these activities , but some have the tendency to do it but they do n't have the time .
The government should think about it because young people are those who will change the future of the city so they have to give order to the institutions of helping the communities .
I have attend the society welfare association at my place and i partcipated in social welfare activities .
Its not complusory for every young people to help their communities , it 's their interest in it .
Most young people intend to do it .
For a better community every person should feel the responsibilty in helping .
Communities bring a great development in the enivronment .
In a community their are resources to develop it , but no one is help it .
My community was is a well structured and desgined because every one help our community and most of them where young people .
Now our community has stadiums , parks and several other places .
And our place is well attracted by others due to cleanginess and beautiful site senes .
Young people are who can change every thing not a community and even a city .
