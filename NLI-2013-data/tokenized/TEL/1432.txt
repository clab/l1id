Selecting the number of subjects will basically depend upon many factors .
However , selecting one specific subject and working over it would help to get complete command over the subject .
But I personally believe that having command over many subjects would be better .

Firstly , it can help in making furthur studies .
By choosing many subjects we can have command over a number of topics which can help us to use it effectively .
For example , when I was in graduation I had a chance to take either one subject or two subjects .
I then felt to take two subjects one as my major other as the minor .
Which helped me to learn both Finance and Marketing .
I also felt the importance of selecting the two subjects when i want to make out the project in final semister .
Which helped me to work for two subject , which are Finance and Marketing .
So I was able to prepare two projects which inturn helped me to keep up my final grades .

Secondly , it will increase our knowledge .
When we study about more subjects it can increase our knowledge about all of them .
When I was in school days we used to have general knowledge and moral science as our extra subjects .
I felt great benefit of these subjects when i matured as a student .
It helped me to participate in quiz competitions and also helped me to increase the helping nature where i learnt through moral science .

Lastly , it makes us to have a fruitfull career .
When the time comes for me to make out a job , the command over different subjects can help me to secure a good job .
Where I can have a number of choices and I can choose the field which is good .
So , it helps to have a good and fruitfull career .
When I completed graduation , as i studied both marketing and finance as subjects in my graduation , it helped me to fetch a job in both the fields .
So I had a choice to prefer .

So , because of these reasons I prefer that learing about more subjects helps us in different ways .
Even though learing about a particular subject can bring specialisation , I still believe to have broad knowledge of many subjects .
