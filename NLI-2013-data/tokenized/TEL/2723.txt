I agree with the statement .
I believe young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people have got strong physical structure and mental capabiliteis than older people do .
Feeling young itself brings in a lot of self confidence to face any problems and perform many situtations in life which most of the old people lack .
Visiting beautiful places all over the world can really rejoice human beings which is easy for young people than older ones as age is a great barrier or older people to make a world trip .

Playing sports is good for health and it is also a big recreation that relieves us from many worldly issues , which young people can do with ease than the older ones .

Sex is one of the important part of life .
It helps in developing good relations with the partner .
Older people cant enjoy sexual pleasure in their old age but the young people can do that .

Young people are more familiar with the current techonological advaancements than the older people and can enjoy a really comfortable and luxurious life than the older ones .
