The term `` Knowledge '' as we see has a ample number of branches to be described .
One such branch that we are about to see is that of a students academics .
A man is simply a learner in his own life .

Lets consider the case of an individual when he is in childhood stage .
As a child he learns to crawl , eat , play etc .
In this context he is a learner to go through all the varied functionalities associated to him .
Later comes the stage of being a grown up boy .
Here would prefer to walk on the ground rather than crawling , thus his interest has got confined .

In a similar way when we consider the case of a individual pursuing his academics .
Its would be better to excel in one specific subject rather than going through various subjects .
This would be beneficial not only to the individual but also to the career that he opts for .
Consider the case of an Engineer , if he is made to go through the subjects like , Politics , Medicine etc. then it would be infered that the chances of becoming an Engineer are bleak .
The same case may not be applicable to all other cases .
When we take the above case of an sucessful Engeineer we can clearly state in the maximum cases that , the inividual has had a plenty of overview of his interest and the subjects that he has studied .

On the other hand a person with only confined knowledge would excel only in his choosed field rather than being aware of the happenings around him .
Lets take the case of any political leaders .
As we know leaders are not born as leaders , they are the people coming from different fields .
A leader may be a doctor , engineer , farmer etc .
So the individual as a leader has to be aware of all the happenings going around him and also his region , province , country etc .
Thus here in this case we can say that a mere confined knowledge is not enough to be a perfect individual .

So we can say that the method of having a broad knowlege of academic subjects depends upon how an individual approaches it , rather than making it a controversial methodology
