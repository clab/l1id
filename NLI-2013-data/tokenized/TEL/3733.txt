Well i do agree with the point that the younger generation today are not giving enough time to help their communities .
There could be various reasons stated for this .
Today 's generation is considered to be extremely fast .
They are more focussed on thier studies , careers and most importantly on building a good future .
they are more intersted in other activities which keep them more interested as such things like helping thier community could be considered rather boring by them .
They often sometimes feel that this is not thier kind of work .

Well as an example i would like to state that once there was a community meeting anong all the members of our community .
As it was observed that only a few young people had attended it .
Also once there was a community function where many people were invited including the young .
But they preferred to go for a movie rather then attend the function .

Many reasons include that even though many of them seem to be very interested they have no time due to prior commitments .
Thus even though they are many members associated they hardly pay any attention .

Many of jobs done or required to be done to help a comunity include helping gatering people and keep them united , helping each other financially or when in times of need , arranging various educational programmes for members of the community who cannot afford it and help in developing various other cultural and traditional aspects belonging to a certain community which actually picturize the roots of the community .
Thus all these aspects not only require the support of the older population but must include the younger generation too since these young minds are considered to be tomorrow 's future in pure terms thus forming an example fr he future generations to come by influencing them by inculcating values like unity and culture and tradition of the community by leading to the better progress of the community Thus i feel that today younger people must be encourged to spend atleast sometime with their community from their busy lives which is not only important for the moment but also for a better tomorrow and for a good and bright future of the community as well as the world thus making the world a better place to live in .
