I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because in the modern technological life you need to know the concepts which are essential to complete a research , project or anything to be solved .

The concepts are the main fudamental points which would explain the whole process in a mehcanical way .
Ideas are the ones which should be understand before going to begin the work or process .
For example as i am being a computer student , to write a program in any program language i should have an idea about the concepts of the programming language before start writing the program .
i need not know the facts .
Because Facts are results if we does one work .
If student understands ideas and conecpts then only the students could step forward and get success in that process .

In this computer modern life student will not give much preference to learn facts , which rather takes up time .
so every student want to first understand the concepts and ideas then be involved into the project .

In the older days students are supposed to learn the facts and get grip on the subject before going to start the process .
but after computer has been introduced , the whole process has been changed , because students are exposed to use the INTERNET , which rather made students to understand the concepts and swept away the process of learning facts .
Internet gives freedom to student which pricely help directly to get the concepts of subject with out much effort to learn facts .

for example if a student want to do a project using any computer language , now a days student would rather use the internet such as GOOGLE , with which he could get all the information in world for that project , automatically he finishes the project by understanding the concepts and ideas with out learnin te fatcs .
i agree this statement because student should grab the opportuinity of technology as we have inthis 21 century .
