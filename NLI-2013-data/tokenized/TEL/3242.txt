With the change of technology and ways of living of the people there is a drastic change in the behaviors of the people .
This is mainly true in case of young people .
These days young people are getting more reluctant to works given to them and even becoming more careless in doing or performing their duties .

I surely agree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' because of few specific reasons .
The reasons that i provide to support my opinion are that nowadays young people are getting more busy with their works or studies or even with entertainment .

Firstly i would like to talk about the studies or the content of the studies .
In today life studies are including a lot of syllubus which give a variety of ideas to youngsters , but the people who are including these syllubus into the academics are forgetting that because of this young people are unable to do their must duties and so ruining them .
Secondly in this compititive world involvement to work is much needed to make a place in the worlds market .
So this might be the other reason for young people forgetting their duties .
Thirdly and the most important one is that the entertainment provided to the world are distracting them from doing their duties perfectly .

These three reasons that are stated above are mainly making young people to become busy and so not allowing them to make any time for their community .
Not only these young people but this problem is with almost every one in this community .
These busy deeds making people forget about the society and to help the society .
But there are many people who are still alloting more of their time to develop the society and because of them the society is still breathing .

So as to make the society more better every one and mainly the young people of the world have to come forward and make time for helping the society and make the world a better place to live in .
