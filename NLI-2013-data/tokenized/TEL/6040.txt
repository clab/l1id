I dont agree with the statement that `` There will be fewer number of cars in use than there are today '' .
the above may not be completely ture because of the points that are given below .
To stop the usage of cars either the petroleum should get scarce and the prices should go so high that only very rich can efford to buy to use cars .
And coming to technology point of view as the technology is developing the parts of cars are becomming cheaper as a result many people can afford to buy a car for their own use .
So , this indicate fairly increase of the number of car than the number that persent now .
Also as the newer models are getting in to the market to attract people .
the people who has cars already send their cars for lower price as a second hand car and go for the new one .

There might be a possibility that if government want to control the pollution producd by the cars .
It can increase the taxs so as to decrease the number of cars .
But still the people may use the cars because the government cant lay too much of taxes .

So , as far as we can see that number decreasing not likely to occur .
But the growth can be predicted because of the above points .
The number of car reduction cant be possible because as the population grows many people are settling well would like to have a car .
Also now a days many colleage students are using cars a lot so decreasing number is not really possible as the statement states .

Also now a days many people who use two wheelers want to buy a car next .
so we can see that the population are orienting towards buying car to have luxuries life .
