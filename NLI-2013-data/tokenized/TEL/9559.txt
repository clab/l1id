I neither agree nor disagree with the following statement .
I strongly feel that successful people are what they are because they have adventured on taking new paths , dared to build on new ideas , but the hidden truth on careful analysis reveals , even though those ideas were risks for others , the winners have always believed their thoughts and progressed with them because they only knew how to do them well .

So I believe successful people are an amalgam of these two different paths to be successful which are illustrated by the statement .

For an example , imagine the situation of two of India 's biggest Industries - The Tatas , and The ambanis - the founders of whcih have risen from depths of poverty to dizzying heights of fame and popularity .

Both of them are an inspiration for new India , because , They visualized their dreams even without a single penny with them , and chose to take risks , even with small amounts rather than saving them up invested them into their ideas and gave a structure to them , because they believed in their ability and also because they were crystal clear as to what they would acheive , and they knew how to do it well .

I believe both these paths are interlinked and are necessities for anybody to succeed , since reasoning implies that only when you are confident in what you want to acheive and how you want to acheive , can you dare to take risks .

Venturing into new avenues without having a knowledge of `` how 's and why 's '' of them only leads you to failure .
Similarly confining yourself to your comfort zone , and in only doing things you are comfortable with , you are distancing yourself from other probabilities thus restricting your success to a certain degree To quote an example actors are never considered acting legends unless they have explored and donned various roles and showed their mettle in them .
If an actor is extremely popular in comic genre , but is afraid to take new challenges , he will never be regarded a success , but taking a risk to don new roles stems from his confidence and as the old saying goes - an inconfident man is never deemed a success .

To sum up , I believe to be successful , anybody needs to have the right blend of risk taking ability and also the capability to do things as well as he can , otherwise the barometer of success would never reach it 's peak .
