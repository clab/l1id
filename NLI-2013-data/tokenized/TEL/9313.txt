yes i do agree with the statement first reason is that the ideas are source for new inventions .
if we face a problem , then we will make our minds active and starts to find out variety of solutions for the problem by doing this we will get lot of ideas and they will be more useful for us for the solution .
the concepts gives us the clear vision of the problem that is the way in which it should be solved and even we can add new concepts for it with our new ideas .

the ideas not only give us the solution but also a perfect meaning to the problem .
every problem has a concept which is naturally made by us but when new concepts are added to the problem , then the problem can be made more easy to solve .

for example if we want to solve a mathematical problem which consists of twenty steps to get a perfect answer .
then we will start solving it by different methods that we get by our own ideas , here the facts will have only one solution to the problem but when we use different kinds of concepts and make different ideas we can get the solutiohn within ten steps .

the students have the ability to think more fast and accurately as their vision will be always concentrated on developing new ideas and concepts rather than the facts .
mainly the young students will get more ideas and variety of concepts .

as the facts will be always the same and there will be no change or alterations can be made in them .
the ideas will eventually increase the strenght and personality of a student .
for example the scientist 's will have lot of ideas and concepts but not facts because they will invent the things by their imaginations .
these imaginations are retreved from new ideas but not from the facts .
the most important thing for a scientist is the concept in which he invents the things .
if he goes with the facts then he cannot invent new things as the facts will give same old invents .

hence the students has to give more and more importance to there new ideas and concepts .
finally facts are always facts but the ideas and concepts will give more enthusiasm to work on and find new concepts .
hence i strongly recommend to give more importance to ideas and concepts rather than the facts .
