The issue at hand is that the youngsters of the present age do n't devote enough time for helping their communities .
This issue is of significant importance because it questions our ability to carry forward our ancient traditions to the younger generations .
I personally agree with the above argument .
There are many reasons for which i agree to the statement .

First , the youngsters nowadays hardly get time to spend in helping their communities .
This is mainly because they are most of the time involved in academics or even over burdened by them .
They have hardly any time to help their communities , let alone relax .
They are overburdened with assignments and tests in their courses most of the time .
Being an undergraduate , i hardly find any time for other activities due to my busy academic schedule .

Secondly , the youngsters today are less inclined towards the propogation of their community culture .
This is mainly because of the various factors , the main reason being the lack of interest on part of the parents .
It is the parents ' duty to instill the feeling of belongingness towards their own community and culture .
This can be attributed to the fact that the parents are also occupied with their works and hardly find time to spend with their children .

The parents should also encourage children to participate in cultural events .
However , the parents rarely show interest in such issues .

Another reason for this could be that the interactions and regular meetings between communities have declined gradually .
This can be attributed to the increased amount of migration of people to distant urban places in search of greener pastures .
The long distance also provides hindrance to the regular meetings of the communities .
After my family migrated to the city , we could not find time to regularly meet our relatives since the city was far away from our village .

In conclusion , i feel that all the above factors have eventually led to the lack of time for the youngsters in helping their communities
