I agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''

People always try new things in oneway or the other to make their life more affordable or happier .
When a person tries in developing something that would make life of society , he will succed in doing so because he have invested considerable amount of time and risk .
Once succeded , he looks for new things that are pausable for many people .
He takes this as a spirit or challenge .
He brainstrom ideas , put to experiment and take the risks .
It is a desire to try newthings with risk for the people who were successful in the past .
It makes them fell happier and drive forward .

I would give some personal examples to strongly support my above statement .
For instance , when I was working on reasearch project at a pharmaceutical company back in my early childhood , I developed a drug for cancer that helped cure many people .
I took the risk in developing the drug knowing the consequences that will have my life .
This successful incident led me to try new things .

Development of instrument that revolutionized the lives of people who have Diabetes ( people who cannot regulate bood sugar ) .
This happened when I was with Pfizer in early 1984 .
At times there is no way people can analyse their blood sugar level without going to hospitals .
It was really very hard on me to develop and instrument that would one day help everyone to get their blood glucose results instantaneously .
I had spent considerable amount of time on this project .
If I am right , it took me 10 years to develop this instrument .

I felt it is like taking the risk , because I may succed at the end or may be not .
I was very successful in doing so .

Finally , I would appreciate the people who are successful and try new things , eventhough knowing the risks in doing so .
