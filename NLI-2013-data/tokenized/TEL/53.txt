Yes , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialisze in one specific subject because of various reasons .

If a person has knowledge about a particular subject , it is good .
But if he wants to refrain himself from foraying from other subjects he should make sure that he is very thorough with that subject .
Because finally he should find a job on that basis only and more ver all the academic topics are interconnected so , it imperative to have knowledgein various fields .

The above option would be good only if he find a job .
He should always keep in mind the different possibilities in hi carreer .
He should ask himself `` what if i dont get a job in his desired field of study ? ''

For example I am a mechanical engineering student .
as every one knows there is a scarcity of jobs for mechanical engineers .
if i continue with the same field would be left unemployed .
Here I need to have an alternate option .
I have my alternate option as computer sciences .
I started learning some computer subjects .
Now even if i donot get a job in my field of study , i may have a chance of getting it in field of computers .
This would not leave me unemployed .
I personally feel that being employed is better than being unemployed .

This criteria not ony works for two fields of same backround , it also works for a technical background and an arts background .
For example , an electrical engineer who doesnot have a job and whose hobby is singing , can survive by giving some stage shows .
Which would also be considered as an employment .

Moreover , broader knowlege would not leave you speechless when you are in a group .
because when agroup is discussing a topic and if you are silent , you may feel embarassed with that .
But if you are familiar with the topic you can also give your opinion on the topic .
this is possible only if you donat confine yourself to a particular field

I conclude that having a broad knowledge is better than to specialize in one subject .
