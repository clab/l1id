I disagree with the statement that a student should have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize on one .

Studying about several subjects at a time will not give the student a chance to know completely about any of the subjects .
If a student is not allowed to learn about any one subject in detail , he would end up having little knowledge of every subject .
This will not help him to be successfull in any of the fields that he has studied about .
He has to decide on one subject or a field and should get into maximum possible details of the subject .
It is quite impossible for a student to get into details of each and every subject .
One has to be gifted with superficial powers to be able to master about all subjects .

Considering an expample of a group of Architecture students .
Learning simple information about every aspect of building design will not help them do a good design individually .
If the group is devided and each student is made to specialize on each aspect of buliding design in detail , the whole group would finally be designing a very successfull project together .
This is more like the idea of devide and rule .
So , a student should be let to study about a subject in detail .

In the above example one student could get into design , another student into structural aspects of a building , another into interior decoration and many more like this .
Finally this group turns out to be a very succesfull architectural firm .

Hence it is clear that when any student is made to study about many subjects and none of them in detail would put him in trouble .
A student has to specialize on one subject .
This helps him to gain his interest and focus his concentration towards one direction .
He may also do good research on the particular subject and invent new things .

So , it is always advantageous to specialize on one specific subject than to have little knowledge about many things at a time .
