I disagree with the statement `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
Cars are the most important means of transport in todays world where people prefer to travel more than other means of transportation .
They play an very important role in once life .

In twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today because in the modern world people are very bussy with there works and they have to travel to a very far places from where they reside to do there work so they have to travel fast to manage there time .
So they need a vehicle in which they can go on very fast so car fullfills the need .
In case of other transportation like the public transportation where they have to wait for the public vehicle to come so they are a wasting a lot of time .
so most people do not prefer .

And many other people have a passion towards cars and they like to drive cars .
So people buy cars because of there passion .
Because of this reason some families will have more than two to three cars .
Car is a prestige issue so this is the reason the average middle class family is also buying a car .

And according to the recent surveys people prefer to buy the cars than to any other means of transportation .
And because of this there is a large increase in the sales of the cars in the recent years many car manufacturing comming up for this reasons .
and when we compare the sales of the cars say from 1930's there is a considerable rise in the sales of the car say at an avereage it is 60 % then the same is going to continue in the future .
So by this we can say that we will be using more cars than today .

Because of the above mentioned reasons i strongly disagree that there will be fewer cars in twenty years from today .
