I agree to the claim that it is indeed important for students to understand the basic ideas and fundamental concepts of any science rather than just learning the facts .

Observing the facts is just like a surfacial phenomenon .
Only , when we penetrate through the existing reality of the subject and understand its inmost charecteristics through analysis of observed ideas an concepts , then only we can correctly map them to the existing facts .

Understanding ideas and concepts is nothing but a sort of research .
Thus , we can redefine our knowledge on the subject and find out the innovations and possible ways to utilize it for our use .
If we just concentrate on facts , then sometimes we may just get carried away with our erroneous conclusions .
Only , through understanding its fundamental features we can analyse it 's basic nature and can put forth satisfying theory that works well with observed fact .

Mankind had progressed significantly most of the time through understanding the ideas and concepts relating to the subject rather than learning facts .
Ofcourse , facts too have their significance , but only analysis of the subject will make progress in that field .

For an example , lets take the field of VLSI ( Very Large Scale Intergrated Circuits ) .
Only through the understanding the concepts behind it made significant chnages in it field .
Onbody can really look into the Integrated Chip and learn how it works .
Only , through a thourough analysis of ideas and concepts we can actually fabricate a chip .
In this case we have no scope to observe the fact rather than understanding it .

The main reason for supporting to understanding the ideas and concepts is , then only the students will have complete idea about how the fact will actually take shape .
Then , they can plan for innovations and alterations in it .
Thats how the concept of research arises .
Only through research have progressed to this extent .
By understanding the basic concepts and learning , analysing facts will become automatic .
But , the converse is not true always .

The first one will prompt for further research while the later , just give a dry understanding .
The basic nature of a research is nothing but understanding and thouroughly analyse the ideas and concepts .
Which ultimately boosts the progress of that field .

Especially , when it comes to the students it is their responsiblity to understand what they study and if possible bring out the best innovations out of the existing ones .
Learning a fact is mere acquision of some knowledge regarding that which often have lesser importance when compared to understanding the concepts and analysing through ideas .

So , I conclude that it really important for the students to understand ideas and concepts reather than to learn the facts as it motivates them to for research and come out with excellent enhancements and new developments .
Ofcourse , learning fact is important , but it is of lesser importance when compared to understanding the ideas and concepts .
