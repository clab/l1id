The statement given is that the young people in the modern society are not showing interest in helping the communities .
Yes i agree with the statement mentioned due to many reasons .
One of the reason is that the students now-a-days are showing lots of interest in the enjoyment itself .
They spend most of the time with their freinds and goes to pubs or some other place and spend time .
Now-a-days the culture is like this and even their parents are not showing interest in guiding the children .
The young students prefer to spend most of their time in playing games .
This is a great enjoyment for them .

The other reason is that the people now-a-days became very competitive and the only aim for them is to reach the higher positions and earn more money .
So , in order to achieve this they are working more and more hours and they are not at all looking to help the social organisations .
For example , i can consider my freind as he got was recruited in social community office .
Here service should be done to old people and the children who lost their parents but the pay will be little less .
He done the job for two months without willingness and gave up ultimately .
He do n't have interest in sevice and he needs more money .
I think this is a good example for the above explanation .

One more reason is that the mindset of the young people will be somewhat selfishness and always compares with the neighbouring people .
What those people did , they want to do the samething and seek higher positions .
They wont bother about the society and the people who need some help from them .
