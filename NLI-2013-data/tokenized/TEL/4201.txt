I completely disagree with the statement as a lot of young people who are the next leaders of the nation are not putting in enough efforts in to helping their community .
Life has become so fast in the twentyfirst century that peole are always busy running around not understanding what they want at the end of the day .
they are so busy with there studies there career and there futhur and the day to day stress they forget the very importance of building a community which would look after each other instead of places were there is a lot of crime , drug abuse etc. which would intern effect there personal life .

Young people these days are so self obsssesed that they dont have time to even think about there next family members .
They have a lot of time to go to movies or coffee place everyday and cant afford to take atleat an hour in a week to help their community .
this can be changed as in my case were proper guidence from the older generation and determination make a change in the community .

With proper motivation from the older generation this can be changed as was the case in my community when we in first moved to the community where i live now there was no proper waste disposal , people would just trow there waste in front of their neighbours house are on the roads which intern affected them with fly and mosqutioes .
To over come this problem we were advised by older people to come up with ideas to solve the problem , this led to sucusfull change in the waste , few of my freinds and me joined hands to collect funds in the colony bought a large bin that placed at one corner of the colony and every house had to dump there waste there and there would be the garbagge collectors to dispose the waste .
This was achevied due to the involvement of youth from the community .

If it made by law that every week a certin number hours are be spent doing community work by the youth i think the there would be a larger undersating and responsibility would be develpoved .
This is followed by the community in stay every month we donate funds to charity organistions like `` CRY '' from screening of movies , organisating events etc .
