People need to move from place to place to carryout various daily activities .
Right from the existance of man on earth he has been nomadic , moving from place to place for food , shelter etc .
So there must be some means of transport and those means changed as generations passed and as the technology developed .
Early man used to walk , later he used tamed animals like camels in deserts , horses etc and then he brought the revolutionary change when he invented wheel .
Almost all the current means of transportation are based on wheel and one such widely use means of transportation is the car .

Many people in the present society have cars and they use it daily to travel from home to office or elsewhere .
So traffic has increased enormously .
In the coming twenty years we will more cars if they increase the way they are now .
But I believe that in the next twenty years cars will actually reduce because there are other means of transportation available such that everyone need not rely on only cars for travelling .

Technology has been growing along with requirements of people .
Now more public transport systems are available which are useful to the society and the facilities thay are providing are also increasing day by day .
Public transport systems like government and privide owned buses , public railway system , local trains and even aeroplanes have bettered their services and increased their frequencies .
So instead of using cars many people now are looking into these means for their routine purposes like going to schools , colleges , offices etc .

One more aspect of these public transport system is that they are a cheap and reliable means of transportation .
It can help many people reach their destination with less risk and cost .
Governments are now introducing many policies to encourage people to use more of this public transport .
Many benefits have been advertised like lower bus fares for students and workers who travel regularly , benefits for elderly people etc .
Many fare concessions are advertised .

One more reason why i feel cars will come down is that the effect these vehecles are having on our environment makes everyone to give a thought on using these vehecles .
The pollution caused by these vehecles cause severe respiratory problems to the entire mankind .
Apart from such direct harm to health of humans it also pollutes the environment and leads to global warming .

One good example to show that cars will come down in future is that countries like singapore and japan use more of bycycles rather than cars .
They advocate people that use of bicycles is not only good for environment but also for our own health .
Their idea has already impressed many and in future many nations will definitely follow this .

One more reason why i think we will see fewer cars in future may be because of the fuel constraints .
Even today many countries are having less rerserves of than what is required .
The fuel prices have been growing higher and higher .

So i agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars considering the various reasons mentioned above .
