Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
However , i disagree with the previous statement that the younger one enjoy life more than older people .
there are several reasons for holding this opinion .

First , younger people are always busy with their studies and schedules because of competition among them .
This hectic life might be painstaking and arduous job for younger ones when compared to the older ones as they are settled and no tensions are around them .
They relax themselves playing with their kids , gardening , which soothes their mind .

second , younger people need to go to their respective job for their servival .
But the old people already struggled with their jobs , and earned sufficient money for their rest of life .
so , they do n't need to worry about job .
As someone stated that enjoying life is nothing but doing the things which soothes our mind and body .
for instance , a retired police officer may not enjoy his / her younger days as he/she is busy with his / her duty as it is impossible to meet his family and friends .
however , after retiring she/he can enjoy her/his remaining life .

Finally , younger ones do n't have matured intelligence and the do n't know the importance of enjoying life .
they think that enjoying life is nothing but having bad habits such as drinking .
but , the older people enjoy life with their families and friends , which is the best .
Even the younger ones do n't know how to enjoy life and the meaning of their lives .

In sum up , i feel that older people enjoy their life than younger people do as they dont have much time , need to go to their jobs and they dont have matured intelligence .
