According to me successful people always go for the new things instead of going for the things that are well known .
They will consider the ideas of the known things and try to go in a new way .
So i agree with the sentence that successful people take risks for getting things to be done .
Suppose if we go for a well known matter there will be no chance of taking risk .
We know what the result is going to be .
We are not taking the risk in that where as if take the risk and obtain the thing or work done it will be satisfactory for us also .

When i was in school my friends use to read only one publication where as i used to read three publications .
I used to answer for most of the qusetions asked by the teachers .
My friends used to say me that its waste of reading all the publications available in the market .
At the end of the examinations i was the top student in the class .
But when i was preparing for the examinations my friends told me that i am going to fail the test and they asked me to read only the prescibed textbook instead of going for other books .
But i know that i am going to score high in the class .
I took risk and i was successful at the end .
But one thing we have to keep in mind is that we should be careful while we are taking the risk .
We should work hard for getting the desired reults .

Most of the successfful world famous scientists also took risk and obtained fruitful result .
If we dont take risk we dont have a scope to work .
So most of the successful bussiness persons and other people who are successful in life will take some risks to achieve the good results .
If we want to do something new then we have to take risk definately .
So its better to take risk in a proper manner and obtain the good results .
