Community is where the people thrive and learn the lessons of social life .
Serving the community is one of the ways you can pay back .
We live in a global village which has no boundaries and it would be short sighted of us to just consider our own community .
To start with I would like to disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

There are quite a number of reasons for the same .
When a community faces a problem then all people associated come forward to solve the problem .
Young people are as much a part of the community as anyone else .
And if they do n't help their community then its them who will have to suffer along .
For an instance the Students at IIT Powai , Mumbai cleaned the Powai Lake which is a fresh water body and one of the major source of drinking water in Mumbai .
No one forced them to do this but they made waves when they undertook this task and many organizations came forward to help with equipment and funding .

Then again there are other ways in which one can help .
Like for an instance blood donation campaign and donation of clothes and necessary items for the needy .
We at our company have regular blood donation campaigns and help age group activities .
Donations are never monitory but still they help .
Sometimes we just give our time , time for the people who crave attention like the generation of grandparents .
And this also gives a sort of self satisfaction and self revelation as well .

There are also people who are joining red-cross and other organizations to help the needy .
The doctors in these missions are also young .
I know a family personally who renounced everything for the good of the down-trodden , and they are not just any graduates but engineers working for MNCs .

In the end i would like to say that help can be of different kinds , if we are helping the world as a whole then we should not be self centered to just consider our own place only .
So it is not correct to say that young are not helping the community when they are helping the world as a whole .
