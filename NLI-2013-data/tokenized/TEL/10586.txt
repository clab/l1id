In my opinion successful people try new things and take risks rather than simply doing work on things that they already known .
In my opinion a successful person is a one who never stops working and who has a eager to discover new things not just by stoping after some successful work because he know the importants of success .

A person is successful when he sets the goals and works for them to achieve .
Once if he sets the goal , he gets organised .
By talking about his gaols with some other people whom he knows he may get help like suggestions and assurance from them .
in this way he achievs his goals by puting a lot of hard work in it .

After achiving a goal he automaticaly shifts to new thing in order to continue his success .
I mean they are ready to take risks on there further work .
By doing like this they can get grip on there goals or subject on which they are working .
This also makes him to get prestage in socity , he might become popular on his work .
He might get money in the form of rewards and awards .

Successful people never forgets the steps they were followed .
This makes them to stragule in new things and makes them to risk .
If they work on what they already known instead of taking risks and trying for new things , they become unpopular and they forget about goals and hard work , this makes them lazy .
Because of this fear they always works and takes risks .
