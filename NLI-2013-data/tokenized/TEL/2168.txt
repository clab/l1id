I agree with the fact that young people enjoy life more than the old people do .
Age is an important factor in a person life and it , in many ways the way he leads it .

Youngsters have a zeal and enthusiasm in them within them and look at life with hope and happiness .
It is the ideal age to experience life and each day gives a new chance for a new attempt and each attempt gives a new moral .
Generally people under their 30's , have the hope that they can achieve their goals and also they believe that they have the energy to do it .
It is this energy that corporate multinational organisations look for .

A typical senior citizen would lack enthusiasm and zeal in their lifeand this dullness is quite natural .
They have already tasted the variety in life and anything gets boring when one gets used it .
Very few things seem new to them and this makes life quite spiceless .

The physical conditions of youngsters helps them to enjoy life a lot better .
They have the agility in their bodies and more importanly they have better immunities that helps them stay healthy .
The bodies of the senior citizens lack agility and they are more prone to irregular blood pressures , heart attacks , diabetes etctec .
They have to constrain their activities and due to this they may not be able to enjoy life to the maximum .

The biggest problem with the old is the feelin of being unwanted .
Old people may have the feelin of loneliness and may feel dejected as they may lose their friends , partners , parents , The busy schedule of thier children and the other beloved younger group , worsens this feeling .
This feeling could stop them from enjoying life .
Th younger lot have the beloved ones with them and spending time with them brings back color to the otherwise dull life .
Psychologies change with age and it is not possible for the senior people to have the same psychology they had in thier youth .
So .
they might not have the same joy and cheerful life they had in theri youth where they would move round with friends , partying and also a trying to make an image of thier own the society .
