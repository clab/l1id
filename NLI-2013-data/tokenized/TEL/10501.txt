I agree with the statement `` sucessful people try new things and take new risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do '' , because a successful person may have confidence which may not there in unsuccessful person .
By this confidence they take risks and also works harder to get success .
Avoiding pressure is the one of the important factor for a person to acheive success , but the unsuccessful persons are in pressure which leads them not to do risks at that period .
A successful may ovecome the pressure which is not possible for a unsuccessful person .

For example , consider business people , the person who gains profit in bussiness may try to do risks by perfoming different plans .
These people can withstand for any type of result that may give profit or loss , but the person who is in loss will never try to do risks as the reason that he may face loss if the plan gives negative result which leads the person to huge ammount of loss .

A successful person always need more success which leads In my conclusion , it is not possible for a unsuccessful person to do risks as a successful person can do .
