Yes I agree with following statements .
It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts .
As life is a short period so the student cant experience or learn every thing in facts .

when coming to understanding the ideas and coccepts it one of the life cycle for the student .
As student faces many kind of ideas and concepts in class while listening to the class .
Student comes to know many kinds of concepts while reading a book or listening to the lecture in the class .
The student is supposed to create ideas while reading books .
Understanding the ideas of other people like class mates or friends is very important in the student life , because many people have many ideas and concepts .
by understanding the ideas of other people the student can learn many things related to life and survive ni his life at any stage with out facing any problems .
If the student fails in catching the ideas and concepts of other people he will face many problemsin life .
Some people has the ideas of solving any kind of problem by their ideas and concepts which he faced regularly in his life .

By having ideas on a perticular job which has to finish by the student he can survive and completes the job at any kind of difficulties he faces in the path of completing the job .
For example the students prepares for a seminar and prepared a paper work for the seminar .
but he losts the information prepared by him .
But he is not discouraged and the ideas and the concepts he prepared encourages him to complete the task in time .
This is the main advantage for the students to understant the ideas and concepts than to leatn facts .
Favts can be learned by the experiences faced by the students in his life .
every thing in the life cant be experienced as stated below .
As there is no experience for the student in facing the seminar but he completes it perfectle with the ideas and concepts .

For this reason iagree with the above statement
