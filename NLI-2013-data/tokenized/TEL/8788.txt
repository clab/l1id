After recaptulating the experience in my life i found both understanding and learning the concepts are usefull but understanding the ideas and concepts more usefull and scietifical .

I found understanding of conepts more benificial in many fields and ways because by understanding the idea we know how to apply easily and effctively .

for example in solving a physics problem if you understand the concept you can do it easily and accurately with in lees time compared to others .
another example if we understand a surgical procedure thoroughly we can perfom it less complications .

Understanding concept also makes us remember the concept for a long time .
for example i still remember the dissection of frog which i learned in my school days becuse i understood the steps of dissection well .

another example is that regadding the differant process that takes place in the human digstive system .

Analyzation of the subject is increased when we understand the concept , this can be supported with the example of apersonal experience regarding the case which i saw in the hospital i found the symptoms of the disaese icould diagnose a tough case easily .
I was able to do so only because i had better understanding of the subject .

Understanding the subject also increases our depth and the the command of the subject for example in organic chemistry we should depth of the concept in order to judge the correct the reaction .

thus with the correct understanding of concept is essential for all these to occur .
