I do agree with the statements that succesful people try new things and take new risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
It is the calculated risk that a person takes that shows his confidence and attitude towards life .
Trying out new things keeps a person from getting bored with the routine type of work .
Taking new risks always has a chance for growth not only in what he/she is doing but also as a person .

I can state my own experience as an example .
I 've always been a topper in high school with excellence in mathematics .
After graduating from high school most were taking up engineering and accounts for undergraduation .
I realised I had an interest in sciences and dared to take the risk to face the competion to enter into a medical school .
Finally not only did I get into one of the top medical schools with 98.5 % but also got a financial aid .
All through the way I believed in myself and never let my confidence fall apart .

And then I realised that I had a taste for music , which led me to become a Disc Jockey .
I used it as a way to relax my tensions from my academic curriculum .
People thought how can a ` ld be doctor possibly be a DJ .
Well , I know it sounds weird , but I wanted to try someting new .
It was just the start and the list went on from organising Medical Camps , Awareness campaigns to starting a student organisation for sincerity , service and development .

Although you need discipline , hardwork and patience to reach goals , it is the difference which you make that matters .
It shows the attitude towards life and the confidence with which we move ahead .

Successful people are confident people with a positive attitude who try out something new always and try to make a difference in others ' lives .
Every new task is a challenge for proficiency and confidence .
They always want to see life in a broader prespective filled with challenges .

As a matter of fact , everybody should try out new things , which will develop their attitude towards life and will make them a better person .
