The advertisements make the most products look better than they are really , i agree with this above mentioned satement .
for this agree i want to state sum examples to hold my agrrement .

As per my knowledge is concerned some advertisements regarding the products that is any product , the advertisement makes much better than they really what the product is .
I does not want to criticize any paricular item or a manufacturer of the product ,

I have so many experiences with this statement , i want to produce one example what i have faced , one time i was watching the television show in between the show there was a commercial break , in the break i watched one advertisement regarding an ornament , in that advertisement the manufacturers were showing their best qualities of the ornaments with celebrities of the modern world , and that time i was greatly influenced by that advertisement particularly i made a strong decision to visit that store to purchase the ornament .

After a few days i visited that store with my friends , i purchased one of the ornament that i liked there , and i came back from the store after a few days later i noticed that the product which i purchased from the ornament store got damaged because of misproper finishings , it was one of the costliest item which i purchased , and after this situation i realized that some kinds of advertisements make the products seem much even better than their orginal .
so i finally conclude this statement by agreeing .
