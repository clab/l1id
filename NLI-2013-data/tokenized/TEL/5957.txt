`` In twenty years there will be fewercars in use thanthere are today '' .
I agree with this following statement , there may be people use less cars now they are using .
Because each and single person buying a new car for his own travelling , in this way each and single person use one car it may crowed in the roads .
And traffic joms may happen .
It is very risk to clear the traffic .

After some days when the people want travel in single they use public mass transports .
So that people will not to pay intrest to buy a car .
There are some othere reasons are there that in few more years the people can not use cars .

In that one is that , in the prasent day the petrolium rates are growing by every year .
this is also one of the reasons that the number of cars used is also decrease .
How it influence is , if oil rates increase the maintanence of the car is more .
So that the common people not intrested to buy the car .

And another reason is we can not made petrolium products artificially .
These are availlable ground .
But mass usage these petrolium products also decreased .
But we can provide artifical fuels .
To make these artificial fuels are more costly then natural fuels .
This also make that buying the cars in future is decreases .

From the folloing reasons we can conclude the in few years there will be less cars in use than there today used .
