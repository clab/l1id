I agree with the statement that `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
I support the above statement because younger people have the capability , vitality and vigour to do things than what older people can do .
I can explain this by following examples .

Firstly , considering the present situation of technolgical developments taking place and day by day the world market is being stormed by a variety of innovative gadgets .
Younger people have the edge over older people for enjoying these products .
Young people have the strong inclination to use these products which the older people may not posess due loss in intrests in the worldly pleasures .

Secondly , considering the examples of learning , younger people are exposed newer innovative ideas and newer discoveries being made .
By learning these things they can come to a better understanding of the present situation of their society which ultimately leads them to create a better enjoyable life of their own .
Where as the older people may lack the interest of learning new things which may be due to their old age or due to a prejudiced feeling that they know everything .

Finally , considering the biological aspect younger people can do a lot of work than the older people can do .
While doing the work of their interest young people can enjoy that work as the physically they can subject their body to stress .
Where as considering the old people , even they have interst to do some work the physical condition of their body may not cooperate for doing the work .
In addition young people tend to be more healthy .
So , they can enjoy different types recepies whereas it is not possible in the case of older people who are more prone to health ailments .

Considering the above stated three examples I think that I was able to justify my statement that `` younger people enjoy life more than older pople do ''
