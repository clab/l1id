In general , it is better to have both the tasks i.e. , Broad knowledge of many academic subjects and also specialization in particular subjects .
Depending on the present concern , i prefer specialization in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Having specialization in one specific subject shows ones own interest in picking particular subject of greater importance in the present trend of education .
I prefer this because having broad knowledge on many academic subjects is of no use as all the academic subjects may not carry equal importance .

Additionally , specialize in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that we cannot have the ability to analyze the problems in all the subjects efficiently .
This will make me more strong to have good command on one particular subject than having a broad knowledge of various academic subjects .

Finally , i choose specialization in one specific subject superior to broad knowledge of various academic subjects is that we will be able to take up any challenge or if any problem in that particular subject can be efficiently sorted out with the command or the specialization on a particular subject .
This efficiency cannot be achieved by having a broad knowledge over a subject .

Ultimately , i believe that the specialization in one subject is better than having a broad knowledge of academic subjects because we will be able to master that particular subject and also we can select the subject depending on the person 's interest and also the present boom for that particular subject .
This is because , all the academic subjects may not be so important to learn so deeper .
This makes me very strong to prefer specialization in one specific subject over having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
