I do agree with the statement that in the twenty years there will be fewer cars than they are today .
There are many reasons for this like the environmental impact , the distance to be travelled , the traffic problem , cost of the fuel , increase in the labour charges for fixing the car , the policies of the government , etc .
These are explained as below .

First , from the environmental point of view cars are a major source of pollution pouring heavy amounts of carbon monoxide in to the atmosphere .
So many people are these days much aware of the environment and are intending to live in a pollution free cities and towns .
The people stopped buying cars in many of the countries these days and are resorting to other means of transport like trains and buses which carry many passengers at a time having a negligent effect on the environment when compare to cars if all those people travel in each .

Second , these days since the cities being fully developed and no places being left in the city so many of the firms are being shifted to the outskirts of the city .
Many people will find it difficult to travel to the outskirts of the city in a car as the distance is much longer and they also find it safer to travel by trains and buses .
It is also cheaper when compared to travelling by a car .
The railways and the public tranportation these days have been developed a lot and it is much safer these days to travel by these sources .

Third , the traffic problem and the cost of the fuel .
As the population has increased the number of vehicles people used has also increased by a considerable number as a result the traffic in the towns and cities is very heavy .
Many people found that it is very stressful to drive in such a heavy traffic and the accidents have also increased .
Moreover the cost of the fuel like diesel and petrol is increasing day by day and people are finding it much difficult to pay so much for the fuel .
In the twenty years the fuel may cost twice or thrice of the present cost .
The labour charges for fixing the car have also increased by a considerable amount and in the future they are may be five to six times more .

Finally the traffic in the cities and towns is very heavy and the people have to get struck inthe traffic for hours and hours .
The parking lots alloted for the cars are filled by half the customers in the shopping malls and the people are finding it difficult to park the cars .
The goverment also imposed amny restrictions on the owners of the cars like cars should not be used for more than 10 years , they have to have the pollution check certified every two months , etc .
I hope that people will stop buying cars in the next twenty years basing on alll these factors .
But however the travel by car is very convinient as we can travel at any time we need .
