The given statement `` it is more important to understand ideas and consepts than it is for them to learn facts '' on glance it look quite convincing but on closer scrutinity it need a carefull analysis and indepth investigation , I tend to agree with the statement with out undrstanding the topic or idea or consept we can not learn the facts with out proper analysis we can not judge the facts .

For instance a student is suffering with a heart attack and other peer students are collicting the fund for his treatment with out noing the main idea how others will donate fund to the students so understanding the idea is important .

With out nowing the main concept of the idea it will missleads the student , for example a sujar cane factory is going to establish in your town with in a few days a notice has came that there is a esablishment of a factory in your town which has more employment opportunities , then every one fells that it will reduce the unemployment problem in the town and there will be lot of advantages like new facilities will be improved and they asume so on .
But the impact of sugarcane factory will be danger for there health the surrounding of the factory will be polluted with the smell and the air will be polluted , if they know actual concept then the student will oppose to esablishment of factory in the town .

with out understanding the proper idea or concept it will lead for many misunderstandings .
with out understanding the proper idea or concept the student may suffer lot to understand the main theme of the topic .
Not only a student every one should understand the idea and concept than only they can learn the facts

so I conclude in my openion it is important to understand the idea and concept than only we can learn the facts .
