I agree that the young people nowadays are not giving time to help their communities .
The young people as soon as they finish their schooling they awaiting for the college to be opened .
Though they do not have so much interest they feel that helping their communities degrade their presitge and it matters alot .
In my point of view not only the young people but also their parents are responsible for that .
If they have interest and when they go to help , their parents will restrict them .
This does not happens in all cases but some of the parents might be doing .
For those parents first they must realize the need of help for their community and encourage their young ones .

If we take the young people into consideration their parents must be encouraged and the students who are interested in helping the community must form a group and must also encourage the other young people .
The problems of the community must be discussed among the group and certain measures must be taken .

Not only taking the certain measures but also they must be kept into action and the parents must guide their children .
This helps the young people not only to help their community but also the nation can changed .
Taking inspiration of small group of young people each and every young person will come forward to help their own community .
By helping these communities the problems that are suffered by the country can prevented as well as removed .

Finally young people are the main citizens of the country they should have the responsibility over their family , their community and their country .
This helps each and every young one to think about themselves as well as about their surroundings .
This also helps them in building their carreer in the right path .
