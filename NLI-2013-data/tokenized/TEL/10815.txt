I do agree to what is being said about the successful people in the above stated question .
Because , it is a matter of fact and can be accepted that the successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

For a successful person , it would rather become an interest to go in search of many new things by taking risks .
If at any point of time , one is really successful in any aspect of life , he or she would really go in search of new things even if it calls for risks to get expertise in all the aspects of life , as life is not confined to a small pond .
That would make them understand different things and different situations in the world andf also teachs them the necessary steps to be taken .
The world is very big and there are many things to be learnt from the world , so one cannot limit his area of thinking and expertise in only one field .
One should get a diversified idea and reasonable expertise in what exactly is happening around the world .

On the contrary , when we become successful in one area of life , we tend to know more about the same thing we have been learning all years .
They would have the profound knowledge about the same aspect of life , however , if something else is given to them , they just go blank as they do not know what has to be done exactly in those situations .
One trys to develop an illusion to only have his thinking confined to a single errand rather than going deep into the world .

When it comes to learning different things , besides what they are already doing , the new things would for sure fascinate one self to go deep into it .
In the future , if an individual faces any instance in his life in regards to something outside his profession , he would find room to get some things done for himself rather than just going blank in those situations which a normal person would .

With the present days increasing technology , if one has to grow in his life , one profession would not fetch him bread and butter .
Only multiple talents would actually make him earn a living .
At the same time we cannot expect all the people to be gifted with the same talent , there would be some people without multiple talents .
This is where Bill Clinton 's phrase comes into picture . ''
If someone is born poor , it is not his fault .
If he dies poor , it is is fault . ''
This plays a major role and would be quoted a motivating statement that would drive an individual to take risks and try out new things rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
