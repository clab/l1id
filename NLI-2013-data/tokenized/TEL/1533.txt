The issue at our hand is wheather it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I think it is better to be specialized in one specific subject .

If one chooses a single subject in which the student wants to be specialized , he will be more focused towards that specific subject and its implimentations and he will become a professional in that subject .
Where as if he has broad knowledge of many academic subjects he will be half focused towards all the subjects and he would not be able to handle any subject perfectly .
Because of this reason i think it is better to be specialized in one specific subject .

And also he can spend much more time on that perticular subject and he can concentrate more on that subject with which he can improve his knowledge in that subject by presenting several papers on it and doing several projects for the implimentation of the subject .
where as having the broad knowledge of many subjects may make the student purplexed .

Lastly consider an example of a person who can play chess , basket ball and cricket .
If he tries to play all the games and if he practice all the games for equal duration he will not be able to better utlize the skills he is having .
where as if he concentrates more on a specific game he will be a champion of that game as he is more focused towards that game .

Finally as the being specialized in specific subject he will be more focused towards that specialization and he can better utilize his knowledge and skills for the implementation of the subject , he learned .
Because of these reasons I think it is better to be specialized in specific subject .
