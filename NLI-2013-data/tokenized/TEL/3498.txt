`` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
I agree with this ststement .
Nowadays , young people are restricted to limited number of activities by their parents .
In this present world young people are almost operated by their by their parents or in general elders .
They are not allowed to think pragmatically .
They already have been alloted with a time table or routine in their life like what is to be done at each age in their life and most of them are kept in control without deviation from their track .
So most of the young people donot give enough time to helping their communities , the task which is not present in their curriculum .

Society and the environment of the young is also influencing them in a greater way .
Most of them are not even aware of the present scenario apart from the studies and they not know exactly about the problems faced by the communities .
Most of them nowadays are narrow minded .
Every one feels and in fact are made to feel '' Why should I care about others ?
What are they to me ? ''
.
Almost everyone is living with the sane mind set .
Every one has the same unique vision of their life that is to study well and earn money for themselves and their families .
No one wants to contribute for the society .

In olden days problems were the part of everyones life .
So young people who are the future of this world knew their responsibilities to be discharged for the community .
People at that time used to lead a practical life with broader vision .
They always did things thinking how this effects and helps the society .

So i feel that young people nowadays are being greatly influenced by their parents and they are not contributing to the society even though they have got a great potential .
Young people who are the future of this world should be properly guided in their association with the society for a better tomorrow .
