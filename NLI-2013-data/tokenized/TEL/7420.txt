I agree that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is beneficial in a number of ways but with a few reservations on group travel .
I would explain my reasoning in the following paragraphs .

Firstly , Tour guide is a professional who knows alot of places , thier history and how to reach the place , where to stay , what food to eat etc . , .
Also Tour guide is proficient in the native language of the place .
These two advantages overwiegh any other disadvantages of travelling .

Secondly , travelling in a group led by a tour guide will be cost effective as more people will share the travel expenses .
Tour guide will explain the history of the place visited which we cannot know unless we do some homework on what places to visit and read through its history which we often donot do .
Travelling in a group will help to build new partnerships with fellow travellers in the group which cannot be done if travelled indivdiually .

Thirdly , travelling in a group with a guide helps us to avoid problems with native language speakers and also fishy shopping tricks by native speakers .
Also as a group , more number of places can be toured with same amount of money if spent on individual travel .

But , there are a few disadvantages for group travel led by a guide .
Limited knowledge of the tour guide will make us to tour fewer places which tour guide is familiar with .
Co-ordination effort among the group of people with different mindsets is difficult .
Privacy during travel will be be voilated during group travel .
Travelling individually allows the individual to see places of his/her interest rather than constrained by the group travel .

In Conclusion , Group travel is advantageous in most of the scenarios in many terms but it depends on the individual preference and his/her fnancial limitations .
