Nowadays the competetion for academic success has increased a lot over the last decade .
The youth , most of them students , donot find time to help their communities .

I am not denying the students ' participation in the activities NGOs and other social organizations .
But their numbers are not much and a significant fraction of them do this work for personal advantages .

This should be looked at more as a consequence of the changing lifestyles and culture .
The role of decline in the importance of traditions , not in the significance of occasions and festivals , but following of the traditions in `` everyday living '' , which has almost vanished is undeniable .
The religion and the cultures have always preached `` giving back '' to your community .

The youth cannot be alone blamed because this trend is generic .
Most people , with the exception of may be the older citizens who still stick on to their old habits and customs , donot show social concern for their communities .

In the Indian context all of the above have been most obstreperous .
Increased competetion could be thr driving force in decreased importance of other issues in the youth 's point of view but the role of changing customs is nevertheless present .
