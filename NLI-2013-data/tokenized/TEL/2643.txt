Yes , i agree with the statement .
Young people are the future of the world , they remain active in thier young period but while they get older they loose patience , concentration and the body organs get weak , they may see inactive comparing with young people .

As young people have many dreams and have many goals to achieve .
They work accordingly to achieve their goals and their age is in the stage that they are ready to do anything , young people say and prove ` nothing is impossible ' .they can jump , play and enjoy the wholelife at maximum extent .
well about the older people they will loose their patience , they have to look after whole family and would face many problems regarding family and now they have no strength to do more work , no strength to dance , jump and travel .

For example , lets take my young cousin , when his family went for an holiday including his grandfather who is 70 years old , my cousin explored whole city and visited many religious places , which make him happpy or he may enjoys that .
while his grandfather who is also interested to see those places but due to his physical weakness and due to the temperature variance he did n't resist at that palce .
And many places are in the hilly areas which are to be travel by walk , as his grandfather have no strength he did n't enjoyed the trip .

Young people have many ways to enjoy their life at maximum .
now-a-days young girls are the main factor for their enjoyment , they go out with their girl friends in which they find much enjoyment .
But older people ca n't do that as they are married they are restricted to thier limitations .
This is a silly example but it is a huge reality statement .

I conclude by saying that young people will have more fun in thier period by comparing with the older people .
Due to their strengths and enthusiascim which can find more in young people rather than in older people .
