I strongly agree that in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there are today .
To support and explain the stated point we have many reasons and lets review them logically .
The main point which hold the statement that in twenty years there would be lesser cars than used today would be since there is a drastic decrease in the natural fuel being used , such as peteroleum products .
To support this point the recent survey conducted by National Geographic expedition and their study shows that these natural reservers like peteroleum would last for not more than another 30 years , if the same rate of usage is continued .
This study also involves the different peteroleum products being used as fules , these include diesel , petrol , gassoline , LPG ( liqufied peteroleum gass ) and other minor fules .

We should also include the case of using natural solar power , or nuclear fuel , but at the present rate of financial investments and other government policies these donot look to spring up in the next recent years .
As for example starting up a nuclear plant in a place called Thungha in the north west part of India took five years .

So as a result of increase in the fule price and also the rate of growth of pollution caused by the burning of these petroleum products , people are highly encourached to use other modes of travel , for example using public transport , metro system , cycling for short distances .
As for example in China , employers are adoptinjg techniquies to reduce the usage of cars , like locating close to work place , using metro system for travel .

Also when we focus on the government policies being laid in recent times , we see that more encourangement is give for public transport than for purchase for cars .
As taking for example a place called Bangalore located in India , during the past five years then price for fuel has grown by more than hundred percentage , while to compensate for this issue , the government had activated more public transport , allocating industrial area next to be in one major location , where the fequency of public transport is concentrated .
This did lead to the decrease in the usage of cars in Bangalore .

Also we may raise the point of using sloar power and other modes of generating fuel for cars , like liquid fuels where water is a byproduct ( presently used to power up space flights and super sonic jets ) , also using electric cars which also need petroleum product to generate , but this demands for great amounts of revenue and also a mojor world collobration .
Also the research in these fileds donot show big progress form the past years for major car production .
So looking at these feature , this will take time and we cannot expect them to happen with in the next twenty years .
Parallely thier would also be the depletion of fuel in the world leading to minorty class of people to use cars ( those who could afford the high price of petroleum products ) .

Hence as stated and explained with examples , according to me I agree that in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there are as of today .
