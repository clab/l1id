Today the people shows very enthusiam to learn new things rather than they had experienced in the past .
Because people also changing their mind sets to the developing technology .
So that they know more things in the future and they feels that , it is a great experience and oppurtunity to them .

I strongly believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than what they know in the previous stage .
Because everybody do the common things like knowing already existed once but the successful peoples are ready to face the problems that are occuring when they are trying to know some new or advanced things .
They are facing so many problems but it gives an experience and good result whether it is right or wrong .
Supose if they achieve positive results in that one they really get a good fame and an ideal pesonality to others , who are interested do like this in the future .

Suppose for example , one of my friend he is really good career from his childhood onwards .
At the age of five , he really do not know about the computer operation and working .
Larter he faces so many problems to learn about that one because his parents are not educated , not having enough money to learn .
But at last he totally learned about that one by working as a part time job in one of the computer instituion .
Finally , that learning is so useful now .
Today he is working as a software engineer in one of the famous company and having a good name .
He is very interested to learn new things till now .
Its bacame a hobby today to his .

So finally I conclude that people taking risks while they try to know new things but those are very minute behind their success in the future .
even though there is no success in learning new things they got a valuable experience .
Hence successfull people try new things ant takes risks rather than what they already know .
