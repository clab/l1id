I strongly agree with the statement , as i personally experiance the feeling .
In life we need to enjoy every part , though it is related to money , adventure , drama etc .
Elders are always frightened as they always think of future than present .
But youngsters are dam bothered about future .

For an example when i am in schooling i need to go for a tour but my parents are very scared to send me , but finally they sent me with more cautions .
After comming back , they have seen my video of my bangee jump in tour and started scoldind me though i safely came back .
They are always more coutious in life and they never try for any adventure .
I feel adventure is also part of enjoyment .

Spending money is economy for elders but for youngers money doesnt matter for enjoyment .
when i started earning , i started spending for my own expenditure like resturants , outing with friends , enjoying weekends , but my parents dont like this as they want me to save money for my future .
I feel that we need to enjoy when we have oppurtunity , as time never comes back .
We can earn money through out our life .

Youngsters like dressing in modern way as per there comfort whereas elders feel that young ones needs to maintain their tradition but i feel dressing in modern is not means that we are loosing our tradition .

Finally i conclude that thinking of all these elders are loosing all enjoyments whereas young people are enjoying more than them .
