I believe that there would be fewer cars in use in the next twenty years , than they are today .
I would like to present various points to support my position which are as listed below .

Firstly , if we examine the number of cars which have been in use in the past few years in the whole world , we would notice that the number has increased .
Many reasons can be ascribed to this increase .
One of the reasons is that car has become a common commodity and a thing easier to possess as its cost has decreased over the past few years .
This price decrease might be due to various factors prominent of which would be the competition among automobile industries .
This led to an increase in the number of cars owned and being used .
This increase has drastically influenced the environment in the wrong way .
It led to serious environmental problems .

Now-a-days , air pollution is one of the major problems being faced by many cities and countries in the world .
The increase in air pollution is mainly attributed to vehicular emissions apart from industrial emissions and other sources .
Amongst the vehicular emissions , the emissions due to cars are the major contributors to the air pollution .
Hence , every country is now looking for options to reduce air pollution and that one effective way would be to lay emission norms and increase the taxes on vehicles which would then place restrictions on the usage of the cars .
Hence the number of cars might decrease .

Moreover , the congestion on the roads has increased due to increase in the number of cars which resulted in traffic jams .
This is making the life of the car users difficult .
Hence , they might opt for otherways of transport such as the Public Transport System .

The governments are also working out in improving the Public Transport system like the use of Metro railways and buses for public transport .
This is exactly what is being done in NewDelhi ( India ) right now which is the place where I am staying and this has worked out here and resulted in a decrease in the number of the cars being used compared to the last year .
After introducing Delhi Metro over here the number of cars in use on roads have decreased .

One more point I would like to suggest to support my position is that increase in scarcity of fossil fuels and hence the hikes in fuel prices might also be responsible for the possible decrease in the number of cars in the next twenty years .

Hence , in sum , I would like to reassert my position after stating the above points that there might be fewer cars in use in the next twenty years than they are today .
