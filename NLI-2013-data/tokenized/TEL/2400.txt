I dont agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than old '' .
In the fast moving era everything in the universe is at constant change .
Everyone wants to learn more and more inorder to compete with the computer generation .
If person has good job skills he or she is considered as intellegent .
Other wise they are beeing considered as mere pippets .
So i feel older generation is enjoying more than young people .

While i was in college i almost spent most of my week ends doing some assignments or preparing for presentations .
My grand-father used to ask me to go with him for live conserts .
which takes place in the other end of our street .
But i never used to go .
Because i have to work hard inorder to get good grades .
He used to talk about those shows for many days .
He truely enjoyed those times .

If one wants to enjoy he needs money .
He has to think about many things , if he is the only one who is earning in the house .
He has to devide his salary to house hold expenses , children education and also to pay taxes .
But when he gets old most of the expences will be eliminated .
Like children education and taxes .
So this is the time they will see some money in their hand .
So they try to enjoy it for their own life .

Not only that lately many young people are suffering from lot of stress because of work load .
Even if they get vacation they are not able enjoy that time because of stress .
Which inturn leads to many more health problems like high blood pressure or diabetis in their early ages .
But elderly are far away from all this work related stress as they are nolonger working .
Whoever have no tensions in life they enjoy the most .
In my guess thet are old people .

according to me elderly people in our comminity are enjoying the most than young generation .
They get sufficient to go to clubs or entertainment centers to pass their time which is not possible for youngsters .
