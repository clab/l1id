learning begins at home , even a small thing that happens in our daily neighbhourhood affects the student 's learnin capabilities .
Will just understanding these ideas or concepts help the student ?
or will he have to learn the facts ?

well , the answer lies in the question itself , its impossible for one to learn the ideas and concepts without learning the facts about them .

for example when someone is asked not to do something , he wants to know , why is that particular task prohibited ? , and when he is explained `` why he was asked not to do so '' , he will tend to ignore them , than abide by them or he would try them and then learn either through the punishments or through the factual behind it , perhaps that would help him to analise the situation throughly and then he would act wiser the next time .

So , it of more important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts or learn the facts ?

My answer would be `` both '' , the student should get the oppurtunity to learn about it from the teacher as well as learn it by doing tasks practically , and if the issue is about things that cannot be done practicaly then he should try and find out some materials or facts about the particular issue , and then he should be allowed to prioritise and analise the facts and draw a conclusion , rather than just letting himself beleive the doubtful concepts .
He should make a note and then consult the teacher or professor and get more details about it , This idea not only gives the student abundant satisfaction but it also helps the student generate keen intrest in the topic because he is constantly looking for the right answer and almost aware of the whole concept , while he never struggled a lot emphasizing himself to learn it .
