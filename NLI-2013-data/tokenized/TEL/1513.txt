I partly agree and disagree with the statement .
I agree with it because , a student need to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
And i disagree with the statement because all the students may not be having same intrest in all the academic subjects .

A student who has broad knowledge in the academic subjects can perform well in the furture studies .
It is neccesary that upto certain education period a student must have good knowledge in academics because in that way a he/she can learn more number of subjects ..
and find his own interested subjects that are essential for human day to day life .

And the disadvantages of making cumpulsory study of the academic subjects are listed as follows , in the first case all the students may not cope up with the number of subjects in a short period .
some of them may be intrested only in a particular subject , .
because of this a student may find an alternative for studying all the academic subjects and he may also quit from the education field .
And while studying these academic subjects he will surely undergo some strain ..
because of which there will be lot of health problems .
so , i disagree with the statement I conclude saying that it is no doubt essential to have a broad knowledge on academic subjects but that should be restricted to certain education period .
i.e untill a student can decide where his intrest lies .
Also specialization in a particular subject may not be useful in all the cases .
I think both are necessary for a good academic profile .
untill graduation he/she must need to have an broad knowledge on academic subjects and later in their post graduation he/she can specialize in the subject they are intrested in ..
