I completely disagree with the fact that automobiles , especially cars , are going to degrade in number in the next couple of decades .
With the increase in present day technology and the rapid life these days , cars have become of the most essential part of one 's life .

To start with , as the years are passing by , the standards of living of the people has changed dramatically , to be more precise , there has been an increasing hike in people 's way of life .
Modern generation people are beginning to prefer cars to any other automobile , like for instance , bikes , motorcycles , etc .
The reason for this may be due to the overwhelming social economic uplifts , or due to the increasing temperatures day after day .
Travelling on motorcycles and bikes can be tough after 20 years from now with the mercury rising year after year .
Some people , for example industrialists , consider possession of a prized car as a form of pride and honour of their status .

Not to mention the technology that has been increasing rapidly , which inturn proves to be more useful to the automobile industry by encouraging the makers of these cars to evaluate their cars more and more , and their never ending attempts to satisfy their customers can also be named as one of the reasons .
In a recent survey conducted by the Reader 's Digest magazine , it has been stated that the sales of various car companies , for example Hyundai , Toyota , Ford , etc. , have been soaring sky high from the past two decades or so .
There have also been cases of almost 200 % increase in the sales of automobiles in a considerably short span of time .

In the earlier days , possessing a car was actually a dream for the people .
But now , it has almost become accessible to everyone which ultimately decreases its chances of subsiding in numbers .
Taking the next couple of decades into consideration , automobiles , especially cars , can be expected to have an important role in the social as well as economical life of a person , in whatever form possible .

Neverthless , as far as i 'm concerned , i can rate minimum scope for the decline expectation of cars from the world , as per the reasons stated above .
In short , `` Life without Cars ca n't be imagined in the present day ! ''
