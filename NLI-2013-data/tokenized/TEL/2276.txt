The topic is about `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
I agree with the statement for the following reasons .
The younger poeple will enjoy in their age as they have more strength and enthusiasm than the old people .
The old people feel that there life is over and they had nothing to do .

As the life is begining for them , they do not have problems as the old people have they will enjoy themselves by spending time with friends , family , and playing sports in their leisure time .
They do n't have any body to care at that time .
They enjoy a lot during classtime also by cracking jokes on professors .
They have more fun by going to parties with friends .
As they are energetic and interested in many things they will enjoy by doing things what they want .
They will not feel about the future , they always think about the present .
They will enjoy the life of young age by doing mischeivous things as they are not matured as old people .
They dont care about other people .

As the life is almost over for old age people they always think about the past and as they did not have much energy they ca n't enjoy what the young people enjoy .
The old people always thought about there family and theur hard ships rather than their enjoyment .
As there is saying `` once the age gone it will not regain back '' , once the young age is over it will not come , so we have to enjoy at that period .
Some old people think that they had n't have enjoyment in their young age , so one should have enjoyment in their young age as the age goes on we cannot retain our enjoyment .
As the time is not regained we have to enjoy at the right time .

So I conclude that the younger people enjoy life more than old people .
My view is that we have to enjoy when there is ability to enjoy , it doesnot come back when the time is over and we lost lot in life .
