In the near future there would be an increase in the usage of cars because the prices of the cars are going down rapidly .
Advanced technology has resulted in lesser production costs and efficient manufacturing techniques .
This will make cars more affordable in the future .

In the modern society time is considered more valuable than anything and theres a growing emphasis on better time management .
Hence the general public might prefer private transport to the public transport because they can save more time travelling by cars to their work places , colleges and so on , rather than waiting for buses or commuter trains .
This can contribute to a considerable growth in the usage of cars .

Since there is a lot of research being done to develop alternatives for petroleum , there is a possibility that some day a fuel might be developed which is more efficient and environmental friendly than the conventional fuels being used today .
This might bring about a change in the pollution norms which have restricted the usage of cars to a limit and might enable the usage of cars extensively .

A car has always been a symbol of luxury and status in developing countries .
In the recent years many developing nations have registered a rise in the purchasing parity of the individuals living in that country .
This factor led to the increase in the purchase of cars in such countries .
Moreover new marketsing strategies and governments policies will lead to a decline in the car prices in such countries which will make them more affordable than it was in the past .

Because of all these possible reasons i disagree with the statement that in twenty years from now , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
