Yes , i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
For example , a product say a shampoo or some beauty product is advertised in an extra-ordinary manner with a beautiful woman , a serene background , a great and pompous music and captivating puchlines and narration .
But , in reality i dont think the product would be so great .
It would be like any other beauty product that we may be using with slight differences in colour , odour and ofcourse , the price .
Most companies advertise their products in this manner because , they have to compete with other companies which manufacture similar products .
Each manufacturing company wants to be ahead of all of its counterparts .
So , each company tries to advertise its product in a unique manner so that conmsumers are attracted towards its products .
They advertising procedure is unique but the products will be some what similar .
This is because , a product manufactured to meet a particular requirement has more or less the same ingredients .
For example , basic ingredients of a cold cream will always be the same .
So , each manufacturer has to use the same basic ingredients to manufature the cold cream .
The things which can be different are the colour and odour of the cold cream , its packing style etc .
Other reasons for such pompous advertisements could be to lure the consumers to buy more and more of their products .
If advertising is done in a grand way by involving a popular personality or a celebrity then that would attract more attention and will help in the increasing the sales of the product .
For example , if a product is endorsed by a hollywood star , then many of his/her fans and admirers would buy the product out of their adulation towards the star .
So , advertising is done in a very grand and pompous manner using various marketing techniques in order to increase the sale of a product , though the product may not be as great as it would be shown in the advertiment .
This is done to increase the sales of the product so that it brings in profits to its manufacturing company .
