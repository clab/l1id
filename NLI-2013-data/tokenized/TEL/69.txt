I agree with the point that `` better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than going for a specialization in one specific subject '' .
I support this point because we can learn many applications by having many subjects in academic .

The main reason is by learning more subjects we can interpret them and can apply the knowledge one through another .
For example if we have to work on a project like developing a machine .
we have to about the strength it will withstand , to know this we have to work for stresses that apply on the parts of the machine .
But it is difficult to find manually , because first designing the machine the load that with stand on the machine , etc .
Now days that we have simulation softwares that can work by producing a model in that .
For this we need a computer knowledge and how to work on the software .
And then how to design the model , loads , etc .
For all these we need different subjects like , for working with computer we have to computer knowledge , for working to design we need to know the drawing , for finding the loads we have to the mechanis of material , then to solve we need mathematics , and then for assembling we have to learn how to assemble the part .
By seeming all these for one thing we have to work on for different subjects .
We need to apply all the skills in on project .

After learning basics in all subjects then we can go for a specialized one because we work for a perticular model .

So i prefer to have knowledge of many academic subjects in order to have a specislized subject , because if we know all the subjects we need not go for some other specialists we can apply all those .
