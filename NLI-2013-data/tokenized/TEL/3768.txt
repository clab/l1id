Every human being in thecommunity have some responsible towards to the community .
They cannot only enjoys the things as community provides them .
But also they can give enough time to spend on help to their communities .

Morenumber of engineering students produced during year by year .
they can began to create new invention .
the young per son invent the the computer .
But the other young who learn thorough this subject introduce a internet .
we can get more information through this internet .
we can not specially mention those things .
More more and advancrements these thing we can get every thing as eazarly as possible , but the cost constriant is also there .

Dotors find out new methods of surgery things .
If a person seriously injured in accident , or fire work , or some other diseases , he can completly recovered in few days , not like unlike inold endayas .
Young people are learned the new things , thechanges that are occur in the surrounded world .
they want help peeople .

Not only in educational field , they enter into the agricultural fields also .
they ininvent new genetic trees , to produce more fruits to us .
Thus we can meet the need of the people .
tThey goes to the rural areas when they get free time .
they spend time with rural people to educating them .

young ones enter into the spacce reseach also .
Through which we can get the information related our country not only iours but other countrys problemms are also solved .
Example tsunami is occur in chennai in india in past year , it create lot of destuction incity .

But again tsunami come we can find out the reasons , areas these tsunmai gets exposed to .
throughspaceresearch .
Earthquakes , weather report can be given by space research people .
and there are more developements are made inthis .
field .
we step inthe moon .
TO get more usefull information to us .

That s why i disagree with the sttement as young people donot give enough time to helping their community .
