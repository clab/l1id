Yes , i agree that young people enjoy more than older people .
Young age means the teenage where most of the people spoil their life rather moulding it into a good future .
They study till the secondary school but as soon as they enter into their college life they enjoy rather concentrate on their studies .
He is not aware of the future experiences and problems he would face .

Young people enjoy in their teenage keeping studies aside .
Most of the people in their young age are not aware of the future .
They just waste time in enjoying and partying .
so that they cannot became a successful person in these society .
He cannot reach his goal .
Every person has their on goal but we have to fulfill .
By enjoying we waste half of our life and suffer half of the life .
Their is no use of recognition after the teenage is passed .

They think that they have grown up and can handle their decisions on their own .
they think that they know what is right and what is wrong .
They go on for parties without the permission of parents and return late nights .
They smoke , they drink and commits lots of mistakes .
They break the parents reputations .
But the same person when he comes to old age he shall think of the past what he have done .
He stops all the enjoyments and concentrate on the works and settlement .
He thinks as a mature person .

Young people are not matured and cannot take decisions on their own .
They live in a world of fantasy , passionate and fashionable .
He wanders on the streets and creates havoc to the public .
Most of the young people who thinks in a better way get settles in life but those are still on roads .
so everything is in our hands , we should have to change our life according to ur wish .
