Yes i agree with the concept to discuss about that it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Because by understanding the idea only a student can make desitions currectly .
By understanding the concepts he or she can judge easily and can get through it .
Most of the students understand the idea such that they can do the things better and get grip on that particular idea and also he can learn more things about the idea he learnt .

For an example a student preparing fo his exams coming over in few days , to get rid of that he must read properly that he must not forget that he prepared for the exams , so he must understand the concept of that particular subject that there is no need for mugging up or there is no chance for forgetting the concept he had prepared for the exam .

Understanding the idea and concepts the student can learn the facts .
For example listerning the lecture in the professers class there we need more concentration in the class , such that the student must understand the concept and perform well in the exam or in the seminar etc .

By understanding the ideas and concepts he can perform them very perfectly .

The ideas like in the software field we must learn and understand the concepts to perform well in our interviews , and also in the running project .
There is the only way that to learn the concept and implement it where ever it is use ful in our lifes .

As mentioned above example that the many students mug up the conceptes and fail in the exams so there is the only solution for this is to understand the concept and inplement the faces .

Most of the students will face the problem the reason is that they will not understan the problem and make them get into troubles , so this is mainly applicable for the students .

Understanding the ideas and concepts not even for the students but also every one can get benefited by this concept i.e understanding ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
