I partially agree with the statement that either understanding the ideas and concepts is importent or to learn the facts .
Because every thing in our life cant be understand through the ideas and concepts that which it neede more creative mind .

firstly when we talk about the ideas and concepts these some times easy to understan but some times very typical to understan .
And this also depends on the type of the mind that the student has .
and understanding ideas and concepts also depends on the way how we have brought in our life .
because if a student is restricted to certain things in his childhood then he cant have a creative mind .
and if there is every thing understood through the ideas then there will be more number of scientists than the normal persons on the earth .

And the other thing we have to talk about is learn facts that is learning through the experiences .
and every thing cant be experienced because if we think wearing helmet can implemented after facing any problen then its just like taking chance in our life .
and every thin cant be learned through the facts becayse every thing cant be a fact in our life .
because it is difficult to get every thing as a fact .
and if we wait for a fact to be happened in our life then our life will be completing just for learning and not for implementing those which we have learned .

And the importent thing is understandind ideas and concepts gives the sharpness to our mind as we go on understanding them but there are some concepts which cant be understan through ideas but we can undertand them through the facts , thus there is the need of facts .
and learning things through the facts is a good thing that which improves our practical knowledge .
but every thing cant be a fact so it is good to learn them from the ideas and concepts .
and the reproduction of the plantsa and animalas can be well understan through the facts .
