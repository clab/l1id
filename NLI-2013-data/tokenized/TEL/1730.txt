Although its an ambitious and challeging motive to have a broad knowledge about many academic subjects , I would rather prefer to have knowledge about one perticular subject .
There are few reasons for which i feel this way .
Firstly , a knowledge all subjects means a lot of information and plenty of hardwork and time for gaining the information .
As a result of this complex interactions of the above factors , most of time adequate knowledge of any of the subjects is not aquired .
As a result of this a person becomes a Jack of all Trades but master of none .

Secondly , lots of sujects mean lot of hardwork , and there would be too little time for personal life , which means he will have less time for making new friends , watching movies and partying .
After all education is only one part of the curricilum , there are many other activities to be done to make an all round personality .
As a result of this his social life might be affected , and he will fit into the classic old saying , All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy !!

Finally , at the end of his education period if he feels that there is no looking back for him , since he has aquired all the knowledge , he is then dumped again .
Once in professional life , people prefer those who are specialists in a perticular subject rather than those who have only a moderate knowlege of it .
For example a person with high blood pressure and respiratory difficulties would go to a Cardiologist , than to go to a General Physician or a family doctor .
He will feel that he would get a more precise treatment under a cardiologist 's help .

In conclusion , eventhough just think to aquire all the knowledge in the world sounds good , it is practical to have complete knowledge about one aspect .
