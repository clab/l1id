The issue given at the hand is the usage of cars in the coming years .
This issue is difficult as I have to present the various thoughts in this regard .
I think that the usage of cars in the next 20 years is going to increase for the reasons that I am going to mention now .

The first reason that I think that people would use more cars because the people in the developing countries are more focused on their travelling modes and are concerned about the comfort that using a personal vehicle can have .
This is suggested by the fact that the number to car manufacturers are growing world - wide and that the customers are regularly offered cars a relatively low prices to encourage their sales .
Even new designs have appeared and people are mad after the latest model car available in the market .

Secondly , owing a car is considered as a symbol of prestige and is no longer restricted to high - income earning people .
Any person who owns a two wheeler would dream to buy a car in near future and considering the population of average earning group world wide this claearly indicates that their wil be an increase in the usage of cars .
This is human nature to long for more sophisticated things and car is just one of them .
Even the point that the entire family can travel comfortably in one car cannot be ruled out .

Thirdly , even if the traffic problem is considered , many developing countries are now building fly-overs , bridges and other architectural constructions keeping in mind the increase in the traffic in near future .
Considering the design features many cars are now designed to be smaller so that they can fit in the most crowded road very easily .
Even the parking problem is solved using magnificient structures that allow many vehicles to be parked at a single place which is usually underground .
So even the government is expecting the increase in the use of four wheeler .

Fourth reason that can be given is the development of new technology that ensures reduction in the fuel required , even the use of CNG can be considered which guarantees no pollution , increase in the performance of the vehicle and hence overall contributon to reducing the environmental pollution , which is usually bought in these cases , contribute to the increase in the number of car owners .

For all the reasons-peoples attitude , traffic problem which can be solved , car manufacturer new designs and efforts in reducing the environmental pollution - I have mentioned above I think that the number of car owners are going to increase in the next twenty years .
