Yes I undoubtedly agree with the statement that it is more important and recomendable for a student to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

I support the statement because through real time experiences I inferred that most of the people who learn facts as they are instead of taking the real meaning behind it are mostly vulnerable to take it for a wrong purpose .

The facts we learn in our early stages of life help us throughout our life .
We build ourselves and our characters upon the concrete pillars of what we infer .
so , it is essential for us to understand the facts instead of learning them .
As the later may lead to serious consequences and wrong character building .

For example , lets get into the daily life .
We learn in physics that according to newtons third law of motion every action has an equal and opposite reaction .
This is a broad concept that could be applied in many cases of our real life .
Lets consider the rockets on which we applied it to reach limits of our atmosphere and also further .
But , when you consider it in case of a simple daily case of a pressure coocker .
The steam builds up when it is heated inside it and if you happen to open the lid without allowing the inner pressure to escape my removing the counter weight there is a high danger that the high pressurised steam may come bursting on to the one who opens it causing seroius burns .
This was a case I say , that shocked me and after consulting my physics lecturer I came to know the reason behind it .

Had the person known the concept of the laws of pressure and the newtons third law of motion he would n't have done the mistake which sent him to hospital for more than a month .
This severe could be the consequences of not knowing things for what they are meant .
