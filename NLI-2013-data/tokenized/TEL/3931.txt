According to the question `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' I agree to the fact in the question .
I feel that this issue is not in a specific country or community but its almost in the entire world of humans .
Life compared to the past has changed a lot today .
The generations today have a busy life of their own and may have forgotten their responsibilities of giving a helping hand to their community .

In todays life the young people are busy with their jobs , own family , kids and are trying to give better comforts , good education and a luxirous living to their children .
Talking about jobs or a busy profession there is so much competition among the co-workers to update themselves and go to better positions through promotions .
In certain situations the young people forget the sacrifices their parents did for them , in bringing them up to a good position by giving them good education and providing all the nessicities they required in their childhood .

There are a lot of old age homes comming up every where all over the world for the older community .
The strong reason behind this is the older community is being neglected by the young ones .

There are other reasons too in a developing country like India where the population is very high and there is a lot of unemployment , in such situations the youngsters have nothing to do for themselves and are helpless in their own situation and cannot do anything for their own community or older community .

Financial burden is one factor that everyone faces today and the greed for a better position and a greed for more money make the younger generation selfish at times .
So according to me the younger generation do not concentrate in helping their communities either the older or younger communities .
