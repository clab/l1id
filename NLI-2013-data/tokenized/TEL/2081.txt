I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .
This is like this .
Lot of youngr people are very enthusiastic about their young life to explore the new things so as to enjoy up to the maximum extent where as the older people who have experinced almost all the things in their life tend to relax in their older ages .

Now , young people who are new to the world with new intentions like to spend their time in enjoying the life as much as possible like doing many things , such as going to the theaters to watch films and pubs every weekends to have fun , can play a lot of games together and even participate in high level tournaments , can have sex , can enjoy their university life as a student and many .
Many of these things can also be enjoyed by the older people even but they are bored of doing them as they did a lot in their young life .

Playing sports must need a lot of strength and energy which older people lack .
Having a lot of parties with friends in young life is the other important thing to be considered which the older people may find it difficult to do as often as young people do and they also think that thay are a waste of money .
To some extent even older people who are still interested will enjoy attending the parties and pubs .

One more important thing is the student life , which will not be repeated again .
Students enjoy a lot in the universities in many aspects such as sports , research and even in some other co-curricular activities .
Older people cannot definately do that again , but can enjoy as a professor which is quite different from the student life .
Students can experience the newer generatiions of life that has been changing gradually and they increase their expectations that suits the newer generations .

As the younger people having more expectations on life and more resources than the older people had , I can strongly conclude that young people will definately enjoy more than the older people do .
