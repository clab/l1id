Science , for that matter any other field of study , have been broadly classified in to many subjects .
Its important for everone to have a basic knowledge of all these subjects but I think its better to specialize in one specific subject .

Concentrating on a wide range of subjects creates a lot of problems .
Firstly , the individual may not be able to find ample time to devote to each subject .
Secondly , the reader may retain far less than what is required because the details of the mix of all subjects might be really confusing .

We always find that people who make their decisions early and act promptly and concentrate in a particular area of interest turn out to be high performers or high end achievers contributing a lot towards the development of society .
Dr. A.P.J
Abdul Kalam , The President of India can be quoted as a very relevant example in this context .
Dr. Kalam identified very early that his interest lies in the area of space science and technology and started working on it from his senior seondary school itself .
We all know that he had always been a towering figure in the evolution of Indian space programme ever since he joined the Indian Space Research Organization .
He can be a real role model to the young students .

I do feel that an exposure to all the subjects is essential for a student to make the right choice .
It also gives him the confidence to tackle new situations and to effectively put forward a new idea before the general public .
But ultimately one should try to become a specialist in any field of his interest .
In this society I feel one should be a specialist in the field he or she is working to make the other people listen their voice .
It also generates a sense of belief among them over the things he or she is telling them .
I feel its always better to be a master in one field rather than a jack of all .
