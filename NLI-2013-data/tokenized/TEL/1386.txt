I agree with the author 's statement .
Since ` Knowledge is power ' says a proverb .
So , in today 's competitive world it is better to have broader knowledge of all academic subjects .
if we have broad idea of lot of subjects , then the chances of oppurtunites increases .

If aperson is attended for an interview for a post who is having good subject in various fields will be obviosly selected rather than a person who is specialized in only one field , more over the person with diverse skills will face the interview with confidence .

The person with broad knowledge will not essential requires any type of training .
But the person knows only one specific subject most probably he must be trained and guided under other matured people in that area .

If the person with broader view of subject can easily follow the new trends in the market rather than a person with a little knowledge .
Although , a person with specialized knowledge in one area can perform very well in his field but he always abondon from tasks which consists other than his subject knowledge .

A person knows only a specific subjet fails to perform well if the boom for that field decreases drastically or it is in slum .
But there is no such type of problens arises for the person who is good at myriad fields .

Hence I conclude that a person with broad subject knowledge will always flourish in his field .
