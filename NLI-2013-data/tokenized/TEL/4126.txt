I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
The statement is true .

Young people nowadays are very busy with their schedules .
They do not have time to involve in the activities that help their communities .
For example , my brother who is working as a software engineer is busy with his job working late nights on tasks assigned to him .
So he doesn'thave that much time to engage himself for helping his community .

The young people nowadays are lacking the sense of helping .
Many people are thinking about what they get in return after helping their communities .
For example , I met a young minister in our locality .
He was very reluctant to help the community people because he thinks that he does n't get anything in return from them and its a meagre waste of granting funds to them .

Although some young people are getting enough time to help others they are simply wasting their time .
For example , my cousin who is a teacher , after returning from the school , simply wastes the remaining time just by idling or watching T.V .
The current generations , particularly students are engrossed in their studies and sports rather than making an effort to help others .
Some people are wasting their money by spending it on waste activities such as drinking , smoking etc .
If they spend this money on helping their community it will be very useful for the people .

some young people are in the mad race for acquiring lands .
If they donate these lands to the homeless in the community , atleast they can build houses and provide shelter for themselves .

Finally I conclude that helping his own community is the most essential function of young people .
They should spare time for helping .
