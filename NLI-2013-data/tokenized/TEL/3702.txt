I donot agree with the statement that `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
I support my statement with the following reasoning .
It is true that the life syle of man has changed drastically over a period of time and man has to compete against time to go on .
But there are many social organisations that mainly comprise of young people who work for a good cause .
For example , the blood bank in my city has more than 1000 young people as its members .
They organise blood donation camps often in the city and also provide it for free of cost .
One more interesting fact about this is that most of the members are the young software professionals and doctors who inspite of their busy working hours take out time for charity .

Another example I would like to quote here is the HIV-AIDS awareness programme being conducted in the villages where the people are ignorant about the disease .
This programme is organised and conducted by a group of young medical students of which I also form a part .
We stage plays explaining the spread of the disease , its dangerous effects and the preventive measures .
We do all this in the weekends and we are able to bring out a considerable change in half of a village .

Also , there are many Indians settled abroad .
These nonresident young professionals formed into a group and carrying so many remarkable projects in their home land through proper organisation channels .
This offers a best example of the concern of the young people towards their community .

I personally feel that the main constraint to today 's young generation is the time but not the lack of interest to help their community .
there may be a little lack of awareness in them and which requires proper stimulation .

So , with all the reasonings stated above I support my view that today 's young people are not reluctant to help their soceity .
Afterall , today 's young generation implies the future of tommorrow .
