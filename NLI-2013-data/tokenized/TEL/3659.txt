I agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .

This is seriously observed in urbanised communities than in rural comunities .
The possible reason why young people nowadays spend less time in helping their communites could be their tight and hectic schedules .
The education system these days is really challenging the students .
It is not that easy to get through such a process of education because of the severe competition among the young students .
The students cannot afford to leave the education system responsibilites for the sake of community requirements .
if they dont concentrate much on their education they will have to regret at the poor grades they score and the poor performance they had given .
This would affect their future .
They would n't get enough or suitable employment opportunites .
Usually , a student with good educational qualifications get enough opportunities to lead their professional life satisfactorily .

The other possible reason could be the change of mindset of the students these days .
The present day students lack the quality of helping nature .
This could have been resulted from the severe competition from their counterparts .
So , students have turned selfish .
They dont show concern for the development of the fellow-student because of the fear that they might overtake .
For example , in a university there are limited number of seats .
Obviously all those who are aware of the fact keep it confidantial and do not show concern for others because of the fear that the university seats get exhausted .
A similar kind of attitude is more seriously observed among the employees of a company .
An employee is reluctant towards his co-employee or he doe n't show any concern to help him because of the fear that the opther person might overtake .
The reason for this kind of behaviour among the people is the lack of enough number of opportunities .

So , for all these reasons , the pesent day students neither concentrate much on community affairs nor contribute for the community welfare .
