I agree with the statement with `` young people enjoy there life more than older people do '' .
When life is like a game and we ever dont know that will happen any time with our game .
So i think it was best place to enjoy the life at some good young stage .
Enjoying the life can be of many forms .
But it should be make some attention in the career growth too .
For example a young kid can enjoy his profession which intern makes sucess for this career .

Enjoying the life with some carrer oriented allways a good option .
I enjoy my current profession Software Engineer very much and i likes to keep every thing honest without any misleads .
This is the way i feel myself happy .
There are many examples like the people enjoy there work and becoming very great people .
Small example i can give is Google websearch creators , they enjoyed there profession very much and started developing a very great product this intern leaded to the employment to many people aroung the world .
Young people enjoy there life and also should set some examples what is the proper meaning of the `` enjoying the life '' .
This is not only releated to the area of science this can be releated to the areas of music , arts , soical etc .

Youngsters are backbone of any country development and growth .
But the enjoying the life should not turn in bad habbits example like Drugs , sex etc .
Seting example to the others is allways are great feeling for any young kid .
There are many greater stories happening in the recent time about many young kids how do they enjoy the life and sets examples .

Finally i feel we has to enjoy the life with fun and passion and face the problems straight and set examples to the others
