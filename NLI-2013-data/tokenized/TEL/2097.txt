In general public there is a preconcieved notion that once people become older they are free from all problems , and responsibilities hence they enjoy their life very much but i do not agree with this idea because , i believe that the older one becomes the responsibilities and problems they need to deal with increases .
For instance take one example of a successful person having irresponsible children .
when he was young he only had to look after his carrer which was successful so he does not bother about other things and can actually enjoy his success , where as once he becomes older he should not only look after himself , infact he has to look after his irresponsible child .
so he has another responsibility and as well as a problem to mend his child ways , so he will not be able to enjoy his life once he becomes older .

another example is that the older people allways have a fear in thier minds that they will die soon or later which would definitely hamper them from enjoying thier life .
another thing is that older people dont have physical strength .
they can not concentrate on a particular thing .

younger people can actually enjoy their life if they organise their life properly because they dont have any responsibilities .
even if they have any responsibilities or problems they have the strength to deal with these .
which comes by virtue of their age .
