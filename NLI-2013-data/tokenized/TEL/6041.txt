The statement says to predict the future after twenty years about the position of the cars .
As per my veiw and my perceptoin are concerned and I would like contradict thestatement and I guess that there would be a increase in the number of cars than at present .
I would like to give the following veiws in order to support the issue and they are as follows

Firstly the peope are grewing richer and richer than are today and all the rich people feel it is a prestige to own a car and and it not a matter for them to own and maintain a car .
In the metropolitan cities it has became a common source of travel .
Journey by cars are more comfort than the public means of transportation for local needs .

Secondly I would like to emphasize on the incresase in the technological advances , there are many a cars coming and some of them are a cheap which encourages even a normal person to own a car .

Thirdly the same increase in the tchnologocal inventions lead to search for alternate fuel sources which are ecofriendly and cheaper than present day fuel such as the gas and electric cars which operate on battery source are also gaining importance as they donot pollute the environiment .

We must consider a reason for decrease in the number of cars which may be by imposing a ban on the cars , but the government will not impose because the automobile industry would collapse many factories tend to close leading to unemployment and financial crisis may also occur leading to a disturbensce in the economy .
Some people may also loose their there lively hood like the cabdrivers and so the government will not impose the ban .

statisticaly , it was also said that an increase in the number of cars from the past years was tremendrous and the growth will continue till after twenty years indicating the rapid increase in the number of cars .

In a nut shell I want to conclude that with all the above stated factors there might not be a decrease in the number of cars in the coming twenty years .
