Well , enjoying life does n't really depend upon how old we are , provided , one is interested in giving time for oneself and one 's joys .

In most of the cases , yes , it 's true that young people enjoy life better than most of the old people do .

One of the reasons why this happens is that , young people generally do n't have much of responsibilities as old people do .
A school-going or a college-going girl has only one major responsibility in life .
Thats is to study .
Apart from that , she has no tensions and worries , usually .
Whereas , old people have a lot of responsibilities .
Older people generally get busy with work and responsibilties concerned with work apart from the responsibities at home .
Elder people get to manage the family economically also .
They need to take care of every family member and their necessities .

Another important factor that refrains old people from enjoying their lives , going out and partying kind of stuff , is expense involved in these .
It would n't be a big problem for a 20 year old guy to spend $ 20 or $ 30 for a movie or spend more in a restaurant or a party .
But , old people , as they take the responsibilty of the whole family , do n't generally prefer to spend so much on a so-called `` luxury '' but will want to spend that money on some useful item for the house so that everyone is benefitted by their expense .

Another factor is enthusiasm .
Old people , usually , are n't as energetic as young people are and so they ca n't spend much time spending much energy in anything .
Whereas youth are full of energy and spend more time having fun and enjoying than old people do .

To conclude , there should be balance in anyone 's life .
People , irrespective of age or financial status should spend some time having fun and enjoying life than spending most of their lives dedicated to work .
