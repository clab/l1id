I agree that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars than there are today .
Owing to the over-crowding of roads and highways and lack of enough parking spaces in large-cities and the global warming effects due to the fuel-missions , authorities concerned in advanced countries around the world would plan on taking of a lot of cars off the road or atleast reduce their numbers as such .

Cars consume too much fuel , fuel in the form of Kerosense , Petrol , Diesel .
And their natural resouces like the crude-oil reserves are fast depleting .
So , the number of cars are more likely to be decreased in a few years down the lane in order to cut down the fuel consumption .

Countries/Nations would invest in building rail road infrastructure and build a wider and larger sophisticated network of railroads for inter-city and intra-city connections .
This will happen in 20 years from now .
Rail roads provide very efficient public transportation and this option naturally replaces cars .

Public transportation like fuel efficient buses , trams will increase so as to serve the society 's transportation needs and hence people are less likely to be inclined to fancy themselves with a new car .

Bicycles , tri-cycles offer a very eco-friendly alternative as a personal mode of transportation for travelling lesser distances .
Traffic problems due to too many cars on the highways is viewed very cautiously by the Dept of Transportation in many cities .
So , the only solution to cut down the traffic during peak times is to discourage people to buy cards and encourage public transportation like bus , trams , commuter-trains .

Air-travel will increase and there will be airports at most smaller towns and cities and this enable people to reach their destinations faster .
Airline network will be increased with better connections and better flights to serve the passengers needs in twenty years from now .

Scientists have already spoken a lot about the deleterious effects of Global warming which is caused due to the dangerous fuel emissions from the cars .
So , to check this , Governments will plan , strategise and draft a plan to find global solutions to this problem .
This will result in fewer cars in 20 years from now .

Cars may however remain a main mode of personal/family transportation now , but in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use which would result in a better enviroment across the globe and the world will be a lot cleaner and healthier .
