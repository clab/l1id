The topic `` young people do not give enough time to help their communities '' is a very controversial one .
On one hand it seems to be true relating to the other activities of young people .
But on the other hand it proposes a negation considering many communities where young people itself are the key workers .
i would go by the direction that young people do n't have enough time helping the communities .

Firstly , a young mind wants to enjoy and spend his teenage with pleasure so that he can cherish his memories when he is old .
Infact he goes by the policy that life is short and enjoy it to the maximum .
For example consider a young boy who is more intersted in playing rather than helping his community .

Secondly , I feel that young minds are already being stressed under a process named studying .
He has homework and other activities called exams , papers for which he has to spend enough amount of time to improve his career and also his nation as children are the future building blocks of every country .

Further he can improve on his field and can also put undivided attention on his studies turning out to be a great scientist or professionalist .
If he devotes time for helping communities , his precious time will be lost as time and tide wait for none .
He cannot achieve his aim or goal set for himself .

Another point which supports my arguement is young children do not do not have enough interest to help and support the community .
The young children nowadays are more interested in enjoying going to night clubs , watching films and other activities which are hinderence in helping their communities as interest or desire drives a person rather than duities .

From the above points , I would conclude saying that young children have many other activities and interests rather than helping their communities .
