I would strongly agree that successful people do try new things and also take risks rather than sticking to what they already know and continuing work on it .
A good example to support my opinion is NASA .
The scientists and Engineers over there dare to take risks and they also know how to achieve their goals .
Insipte of the Columbia space shuttle crashes they were not dissappointed and did not stop their work .
They are well aware that they are risking their lifes but still continuing their work and are succeeding in their works that they were involved in .
I think their motto would be dare to dream and make it happen .
I think life is about trying and experiencing new things and taking risks , otherwise we would not be in so advanced state .
As an another example I would like to describe the effects of Nuclear Science .
I would like to appreciate the works done by technologists and other gies for handling the nuclear reactors and stations as they are not only used for making nuclear bombs but are also used for power generation and India is perfect example .
As an another example I would like to appreciate the work done by our defense forces such as Army , Navy , Airforce and also police forces .

They are adopting to new technologies and trying out so many new things making diffrent strategies in order to help the nation from terrorists and other extremists .
We should not forget that they are risking their lifes in order to do all such things .
In conclusion I would like to say that try and try until you succeed .
In order for the Nation and the whole world to develop people should try out new things .
And if there is no risk there is no gain .
