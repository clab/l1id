There are several viewpoints on , `` is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one '' .
Both views have their own individual pros and cons .
There are so many aspects to consider .
Let me explain some aspects in the following passage .

First consider , Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
By knowing all these subjects we have alot of advantages .
We can have a good future , good knowledge on all subjects ...
etc .
By knowing all subjects we can have a future in any field .
We can have alot of choices to earn money .
You never feel any difficulty in life regarding subject knowledge .
For example , Let me tell you about my profession .
I am a architectural student .
If i learn Autocad , Photosho - p , 3Dmax ..
etc .
With these i can have more future options .
Thus i can earn alot of money in different fields .
These have some problems .
I prefer advantages should always be greater than disadvantages

Second let me explain about knowledge in one specific subject .
This can help in someways .
We can have good future , money in that subject .
Even one can become researcher , who helps society in alot of ways .
From that way one can earn money .
For example , Let me tell you about my profession .
If i have indepth knowledge in designing and construction of buildings , I can settle down as a ARCHITECT and i can create magics .
The main problem is if i do n't get a chance to proove myself , i ca n't earn money .
If we consider the other side of the statement , it is having so many problems thereby we cannot have much knowledge about everything , we have to fix in one field .

I am inclined to support both positions because both have their own views .
However , I Suggested more towards having knowledge in many academic than in onme specific one .
so , I agree in parts with the statement .
