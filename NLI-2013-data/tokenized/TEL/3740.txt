I hardly remember any incident when some young elder member of my community has offered to help me in any way .
The growing globalisation and ever-increasing competetion sees to it that evryone becomes self-celtred and works for one 's own gain , thus significantly reducing any chances of social service or social commitment .
I totally agree that the youth today are not sparing sufficient time helping their communities .
Increasing competition , decline in the moral and ethical standards , uncontrollable desires , advancement of technology have been depriving today 's youth to even think about helping their communities .

If we check out any field , be it academic or non-academic , we see that there is an increasing competetion .
So , to survive in the world of competetion and to retain his place in this very tough world , the young man of today is driven to focus on his career aspects and to continuously spend huge amounts of time bettering his prospects for a better future .

Moreover , we constantly see a continual decline in the moral and ethical standards in any community .
And the people who are more into degraded morals and ethics are the youth .
This degradation of moral values leaves them so hollow that they can hardly think about their communities , let alone helping them .
This moral degradation can be seen quite predominantly in any part of the world today .

Someone rightly said `` Man is driven by desire '' .
The `` Desires '' of today 's youth have become so intense and so uncontrollable that they can hardly resist these desires , and moreover they are being driven by the not-so-good desires .
Desire to advance positively is always conducive to one 's personality , but desiring for `` illegitimate '' things has been having a lethal effect on the individuals personality .
So , this deprives him of the need to think about others in the community and even help them .

With newer and newer technologies arriving in this world , the youth are engaging themselves in taking pleasure in these technologies .
For example , with newer and newer video games in the markets , the youth are driven to purchase them and spend most of their time playing video games .
This culture of playing video games is stealing away so much time that the individual hardly realises it .
Moreover , this particular activity is eating up most of the available free time so that an individual can hardly think about helping his community .

So , keeping all these factors in mind , I totally concur with the statement that today 's youth is not giving adequate time helping their communities .
