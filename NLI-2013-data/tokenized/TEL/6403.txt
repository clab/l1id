The issue at hand is will there be more cars in near future i.e another twenty years than there are today .
the given issue is important because it is questioning about a probable revolution in automobile industry .
i dont agree with the topic .
There are several rerasons i would like to cite and explain on my stand .

with the advent and advancement of technology man has been able to expand his horizons in every possible direction and in vast number of fields .
but the main underlying point regarding the advancements is only to comfort himself as much as possible .
the invention of automobile has actually happened like a miracle .
but owning an automobile was a dream to bourgeois and the laborclass people then .
today , we can find a car or other automobile in every household .
the number of cars all over the globe today is some several thousands of times to what it was four decades ago and the number is likely to increase much higher as the cost of buying a car is decreasing day by day .
so , i think that my option of increase in the number of cars in another twenty years is better than the other .

also , it is a human tendency that owning a car or another four wheeler is a matter of prestige .
so , everybody aims to own a car and that too at an earlier stage of their careers .
though , the cost of gas and fuel is goin up drastically , most of the people are watching out for even a small incentive in their jobs so that they can buy a new car .
so , it is highly unlikely that the number of cars will decrease in the future .

additionally , it is also possible that a car may run on water rather than gas in the near future .
alot of research and experimentation has already been going on studying the property of auto mechanics in this aspect .
if this happens , then the automobile industry would bask in the glory of success and flourish in the fragrance of wealth .
this situation no matter what will never let down the number of cars in the future .

Finally , the people are also thinking about the long distances they have to travel everyday and the hectic schedules they have everyday .
commuting by car , is what makes them totally independent in travelling to large distances as per their wish .
moreover , a car also provides the comfort of goin on long drives with family members or with friends and serves the purpose of sharing longterm memories .

ultimately , i think thatmy option of the increase in number of cars is likely to happen in the near future .
