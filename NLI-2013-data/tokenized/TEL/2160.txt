`` Old is gold '' goes a famous quote .
I disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Young people are always busy with something or the other , like completing assignments , heading for meetings etc etc .
Where as the older people , they completed every thing and now relaxed .
For them there are no assignments to be finished or meetings to be attended .

For example lets consider a young man and an old man .
We will consider some of their daily routine .
Young man needs to wake up early like 5.00am in the morning go for a gym or jog to maintain his body .
He should again rush to his home as he must get ready to attend his office or university .
Its a tight schedule .
Where as an old man , he can wake up whenever he wants , can go for a walk whenever he wants and can return leisurely .
So who is enjoying life ?
old man .

Now we will consider and old woman and a young woman .
Young woman. , she must also wake up early to go for a jog or a walk to remain fit and return to home quickly as she must go for an university or office , ofcourse there is an exception for housewives but if the housewives have children then again she is responsible for the child 's upbringing .
On the other hand the older woman can wake up whenever she wants and do whatever she wants as she has lot of time with her .
Some woman enjoy cooking so the old woman can try new dishes or she can write peoms do whatever she wants .
So i strongly feel that older people enjoy life more than younger people .
Younger people are always associated with more responsibilities than older people , building up their career etc etc .
