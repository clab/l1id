The future of the country lies on the shoulders of youth .
It is the responsibility of the present generation to lead the country to the path of the prosperity .
I disagree with the statement that youth do not spend enough time in community service .

Many successful community programs in the city where I live are associated with the active participation of youth .
Take the example of the cleanliness drive that was undertaken in my city to get rid of the rubbish accumulated on the beach .
Students and young working professionals showed up in large numbers and worked eagerly in the activity .
Not only that some people even went to the extent of putting up sign boards to educate the people about the hazards of polluting the beach .

It cannot be said that youth do not participate in the community programs due to lack of time .
One of the reasons could be lack of proper advertising of program .
Last year the local program in my city to protect the turtles during the breeding recieved minimal response as hardly anyone knew about it , including me .
However , this the local corporation officals gave widespread publicity about the program and a large number of people signed up for it ( it included me ) .
The response was tremendous and there were actually more number of people than required .

Youth also need notset apart a specific period of time for community activites .
They can incorporate them in their daily activities , like dropping the neighbours child at school on their way to college , bring the neighbours groceries while they do their own shopping or take out their garbage along with their own or in a number of other ways that can be done parallely along with their own activities .

So , the notion that young people today donot allot enough time for community activities can be ruled out .
