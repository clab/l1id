I dissagree with the statement that `` there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
Now in present generation the need of a car is more essential for each and every individual .
The car has become an essential body to transportation .
so the increasing demand among the public will lead to manifacturing the number off cars .

AS the population grows we need more cars , for transportation .
Because the public transportation in the country has failed , people need more cars for transportation , safely and in aproper time .
we can also go in cars where ever we like to go , what ever time to reach .

For example , my father uses a car to go to hospital .
So as my mother uses to go to office .
so for different reasons we use cars , if there is need for the car how can the number off cars could decrease in the next twenty years .

Cars now adays are used by many people to save the time , to go to job and the other places .
Cars are use full togo along with the family to a picknic .
Cars are the main public transportation in the united states , as the public transportation has failed to transport the public .

Therefore the number of cars are not going to decrease in the next twenty years .
They are going to become the double the number off cars present today on the roads .
so the government has to regulate new laws to regulate the pollution that the cars are going ti produse .
