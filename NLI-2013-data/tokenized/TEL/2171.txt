The standard of Living has been changing over the years .
Due to all the Modernisation and Technology people tend to enjoy a lot these days .
I believe that now a days younger people are enjoying more than the older people .
Because in the era of lot of inventions and sophisticated technologies younger people are having a great time .
Many ways of entertainment came into existence like Amusement parks and Shopping Malls where younger people are getting very much attracted while the old people are not willing to get into these parties because they prefer home .
On the other hand younger people want to enjoy themselves like having dialy parties , going to picnic and have a drink .

I think that there is considerable amount of change in enjoying these days rather than few years ago .
Younger people are becoming more successful in their careers which implies that they are searching for new ways of enjoyment and having fun .
While old people dont have eagerness to go for daily parties and picnics and they prefer a calm and peaceful life where there is not much pollution and traffic .

Younger people are very much eager to do something different and they want to have fun all the time .
There are various ways in which the younger people enjoy like , taking part in sport activites that consists of Car racing , Water sports and many other games .
By participating in them they enjoy very much which releases all the burden and all the stress of thier work .
While in the case osf older people they prefer to be at home sleeping in their bed eating their own meals .
While younger people prefer eating outside with their friends having fun all the time .
Moreover younger people want to drive away the boredom and they dont want to spend their weekends in their home rather they are finding new ways of enjoyment like going to movies , arranging special parties in costliest hotels while older people always prefer their home .
And when there is an instance of any success in their job the younger people want to share their success with all the friends and they spend lavishly for the party .

In my opinion i think that younger people are having a good time rather than the older people .
