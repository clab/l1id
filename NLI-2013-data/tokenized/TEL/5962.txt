In this modern world people are more concerned about their travel to different location .
So , people should make their transport .
Eveyone are busy in this world so one has to make their own transport to reach their detinations .
This can be done by owning a car .

I diagree withe the statement that there will be fewer use of cars .
This can be stated by following reasons .

When destination is too long we need to take car to go on .
we cannot travel all time in buses or trains .
Furthermore , we need to take bus passes or bus tickets when ever we would go htrough buses .
This would become messup to purchase evryday ticket .

Let us consider an example , if any peson is ill in our family i.e in critical condition we need to take him to hospital quickly .
This can be done by having a car in our homes .
If we have car in our homes we acn quickly take him to hospital .
We cannot take him in any other means of transport .
This would take his life .

Cars are neccessary in modern world .
If going to any place in car automatically it reflects our status .
So , one would like to travel in car throughout his life .
We cant travel every day in buses which are overcrowded or which may or may not come in proper timing , which may cause delay by stopping at every bustop .
Evenmore , if we need to go to different street we where the bus is not provided then we must walk .
If we have car we can directly goto the particular place where we decide to go .

In twenty years there may be any kind of tansport may introduced but this cannot take to the destination which we want .
If fuel prices go high then we can use electric cars which are recently introduced .
In this way we can reduce our economy .
We can be safe from traffic and pollution if we go by cars .
We wont be effected much like when we travel through other means of transport .
So there there would be heavy use of cars even after twenty years .

Therefore , car use will not become fewer at any time be it in twenty years , after twenty years or thiry years .
