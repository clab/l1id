The topic given to me is that broad knowledge is better than on the knowledge of a specific subject .
I dont agree with the following statement because broad knowledge cannot help us always .
It is necessary to have a specialised knowledge over a particular subject .

By having broad knowledge over many academic subjects cannot fetch you in getting a job .
This is because the companies want students who were specalised in a particular task for their work .
Moreover he cannot be confident in any of his subjects and face many problems .

If we are specalised in a particular subject we can do research in that particular subject and can improve our knowledge .
By doing so we can reach great heights in our career .
For example if we consider the President of India , he is a great scientist who used to work at ISRO got great fame because of his sucess in the field he has choosen .
We must take him as inspiration and must try to develop in our future .

If we try to have knowledge on all subjects than its just like standing on two Boats and definetly we have to face many problems in the future .
Though he is talented he cannot reach great heights in his career .
He may also face the problem of earning money as he cannot get a good job that bears his expenses .

For example if I am interested in both science and social it is better to concentrate on only one subjects than the two .
This is because if he studies both he cannot be a knowledged persons in any of the subjects and and he will come to the stage of confusion to choose which subject for his higher studies .
I finally say that it is better to be a leader in one field than to be a member in many fields .

So finally I feel that it is better to specalize in one subject due to the reasons given above .
moreover by doing so we can be the most knowledable and experienced person in a particular field .
