Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
I do agree with the given statement absolutely .
It is the inclination for taking up things that are different from the conventional ways and means of doing things , that set the successful people apart from their plebian fellow beings .
For e.g. had it not been for the Wright Brothers , we would not have known the face of the Aeroplane today .
It is their determination to do something different that made it possible .
They dared to take the plane into the air ...
up and up ...
and their reputation soared even higher .

Successful people tend to take the less trodden path and achieve success at the end of it .
It speaks of their determination and perseverance .
Take for instance , Thomas Alva Edison ..
the inventor of electric bulb .
He failed many a times before he could succeed .
The failures didnt deter him , instead they motivated him to try still harder .

Complacence is not a virtue of successful people .
They try to improve on the things further .
If the invention has stopped with the bicycle , imagine how would the world have been today .
If people are content with what they have , then their is no progress in life .
Some people , people with vision and passion , take upon them the task of doing new things and take risks instead of going along with the routine , and they are the people who stand apart from the commons and become exemplary .
