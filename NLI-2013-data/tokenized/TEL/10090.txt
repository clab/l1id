In my point fo view the successful people try new things risks rather then only doing what they already know .
So meny people like successfull men 's or women 's there are will at studes and jobs there are coming from good background at studers and envornment .
They think about what .
why , how and so and so question .

The people like Will at studes and think in different way the people the learn new thinks .
They want to learn think 's for usefull so they want to learn new think 's taking risk rather current .

For example take take on Software proffeson .
For example he is working Java technology .
He is good at java and successfull working on java , But in that some new things are add to the Java Technology for example Swings , hiber net .
It is uses full for the next Project .
So that person learn that things taking the risk rather tan the doing what they alresdy .

Successful people try new things for developing thre future .
For Second example we take music payers they work at some instruments only , But they want learn the new things in the music .

Thay tearn the things taking the high risk then the doing things .
I thing that the person is successed that is He or She taking the risk on that what they do and doing things .
So many Successful people Successed By taking the risk and interst in thar pariclar takes .

So meny Risk and hard work give the so much result to the humen 's .
We agree with the statement .
