I agree .

In this rapidly changing world with higher degree of sophisticated benefits , comforts , luxuries and entertainment , young people are not sufficiently motivated to lend a helping hand to the community in which they live in .

The changing dynamics of world in terms of pace , the benefits money can bring , young people are getting attracted to them and started pursuing money earning habits or past time activities from a younger age not witnessed earlier .

Right from schooling a ` comprasion attitude ' in terms of quality or higher rank is commendable , yet it becomes deplorable when it is described or implanted in the younger minds as a trigger to money earning activity .
Such an impression in the early stage lasts long and effectively works in the minds of younger generation in pursuit of that goal .

Another stage that younger prople fall prey to this attitude is when they are deprived of certain minimum comforts their peers are enjoying .
This may make them parasites and kill or supress their natural concern or feeling for others .

The wide variety of entertainment available now a days keeps away from helping the community , rather spend as per their wish to derive some pleasure .
Though nothing wrong in spending for one 's own entertainment or comfort or benefit or luxury , being a part of society contributing to the society is like paying back to the parents .

The attitude of paying back and concern for others also gives pleasure and creates a healthy atmosphere .
This type of metamorphosis can be brought out by collective effort and higher degree of introspection .

It becomes the bounden duty of the parents and teachers to explain the moral and social values of the system and ensure that such qulaities get inculcated gradually in younger generation .

By explaining and making them understandable about the pleasures of sharing and helping the needy , younger generation can be made more responsible and acquire these divine qualities .
