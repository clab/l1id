I do not agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to helping their communities .
In todays fast going society , where time is money and every one is over acheiving , there is little time which a young person can devote to the commnunity .
But with in this small amount of time which is available , todays youth is contributing much in terms of quality of help as well as quantity

There are numerous ways in which this can be shown .
90 percent of the young men and women whom you meet today are having hearty ambitions and very defined carrer goals .
Most young women today aspire to be dynamic executives rather than being just a home maker Mom .
These healthy ambitions in them selves are a great contribution to human society , making the society progressive and dynamic .
The vitality of society brings about the much nourishment which is required for the charity organizations .
A goal driven youth is much more likely to be a benefactor to a poor child or a good social worker , as part of service which is required for obtaining a place in prestigious educational institutes .
Today 's aspring youth are tomorrow 's benefactors of society for a given certainity , as they drive the economy in full speed

Another example of youth contribution to society is evident in increased entreprenuership , in sectors of environment protection , waste recycling and alternative energy production , by young entreprenuers through out the world

A teenager who earns pocket money or money for tution fee through baby sitting or service in a old age home is an excellent example of a young person who is serving the society as well as his or her own needs .
A student who organizes a student body or writes a web log to help other students from his nation to study internationally and earn prestigious honors is an excellent example of a young person , trying to develop his fellow students .

In a place like India , where government can not provide adequate social security , recently I read of 2 young sisters , who have organized a rehabilitation center for mentally retarded or dsiturbed women who roam in streets , with out nobody to take care of them .
I personally know some of my young friends who sponsor poor children annually , almost anonymously

I would like to conclude that todays youth is responsible , goal driven and service oriented .
They are giving back to their communities and are role models for coming generations
