The world today is exploding with the techonlogical advancements made .
The major factor which has completely transformed the face of the world were is the advancement in the transportation industry .

The automobile industry plays a vital role in the current world where the people are able to travel more in a very less time .
What took some days of travel in the olden days now only takes a few hours and what took few hours earlier now inly take few minutes .
All Thanks to the automobile industry which has wiped off the distances .

The automobile industry has grown rapidly in the past century .
One of the bacis ways of transport is the buses , Vans , and not to mention the cars .
Earlier in the early twentieth century cars were more of a status symbol .
There were not many people who owned a car .
In the later part of the century they cars have come to the comfort level .
But in the current day Cars are for more than comfort but they have become a necessecity .
As such we see that there are more noumber of cars on the streets than earlier .

The major factors which has raised the usability of cars is that there are more number of providers and people have a lot of options to choose in every budget range .
The people have become more busier than ever and so they want their personal means of transport to save their time and cars offer them this .
Also there are more number of service centers avaliable all acroos the country which is why we are seeing an increase the people who wants to go for cars .
Alll these reasons Can increase the number of cars in the future .

But there a downside to this .
We all know that torun these cars we need fuel and the natural fuel resources are getting depleted day by day .
The world oil organization has already warned that the current resouurces are not going to last long .
Taking this call few nations have already taken actions in this direction .
Like looking for other alternative like bicycles which do not require any fuel .
Some nations have enforced a law that one day in a week a car should not be used .
Already the usage of cars is so high that the people are stuck up in traffic jams for hours which is really frustrating .

The oil prices are rising day by day and the common man is not in a position to pay more and so these days people are looking for other options like pooling in with your friends or neighbours who can pick and drop you Thus sharing the load on your pocket .

Considering all these situation i guess that the number of cars should decrease in the future and thus lets make the world a healthier place to live .
