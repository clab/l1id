Whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialize in one specific subject depends on the range and variety of academic subjects .
In my opinion , to be a specialist in one subject would prove to be more advantageous than to be competent in various fields .

The main reason for my view is that to specialize in one subject would mean that the person becomes a pioneer in that field .
He would be qualified to make contributions to his chosen field .
For example , when a person specializes in Civil Engineering , he would become a qualified person to speak on the topic and to offer his services to the public .
To major in one subject would mean that the person would be empowered to forsee changes and paradigm shifts , that could be for the better or worse , in the field .
If for the worse , he would be in a position to make a positice difference .

Another reason for my view is that , a fully qualified professional would be able to engage himself in high-end research thereby enabling him to make technological advances .
Some may say that to be a competent speaker on varied topics would enable a person to have a farther reach and bigger sphere of influence .
Yet , it has to be acknowledged that a man who is a specialist in a field will be able to make a stronger influence on those around him .
Others might cite that to specialize in one field would be to limit a person 's perspective .
However , a specialist in a field would not only have a good perspective but also a vision .
This vision would enable him to achieve an envisioned goal .

Specifically , it has to be stated that to set and achieve goals , a person would have to be a specialist in the field .
For instance , only a qualified electronics engineer would be able to improve the satellite communication techniques and not a newspaper editor , who would be competent to speak on varied subjects .
Admittedly , if the person wishes to enter another field to enhance his knowledge , his oppurtunities would be limited considering his poor prior knowledge .
But the upside is that there is rarely a dearth in demand for specialists in a field .
To be a pioneer in his chosen field would enable the person to mentor budding people and to guide others and hence contributing back to the people .

In conclusion , to specialize in one subject would be more benefical , not only to the person but also to the community .
I would agree that having varied interests is beneficial but on balance , this should be supported by a mastery in one subject .
