I agree with the statement that ` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . '
The present situation of the man demands his time and full energy wherein he is busy all the day with hectic schedules of his work .
As the saying , ` Man is a social animal ' depicts that , today 's man lives in the society , for the society and with the society .
So he wants to just go along with other people to grab for the oppurtunities for his betterment of needs and betterment of his future .
If he do not do this for himself , he will definitely lag behind and keep on waiting for the chances to go along with the society .

With all these tensions in the mind , today 's man is unable to give time helping his communities .
Let us take my example only , I am a doctor by my profession and i was an athelete when i was in my college days .
I use to play cricket at national level .
That time i had a thought in my mind that i should pick up some beautiful players and train them perfectly and send them for national and international games .
I started with collecting the members of various colleges and i made a real strong group of cricket team .
But later when i was busy with my hectic schedules , i could n't concentrate much on my particular small community and i left them alone which posed a remarkable effect on my mind .

There are many communities like physically handicapped and oldage people , where the young generation should really look into and try to spend some time helping them out .
They can spend little time for them and little money which would make them mentally relaxed and feel well that there is someone who is caring about them .

I finally conclude by saying that `` what goes around will come around '' .
When you do something good for the betterment of the society , that will definitely help you out atleast in later stages of your life .
