I 'd agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are many reasons for this but none more than technology and the internet .

In today 's hi tech world , everything you want is available at the click of a button and the young people of the world are at the core of this Internet revolution .
Although the internet allows you to master domains never heard of before , it also makes you forget your immediate neighbourhood and your community .
And thats the downside to this revolution .

Lets take shopping for groceries for instance .
Shopping at the nearest store used to be a great place to meet people from your community .
Friendships were formed while shopping for fruits and vegetables .
But now with everything available at the tip of your fingers , the neccessity to go out has reduced greatly .

Going to movies with people was another great way to meeting and knowing people living in the community .
But now even movies can be seen in the luxury of our homes .

As a result of these changes , the need to go out has reduced a great deal , thus cutting young people away from the community and its people .
Young people nowadays hardly know who their neighbours are .
Because of this scarce social contact with the community , they do not feel the need or the urge to go out and help the community .
Even if they do , it 's more because of an external pressure rather than a real desire to do something for the community .

This trend can be reversed only if people go out and meet both the young and the old in the community and interact with them .
Some time has to be set aside for community help .
That way , young people will feel part of the community .
The urge will come naturally once they feel part of the group .
This will help both the community and the young people in the long run .
