I disgree with the given statement because i think it depends on individual and not on the time available .
A person who really wants to help his community can surely take out time for the same whereas a person who is not that interested will use his time for other purpose rather than serving his community .

No doubt that in the present generation the competition has increased and inorder to lead a resonablly good life people we really need to work hard .
So in running after making penny people are overlooking the need for sparing time for working for the community .
But still its not true that people dont give enough timefor community .
For example , recently mumbai encountered a bomblast where thousands of people were injured .
Then immediately people reacted and started helping the government in moving the injured people to the hospitals and geting their treatment done .
A group of students took shifts for whole night and served the injured with bread and tea .
I think this showsw the concern left in people .

Donating money for development of poor people is also one way of serving the comunity .
Because of the vast destruction of psunami many people were left with starving stomachs .
In many colleges people collected money food , clothes and gave it to the government for sending them to the required places .
Serving community not only means that you have to take fixed amount of time separately for it .
I think helping the people where ever you find them is also serving .
For exapmle , when we are on the way to office and come across a blind person struggling to cross the road helping him will also serve the purpose .

In short for serving community we need not be the active participants .
Seeing the people reaction in such cases like psunami and the bomb blasts i think young spirits are still burning .
