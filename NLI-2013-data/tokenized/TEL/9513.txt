Before going to the topic it is necessary to define the terms ideas , concepts and facts .
Ideas on the first hand are the basis for innovation .
Without idea there will not be any advancement in the curren technology frontiers .
A good idea may change the way of our life .
On the other hand concept is what we develop from the idea .
Simply speaking concept is the paper work for an idea .
This theoritcal statement will gude the application of the idea .
Coming to the factswhick unlike ideas and concepts will mostly reveal what actually happens in a phenomina .

I do agree with the question for several reasons .
One reason is without a proper base or idea how come a student learn a subject or what will be there to reveal .
So it is required for a student to learn both the ideas and concepts .
For example let us suppose there is a mistireous entity or a phenomina that is unknown like the `` dark matter '' in the outer space .
As no information is available about it or even its existence is doubted then it is necessary to assume several properties even without knowing proper facts .
This is possible by devoloping a solid concept over the entity that will eventually give rise to ideas about the entity and its behaviour .
For instance let us assume that there is no information available about the dark matter .
Then what facts can be revealed about it without any phenomina stating its existence .
Only the concept changes when the original facts are revealed .

So it is highly necessary to learn ideas and concepts before Knowing their facts .
And the concepts which arise from ideas help in moulding our future .
`` Ideas are what we are living and ideas are what we are made of ...
and ideas are bullet proof '' .
