Here the topic is about whether to have broad knowledge in many academics subjects is better or in one specific subject is better .
I agree with the concept of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better .

Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better because now a days world is growing in every aspect , whether it is technology or science etc .
I dont think specialization in one specific subject is enough to enjoy this growth .
For example every present engineer other than computer science students also should have atleast some knowledge about the computer even though it is not present in their syllabus in the university , as it is necessary for lot of needs like applying jobs on line and also for the communication purpose etc .

At the same time knowledge in many academic subjects gives you a wide variety of knowledge and you will be having lot of chances to go through and also for the jobs .
Now a days people with konwledge in many academic subjects are given importance for the job compared to those who have specialization in one specific subject .
Those people having specialization in one subject will have less chances and oppertunities to get job compared to others .

knowledge in many subjects will also give some refreshmet to the mind as we go through different aspects of the world .
some times our personal intersent will change , at that moment having knowledge in different academic subjects will help you to set your mind easily for your new interest .
But having intersent in one subject you cant detract youself to another subject if you get bored in the present subject .
For example i was interested in the mathematic during my school age but afterward i found that politics is suitable for me when compared to mathematic .
I just changed my opinion and went through politics in my Post graduation , as i am having knowledge in many subjects , i was able to set my mind easily .
But my friends in the mathematics post graduation are saying that it is boring , while studying mathematics but they cant change it as they are not having knowledge in many academic subjects .

In my view , for this fast changing world having broad knowledge in many academic subjects is better .
