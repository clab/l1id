To a large extent i agree that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide .
Especially if you are visiting a new country or place where there could be a language problem then having a tour guide is very desirable .
I would like to recount an experience i had when my parents and i had gone to australia on a vacation .

Australia is a very beautiful country and i 'm fortunate to have visited .
We went with a group of twenty people from different locations .
All of us started off from a common meeting point .
The advantages are that all our flight and hotel reservations were booked in advance so we did not have to bother about getting flight and hotel reservations .
The tour guide is trained and are well equipped to solve any problems that arise in course of the journey .
All local transport was arranged for in advance so getting from point to point is not a problem .
An itenary of the places of interest that we would be visiting on a particular day is handed out so we know where we are going and what we are going to see .
The disadvantages are that we have to follow a fixed itenary and cannot see or visit places not written in the itenary .
The other thing is that different people have different tastes , some like visiting museums and places of historical interest while others like amusement parks .
Irrespective of our likes or dislikes , we have to be together with the group .
Since we visit as tourists , we donot get to see how day to day life is .
Finally there is a possibility of not being able to get along with some of the group members .
We have to be tolarant towards everyone in the group .

I personally feel that the advantages of having a tour guide out weight the disadvantages .
These choices are usually dependent on temperment ( s ) of individuals , people who are adventerous may prefer to plan vacations on their own while others may choose a path thats tried and tested .
