I feel that in twenty yeras number of cars used will be much more than the ones that are being used today .
There are several reasons that i can think of to support this view such as : increase in population , more dependence on alternate fuels , competitve pricing by the car manufactures .
The populatin of the world has been increasing in exponential proportions over the past few decades and i do not think this trend would change much in the next two decades .
With the increase in population the number of people using personal vehichels would also increase and thus this would increase the number of cars purchsed and used .

Even though the increase in the comertial fuel prices might deter the people from using cars , of late we have seen a concious effort made by the govetnments in varios countries to use natural fuels like bio-diesel which would mean that thefuprice will be taken care of .
Even the electric vechicles woul serve this purpose .

With the increasing globalisation the car manufactures would be competing with each others to sell their cars and this might result in competitive pricing .
Competive pricing will lower the car sales and thus encourage the people to buy the cars .
The increasing number of car fianancer woul enhance the sales .

With most of the govrnments laying emphasis on infrastructue development , the new roads and flyovers would help reduce the traffic congestion to a large extent .
Moreover this world is becoming so materialistic that i guess we would have to see a major calamity resulting due to the damages caused by the pollution berfore the governments would place mre stringent laws in order to retrict the number of car sales .

Even if laws are passed to limit the sales of cars it would take a long time before the state could provide adequate public transport serve the entire population .
Hence because of the above reasons i feel the number of cars would only increase over coming few decades .
