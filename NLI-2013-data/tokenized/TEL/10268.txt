Step by step , little by little and bit by bit that is the way for success .
Success is how high you bounce when you hit the bottom .
I agree with the statement that ` successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well ' .

To buttress my point of view , at first , the important tool that one should possess to meet success in one 's life is positive thinking .
For instance consider Dr.Flemming who discovered pencillin or consider Dr.Barnardshaw who performed first open heart transplantation .
Its their positive thinking that made them to turn impossible things to possible things .

Secondly , to become successful its necessary to learn from the past experiment with current and hope for the best .
For example consider Abraham Lincon who lost sixteen times in elections .
Do n't we say him as a successful man in our history ?
In short faluire is the stepping stone to success .

Thirdly , every person must remember about four C 's in life : confidence , commitment , courage and constacy to climb the ladder of success .
One will face obstacles and hurdles while fighting in the battle to reach the goal called success one must take things challengingly unlike the coward man who jumps into the vortex of troubles and tries to end the life there .

Fourthly , success is never ending .
One should not relax after achieving a goal rather they must put their constant efforts in achieving much better things in life .
The success based on pure luck gives temporary happiness .
HARDWORK IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS .

In the view of above menitioned manifold reasons i agree that to become successful in one 's life one should be bold and must accept and overcome the risks .
