Aactual facts are more realistic than fact and concepts , i totally disagree that is it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts though they will be helpful to a certain extent , but facts are different , having an idea to achieve certain objectives and setting a goal to achieve is a good thought , but in its way of reaching the objective you will find it difficult , so when you plan to achieve something dealt it with facts of the real life and try to reach your gaol Every idea cannot be put into practice if it is put into practice one should look into procs and cons of the results what a waste of time when you cannot take things which are facts here an example of a mountaineer who wants to climb mount everest he takes certain precautionary measures before going for a expedition like the climatic conditions , medical equipment , food and other things while climbing he faces the actual realty of how difficult it is to climb

in the case of students it holds good as well meagre having ideals you cannot real your goal as intended you should also think of the procs and cons bearing actual facts on the mind the concept to achieve a particular goal is also veryimportant a personcan acieve alot in his life by having an idea thus alot of discoveries are made based upon the ideas and concepts but once should estimate it thorougly by making into account thereal facts and the results these ideals and concepts will lead us into

it is verygood to have ideas and concepts for a student whowants to be good , honest , gentle , hardworking but in real world it is upto him whether he can follow it or not , if he can follow it is well and good for him and the society
