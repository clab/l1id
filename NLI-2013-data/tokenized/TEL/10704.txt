I do completey agree with the statement presented here .
A successful person is he/she who takes risks at almost all the times .
He is also a person who tries to try different things and venture out in to different areas .

To be a successful person once , twice or thrice you can always do what you already know how to do well or do the same things inthe same area without taking any risks , but if you need to be a suucessful person all the times , you need to take risks .
All the successful person 's like Edison , Einstein to say few have always thought on different topics and concentrated on areas where little people have ventured out .
One of the most successful person 's in the Human history is Thomas Alva Edison .
He has more than 200 patents to his credit .
He always thought differently and has taken risks too .
If he has not ventured in to different things and taken risks we would not have seen the bulb till date .
Every electronic device that work 's today is courtsey , Edison .

A person on the other hand who always does the same things and is not interested in taking risks at any time can be a brilliant person and may be a good person , but cannot always be a successful person .
Another example of the most successful person is of Albert Einstein .
He was the person who constantly had to live with Risks .
He even faced execution in his own country and had to fly away to another one to save his life .
This was one of the risks that he has taken in his life .

I always beleive in the above saying of `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
If people of this world has not taken any risks and not worked differently then today we would not enjoy the beauty of this life.i.e life with material world .
