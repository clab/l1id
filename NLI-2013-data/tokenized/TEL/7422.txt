I agree with the following statement .
because the best way to travel is in led by a tour giude is very important and ver use ful .
by travelling a tour a guide is very interesting evry one .
we can enjoy a lot of things by taking the tour guide , the tour guide is very important in the following situations .

First we can visit all places .
the travelling with a groud led is very critical .
because with out knowing the palces we can not complete our tour sucessfully .
if we take a guide a person who knows all the places where we are going to visit .
with these we can easily visit the all places which are in our tour .
so that the person knows everything in that place what we have to see .
and what are the important places are there .

Second we can save our time .
with this we can not waste our to visit all the places .
because the time is very important while travelling with a group led .
it will take a lot of time for visit to all places because of we are new to that place .
so if we take a tour guide he is very helpful to save our time .

Finally , we can save money .
in the group led beacuse if we do n't take the tour guide we will loss very money .
we spent a lot of money with out knowing anything .
because it is a group led so its become very criticle to spend much money .
most people choose to travel with group led by atpur guide .
with this every one saves their money in a proper way .

So atlast i can conclude that the the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide is very important .
if we take the tour guide the group can easily save many things stated as above .
so that 's the reason i agree with the statement .
because now a days every one want to save these things only .
these are very important .
