I do agree with the statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .

Firstly , the cause of global warming is the important point which i would like to support my view .
Elucidating about that .
We can observe the temperatures around us during the summer season .
The seasons are modifying gradually .
We ca n't expect the rain in the rainy season .
It is due to the alteration in the atmosphere cycle .
It 's happening all around India .
The main reasons are the atmosphere is getting warmed due to the green house gases that are emanating from various sources like the motor vehicles , cars , factories etc. , concentrating mainly on the cars .
They are releasing the harmful gases like carbon monoxide , carbondioxide etc. , which are detrimental to the human beings .
May be the government introduces a law that usage of cars may be prohibited and the usage of public transportation may be considered .

Secondly , the earth is running out of the renewable resources .
Even though that is not predicted , i hope that is so imminent due to the usage of the natural resources like petroleum , diesel .
Today the prices of the petrol and the diesel got hiked and they will definitely go more higher in the coming years .
From economic point of view the people may prefer other means like public transportation for reaching their destinations .
Let the petrol and the diesel supply be ceased for a month everywhere in the world for cars .
Then see how much the number of people using the cars would defintely decline .
They will definitely opt for the public transportation .
Later see the pollution of the environment .
I bet that u can definely notice a steep decline in the pollution level .
Even if any other source for driving the cars other than petrol or diesel is invented .
That too does n't last long .

Lastly , the science and the technology is developing at a rocket pace .
Nowadays you can buy everthing from your house by a single click of your computer mouse .
I hope that the entire world will be digitalized by the next twenty years .
If that happens , then definitely people dont need any cars for transportation .
So it is also a possible way that the number of the cars get reduced .
