I disagree with the statement that Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
With time the awareness of benefits that come out of helping communities are found rooted in the society .
Forming communities and giving few productive hours of schedule has become routine in most of the Young people as they realise the fact that working for the communities would develop the society which constitutes them too .

There are lots of communities formed based on different aspects like - from the profession one is into , the locality one lives , the age group , the university one is into , to the food one is inclined to .
The community formed based on the professional similarity would help them discuss what skills must to developed to have a better value in the market .
So all the young people would definately be penchant to join the community .
Similarlly , the people of a locality forming a group would help them to have their homes a better places to live in by taking up programs like clean and green which indirectly helps the enviroment to get out of deforestration and in this process of keeping the locality clean the sewage system will also be improved .
So its the entire public thats enjoying the fruits of forming a community .
Thus i think that all Young people will definately be enthusiastic to be a part of all communities which leads to their welfare inturn .

For example , when i was doing my first year of graduation there were many articles about not using plastic in any form as it leads to cancer .
But there were very few who bothered to pay attention .
And all our classmates took an initiative formed a community which was againt using plastic .
We organised road shows , disussed the disadvantages of it with the enviromental care board members and took their help a put an appeal to the governament bang the product .
Doing so , we successed to an extent in giving plastic a stop .
So i feel that its mostly the young people who are aware of the current day circumstances and form communities to find the solutions to make the society a better place to live in .
