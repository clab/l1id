I agree to the given statement .
Succesfull people try new things and take risks .
All the people could do wat they have already known , but the people who try for acheiving and observing new things were vrey greatful .

Normal people are different from scientists , who always trying to invent new things .
As i am interested in research , i prefer peole trying new things were great and they would be the succesful in their carrer .
For example : there are 2 types of jobs offered for different people .
one is related to their knowledge an the other somewhat related to brainstorm and work hard to prove it and show better results .
So many were interested in selecting 1st job , but few people who were really looking for good carreer select second job and tries why it is difficult .

Not only jobs , in practical life also people wont risk to do things they dont know .
For example i n a school , quiz show , is taking place .
Teacher asked question if the students dont know the rigth answer , no one risk to press the button and answer .
They probably think why should we take risk ?
They simply say that we dont know , and they didnt even try for the answer .
this is not hte right thing .
Some students try to answer the question and even it was wrong they should not feel antyhing wrong .
And this is the right way .
now they attempted wrong and next time they rectify their mistake and able to remember the answer correct and these students score good marks .
And these students will come up in their life brightly ans these are succesfull on their career .

so , i probably conclude my opinion by mentioning that risks should be taken by people in their lives which leads to succesfull person in their career .
what we have known is known , that we cannot do any thing .
what we dont know is considered and try to know something better and be a successful person .
