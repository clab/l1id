____________________________________________________ -
i agree with the following state ment successful people try new thing and achieve better reults when compared to the people who always thinks the same results in the people who want to achieve success they may have suffered with many problems but they didnt for get about their goals .
IN their mind their will be certain ideas they will implent the ideas on their new tasks they will definately acquire good results ( success is the next step for failure ) in their minds always new thoughts and ideas will alway roll in their mind if a person wants to succed in life he should be dedicated toward 's his work he should be optimistic , his maturity also plays a vital role in his success .

success people if aproblem has arise in their task they also know how to over come the task they will develop a character that it will not be able to distinguish by the people who think same , success people are the people who dare to do everything even though if they are failure in their task they know how to overcome from the problem they ill again try for the same task success people are the people who invent the new things they all of a sudden not became success in their life they had gone several up and down in their life , they had spent many sleepless nights they had worked for the people they lets take example telephone is invented by alaxader graham bell if the telephoen is not invented how the communication is made possible ?
with the invention of telephone we can able to talk with the people who are staying in other country 's .

success full people in their mind their have only one word which roll 's around their tounge that is `` i can do it '' this word certainly make 's the different .
that 's why they can achieve better results when compared to the normal people who think 's the same they doesnt depend on their luck they depend only on their hard work they believe in hard work .
they do the work honestly and sinciarly and achieve good results with ths i conclude this essay .
