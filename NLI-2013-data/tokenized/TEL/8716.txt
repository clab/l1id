I will agree to the statement that `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
If we learn ideas and understand concepts then we can question those ideas which would lead to new way of thinking and lead to discover new things .
If we learn facts then there is nothing much to change either you know the answer or you do not , but if you new the concept that leads to the fact then the student would use that concept to arrive at the answer .
For example if the student wanted to know the circumference of a pentagon then if the student only learned facts the he may have forgotten the equation , but if a student knew that circumference of any object was the total length of the sides then he can add the length of each side and get the answer .

The importance of education is not in knowing the capitals of all countries nor in learning the entire science book by heart but to use , what the student has learned in the school , in his every day life , to better his life , to use it when faced with a challenge and come out winning .
Learning facts may help you sometimes in your life but completely understanding the subject will always help you .

There are six basic questions to everything - when ?
where ?
why ?
how ?
what ?
which ?
If you knew the answer to only one question then the education would be incomplete , only by understanding the entire concept will the student know all the answers and the exact meaning of a subject .

lastly on a broader note , for a society to evolve and progress in culture and education we need new ideas , new concepts because if we do not develop new ideas we would still believe that Earth was flat and was the center of the universe , this way of thinking would have had a detrimental effect on humans as a whole and we would still be living like animals .
