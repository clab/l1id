I completely agree on the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing the things they are already proficient at .
There are many great scientists , politicians , poets who are considered very sucessful by our society .
If they have not tried new ideas they would not have been so popular .
For ex : If professor Einstein would not have thought of new theories in physics , we would'nt be studying the Einsteins law 's of energy today .

Great discoveries only happen when the people take chance and risk .
For ex : Columbus discovered America just by exploring new routes across the oceans .
Many inventions like the Newton 's law 's of motion were discovered very accidentally , when Newton threw a apple into the sky and observed the outcome .
Also for ex : Many live saving anti-cancer drugs would not have been in the market , if the pharmaceutical companies have not taken a chance and invested in them .

Trying new things and taking calculated risks brings in technologies .
For ex : i-pod is one good innovation of Apple .
Every person who loves music carries an i-pod .
Had the Apple industry been so apprehensive about the market of their new product without actually placing it in the market they would not have been so successful .

Taking chances and trying innovative things improves the life and brings in enthusiasm in every person 's life .
For ex : one of my friend has never tried hiking , I have encouraged her to come with me for hiking .
She started to like hiking once she started doing it .

To summarize , people should think creatively out of their shell and take risks which will improve their personality as a whole and which benefit the nation .
