yes ofcource i agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because my best friend named vamshi he used to ride the cycle by sitting at any place on the cycle with out any problem and the people around him used to appeciate his talent and he is only one who used the cycle in differend way in that surrounding area and he made some stunts in some telivision programms then after he also wants to be successful in the bike riding and he had practice with the bike with lot of risk , later on he got the tremondus name in the bike riding also .
And finally he also wanted to be successful in the car riding also finally he achieved the success of new thing and took risk rather than only doing what he already know .
he showed what his talent is and what he can do , and he proved that man can do any thing for the success whether it is risk or dangerous he will not not care any thing for success , so finally i agree with the following statement
