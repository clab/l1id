I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know .
Todays world of comfort and happiness we are enjoying is , because of the efforts of many successful people .
I can mention the following points to support of my argument .

Firstly , Each and evry person has their own success , in their own terms .
People who have urge to get a good life keepaside the things what they achieved , and try to do things what they have n't achieved .
If we take the school going children , success for them is to complete primary schooling , and after that undergraduation , and then graduation and then getting a job , then they will start thinking about the familly and their children .
Though they remember about their past at the back of mind , they will concentrate more on the future and be a sucessful person at that instance of life

Secondly , success may vary from person to person .
For me success is more like a getting a good job .
For my parents success is having abetter education for their children , eventhough it is difficult for them to invest for the studies and taking the risk .
If my parents just stop investing on my education thinking that they cannot risk it , we will not have a better future .
Each and everyperson try to be successful by trying newthings and taking risks .

Finally , each and every country have their own successful leaders and buisiness people and people of variety of fields who took the risks and invented new things .
We must be thankful for them for what we are today .
They are responsible for happiness and comfort of life that we are enjoying today , and we must put our effort and be a suceesful person rather than sticking and doing the same things .

In conclusion each and every person can be successful , if they work hard and give more better life for the future generations
