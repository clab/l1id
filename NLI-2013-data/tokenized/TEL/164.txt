In twenty years from now , the number of cars in use will be extremely high .
There is no chance for having less number of cars .
There are quite many reasons to support my statement .

The main reason for expecting a huge number of cars in mere future is by considering the past records .
The number of cars some years ago were very less .
But today its number is almost doubled .
Every process future analysis is based on a `` HYSTERISIS '' curve , which shows the probability of any issue considering the past statistics .
In the same manner we can have a histerisis curve for the usage of cars .
It depicts a huge increase of number of cars in use in future .

The other main reason is the increase in the population and their standards of living .
The standards of living of people is increasing day by day .
People are aiming high and acheiving high .
Every one is trying to reach the best position in life .
A car reflects the status of a person in the society .
So people are showing interest to own a car .
Its becoming one of their most important part of their luxury list .
So it can be expected that every middle class individual owns a car in coming twenty years .
This increases the number of cars used .

The selling price of a car is becoming immensely low these days .
Its being reachable to every middle class individual .
As the price is diminishing with time , every one is planning to own a car .
Even car industries are planning to reduce the price of the cars to increase their sales .
This is to make them reachable to each and every person .

For example , consider a television .
Television was a dream to every common man few years ago .
Its cost was around 3000 $ before .
Its demand was less at that time due to its heavy price .
But today its cost came to less than half .
Today everyone owns a television .
Same is the case with mobile telephones too .
In the same way we can say that a car becomes a part of life to almost every middle class individual .

So , by considering many reasons and facts we can say that the number of cars that will be used in coming twenty years will be absolutely high .
Almost every individual owns a car in future .
