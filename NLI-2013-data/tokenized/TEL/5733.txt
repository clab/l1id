As I am try to assess the state of the number of cars being used twenty years down the line , we can primarily look into the things that might actuallly be the core reasons , which can minimise the use of cars

The reasons I see for decrease in the number of cars is to decrease consumption of fuel as fuel is being scarce day by day , to decrease the environmental pollution , people looking for more faster means of transport , might become too expensive .

As we can see the reasons , to decrease the consumption of fuel , there is no need to curb the use of cars instead we can try and invent new mean of fuel for ignition , for instance people have already started using cooking gas as fuel , but it is agreed that it is too dangerous as a small spark can ignite the whole vehicle , so research has to be made to develop furthur .
and the ease of availability of the cooking gas is also specious , but there is definitely alternate way to produce fuel

Another reason for decrease might be that maitaining a car might become too expensive , as the number of cars increased the consumption of fuel increased too , this led to decrease in the availability of fuel or over all depletion of the fuel in the world , this will lead to increase in available fuel cost .
Not only this for maitaining a car , we need a space to park it , increasing use of this means of trasport on metropolitan cities have decreased the availability of space , sometimes getting small amout of space is much more expensive than one can visualize .

People might choose more reliable and faster means of trasport , may be some cheaper air transport .
this not completely imaginative idea , but this already put to practice to create few planes which can be used by common people , if these bcome more compact , easier and faster means of transport people might well opt for the same , but this might not be possible in just twenty years .

infact , I believe that there might be much more cars than the what we currently have , if the raise in the use of cars is considered .
if we just consider the case of developing contries like India , the raise has been significant for the past twenty years .
that can be seen from the fact that number of brands of cars that India used to have twenty years before and what it is now , and also the increase in the traffic level .

May be developed countries might have already exhausted their use of cars in all their metropolitan cities , but we still have the scope to grow in the developing countries .
another point that can be described is the fact that growing population needs increases the scope of travel , thus increases the number of mean of trasport that we use .
as population of the world is defenitely in an increasing state , there will never be decrease in the number of means of transport they use .
as Car is the significant means of trasport in this modern world , there are prone to increase too .

So , on the whole I believe that will never be fewer cars in this world than today , though
