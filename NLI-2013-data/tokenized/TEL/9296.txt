I agree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .

Basically our mind is like a fire which needs to be kindled and not a vessel to be filled up .
Ideas and concepts are the right catalyst to set our mind wondering and thinking on those topics .
Famous scientist Albert Einstein used the age old calculus to derive the theory of relativity .

Our inventions and discoveries have relations to the past .
The present technologies owes a lot of its origin to the earlier generations .
We cannot do things abstract and all of a sudden out of the blue .
It may appear to have happened that way , when we superficailly go through the matter .
A deeper study reveals the connections , which are very interesting .

Facts are simple statistics .
They are very important .
They need to be collected and kept for rational reference .
We take decisions based on facts not on ideas and concepts .
So that is the role of facts in our life , I feel .
For example , if we need to know whether a specific disease has become an epidemic and if the government needs to msuter more support and put in more efforts to curb the further spreading of the disease , we need to know the number of patients registered at the hospitals with the symptoms of that disease recently .
These are essential in leading us to make a crucial decision .
Facts can be of various types .
Some about the past which would relate to the history of the land .
Some relate to who did what etc and some good to know information .
They have their importance in the society .

A students life is very important phase in his career .
We need to choose carefully what he needs to understand to keep his inquisitiveness and mind in search of quests .
This will take us a long way in builing a society where there will be no deficieny of innovations , discoveries and inventions to acclerate us towards further growth and development .
