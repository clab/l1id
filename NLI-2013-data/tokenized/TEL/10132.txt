Some people are called successful people because they try for something that others cannot achieve so easily .
Because of these successful persons we are able to see refrigerator , micro owen , television , computer , aeroplane etc .

Successful people are unique and risques are always part of thier life .
They never mind taking risks during reaching thier goal .
For example take the case of wright brother of America who has led to the discovery of jet plane , aeroplane .
Wright brothers saw a bird flying in the air and he thought that why cannot a similar structure be made and make it fly in the air using two wings and a tail .
He went to ahill and ran from the hill to downwards by letting to fly with the modelled plane .
He had tried several times and has eventually failed .
Even there was risk to his life he never minded and his goal was to run the plane .
Atlast he finally succeded oneday .
From this one can learn successful people try new things and take risks .

We can also take the case of Newton who was responsible to find the gravity of motion of earth .
He was once sitting down an apple tree and he was seeing up towards the sky .
While he was seeing towards the sky an apple has eventually had fallen on his head .
He was surprised by seeing the apple that had fallen on his head and he thought that why does the apple does not go up towards the sky and why is it falling downwards .
This typical thinking lead him to the finding of gravitational motion of earth .
He was also responsible for finding the three Newtons law of motion .

From the above examples we can conclude that successful people always try new things and those things make these people unique from others .
Without risk we cannot do any thing great and we all people should do something new and find something new and contribute something to world .
