Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I do not completely agree with the above statement because advertisements have both advantages and disadvantages .

Firstly , i will discuss about the advantages with quite a few examples .
What exactly a person looks for while buying a product ?
may be the price , quality or some other factor .
More clearly , we can say that he or she is not sure in certain situations .
Finally , they make a decision to buy something new which they have seen last night in the commercial ad .
Simlarly , when people does not know anything about a particular product , in most cases , they rely on advertisements .
Thats an other plus point of advertising .
Apart from this , most of the time people spend their leisure time by watching television and reading books , which are the excellent sources for advertising .
As a result , public come to know about the new products through the ads .

Coming to the disadvantages , the first and foremost is with the children .
Whenever they found the ad to be attractive , they want u to buy the product for them , regardless they use it or not .
When comes to the food stuff , they always try to go for the junk food , where the ads cash in by showing them attractive .
Sometimes , we see some of the products to be less expensive .
We usually gets attracted to and purchase them .
But the final result is that it gets damaged after a short period .
We have to compromise for the quality .

In the conclusion , i would like to say that advertisements does not make us buy less quality products all the time but they do sometimes .
It is our mental ability to think what to purchase and what not ?
In most cases , the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are
