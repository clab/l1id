I strongly agree with the given statement .
From my point of view understanding ideas and concepts should be the top priority for students than learning facts .
There are many strong reasons that have influenced me in accepting this statement .
These reasons are presented in the subsequent paragraphs .

Firstly , its my firm belief that students should have a solid understanding of concepts and ideas .
This would build them up in such a way that they would be in a position to further research these ideas and present their points of view .
Research has also shown that students understand better when they have a firm grip over the fundamentals .

Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts would develop and hone their analytical ability .
The analytical ability is now a crucial factor in judging the intellect of an individual .

Thirdly , mere learning of facts with out understanding the concepts would encourage rote memorization .
This would hinder the development process of a child .
This would make him a mere data storage device .

Fourthly , when we learn from facts especially historical facts much depends on the authenticity of the information that has been provided .
It is quite possible that the information provided by archaelogists or historians might have been altered by the then existed governments .
Governments might alter the information provided by them , when they think that it would hurt the sentiments of people or cause a conflict among different socio-cultural groups .

Fifthly , I feel that in this Age of Technology mere learing of facts would not suffice .
The technological innovations demand an individual to have critical thinking ability , strong analytical skills and a firm grip over the basics of the subject .
Only when the basics are strong can a student understand the innovation and further research the idea .

I strongly feel that `` Only when the roots are strong can a Tree stand tall and firm . ''
These are the compelling reasons that have influenced me in stating that understanding ideas and concepts is far better than learning facts .
