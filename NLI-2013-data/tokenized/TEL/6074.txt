I disagree with the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use that there are today .
At times when there is a severe crisis of energy from fossil fuels , new inventions for alternate energy are coming into being .
Use of CNG gas as an alternate fuel has already started in 3rd world countries .
Bio fuels are considered to be a nice alternative but all these fuel alternatives doesnt stop us from using a car ! .
Every mans dream nowadays is to possess a car of his wish irrespective of the fact that there is a growing concern about the environmental hazards caused by the vehicles exhaust gases .

Some countries are trying to reduce the individual usage of cars by improving their public transport facility .
At the same time corporates are busy in designing cars which are more sleek , fashionable and fast only to attract more customers .
With the increase in population and economy boosts i think the usage of cars keeps on increasing day by day .
Solar cars are coming a big way these days .
With the increase of science and technology , newer techniques to improve the efficiency , durability of cars are being discovered .
Developing countries like India and china with their booming economies might be responsible for an increased usage of cars in future .
Even though these countries doesnt possess enough knowledge base to produce more cars comprising of new technologies like solarfuels and biofuels , they might have the economic capacity to import the technology from countries like US and Europe .

Also with the increasing population and job opportunities people are very much concerned about the time factor .
Busy lives are forcing people to be very punctual .
Cars being a personal thing can be used at any time and comes in handy at the time of crisis .

So a person who wants to attend an important seminar would prefer a car instead of a public trasport system like a bus .
Hence i am of the opinion that the usage of cars keeps on increasing for the times to come .
