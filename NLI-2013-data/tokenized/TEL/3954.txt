Time is the key point that is to be considered in ones life the young people focus there time mostely on the education and other physical activites but they rarely focus on the development of the community .

I agree with the statement because when we consider the example of the college student he spends most of his time on studyes rather then on the welfare or development of the community .
Mainely the reason lies in his thinking of what the community has done to him , that is if there is a favour that has been done to him by the community then he would probabely think of returning it back .

At the young age the people focus or think on making a living or exploring the resources that give them oppurtiny to make money and settel in life , but they forget to think that by developing the community in which he lives he can gain more bussiness and develop at a faster rate because the dvelopment or sucess of a individual not only depends on the efforts that are being made by him but also on the surroundings , that is his community and his surroundings .

At the young age the way of thinking is far different as the people think more practically and the way of apporach to a ploblem is far more different .
when we consider politics young people refuse to join actively in the politics because they think that it requires more experience and at there age might not be the proper time to join politics .
But they forget to that the comminty they live in needs the help of young individuals but not that of one who is 45 years old as his way of thinking may be quite different from the younger ones .

A clarity of mind is present in young people , so i feel that they should focus there attention on the community and help in the development of the nation , which in turn helps in gaining personal development also .
