I THINK SUCCESS IS A THING WHICH CAN BE OBTAINED FROM HARD WORK AND OFCOURSE IN SOME CASES IT MAY COMETHROUGH LUCK ALSO , BUT IT WILL NOT REMAIN FOR A LONG TIME .
ACCORDING TO ME `` HARDWORK IS THE MAIN CONCEPT FOR SUCCESS '' AND COMING TO SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE , I THINK THEY SUCCEDED BECAUSE OF HARDWORK .
BY IMPLEMENTING THE NEW IDEAS IN THE FIELD OF BUSINESS THEY HAVE DEVELOPED THEIR BUSINESSES .
THESE NEW IDEAS MAY BE SOME TIMES RISKY AND MAY LEAD TO THE LOSS IN THE BUSINESS .
BUT EVERY SUCCESSFUL PERSON THINKS THAT `` FAILURES ARE THE STEPING STONES TO SUCCESS '' .
A SUCCESSFUL PERSON NEVER AND SHOULD NOT BE DISCOURAGED .
THERE IS NOTHING NEW IN DOING THE SAME THING THEY KNOW AND MAKING TO RUN THE BUSINESS ASUSUALLY WITH NORMALPROFITS .
AND THAT 'S ALSO NOT THAT MUCH INTERESTING IN LIFE .
ACCORDING TO ME EVERY BUSINESS PERSON IN THE FIELD OF BUSINESS THINKS OF GROWING MORE NA MORE AND TO REACH A HIGHER POSITION IN LIFE .
EVERY PERSON IN THE FIELD OF BUSINESS SHOULD HAVE ZEAL TO GROW UP .
FOR EXAMPLE TAKE SOME OF THE INDIANS WHO R IN ONE OF THE TOP POSITIONS IN THE WORLD AND IN THE COUNTRY , THOSE ARE MR.LAKSHMI MITTAL , ANIL AMBANI , MUKESH AMBANI , RATAN TATA , AJIM PREMJI ...
ETC. , AND MANY MOR .
ALL THESE PERSONS ARE NOT BORN WITH SILVER SPOON WHILE BIRTH .
THEY HAVE REACHED THEIR POSITIONS BY CAREFULLY IMPLEMENTING THE REQUIRED RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR THE NEW IDEAS OR THINGS WHICH ARE RISKY .
THEY DID NOT STOP THEIR ACHIEVEMENT BY JUST DOING THE SAME BUSINESS WHAT THEY HAVE STARTED FIRST AND BECOMING CALM .
EVERY PERSON SHOULD HAVE A SPECIFIC SCOPE IN ORDER TO REACH SOMETHING NEW .
NO PERSON SHOULD STOP AT THE LEVEL THEY HAVE AQUIRED AND SHOULD TRY FOR HIGHER POSITION .

THEREFORE I CONCLUDE BY AGREEMENT THAT SUCCESSFUL PERSON TRY NEW THINGGS AND TAKE RISKA RATHER THAN ONLY DOING WHAT THEY KNOW HOW TO DO WELL .
