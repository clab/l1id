`` Young prople are strong and dynamic '' this words are proved by great scholors and philosophers of our country .
I strongly agree with the statement which is followed . ''
Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .enjoyment should be done only when ur young because its the age to have fun .
young people r more dynamic and strong and when its growing age people wil be very strong and body parts also grow .

Young people have the life in them where they should make some memories for the future life .
And young people can really have fun time with they friends and relatives and lead they life to the fullest .
young people still have the life which is just started can some young people really do enjoy life hanging out with friends and will have fun time .
Young life is such a age where few people develop in a good way and few people get into a bad way .
they have the life which they have it in their hands .

Few people really enjoy life by experimenting with drinks and drugs .
they feel experimenting with them is a enjoyment .
But those r not really enjoyment things its infact which apoil the carrier of the youngster .
those kind a enjoyment is to be ristricted and enjoyment should be done such that he has good time andd good memories which he can share with his young generation .

Young people really do enjoy life they have more energy and more capability to have enjoy .
Young people go to any extent for their enjoyment .
But older people cannot have much enjoyment as the youngster 's as they got no energy and capability to enjoy .
Older people wil have to think off their young age enjoyment and have good memories and have funw ith those memories .

Young people cannot be stopped from having fun or enjoying .
Those youngster age doe n't permit to control from having fun .
even in school or at education places we have special time for refreshing and enjoyment for youngster 's this is only because youngster should have enjoyment equally with studies .
they is a saying by our great scholors saying `` All work no play makes a man lazy '' youngster 's need some with for fun appart from their routine education life .
this is mainly to have peace off mind and relaxcation Young people are more flexible when compaired to old people they can do any adventure where as old people all depend on young people .
Young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have more time and intrest towards enjoyment and youngsters have to give importacne to the enjoying life to make himself active in all basis .
young people really have great energy and emthusiasm towards enjoyment they can enjoy the whole day but they dont get tired this is only because off intrest .
this intrest is to be provoked in studies .

Therefore i totally agree with the abouve statement saying `` Young people enjoy life more than olkder people do '' because older people should have sweet and unforgettable memories in their age and this is can be only done by older people only if they enjoy they life in the young age .
The starting and ending of life depends on the enjoyment basis which is only obtained at the young age .
