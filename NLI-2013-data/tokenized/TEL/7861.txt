Travelling is only fun when I have the freedom to do whatever I want .
So I disagree with a statement `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .
Travelling in a group with a tour guide poses problems like following a schedule and following suit .

First and foremost , I travel to visit and experience places first hand to visualize beauty in my own way .
A tour guide will not only force me to view the sites through his eyes but also hinder my experience and impose other unnecessary constaints like time and schedule requirements .
The tour guide will be barking orders and giving all sorts of information that I will hear from one ear and forget it from the other .
I would like to take my own time when watching the breathtaking Niagara Falls or the mind-blowing Egyptian Spinx .

Group travelling will force me to do the same activities others are doing and so , will not allow me some time on my own .
I would be very disturbed with my loss of command over myself .
I would like to be my own boss and do things my own way .
Just because 10 people want to visit the Eiffel Tower for the second time does n't mean that I would waste my oppurtunity to appreciate the Romantic art at the Louvre .
I am just one of those people who love working and doing stuff outside a group .

In conclusion , a travelling group with a tour guide is a bad choice according to me .
I would lose my independence of thoughts and my control of choices .
I would rather voyage in peace and serenity without all the fuss of a group .
