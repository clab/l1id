I will agree with the following statement that , it is improtant that for the student to understand ideas and concepts than iit is for them learning the facts .
For students who learn the facts , it will be the temporary in their minds .
when students understand ideas and concepts it will be inthe mind permanatly .

Firstly students in the school will follow the process of understanding the ideas and concepts of a particular topic .
For example students learning the subjects like Physics , mathematics , their is a need to understand the ideas and concepts related to the problem or topic .
by knowing the concepts and ideas he can these ideas any where in that feild .

second reason is that if they practice the same procedure i.e understanding the ideas and concepts related to the topic he may create a histroy in that field .
For example consider a scientist , he can able to solve the problem by understanding the ideas and concepts which are related to that topic .
By learning the facts the students cannot know the subject theoritically .

I will conclde this topic , by learning the facts students will not gain any thing in the future .
But by understanding the ideas and concepts students will more information about that topic whoch bthey are studing .
