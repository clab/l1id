Specialisation and having a broad knowledge of many different subjects are both equally important .
Both specialisation and general knowledge should co exist together for a society to evolve Specialists are the people who study deeply about a specific subject .
They try to gain as much knowledge of the subject as possible .
Specialists are needed where the surface knowledge about the subject is not enough .
For example if a patient is having a skin problem , initialy a general practioner will try to find a cure , but if the problem is too deep then a skin specialist comes into the picture .
So a specialist is needed whenever a problem is too specific .
But a specialist has a danger of getting isolated in his own work and miss the big picture Having a broad knowledge helps a person to see the big picture .
It helps a person to see the co relation between different things .
The problem is viewed from every angle and also in corelation to other things .
A generalist is needed to see in which direction the society is moving .
He is needed to address the bigger problems of the society .

Thus both general knowledge and specialistion are needed and should complement each other for a society to function successfully
