I partly inagreement with the statement .
Some people enjoy the life when they where young and other when they became old .
One of the definations of enjoyment of life is `` living with the people they love '' .
In the cycle of generations of human race the relationship plays an important role .

At young age people look more energetic and active .
The communication of the people is so fresh and healthy at that age .
With this , people will really get well equiped with so many friends and relatives .
Right from the childhood the people continue to enjoy with the friends , while studying then with work and then with his family up to his next generation .
For example consider the case of a newly married couple , the couple is new to the both the families and the atmosphere gives a chance to the people to enjoy that time .

In some cases the young people with a different mentality or due to the atmosphere they grow wants to lead the life alone with out any interaction with others .
The life like that has no chance of enjoyment .

At the oldage the maintanence of the relation plays a major role .
If the old people are maintaining the relation right from their young age with the relatives , sons and grandsons they will enjoy the life even better at that age .
At that age also the relation that maintained by us make the people to visit us again and again and they insist the people to spend the time with us .
For example the love and affection shown by `` mother theresa '' is still visible to the people .
These kind of people will definatly enjoy the life at oldage .
They can really forget all illness due to age and keep smiling untill their death .

On the other hand the people who are not having their childern to look after their needs and help them at that age , will suffer so much .
For example we can see these type of people in oldage homes who suffer alot at that age living far from the family .

So people can enjoy the life at both stages that is at young age and old age .
It depends on the people maintaining the relations and the love given to the future generations .
