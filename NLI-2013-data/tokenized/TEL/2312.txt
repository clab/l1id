I agree with the statement that young people will enjoy alot in their life more than the old people as the young people begin their life with no responsibilities and so they do n't have to think about others as this causes the young peole to enjoy alot then the old peoples enjoyment .

The other thing is young people will be having a lot of time in their life as they do n't have to earn alot as the old peole , as for the old people their will be a reponsibility to set their llife and also for young ones in a better beneficial way so their is chance that they ca n't enjoy in their life as their enjoyment may be less than the young people .

As the young people who will be going to colleges has to look their college time and college schedule only so their may be a chances that they have a lot of time in their life to enjoy .

As in same way the old people who are going to offices for their income has to spare a lot of time in the working in the office than the other people so in this way young people will get a lot of time in their enjoyment rather than the old people .

Their will be differenses in the experience that got from the lifes as it is different for young and old people and the experience and their problems and their work , what they do results in stress to old poeple as then to the young people as the young people will do n't have any stress like the old people in their real life so this a reason why young people will enjoy alot in thier life compated to the old people enjoyment .
