Youth are the back bone of any nation .
The development of nation is in their hands .
So they do lot of things which include helping to communities .
As being of the same group I would like to disagree with the statement .

Youth have a lot of reponsibilities in building strong nation .
Though they are involved in their restless work they do spend some time for the benefits of others .
The strong reason for my disagreement is they help the community with their profession also .

They are hell lot of young enterpreneurs who are looking forward to help the society by providing employment .

I would like to mention the charitable organisations being established by various MNC 's where lot of youth work for it .
They concentrate on various basic eminities like drinking water , laying roads , conducting awareness camps , oldage homes .
All these organisations are run by the youth in a fantastic way .
Though they do not directly involve inthe action the are the back bones of various organisation .

I would like to notify this example from my personal life , during our college days we used to dedicate 2 saturday of every month to plant trees in various communities beside our college and we were awareded for that and taking that spirit we are still continuing .

The works done by youth do not attract mass media or other means as they feel it as a duty rather than reponsibility .
The awareness camp conduted by youth against AIDS has been a exellent program in the history of our country .
Helping to others need not require any organisation and work under it it can be a small help that you contribuited for others welfare and especially for the needy .

In a nut shell , I state the being considering as a duty youth are playing a key role in improving the standards of the society by contributing quality of work without exposing to media beinga reason to supress our efforts .
