In my point of view understanding ideas and concepts is very Important .
The subject like a java , we can know the knowledge of java by understanding the ideas and concepts .
concepts is more Important than facts .
By studying the facts like sun microsystems invented the java , we ca n't understand the features of the java .

we can also learn by something hearing and studying the facts .
facts can also Improve the knowledge .
By studying the facts like Independense we should know about the great leaders of our country , and we should know about the how they will work hard for the Independense .
History will tell about this .
So learning the facts were Important .
By studing the facts the children can learn about the honesty , relibility , and history of the country .
Everyone must should know about the history of the country .
By learning the facts we can prevent the wars like second world war and the first world war .

by learning the facts we can know about our previous cultures and methods , It was very Intrresting .
last week some of the persons found the Dwaraka under the sea , so by hearing this fact we can conclude that there were Dwaraka in the past .

By understanding the concepts and ideas we can Improve the knowledge of the subject and we can Improve our performance and profound knowledge in the subject .
we ca n't understand the concepts like polymorphism and abstracton while learning about the facts .
All the students can understand by understanding the concepts and ideas of the subject .
Conceots were very Important and Ideas were also Important .

For understanding subjects the students could know about the ideas and concepts .
There would be necerrely facts for the students because for know about the past .
In this days , understanding the concepts is very Importants for future Importance .
