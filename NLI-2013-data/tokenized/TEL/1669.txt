What are academic subjects ?
Does specializing in one specific subject help ?
Or is it better to have a broader knowledge about various subjects ?
Knowledge is like an ocean .
There are various unlimited subjects .
Most of us choose our subjects according to our interests and preference .
Choosing a subject plays an important role in everyones life and thus an individual should make a clear dicission .
The role choosing a specific subject played in my sisters life and the rapid change in the technology helped me realize that choosing a specific subject is very important in todays world .

My sister is specialized in computer science engineering .
She did her graduation and post graduation in only one subject .
Now as a result many companies are willing to give a high paid job .
She was interested right from her chilhood days in the field of computers .
So because of her consistant approach towards the subject helped her to reach her goals and ambitions .

The technology today is accelerating .
There are many new discoveries and innovations in the field of science and technology .
To catch up with the pace of this change one should constantly concentrate in any particular field .
This would intern help him/her to participate to make new innovations in any particular field .
This process would help in nation building .

Therefore , I personally want to specialize in the field of computers like my sister and also be a part of innovating new technological systems .
Thus specializing in any particular subject helps an individual to know the subject in detail and more specifically .
So this is the main reason i choose to select any particular suject and specialise in it .
