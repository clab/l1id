It is intresting weather we look for idea and concept than facts .
I belive that emphasising on the facts is good rather than ideas and concepts .
So , I disagree with the above statement .

Ideas and concepts were formulated by philosophers or scientsts where made questions on the facts .
For example scientists belive that earth was large flat surface .
Untill one of the scientist while travelling on the ocean recognised that earth is not a flat surface because the the fact that oceance is appearing like endless and movent of steasmers proved the fact that earth is in shape of the globe .
So , Ideas and concepts are not always true .

Facts are what we observe and these werwe stone of development .
For example invention of chicken pox vaccination by the Edwarrd Genner , he discoved the vaccine by observing that persons working with milk products were not affected by the perticular organism besause of the fact that they were ressistant to that organism .
Another best example is the Health Profession of Physiotherapy which sounds good for the facts ..
The studens and Physiotherapists stongly belive the `` EVIDENCED BASED CLINICAL PRACTICE '' .
Evedence based practce .
treating the patiens with the best available stratages and protocols stated and proved by the students and Physiotherapists .

In coclusion , the students will more benifited when they learn the rel facts .
