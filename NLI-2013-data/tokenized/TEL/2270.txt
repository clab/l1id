Now a days the technology has been improved to enjoy both yong and old equally .
as the culture is getting changed , if the old people go with the change they mey also enjoy as youth .
enjoyment comes from take the growth as benefits then taking it as useless The young people are enjoying more , as all the helpful in present day busy life .
for example eating at fastfood centers then by cooking at home this makes them to use the time .
the advanced improvement in computer decreses the work stress on them , as the salaries are more they are spending more money to get enjoy like buying sports cars and leading a luxurious life .

The people who are old now where young at sometime before they enjoyed at their time .
The people who are old enough are not satisfied with the the change in culture , they give more importance to the moral values , health , andtheir own views .
if they does n't change their ideas they may not enjoy .

for example consider the new year itself , the young people enjoy themselves in the parties and want to celebrate the whole day with many people in clubs , the old people may not go the clubs and gets involved in the party .
they sit idle at homes .
the movies now a days more concentrate on the youth and making them more enjoying , while the ca n't see those movies which involve romance , action e.t.c .

I agree with the above statement that young are enjoying more than older .
they are seeing for a temporary joy , as increasing lifestyle .
