Now a days in this globalised world people need fast modes of transportation to move from one part of the world to other .
In that process people will choose many sources of transportations .
Cars play on of the vital roles in the transportation in those many sources

Now in this 20th century people are giving a lot of importance to time and they are trying to make their time to travel lesser .
That is they are trying to see that they waste minimum time .
And I hope this busy life would become even more in future say after 20 years or after any number of years .
So people will not find themselves wasting time .

Now many of people are using cars as their mode of transportation and so due to the busy schedules in life they try to use much more faster way to transport .
That is they try to find cars which are much faster than the present age .
In my opinion usage of cars will ever increase but not decrease .

In developing countries like United States of America , United Kingdom and some other places people use cars for many resons .
They use cars for not wasting their time in transportation , and even prefer cars for comfortable journey .
In Developing countries and in under developed countries the people not only maintain cars for have a comfortable journey but also people maintain cars as a symbol of prestige .

Coming to the point of protection we recieve from cars we can protects ourselves from environmental pollutions like dust , smoke , frost , etc .
And from climatic conditions like extreme cold , snow , rain .
hot sun etc .

Many can mention a point about extiction of resources like shortage of diesel , petroleum etc , may happen due to the extensive usage of cars .
But once we see that there are many uses through cars , then we can do a lot of research works to find out other sources for running the car .
Alternative resources are seen in such a way that the extiction of petroleum products will not affect the uasge to cars .

And we cant even dream about the times were usage of cars is reduced .
One great example is that the rate of manufacturing of the cars is increasing day by day .
The companies of car manufacturing products are also increasing day by day .
Not only just increasing but also profiting themselves with gains .

So in view of all the above mentioned conditions one would prefer to purchase a car if he doesnot have any , or to purchase another one if he already have one .
So obviously there will be increase in usage of cars even in 20 years from now .
And preciesly not only just 20 years but also more number of years .
