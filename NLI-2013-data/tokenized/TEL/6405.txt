I agree with the statement given .
There will be decrease in the number of cars in use over the next twenty years .
This is because of several contributing reasons which include growing traffic problems , depleting petroleum resources , invention of newer modes of transport , and several other reasons .

Firstly , the traffic problems in today 's roadways is a major contributing factor .
The remedies for such problems would prove more costly than inventing a new transport method or developing an alternate transport method .
The possible cures for today 's traffic hazards and traffic jams could be building more overhead bridges .
The building of bridges in existing city premises need a lot of funds and planning .
On the other hand if these efforts were made in the direction of improving railway commuting facility or metro train facilities , it would be more fruitful .

The invention newer modes of transport like small range air vehicles or helicopters for transport in the city would facilitate easy as well as faster solutions to such traffic problems .

Depletion of petroleum resources also has a major role to play in retarding the manufacture of cars at this rate .
Petroleum goods are used for various other purposes like industrial usages and cooking etc .
But today most of the petroleum resources are used up in automobile industry .
To change this scenario , the number of cars would have to be drastically reduced .
Alternate energy sources like hydrogen fuel cell cars , electric battery cars have not been very successful .
Therefore the number of cars after twenty years would certainly be a small fraction of the present number .

The technology and developments which enhance the efficiency of cars has almost come to a point of saturation .
Cars now are bought more because of their beauty in design or brand of the maker , rather than because of their efficiency .
Even this supports that if there are newer and more fashionable modes of public transport , more and more people will want to commute by those vehicles .

Therefore by looking at the present trends of car design and keeping in mind the depleting resources , i strongly feel that the number of cars in use after twenty years from now would be very few .
New inventions could easily substitute the automobiles in the near future .
