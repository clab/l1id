Knowledge is devine .
Having knowledge on differnt subjects does not lead to any confusion , rather we have more advantages .
I disagree with the mentioned statement .
In our day to day life we see so many changes , the thing you see today might no be there tommorow , when we talk about technologies the above statement is true , however there are few subjects , where they remain constant , for example History , the term itself describes about past actvity .
If an individual stick to this subject through out his/her life , there is posibility of not knowing the latest updates of our surroundings .

Mastering in a specific subject is a good option , but at the same time every individual should have the basics of other subjects as well .

Consider a small example here , say there are two students A and B. A is specialized in history and has zero knowledge on other subjects B is good at computers and also shows intrest in other subjects .
If both were told to give a ceminar , A would be stronger only in presenting the lecture but where as when B gives presentation on the same topic as A did , B 's presentation would be more affective and the reason being , B 's presentation includes a graphical representation which will strike the ordians minds with great impact .

If Parents have knowledge in different subjects , it helps their children to think , understand and analyze and if we are sticked to one topic forever , it might create a problem for us and for the younger generation .
Knowledge is prowerful weapon and it is an ocean and having a broad knowledge will help us in better thinking and sharing it with otheres put us one step ahead .
