communites reffer to our friends , relatives , colliges nowadays every body are concerned about there own but not about communites every body are thinking about their own and their family only they are not intrested about any body they are not in a possition to care to some neddy people

Yes i agree that young people now a days are not giving enough time for helping their communites because most of them think that this is not their work they are always thinking about their own family and themselvs some of them think that it is waste of time and money they also think that it is foolish to help others we can see such a type of people in our dialy life also for example if any .
accidient occurs on a bussy road no body care about the feldown one no body will stop their vechiles and help hte accidient ones most them will be scolding them moving forward but they wont help them Like this we can take many examples in our dialy life only most of the youngesters are thinking that helping other communities wont help them they are thinking that many are there for helping them they will understand this when they are in needy .

when we help others in any probelem they will help us when we are in problem no body are understanging this every body are thinking about their own they are in a mood that they wont gain anything by doing such a type of social work helping others in needy is a social work of every common man we should develop ourselves that by helping others we are removing others pain through our hands we can prove ourselves as humanbeings by giving our hands for help of others .
