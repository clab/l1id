People may try new things for which risk has to be taken , and if the risk pays of they become successful .
I strongly belive that when there is a risk involved the chances of being successful are equal to chances of failing .
Definetly only new things give greater magnitude of success , since people are more inclined to newer and innovative things rather than the things which are already existing , there would certainly go for something new in the market .
I know of a person who became very sucessful after introducing polyster into the national market where all the major buissness sold only cotton as their main product , the person tried something new though he knew that risk was involved and became a great success story .

On similar grounds one of my friend wanted to try out something new and he opened a chain of clothes store on a newbrand name , though everyone adviced him to take up a franchise with an already established brand as their was reduced risk of failing and reduced cost in new ideas and advertizements , he did not listen to their advice and setup his own thing , but unfortunately for him the store did not do good business and he could not get to taste success .
I also know of a person who opened a franchise of a popular company and doing great bussiness , here he did not try anything new went with doing what people already new about , that way it was a sure thing for him and he did not have to invest as much as he would have if he started something new and he is enjoying success , although his success might not be of an equal magnitude compared to the ones who have tried new things and became successful .

I conclude that as there are two sides to a coin there are both advantages and disadvantages in trying out new things or doing something which is already well established .
