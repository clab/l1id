I agree with the idea that now a days young people do not give enough time to help their communities .
I feel this true atleast in my country .
In olden days during freedom struggle many young people felt it is their resposibility to help their country to regain its glory .
This can demonstrated from the fact that most of the national leaders at that time had a very good record in helping the community when they were young .
May be it is because they are very enthusiastic or may be the conditions demanded them to do so but they definitely spent more time in helping community than modern day guys .

Now a days young people have become more lazy mainly because the hard ship faced by the people over the period of time has reduced and that they generally do n't face the hard conditions faced by the people in earlier times .
More over with the advencement of entertainment industry the young people have found a way to kill their leasure time there by not bothering about the things that are happening around them .
More over with the advencement of importance of studies now a days young people often get preoccupied in their own problems finding it difficult to care about problem faced by the community .
But they are not realising by neglecting the community they are neglecting them selves .
The point that people are neglecting their community can be demonstrated by the point the number of strikes against bad government policies has reduced over a period of time .

So i say that now a days people dont give enough time to help their communities and by doing so they are spoiling them selves and also the community .
I finally say that people should spend more time for community as did by their predissors
