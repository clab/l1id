Every young man is supposed to do that kind because , i disagree this satement beause of many reasons , but at the sametime .
I agree the statement .
REASONS FOR THE DISAGREEMENT ARE

1 ) As am a young boy , i myself formed a group in my street , and we held elections , i was selected as the head of the youth.my duty is to look about the welfare of the society , so what i did is , i started collected money every week from the individuals , and i started helping the communities ,
2 ) we should agree te statement that youth are participating in the community development , because as we have many players who represent their own country , say for example great crickter master blastyer sachin tendulkar he has satarted a community in india , from which he can help nearly 10 thousand people to survive their lifes ,
3 ) maria sharapoa , aNdrew raddick , sanis mirza who are the famous tennis players the hepl the community by giving up their renumarations which they receive from the different corporate companies .
4 ) every country has got their own respect to their cedit , development in the community depends on the developmnt of the country , so individual government has taking its own individual rules regulations .

5 ) youth has always get associated with the communities
we have different kinds of communities , say islam community , christian comunity , inindia we have hindu commmunity , so every religion must look upon their own community development systems / .
6 ) even in christianity we d have many kinds of communities .
They say catholics , protestents , and they have different kind things they have .
If youth donot find time in helping communities then how these many communities are there , Every community has its own passion , they have different cultures , they have many aims to their credit people often participatein community meetings .
