It is more imortant for students to unerstand ideas and concepts rather than concept it for them to learn facts .
Acording to my opinion It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , because ideas to help the students to improve his skills and more knowledge about the subject , and it is more important to student to achieve his goal .
The concept of reasonable subject is help the students to reach their goals .

First of all i would like to give one example of this .
When i am in the tenth class i did not well in the mathematics subject and i did not concentrate on the class very well , because of this lack of ideas i did not well in the mathematics subject .
One day my mathematics techer asked me do the problem , but i did not done that problem properly .
Then she wil teach subject very easily and giving the ideas to me , and gave concepts of the basic subject , then i easly understand the mathematics subject and i did very well in the exam .

Secondly i would like to tell you that is basic ideas and concepts very important to students , because if they did not know about the basic ideas of the subject , they definately low knowledge about that subject .
We did not understand the concept of the subject then we lose the knowledge of that subject , example poor students did not very well in their subjects .

Finally , Intelligent people has always give the important to the ideas and concepts , and they very well known about the subject , those students whose ideas are good they going to be goodperson .
specially students are engineers they must include this ideas .
That way i am interested in this , and i also says that ideas and concepts are very important to the students .
