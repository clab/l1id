I agree with the statement and think that it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specialize in one particular subject .
Firstly , a broad knowledge of subjects helps an individual learn a lot more in different fields and opens up his mind .
This helps him think in various perspectives than a single one .
For instance , if a doctor were asked if the height of a door in the house was appropriate acccording to the height of the roof in the planning of a house , he would be perplexed and refer an architect .
On the other hand , the same question would be answered by an individual who studied all subjects moderately more clearly or atleast with a brief idea .

Secondly , the knowledge of a broad spectrum of subjects reflects versatility of a person and helps him get into various types of careers opening up more avenues and increasing his flexibility in terms of choosing a career rather than limiting himself to one particular field .
For example , although an architect specializes in his field an architect with an additional MBA degree would be preferred due to his broader domain of knowledge helping him perform better than the one with a single architect degree .

Thirdly , a variety of subjects help an individual in increasing awareness and general knowledge which is very important in the competetive world of today .
One who is ahead in this race ascends the steps of success at a faster rate .
If we compare an invidual who knows the basics of all subjects with one who knows everything about one particular subject and nothing about anything else , it is but obvious that the former would get an upper hand in more number of fields in life than the latter .

Finally , it is important to know the basics of all subjects which can be built upon later depending on the career we choose to take up .
This helps us in increasing our chances of survival in this world of ever increasing competition .
