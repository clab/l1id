Touring should be done with a touring guide .
Primarily a tour guide is necessary to cover all the places planned ; to keep the time always in tact as it is a most vital factor in all the tours ; communciation skills ; general knowledge about the places of our visit etc .

First and foremostly the coverage of all places can only be achieved if guided appropriately .
Tours are not planned frequently and if given an option the option should be utilized to the fullest extent .
Basic idea of any tour itenary will have the places of visit .
Coverage of all the planned places is very necessary for it to become a very sucessful one .
Without appropriate guide the coverage cannot be achieved or in better words it is difficult to achieve .
Tour guide will know the operational hours of any place .
Consider you liked to visit a park , a boat house - everything has operational hours and knowing all the operational hours is very difficult .
Though the information can be gathered prior to the tour , all the information thus gathered may not be very true .
There might be false informations if the information was obtained from the internet media or a old paper clipping .
A tour guide will obviously know about the operational hours , best time to visit and cost of the visit .

Second important factor is the place of stay .
Choosing an accomodation is the most important aspect of any tour .
Accomodation should be cost effective , near to the places in the itenary and the environment should be very good .
Choosing an accomodation all by ourselves without a guide may seem plausible but there is no gurantee that the place selected would have all the qualities as enumerated above .

The next factor would be communciation skill .
Consider you are touring on a place where they speak a foreign language which you have n't come across .
Language plays a major role while going to new places as without that it would be an unseeming task of covering all the places in the itenary and reaching the destination in time .
Speaking about the time - time is a very important factor .
Even if the tour was planned with buffer times it might not be possible to reach a place due to various practical reasons .
Tour guide will solve all those problems .

Climate and other conditional factors to your favorite destination is important .
We may have decided on places based on various sources .
May be from our friends , our relatives and from the great Internet and other media .
All the information may not be correct about the climate .
Say you are going for a fall drive .
You will know the place is better in fall .
Without any guidance the exact practical scenario cannot be predicted .
It has really happened to me .
I was once on a trip to `` Vermont '' for the fall scenic drive .
Though i knew the colour of trees would be awesome pretty less i knew about the time at which the leaves will shed .
Hence always in any tour a touring guide is mandatory .
Assistance always make things easier .
It will not be a bad idea to grab an option if it is available .

I would like to state a personal experience wherein we planned for a big trip to a hill station without a tour guide .
There were fifty peple in number and we planned to visit number of places .
Because of the lack of a tour guide we managed to visit only fewer places and that too we could n't spend much time in all places .
As there were even girls in the trip we chose a better accomodation on the first day and second day we settled with a mean place .
First day stay was very expensive as it was too luxurious to stay and second day stay was so mean that people could even barely sleep .
Next most worrying and disgusting thing was we could n't get food as we thought .
People like various kinds of food and it was a hard time to satisfy all the people .

Thus for any tour a touring guide is mandatory .
Tour guide as described about will have a vast knowledge of the places we visit and he/she would make the best out of our plan .
To really see the value our money tour should be enjoyed with a tour guide .
