I feel that the young people enjoy there life more than the older once because the young people do n't have any responsibilities .
For example compare with a girl to her mother .
Basically a girl only has a responsibility to study and if she has finished doing it , she probabilly enjoys by freeking out with friend to a good place orby going to some friends house .

But her mother who has many responsibility like her daughter , and the other child she had so basically she is busy in her responsibilities .
she dont atleast do n't find time to enjoy .
And if she is a working women she has to move to her job in the morning and when she returns to home she needs to do some work like cooking and cleaning the home .
So finally she is tired at the end of the day and she dont atleast have time to enjoy and she feels to take rest .

But basically enjoying also depends on the peoples character some people are there who really enjoy there work they feel that they enjoy by doing their work properly .
And some people enjoy all the time by making fun .
I feel age is not the matter to enjoy or responsibilities are not the part which stop the people to enjoy .

And the older people enjoy really when they completed there responsibilities in a proper way the feel proud and they do enjoy there job .
But enjoyment is the job what we have done in a proper way with out harming or hurting the other people , but the enjoyment should be in such a way that the person beside you should also enjoy .

The young people enjoy by freeking out to parties and the older people enjoy by fulfilling there responsibilites .
So probabilly both the generations enjoy but in the way they enjoy is different .
