The statement is `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
I partially agree with the above statement .
I would like to quote sevaral reasons in support of my stance .
The following essay will justify my stance .

Firstly , i would like to say that there may be decrease in number of cars that are using today because of increase in the Traffic in each and every city .
For example , consider a city where it has many more number of cars than its actual capacity of roads .
This situation will lead to frequent and severe Traffic jams .
No person will be able to reach th dstination in time .
The people will get frustrated with this and they naturally prefer other types on conveyence like mass conveyence system which includes trains , buses and aircrafts .

Also , consider a situation where a city is highly polluted , which also results in decrease of number of cars after twenty years .
For example consider a place where it is vastly polluted .
The levels of sevaral chemicals like Co2 , hydrogen have fairly raised up than their normal levels .
The gas that is ejected from the cars is also a reason for this .
This results in decrease of number of cars .

Next , consider a situation of accidents .
These accidents are very common in each and every place in the world .
For example consider a situation where a firm will be providing safer means of transportation .
Mass conveyence systems like trains , buses , aircrafts are safer than cars .
this is also a situation where there will decrase in the numbr of cars in the future .

Finally , consider a situation wherethe devolopement of this mass conveyence is fast .
This will lead to important things like safer journey , reaching to the place safely , low fairs .
Many people does n't want than this .
So , there will be decrease in the number of cars in the future than they are used today .

In conclusion i would like to say that as there are both sides of a coin consider a situtation where in the economic status of the country is increased and each and every person prefer to purchase a car .
This is possible becuase people in many countries believe that purchasing a car increases their economic status .
so there is also a chance that cars may be increased in the future after twenty years .

This is my stance on the following essay .
