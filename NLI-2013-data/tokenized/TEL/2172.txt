Enjoyment of life is boon from god to all the living creatures .
Every person likes to enjoy his life in his own way , irrespective of his age .
Age is not the matter to enjoy life , since every person enjoys his life according to the energy he is capable of .

According to my point of view young people enjoy a lot than older people , because they are cold blooded , highly energitic and flexible to every movement .
Since it is a growing age , he is free of problems , and enjoys every movement of life .

Due to the flexibility he can do any thing he wanted to do , without any riddles .
Young people enjoy life by participating in various activities as a part of studying .
For example young people belonging to school age enjoy a lot , such as making noises , screaming , fighting among themselves , parcipating in various physical activities , due to which they maintain agood health which yeilds good growth .
Because this is the age we able to know each other , knowing relationships making buddies and having lots of fun .

Older people are not so energitic as young blood , because of the age factor , not flexible body as age grows and responsibilities they have around them .
They cannot enjoy the same one as , the zeal with which young people do .
Because they are always cornered with the problems and responsibilities that surround around them .

According to me young people are free birds who can stretch their wings to enjoy the world around them .
At the mourning age we like to spend a lots of time with friends , roaming on bikes and attending parties and functions to get the time passed and the joyful and delightful mood .
At this age we spend lavishly and even and we do not even known how to control our activities .

Older people cannot do the same as young lads do since they know life and the consequences they limit themselves to major extend .
Every person has his own view .
According to me we enjoy a lot in youn
