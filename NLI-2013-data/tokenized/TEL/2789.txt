`` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' yes , It is correct because due the development of the country .
In the olden day is no such type of facilities which we are enjoying in this days .

Young people will enjoy a much because the parents were being the educated people .
Now a day the generation is also little bit faster than the previous generation the main reason is the due to increasing the development in the cities .

Young people were enjoying a lot with the help of new technology , people were enjoying life with there needs and the people were learning the education with the happiest way .

In olden days there is no proper education to learn and people were educated a little thepeople were satisfied with there education .
But the young people were not compromising in the education so that the they are studying upto the graduation or more .

young people were enjoying the life with there education , people that they are enjoying with the education and they were enjoying other activities also like sports .
entertainment etc. according to my view that the young people were enjoying inall aspects more then the older people .
I agree that the Young people were there life more than older people .
they are ejoying in the all activities which are available in the world .
even though that the people were enjoying and they were take the good education also .
the enjoyment is not a bad habit .
