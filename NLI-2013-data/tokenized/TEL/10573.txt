The term success leads to encourage the people to try new things for the better growth and fame to the individual and the organistaion too .
I agree that successful people should have a great deal of energy and courage to do find for the new ideas and plans , which obviously leads to take certain risks .
But these risks also count worthy when the goal is achieved .
A successful person always tend to move forward to get even better prospects for him , this helps him to try out new things rather than sticking to the one already been engaged .

Doing the old job or already know thing is that something leads to a confined life , which is not always followed by a person of succsess .
The person should try out risks to handle the situation even better , and also letting the know things is not a wise thing to do .
We need to try out new things and relatively try for better ones , that helps to get work even simpler and better .
There is a element of risk in every job which we handle , but the risk should be overcomed by the proper steps and skill that we have , need to be wise and genious in handling the risk , else it will eventualy leed to distractions in the life .

However , the risk element is encountered in trying new things it can be easily digested when we acheive the goal we aimed at .
Successful person always try for the new ways of thinking and re-establishing himself/herself in a better rennovated position .
Sucessful person always try for the more success and this makes him to try for new things to develop .
We know that failures leed to the success one day or other , but success ultimately try 's for a better success .
For example , if a person acheived 70 % in his first attempt , he tries to improve it by changing the course of studying , he works harder and better to reach more then 70 % in his next attempt .

In this example , he tried some new ways to held himself motivated to improve the grades by an improvised study .

Finally , I suggest that a successful person become more success in every aspect if he tries new things rather than confined to they already know well .
The person of a high caliber can always handle the amount of risk with ease , when risk is eliminated it all in our hands to do better for the success of the new aspects or things which we do
.
Right thiking at the right point of time , always leeds to a better success .
So , its always encoured to try out for new deals to helps things better in life .
Successful people always strive hard for the better success , for better success we need to switch on to new things .
If the new things clicks he/she becomes more popular and reach the goal aimed at .
