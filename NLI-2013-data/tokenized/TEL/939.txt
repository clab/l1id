I would disgree with this statment having the broad knowledge of many acaemics subjects than to specialise in one specific subject because everyone would have their own choice of subject , so they prefer to be specialised in that particular subject .
Notonly that many of the students would have grip over particular subject .
It becomes difficult for the student to understand the unfamilier subject it would distracts them from their regular courses .

For an example if we consider the undergraduated student who have undergone his studies practicular field of subject such as computersciences , communications etc .
These undergraduted students who undergone specific courses would prefer to take specialisation in particular subject since they have know about the subject .
If the student of computers would prefer to the broad knowledge about the electronics then that student face a problem because that would be the unfamilier subject , where he have to learn basics this would distracts him from his regular course .

If we prefer to be specialised in the particular subject of our intertest then we could learn more about the subject i.e from basics to the recent developments .
We would may much attention towards the subject and also shows much enthusiasm in that specific subject because it is the subject of our interest .
Knowing everything about particular subject is better .
