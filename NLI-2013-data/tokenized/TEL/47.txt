It is better to have braod knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I am agree with the above statement because of the following reasons .

These days getting job is very competetive .
For getting job , surviving in society you need to know lot of things .
Every where you are using lot of concepts .
For example take soft ware engineer .

He need to know computer scince , mathematics , english , business logic .
If he dont know one of the above , he ca n't grow in that job .
Nowadays the gap between any two academic subjects is going down .
we are using lot of subjects for understanding single subject .
Consider the example mathematics .
Recent days for understading mathematics , we need physics , chemistry and some other topics .
Similarly we are using mathematics for solving lot of problems in phycics , chemistry , space related problems .
Even we are using mathematics in medicine .
Similarly every subject used for understanding other subjects .
If you have knowledge in single subject , we ca n't under stand recent mathematics .

In reasearch , scintists are using lot of concepts for finding one application .
For understanding recent research papers single subject knowledge is not sufficiant .
Take an expamle space programme .
In space programme we are using mathematics , statistics , physics , aeronautics etc ...
Not only space programme every where we are using lot of subjects .

Finally for surviving in this competitive world , for doing good reasearch , we need to know lot of concets .
for that we need to study lot of academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ..
