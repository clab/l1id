Advertising is a media by which people come to know about new market .
New market means new type of products , new models etc .
Only by believing the content of advertisement , people go for shopping .
So advertisements always try to draw full attention of it 's audience .
They do this to improve their sales .
Sometimes , the advertisements may contain false information .

The advertisers should try to impress people but not give wrong information about their product .
Take the example of a cocacola soft drink company .
Scientists proved that the products of cocacola drinks contain some pesticides .
So all people stopped drinking of cocacola products .
Their market went down .
Again , after some months the company came out .
The company started adevertising by famous heros .
So the fans of that hero believed his statement mentioned in advertisement and again started drinking cocacola products .
Indirectly , the advertisement challenged the proof of scientists .
Some educated people may be confused in such situations .
They may lose impression on advertisements .

Most adevertisers show their products much better than they really are .
I can explain this with my personal experience .
I bought one `` anti-dandruff '' shampoo after i saw one advertisement .
According to the advertisement , it should remove total dandruff in 4 weeks .
I used according to the insructions mentioned on the label .
But i didnot find any improvement even after 4 months .
Sometimes people may be misguided by these type of advertisements .

Advertisements should not contain false information .
It should reflect the real authenticity of the product .
Then only , people get good impression on advertisements .
Most people , while watching Television always try to skip advertisements .
Because they know that they are fake advertisements .
They may either change the channel for a while or they may engage in other work for that period .
The companies choose the advertising as a messenger to increase their market and to get some identity in people about their product .
So they should be designed in such a way to get good impression by people .
