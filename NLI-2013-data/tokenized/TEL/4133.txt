Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities no I dont agree to the above statement .
In the present generation people are able to earn money by many ways .
in olden days rich are allways rich and poor are allways poor .
poor people can not go to school they bont have any support from any one .
The development in the poor people area is very less .

In the present days people have came to know about the importance of education so every one started going to school there are maintaings there surroundings neat clean .

Those days there are no clubs , play grounds , camps .
If childrens want to go to school they need walk miles .
But in these days we can see clubs play grounds , schools and many things in each and every colony .
these young people are able to earn money a lot they are able to spend for them self and helping others .
Even though they might not help in direct through hand but they are donating monry to some clubs .

By this i like to say that young people are helping for the development of there communities .
