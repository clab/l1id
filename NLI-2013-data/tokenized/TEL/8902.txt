Ideas are caused by thinking intensely or doing indepth research about any particular subject .
Understanding the concept will make the person researching that particular subject a versatile in that particular subject .

A fact may leave the student only with the outer layer of an indepth knowledge related to that subject rather than understanding `` what lies beneath '' .
During my tenure as a trainer with a particular organization i trained a lot of students to become effective workers .
And this experience makes me suggest that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than knowing facts .
When i trained employees regarding a product i.e aquring transportation permits for various trucks and tractors , I always had to talk about indepth details , about `` concepts '' .
Otherwise the person will not be able to decipher from the request as to what kind of permit he/she has to order for .
The concept of what decides a requiremnt should be understood rather than just knowing the requirement .

For example , a customer requests for a permit for a particular type of vehicle to travel interstate ( that it is not licensed for ) , which usually is provided by the company and if the vehicle is used by a red cross organization which does not necessarily have to acquire as per the law .
Now theoritically the agent taking the request should provide the permit .
Now this is where concept and ideas play a vital role .
If the agent did not pay attention to these concepts during training he/she will probably end up issuing a permit which is not required .

Another simple example : If a student knows a fact that the light bulb functions with just a press of a switch , he knows pretty much what he is supposed to know .
But , when faced a challenge with the light bulb not functioning if he does not know what different components of that tubelight emit light and what other products make it work , he probably will not be able to make it work .
Instead , he would be wasting time waiting for a technician to attend to it .

An equally interesting example is mathematics .
If students do not understand the ideas and concepts of formulas and how to work with them to find a solution for a particular problem then knowing just the fact which is just a formula would not help them solve differnbt problems of the same nature .

Therefore , I conclude by saying that students should definitely pay more attention to understanding ideas and concepts more than just learning facts .
Not just students at school but students in all walks of life .
