Yes , I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
hence I eleborate below .

Students must know ideas concepts with this only the learn facts .
In schools universities they learn ideas and concepts with education .
By this knowledge they can learn facts .

If they understand the ideas and concept they can do what they want to do .
With this they will suceed .
Learning facts means by experince .
After concepts only we can learn .

Students has to understand ideas and concepts so that they can learn facts fastly .
Without concept we cannot learn facts .

Hence on weighing pros and cons the statement is agreed .
The importance for students to understand ideas and concepts .
later they can learn facts .
Strike the iron when it is hot .
Facts are the past records and experience .
