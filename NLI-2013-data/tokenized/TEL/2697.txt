I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
It is the stage i think , is more comfortable to enjoy our living .
I feel so because it is practically noticed that young one 's have lot of zeal in them which makes them more active .
The young people work hard for heir future and at times never let their enjoyment go down .
For example consider a student who plans to pass in distinction in the annual examination .
For achiving this the student works hard the whole year , apart from this the student doe n't miss any other activities that involve enjoyment .

Young stage is the only stage where we can do anything as we can , no matter wheather it is right or wrong .
It is the period where things which cant be done when we become older can be done without any hesitation .

They do what ever they want to do so that they can enjoy up to the maximum .
For example they can dance , swim , play with the friends , roam here and there , can eat all the stuff which they want to , go for racing , can go for a challenge , involve themselves in entertaining programs etc .

On the other part they can enjoy doing what ever their interest is in .
Like in research field , software , where they can makeup their mind set accordingly .
Last but not the least i deal with the facts that everyone knows that the young stage is the most preferable stage where everyone finds it interesting when compared to other stages in our life .

Lastly i conclude saying that the young people enjoy life more than older do .
