I do agree the statement that successful people try new things and take riss rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , by accepting this statement i use to explain it by taking some examples actually all are people but people with aim are less so they are the people called successful people , that people wil ame a success in every thing that what do they do .

In my view people with aim could get a complete success than people witout aim , life with aim is a challenge thing and in that life ther is a thrill and enjoyment and then life will never get embrassed .
According to this passage the successful person will always try new things and take risks rather than only doing what already they know and how to do well that work , so that they can do the work in a new way .
So this is the nature of the successful person , the person will always find a new things which he does n't know that , so that he will take it as a challenge and make it success .

Coming to example , i use to take example of myself that , i want to do my masters in US so that i was preparing for that , why iam using this example , i was not settled financially but i was trying it hardly by putting it as my aim and i will surely suceed in that , up to this age i did a routine thing that every one doing and made a success and i called as a successful person and as a successful person i use to make a new thing in my life that , making a masters in united states of america , i think life is the better example for every thing so that i choose this example for this passage , and statement includes that successful person wil not do the work that already knows means he/she already now about that by doing again the samething that is a time waste and a succesful person will never do time waste he/she will utilise the time which he/she had so that he called as a sucessful person .
So by using this example i agree the statement of the successful person will does n't do the thing which already know and how to do well .
So these all are my views and examples to support myself .
