Every person enjoys life in his or her own way .
Though , I personally believe that youngsters enjoy life more than older people do .

Firstly , the reason why i think so is that as we grow older the responsibilities we have only get more and more .
For example , when I was a kid studying nursery I didnt have any resposibility at all or for that matter very less .
When I was in high school I had to study well to get admission into a good college .
Then in High school I had to get decent grades and also had to help my parents in their work .
Though it was not a burden for me , it surely was a responsibility which i had to do as their daughter .
As a person grows their responsibilities also grow , not just as an individual but also as a person in the family and in the soceity .

Also most of the youngsters tend to take life in a lighter way than the older people .
So we enjoy that phase of our lifethe most .
The older people have already undergone things in life , that make them plan for their future in a certain way or save money for their family .
But the young people tend to spend their money on luxurious things or on more enjoyable things .
For instance , When I was in college I used to spend most of my money on shopping and stuff .
That was enjoyment for me then .
But now I realise the importance of saving money for the future and I shop only when I have the need for it .

Another important point I 'd like to mention is that enjoyement lies in the way we perceive it .
Most of the young people do not have anything major to worry about .
They enjoy the life they are living , doing things at their own pace .
All they have to bother about is their studies .
This is not the case with the older people .
Their lives are more or less very stressful , be it due to family problems or tensions in the work place .

In conclusion , I would say that a person enjoys his life the most when he is young .
