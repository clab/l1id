The population of the world is growing at a tremendous pace also the technology is growing .
As the technology is growing it has become more attainable and affordable . ''
In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
I disagree with the statement .
With the changing phase of mans life and emergence of improved standard of living I really believe there could be many more cars than there are today .

The population of world has been continuously increasing .
And so the the number of people out to suceed in life and make a mark of themself are also considerably many .
Every successful man would like to own a car someday .
This is everyones dream .
So the possibility of number of cars in the world could be multiplying at a very huge rate considering that many people realise their dream .
As the population is growing the market for various commodities and necessities of man are also growing .
In this process of expansion of the market the prices for variious commodities are coming down by a huge margin .
So the cost of the commodities are also coming down because of increasiing market and competition .
The market is flooded with goods and competition between the producers of these goods has also become high .
More the competition , the producers tries to attract more customers .
In order to attract the coustomers the only way being an affordable price of the goods in the market .
In this way the prices of various goods have come down drastically .

Now , considering the advent of technology and globalosation of many industries the income and standard of people has improved stupendously .
There has been a considerable elevation in the standard of living and stature in the society .
So the affordability pf people has also increased .
So the demand for products that were once only reachable to a ceratin section of people has increased following the increase in the standard of living for many poeple .
Car is one such commodity that was once a dream for many a poeple has now become possible to acheive and many people are dreaming about it .
And the important thing is that many are realising their dream .
So the number of poeple who can afford a car are increasing and so are the number of cars .

The number of cars in the next twenty years could be at sky high following the study of the market and increasing affordability of poeple .
It is going to be revolutionary change of the world in next twenty years considering not just the cars but various other goods that would flood the market .

So there would be many more cars than those existing today in twenty years from now and there could be many more developing nations evolving and increased number of poeple who would enjoy life even more with all these changes .
