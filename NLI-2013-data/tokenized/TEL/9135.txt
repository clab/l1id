Students need to learn somethings that are worth to understand thoroughly based on concepts while some other things are learned based on the experiments .
So i feel both are important tecniques to make the students thorough with the subject .

The students can learn the topic of their study by understanding the concept completely .
For instance , take the case of a professor teaching stating that they are 108 elements existing in the nature and probably they are some more unidentifyed yet are true .
Here the student duty is to understand about the nature and characters of the elements instead of raising the question about their practical existence .
Although this way of learning the things makes the students far from understanding but the professor cant help but to teach in his own style .
But in some cases the students are made to better understand by drawing the pictures .
That way the professor can help the student to memorize the subject .

On the other hand some topics are better understand when they are shown experimentaly .
For instance that the case of professor explaining the fact of water existing in three forms .
It is known fact that water exists in ice , water and vapor form .
This can be explained easily .
Water can be converted into ice below zero degree temperature that explains the concept of melting point of water .
In the same way water heated to 100 degree temperature so that the phenomenon of evaporation is observed .
This explain the boiling point of the water .
This form of teaching is best for the student to grasp the subject easily .
This visual way of teaching make the student to remember the topic for a long time .

To sum up , some topics like explaining the unobservable facts need the students to understand the concept thoroughly .
While other topics explained based on experiments can be thought easily .
Eventhough the experimental technique offers more advantage to students but not always applicable way to teach .
So i feel both techniques should be used to make the student to comprehend better in the subject .
