`` Young people enjoy life more than older people . ''

Yes , I agree with the given statement perfectly .
Because of several reasons as follows ,

* At the young age people are not yet matured as the people of older age , so that they can enjoy the life with out any limits .

* Similarly there is a lot of difference in their daily life span of living such that , the young people does'nt have that much responsibilities when compared to the older people .

* If we consider an example , the young man that he is not got married .
He enjoys his life with his freinds and parents in many ways , such as in parties in functions etc. , because he does not need to go to home earlier that he did not got married .

* But where as the old man who got married have to go home early because he has lot of responsibilities of his family .

* Because the old man lives with his wife and the childrens that there are so much work to do with .

* But where as the young man will enjoy till the midnight of the parties where ever he likes .

* If we note the point that this old man also enjoyed in his young periond so that he now got some responsibilities .

* The young people also has some responsibilities internally , about the future and the studies .
But these are not the major problems when we compare to the problems of the olde man has in his life .

* And another thing if we note that some older man also enjoy a lot than the young in some situations , such that these older man are already settled their life and also the life 's of their childrens also with lot of money in their pocket .

* But these situations are much rare ones because some old people gets settled and some will not suceeds in thier life .
Similarly some old people gets soon settled and some will be late .
So by these variations there will get some difference between them .

* Where as this is not the case in Young people , because upto a particular age they will depend upon their parents untill they can get a job .
From there onwards also they will enjoy a lot with their own money and exenses .

* Finally the conclusion is that the `` Young people enjoy life more than Older people '' .
