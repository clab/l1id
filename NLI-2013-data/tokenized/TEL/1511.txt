I would disagree with the statment , the reason being is that it would lead to nothing except confusion .
Having a general idea about various subjects is preferable rather than persuing full time study on all the subjects .
A student who prefers to study all the subjects will have to work much harder than the student who has only choosen specialization in one subject .
Specialization in one subject , will have a clear idea as to what to persue next with regards to that particular academics and could plan for a better career .

Even career opporutunities would be good for the student who has specialization .
Let us take an example of Med-school students .
One student decides to take cardiology as the specialization and other chooses to study many specializations .
The student who chooses cardiology will have concentrate totally on the specialzation which he chooses and can be a master in that specialization .
This student can work in corporate hospitals which are related to cardiology .
On the other hand the student who chooses many specializations will have to work really hard and to get on top it , it would be very difficult for him and some times it may result that he ends up with nothing .
This person will have hard time in choosing his career field as well .

The above example clearly states , what would be the advantage of specialization and with that of knowledge about many subjects .
Even if you look at the students of business administration , you would see that they will choose either one specialization or dual specialization , but not more .
Even the schools and colleges would give a over all idea of the various subjects and then it will be divided into specializations .

Even the person who would opt for broad knowledge of many academics will have to be specialized in one particular subject at the end of the day , since he/she needs to choose a career path which leads to a specialization .
The statement looks better to read on the paper to have many academic subjects , but in practical it would be very much tough to acheive it , although there are people who are persuing many specializations , ideally it would be suggest to have one specialization .
