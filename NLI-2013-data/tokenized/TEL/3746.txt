i do agree this statment but then they cannot generalise this .
we have got some statements to support our proposition .

nowadays people are becoming busy with their own work and not finding the least of the time to help and bring up the community around them .

the generalisation is unfair based on the fact that the voluntary organisations are still holding their services and they are not extinct .
ofcourse this proposition is validated in a way that atleast their number has gone down .
this is because a few of the young may be really interested in helping the society .
also very few classes in young students may find these activities helping their career in turn .
for example humanities and social sciences students find that these activities are improving them in their academic career .
so even if they work they may not be working wholeheartedly .

in that way the no of people finding a career in these sciences are in turn very few .
so partly the proponent is true .

people who are more interested may not find time to carry out these activities beside their careers .
the careers heading in one direction and themselves in the other .
in that way the current society losing the devoted people .
there should be an organised program to bring up these people towards streams like humanities and social sciences .
this may be a pratical difficulty .
so , i am saying that this statement is true to some extent .

some people are leading their careers to dual careers .
in that case obviously those people are more devoted .
and atleast they ar

also people are more or less selfinterested and they can n't help others .
the reason being their needs and desires are not satisfied and they spend almost all of their time in meeting their demands .
not the least they take care of others in such a case .
one possible reason for such an attitude in young people is that they are new to this world , they look at others and try to imitate them .
this in turn brings in desires to these souls .
and they want to enjoy their time meeting their demands .

so even if it so there are people committed enough to live for others .
we have got several examples in our history to support our statement .
for example everybody in our country knows the name of mother teressa .
because she is one of those devoted to these activities .
she made her life `` living for the poor and the diseased '' .

when you remember certain people like her we may feel that the given proposition is unfair .
but in most other times the statement is true and we have got our souls to give the evidence .
