I would say that young people give or may not give enough time to help their communities .
it depend upon individual mentality .
If one wishes he can help but it depends on many factors like time , interest , responsibality and many more .
if one wants to help he wil help without considering these factors cos he may love helping them .
if one does not wants to help even if he has all those factors he wil not help .

For example if ones sees his parent suffering from some pain he may not help .
there may be many reasons for this also like not freindly atmosphere with his parent etc .

Helping one needs courage because without it one is nothing in his life .
so one needs this factor also .
one might not help because he might hav been had busy shedule like work and many more .

If one is busy even if he wishes he will not be abel to help one .
helping communuties not requires young people but all the ages .
nowadays some youngsters are become so busy spending their time in pubs , caffe days , eatouts they waste their tome spending in these places so where will they get the time for communuties .

But some are not indluged in such activities so that they get enough time to spend .
so such people are very effectioned towards such communuties .
But one is more interested to get wealth so they far away places in such situations they might have enough time ot give their communuties .
even they may indulge in some friendship which avoids them to stay far away and not give enough time .

Hence i conclude saying that it depend upon individual mentallity to give enough time ot give their communuties .
