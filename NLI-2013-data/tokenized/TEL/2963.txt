Young people enjoy life more than old people do .
I agree twith the statement because they are more energetic and have a great physical and mental ability to work , to earn , to play and what not . ''
A fit body has better brains '' and this makes young generation to enjoy the life more .
Older people are capable of giving the ideas based on their experiences but could not implement them as they lag the physical fitness required for heavy works and also being slower in doing a work .

Children at school have great fun in learning , playing , doing innovative projects , being with parents , expressing their views in various ways such as drawing , moulding of clay , building some metal structures using small pieces of metal .
At the age of 16 they learn to apply the ideas which helps in inventing new devices or theories that were unsolved or were remained as a mystery so long .
Also the future of the nation depends undoubtedly in the hands of the younger generation .

When you take a look at the past twenty years the role of younger generation in every field has increased gradually .
If a work is alloted to a group of young individuals they take that work as a challenge , strive to complete that as quickly as possible and they even enjoy working for something they want to .
Younger people look for enjoyment in every work they do .
For an example I enjoy working for my studies , for my career and earning for my family and in helping others to develop .
There are many things which the older people cannot do as the young do .
Bill gates was young when he started research , Srinivasa Ramanujan was a young mathematician , Shakuntala Devi was young for her intelligence in answering mathematical questions and puzzles as fast a super computer , Adolf Hitler was Young when he wanted to rule the world .

In the near future we will be able to see the young and dynamic youth ruling .
Education and Research , Politics , Science , Business and in all the fields .
The energy , The entusiasm , The innovative ideas , The spirits and many other factors make the younger generation enjoy life more than the older people do .
