I think that learning facts is more important for a student than to understand ideas and concepts .
But i do think that ideas and concepts are also important .
I think this way because if a student is able to know the facts in reality then he can understand the concept very well .
i can take myself as example in the statement which i made .
During my schooling , i was tought about various concepts and ideas of biological science but i was n't able to understand very well because the teachers were not giving a facts about the science that is experiments which were given in the textbook was n't being demonstrated in the class .
Due to that i was not clear about the topics or concepts covered in my schooling .
In my bacholers i took biological science as my major and here it was not the same case as that was in the school days .
Here i was able to understand the concept and ideas what are being thought .
This is because i was applying all the concepts and ideas in the real life .
i do n't say that concepts and ideas are not at all important but they are a little less important than to learn facts .

i can tell that it may be any subject which a student takes but he can better understand the concept if and only if he finds that in reality .
i also agree that only a few students can understand the subject through ideas and concepts which are given in the textbook and the other case of students finds a different source to study that is muging up the ideas and concepts and present them in the final paper .

Thus , atlast my statement is that learning the facts should be given more importance than understand ideas .
A student can better understand an idea only when it is applied in reality .
