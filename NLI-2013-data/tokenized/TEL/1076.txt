I disagree with statement about to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects rather specializing in one specific subject .
It is always better to have one subject to get specialised more because it makes the person strong enough to compete for certain jobs which especially requires specialization in some particular subject .
I have presented some examples below to support my arguement .

I have got two friends who are studying their undergraduation in `` MECHANICAL '' , `` MECHATRONOICS '' as their majors .
The subjects involved in mechanical are purely related to concepts based on mechanical .
But the subjects involved in mechatronics are related to mechanical , electronics , little bit of computer science , i.e mechatronics is a combination of the subjects .
when my both friends completed their undergraduation in their respective fields , i observed that the person who done his major in mechanical were able to hire or get the job easily .
In case of other friend this has not happened .
Here he is eligible to attend the companies which requries mechanical .
electronics , computerscience background knowledge independently , that sounds to be more specification in the subjects mentioned above .
Here my friend was unable to pursue the job as he lacks more knowledge in depth to be required for a particular company .
Therefore for every individual it is essential to have an keen thorough knowledge or specialization in particular academic subject rather than having a broad knowledge on many subjects .

This case can better be explained in case of field of doctor 's profession .
As we all know that a doctor who is specialized in one particular organ of our human body , say eyes , heart , kidney etc. , are more valuedand paid than the doctors who have got enough knowledge on all aspects of the human organs .
This is the reason why kidney specialists , heart specialists etc. , have more fame than other doctors who do n't have any specialization degree in any organs of oyr human body .
