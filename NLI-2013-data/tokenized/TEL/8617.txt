I agree with the given topic that students should understand ideas and concepts then they can learn the facts When one to know about any thing he ca n't directly learn from them facts because he ca n't undersatnds the facts clearly .
fi any one want to know about any thing first we should know what is it and how it does and so on ...

If any person is asked to do the problem first he understand wat the problem is then only he can do the problem , with out understanding the problem he can not try for that .

Let me take an example of newtons third law `` Fr Every Action There Will Be Equal And Opposite Reaction '' before leading to the facts one has to understand the concepts better then the facts .
for that one has to undesatnd the main idea of the law .
we does not know the exact facts around that Another Example take science experiments in lab first the student is adviced to understand the main idea of the problem , so by doing this he can pdo good work in the lab and he can know the facts clearly , wats going on ? .

If a bug arises in the program , it is a fact that the bug arrised , but with out knowing the idea we can not locate the where i.e in which part of the program the bug arised .
and also if manager sees the bug he doent know what to do , he calls the programmer who is families with the ideas and concepts of the programme .
This is one of teh fact where the concepts and ideas are most important , If a students understand the main ideas and concepts he can be familier with the facts .
Ther are facts which do n't have the reason one among them is `` Burmodas Triangle '' here we know the fact that any thing going upon the area is vanished , but we do n't know whats happening there , In this kind if we know the concept and idea cleary some what we can try to figure it out .

In our daily life we will be hearing a question `` what the concept you are using to fix the bug ? '' one can unerstand the fact clearly if concept and the idea is clerly known , so according to me one should learn and undersatnd the ideas , and concepts clearly
