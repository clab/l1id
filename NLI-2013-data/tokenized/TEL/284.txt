As far as iam concerned , i agree this statement .
Because understanding ideas and concepts are the basic steps to know more about facts .
However facts also having some importance for students .
Following are the reasons to support my choice .

Firstly , understanding ideas gives a basic step to think about the object .
If you understand clearly then its easy to estimate the quality and theory of that object .
Hence we need a extra concentration on understanding ideas and concepts .

Mostly every fact will have its own concept and idea .
Inaddition , if students concentrate well on understading ideas and concepts they can easily recognize the fact .
Some research studies indicates that students who having more concept will show highly recognizing nature than others .
For example will give mutch impotance to understanding ideas and facts , I really got sound knowledge in subject .
Also I can easily estimate the fact in a subject .

Futhermore , lot of the students will give mutch importance to concepts , because if you learn concepts it will take long time to forget .
By showing extra concentration on ideas and facts lot of students were written well on exams .
Most of the lectures will also give importance to concept because once a student learned concept very well than its easy to teach them .

However there is a need to understand facts , these are the conclusion to most ideas and concepts .
Several researchers saying that if a student having capability to recognize the fact than he is very sound in perticular subject .

As far as iam concerned , ideas and concepts can play a major role in determinig facts .
I can strongly support that ideas and facts are more important to students than facts .
Lot of researchers are also saying tha same .

By based on above reasons and supporting points I can safely conclude that conceprt is more important than facts for students .
