As far as its concerns me it 's true that young people enjoy more the older people .
As young people have the strong sprit in them to achieve anything under the sun , be it ragarding the sports , extra curricular activites and the hill climbing ( mountains ) .

In the modern world young people are ready to perform any difficult task bravely because they have the strong will power in them to achieve .

When we consider the sports , young people enjoy a lot by playing outdoor games like football ,, basket ball , base ball and also in the athelitics .
AND this keeps the young people PHYSICALLY and MENTALLY strong inorder perform any risky operation ...
And the older people may not possess equal strength as performed by the young people to play outdoor games ...
and merly the older people as only one chance to encourage the young childern ..

IN this modern world each any every young people want to be different from other youngesters , so he does things differently from the rest .
And he does this because so show that HE IS MORE TALENTED , and also he wants to `` gain appresetation '' from others ...
[ to be rewareded for his bravery ] and also he wants to be recognised as the UNIQUE PERSON ...

AND so i personally feel that all that activities performed by the youngsters cannnot be EQUALLY performed by the older people ..
SO youngesters enjoy a lot than the older people ...
