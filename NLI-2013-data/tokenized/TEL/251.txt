I agree to the above statement .
Its important for the students to undertand the ideas and concepts of the subject .
understanding ideas for any student is little difficult .
We need more concentration ability for clear understanding .

Generally we understand things when listen it or read about it .
Completely understang the concept is something that we need to spend lots of time for it .
Unversities should encourage the students for doing more projects in their intrested subjets .
This kind of system is avilable in very countries such america , uk , Australia and so on .

As the students does projects on the subject , they go deep into subject details , such how , where , and why .
This are key words in any subject to understand it completely .
If they just learn the facts its not usefull for them .
Most people forget what they learned in their lower classes .
Because learning facts it is something that we usually mugg up .
For example electical student as less knowledge than the electician , because the electrican practically works on it .
As the student just learns about it .

If profersior is explaing about Television , he should bring TV to his class rome and explain about its parts and its functioning , Not just theoritcalys explaing about it .
Universites should provide a machanism that concentrates on students pratical knowledge about subject .
And how he undertands ideas and concepts on it .
One such machanism is providing projects for the students .
And allowing him to choose the project of his age , so that he can understand it easily .
