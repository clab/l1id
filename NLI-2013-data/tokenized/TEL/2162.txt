Enjoying the life is more dependent on the factors like age , culture , workatmosphere and many more .
If one counts all the above factors it 's more obvious that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

A young person will be having the zeal to develope himself among the competitive world , here a person undergoes lots of pressure and stress may due to the work or due to the climate they work under .
So most of the people tries new ways to relief themselve 's from stress and strain so they outmost try to opt entertainment such as movies , parties and every possible way to get relief from the day to day work .

Young people enjoy not only with the people of their age group , or of the same culture , but they mingle with each and everyone , they find out new ways for entertainment .
They tend to locate different places and attend parties .

On the other hand old people tend to a similiar age group , they enjoy sitting with together and participate in religious function 's .
They donot feel that much stress or strain as the young people do .

As youngster 's would be more energetic than the old people thay do have lot of aspect 's for entertainment and fun , they have their unique way to celebrate , share their ideas and cultures which most of the old people would'nt prefer .

Mostly old people constrain themselves to a limited part , It does n't mean that they wont have fun and they do n't enjoy .
They will have their own way of life and their own prespective of living .
They constraint themselves to the religious function 's , or else with the small get-to-gether with the family member 's .
Most of the old peole prefer pleasent and stress life after their dutie 's , they prefer clam and pleasent atmosphere arround them .

In my point of view the statement given can be stated as the contradiction of the past and the present life of a man , since every old person is a youngster once a time before in the past .

As a conclusion i want to agree with the statement that `` Young people enjoy the life more than old people do '' .
Since it 's not the comprasion of past and present but it 's a comparision between two races such as old and new faces of a person .

I would end this by concluding that `` Young people enjoy more than the old people do '' .
