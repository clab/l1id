Yes , i agree with successful people tring to reseach in new things , because if all the scientists were happy by finding only one thing and to be perfect in that now we are unable to know about these many things and these many new inventions .

Todays life is very competative and the things are going very faster .
Human being has discovered many things even man landed on the moon also and he invented many things which are unbelivable and really wonderfull .

From the past human being was going on discovering some thing .
They do n't feel that they are taking risks they feel that they are inventing some thing usefull and help full for others .
If they feel that they are taking risk by inventing some thing today we are unable to know about these many intresting thing .
They discovered every thhing which is helpfull for human being and also which is harmfull for human being .

Six years back the whole world was suffered with Y2K problem but it was discovered .
Not only this human being has disovered to many things .
Today we are enjoying a convinient life and happy life because of all those successfull people .
We should encourage them to make new inventions and new discoveries .

They discovered every thing what was our past how a human being was in his past and they discovered many thing for the convinience of people for every thingfortransport , cooking , preserving etc .
Wht all things we wre enjoying today is becauseof them .

According to my view of concerned i belive that because of that successful people now we are here and we grow more higher in our future days .
So , here ends my statement and i agree that successful people trying new things is great .
