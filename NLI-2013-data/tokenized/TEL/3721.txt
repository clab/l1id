In this modern era of drastic changes of sceince and technology , young people play a predominant role .
They really assimulate all their potential in interpreting their skills in different areas and strive hard in attaning their desired results .
This young generation does not hinder any issues they have taken up and it shows their dedication and commitment in their work .

Nowadays , people are often engaged to their buzy schedules in making their future or in jobs and are less evident to their resposibility towards to communities they live in .
Buzy schedules may not be the prime cause of negligence but their are some more important issues to be considered like their might not be a Truthful leader who can make them realise of their resposibilities towards the society .

Young people are the essence of a country 's development .
They are the future citizens who act as a role model for futher generations to come when they are perfectly on a right path by the elders .
This can make them more responsible towards their duties .
One of the best examples like , last month a train accident occured in Banglore , India ..
as it was in the early hours thre was not any major helpline available but a bunch of boys who were Engineers have taken the resposibility not only to call for the helpline but also taking up the necessary first ais measures available in the train .

Another example , when the Katrina has hit the USA , basket ball teenagers organised a charity match between their fellow competitors and managed to gather about thirty thousand dollars for the victims .
They have recieved many applauds for their tremondous work for the humanity .

Also young people of diiferent countries have taken up the responsibility of joining the relief camps and to help the victims .
These dynamic people are really paying alot in terms of their service to the humanity .

Finally , young players nowadays are definetly working hard not only for themselves but also for the community inturn to the country .
All they need is some kind of encouragement in carrying out their duties towards the community .
