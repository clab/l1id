I do agree with the point that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today cars which are useful in travelling is very common today as it is one of the greatest invention of the centuary .
earlier it was asl status symbol , but now a days almost every man who are doing jobs had a car .

Although car is very useful in many ways the disadvantages it has overrides the advantages .
As it is one of the main cause for the pollution producing some hazardeous gases in the atmosphere .
this makes health problems to lot of people , people then realize that it is better to not to have car .

Nowadays cars are one of the main cause of traffic chaos in main cities , a survey tells that there are 100 cars on road per every minute , if this situation continues there will be lot problems on earth causing global warming .
today most people are educated and can understand the problems arising by the pollution .

Government and some other social organisation should take the responsibility to educate the people .
Goverment should pass some rules such as ` one car per home and if anyone having extra car have to pay some high tax ' , this type of steps may reduce the usage of automobiles .
it is responsibility of every individual to protect the earth and in twenty years every person will be aware of this and will take care of his earth by reducing the over usage of automobiles .
In next twenty years there will be less usage of automobiles .
as the situation will demand every person to do so .
otherwise there is danger for the mankind on earth .

thus based on point that automobiles such as cars are causing a lot of damage to the environment , i think there will be fewer cars in use than ther are now
