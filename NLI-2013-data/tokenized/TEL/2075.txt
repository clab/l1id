I agree the statement that , from the Past we come across the fact that younger people enjoy their life more compared to the older people .
People enjoy their life alot when they are young .
younger people has the stamina and consistency to do the their work which cannot possible for the older people .

The are several reasons that old people cannot enjoy more than the young .
Firstly , because their stamina is not consistent after becoming older .
There are several facts , some og them are they cannot eat their own food , they cannot getup themselves unless a person can help them .
secondly their maturity mind will not be same as when they are younger .
For example , my grandmother who is 80 years old she cannot do her own work by herself desperatly she a need help either from my mom or dad .
For instanace one day my grand mother sicked up and she cannot move a side from her bed then my mom helped her to take bathroom .
these are the some of facts of peole whose age is arround 60's .
we can know from the above statement that older people arround 60's cannot do their own work then how can they enjoy like younger childrens of 10 - 20 years children .
Once , when i are palying cricket in groung near by side of my house , my grand father came and said he want to play the cricket .
He played a single ball he suffered from severe chest pain .
The older people has no consistant and stamina compared to the younger one .

older people arround can enjoy their life in different fassion by leaving with their childerns and sparing alot of time with grand childrens .
ofcousre what they will expect more than that .
Their are both advantages and shortcomes for younger and older people enjoyment .
younger people enjoy playing with others and palying jokes and roaming here and their in bikes .
most of the times people enjoy while they are in schools .
The older people enjoy in their fashion buying some toys and neccessity items for the grand childrens and made them happy ofcousre no one can expect much more than that .

hence , I conclude that younger people enjoy their life in their own fassion and older people enjoy in differently from youngers which mentioned earlier in the passages .
i prefer both palys an important role in their lifes .
