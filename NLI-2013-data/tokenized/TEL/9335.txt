It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I agree with the author 's statement .
I have a few examples in my mind for which i can support the author 's statement .
The examples that i would like to sight are as follows .

Firstly , it is more important for the student to understand ideas and concepts rather than simply learning the facts because the knowledge achieved will be true knowledge and can be of more useful in practical applications of ones own life by understanding the the ideas and concepts throughly .
For example if we learn a formulae in mathematics class just as a fact it will be useless where as if you understand the idea and concept behind that formulae it will be of much practical use .
so it is necessary for each and every student to understand the ideas and concepts , without this one ca n't be aware of its practical application and his knowledge gained by learning a fact may be useless after days .
Hence it is necessary to understand the concepts and ideas throughly .

Secondly , it is very important to understand the ideas and concepts in the modern competitive world .
As the competition is growing day by day it has immense effect on understanding the concepts and present them whenever it is needed .
If a student merely learns the facts then he will be no where to compete with the student who understands the ideas and concepts and present them in a great manner whenever needed .
so it is necessary to understand the ideas and concepts to withstand the competition in modern world .

Furthermore it has many advantages in the carrer of a student who do this work perfectly by bunderstanding the ideas and concepts which will be helpful for a student to have a sound knowledge of the particular topic .
Thus it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
