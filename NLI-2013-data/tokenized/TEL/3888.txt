I personally agree with the topic that nowadays young people donot give enough time to helping their community .

Students in the present day modernised world are attracted to more of things like discos and pubs rather than social activities .
To make my opinion stronger i would like to take a personel experience .
On the eve of The Independence Day some of our college friends decided to do some thing good on that day .
As a part of it we decide to constuct a compound wall for a tribal school .
We sent requests to different colleges in need of volunteers .
But on that we were shocked to see that vrey few people turned out for that event .

One more reason why stuudents cant make to such events is that the world has become so competetive that students dont even get time to relax for one complete day .
For example my friends who are persueing thier graduate courses also aim for other exams like CAT , SAT etc .
Also they need to maintain their grades in thier regular graduetion course .
So its difficult for them to spend some time for the extracurricular activities .
Thus howmuch interest they have its not possible for students like them .

Finally the advent of internet in the 20th century revolutionised things very much .
It has made world into a global village .
Anyone can access anything in this world by just sitting at their homes .
This made young people from moving out of their places .
Thus making them lazy .
Hence seldom young people spare enough time to helping thier communities .

Thus from my personal experience i think that young people nowadays donot give enough time to helping thier communities .
