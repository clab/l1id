I agree with the statement because it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .

First factor is the age at this age as student it is better to learn the concepts and understand the ideas because at this age we should learn about the concepts which are first step for a student .
At this age student can easily get the point of concepts .
for example take a student of 7th standared in that class teachers teach the basics of the subject so it is time for him learn the concepts then facts .

Second is as the student grows older he can learn about the facts .
Any student how is getting older can learn from his past about the facts .
For example consider 10 th standard student as he gets older he realizes the facts in this world .
So it is better for him concertrate on his studies then knowing about the facts .

Third is it 's the time of student to improve his skills on the studies because if he improves his skills in it then he is automitacially learns about the facts in it .
For example consider a student how is studying 12th standard he learns from his past life the facts in it .
as he growsup he knows more about the facts so it is better for student to concentrate on understanding the ideas and the concepts .

Forth at the student age knowing about the facts can cause problems fro example it is not correct for primary student to know about sex in his childhood it tends to life of that student .

Finally i conclude that it is better for students to understand the ideas and the concepts then to learn facts at this age .
