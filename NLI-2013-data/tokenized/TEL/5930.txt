I disagree with the statement provided .
Because cars are the efficient transport of a man.cars are the easiest means of transport for the man today .
If the man wants to lead a luxurious life he must have a car .
In the modern day car has become the status symbol for a man .

I dont have any sort that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than today , as the population of the world is growing , we cant say that the use of cars will be less as compared now .
If the usage of cars is less then what the people are going to use ?

When compared to all the vehicles that are available now in the marked , the best transport that fits a family is car , which is affordable by a common man .
If one has to travel from one place to another , everytime he cannot afford to go by aeroplane , trains , when he is having the cheaper means of transport .

If a person has a car of his own , he does n't have to rely on the public transport such as buses , trains , trucks , aeroplanes etc .
Though there are other means of transport one should have a own vehicle such as car .
If he has a car it is useful to him at any part of the day .

The needs and desires of a man suggests to have a car .
A man has to face problems if he doesnot have a car .
If he has to travel urgently without wasting time he has to prefer a car of a flight .
The charges for the flight would be very expensive , so the man prefers to go by car .
If he has to go by means of public transport , lot of time will be wasted for him as he has to go to the nearby statins early to book a ticket and he has to wait for the bus to go .

So i dont agree with the above statement .
Hence cars are not going to be fleeting and they are the only means of transport which are going to be used by every person .
Hence there will be more cars than today , twenty years from now .
