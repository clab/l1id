Knowledge is wide spread and never ending if seen in a different point of view as new information keeps coming up everyday .
It varies according to the topics and information that is discovered from different places in the world .
You may never know when a major discovery might happen and to know what has caused this major discovery you need to obtain knowledge about that specific genre of study .
I agree with both the types .
I think learning a variety of subjects takes you a step above others and on the other hand concentrating on one subject also shares its part of success .
A person may go into a very deep analysis of the subject , learning everything that is related to it .
But I give a upper hand to learning more subjects , as it is more beneficial .

Learning more subjects tells you a lot than learning one subject , for example you can learn a different language which can come as great use when travelling .
Learning a widespread of subjects doesnt only limit upto languages but also a variety of subjects and the person who learns about various things has more information than the person who is just speacializing on one subject .
When learning many subjects one cannot really specialize in all .
If he wants to he can specialize in one of the subjects that he likes the most .

Learning one subject and specializing in it takes a lot of time and then when you want to specialize in a subject you also need to know other subjects that relate to it and also should have a appropriate ammount of information about them .
For instance if a person wants to speacialize in physics , he has to know a lot about math that is because math plays a crucial role in physics .
This does not apply to all the subjects but many of the subjects need relevant ammount of knowledge from other subjects in order to specialize in them .

When one learns more than one subject , he has a better shot at the open world than the person who is stuck onto only one subject as his chances are very limited when compared to the people who have taken up various subjects for study .
Having a broad knowledge makes you open to a lot of information and can help you in various ways for example in a debate or a quiz , since you know many subjects and things that relate to them it will not be a problem to answer but for people who specialize in one subject , they cannot battle the questions cause their knowledge is very limted and can answer questions which are related to their topic properly .

Knowledge is wide spread and everyone has the chance to aquire it and learning different subjects has its downs to as specializing in a subject has its own benefits .
But I still support the point that having a better grasp at differnet subjects at is better until I find convincing statements that prove specializing in one subject is better .
