Here i want to sight a quotation that `` who dares wins '' .
I feel that successful people are those people who have taken risk to do well in their respective fields or taken a risk of choosing a new field to succeed .

I feel that no proffession or venture of human is risk free .
For example if a man have money to invest , he should risk to invest the money in a new bussiness or even shares of some reputed companies .
If he does not take this risk to invest in one field or other , his money may loose it 's value after some period .
If this risk turns to be fruitful , we can say that the risk the man taken succeeded .
We can also say that the man is a successful man .

If a man goes on doing the same work he knows how to do well sometime or the other he will feel life to be boredom .
So taking risk makes man to live lively .
If our premature man have not taken the risk of finding fire , we might be eating the same raw meat and uncooked food .
If they have not taken the risk of hunting animals in those days the human race that we see now may not be existing .
If scientists have not taken the risk of spending their time or brain on inventing new things , we may not be in this developed world of high scientifisc adavancement .

In medicine field if the then doctors has not taken the risk to operate a person by surgery many diseases or injuries of little importance now might still be lethal to human life causing many deaths .
All the recent advances in the automobiles or aeroplanes is because of risk that was taken by our forefathers in developing them .

I feel that all the knowledge that we enjoy now in any field like space research or medicine is because of the risks that were taken by one or the other .

So in my opinion no proffession is risk free and there is no existance of this world if no one takes risk .
