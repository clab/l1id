The statement given makes a strong assertion , that we will see fewer cars on the roads twenty years from now .
This is a statement I disagree with and I will illustrate my rationale now .

Let us look at the possible grounds for this statement .
Petroleum , the current source of fuel for cars , is already facing the prospect of stock depletion .
Faced with ever-increasing demand ( ironically because of the increasing number of cars , among other vehicles ) oil prices have already touched 70 dollars a gallon ( a very considerable amount ) .
With fuel prices this high , how much longer can people afford to buy and use cars ?

Also a very pertinent issue is the alarming-level of pollutants that cars spew out .
Marked environmental changes like increasing health risks in Shangai City ( a study done very recently , in early 2006 ) , have finally brought more and more environmental lobbies and even corporations to sit up and ake notice .
With cars being one of the major sources for such pollution ; how long can they continue ?

The final potential nail in the venerable car 's tombstone might be very real , very visible , very pragmatic issue of space !
With cities ever increasing , cars are literally clogging the arteries of organised urban existance : the roads .
I have observed this in all the cities I have lived in so far : From Hyderabad to Mumbai to Guwahati in India ; From Frankfurt to Mainz to Paris and Amsterdam in Europe .
This problem is just as , if not more pronounced in US metropolises like New York or even Detroit .
With this being the case , how much longer can people even possibly drive cars ?

That is the present situation ; but its not a dire one .
Man , being the persistent , ever innovating construct that he is , is very really circumventing these very issues .
Petroleum is increasing in cost ; yes .
But no longer is petroleum the only viable source of fuel for cars .
Already , new sources of fuel ; from hydrogen cells to solar energy : from nuclear energy to most importantly , electrical energy are being harbored as sources of fuel for cars .
In my institute of study , a lot of work is being done on this very issue and we especially look at the Protius in the US or the smart cars in Japan , where Petroleum is no longer used .
With such potentially limitless new fuels ; cars are still going to live on .

Another fantastic characteristic of these new fuels is their harmony with nature ; the lack of any real threats to our environment .
This only reinforces their role as pragmatic lifeblood for the automobile .

The roads today are being choked up ; yes .
But what are we doing ? , we 're building more .
Its amazing to note that the top 10 civil engineering marvels of the modern age are either road networks , or bridges ( like the one at Shanghai airport ) .
We are countering this threat of traffic in new and wonderful ways .

A lot can happen in twenty years , but certainly not as much as this statement asserts .
Frankly , when I was a kid , I thought we would actually be living like the Jetsons now : but thats obviously not the case .
Before a day dawns when we buckle under the weight of our own contrivances ; before a day dawns when urban networks utterly degenerate into bedlam because of critical mass ; man will most certainly have contingency upon contingency .
Maybe a time will come when cars are no longer pragmatic at all .
But not within twenty years .

As the points I have made above assert ; I truly believe that cars will still remain on the roads twenty years from now .
