`` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
By entering into a specific subject , a person can have knowledge in his own subject only .
He cannot turn into a different fields of working .
according to the present situations and strategy , people should possess high source of knowledge and skill towards all kinds of fields .
For examples many companies are giving training about their projects and using several employes under their hand for the improvement .

They are just the person having communications among different aspects or not .
some specialisations like civil , mechanical , accounts and ect ...
have future among their own fields only .
They cannot come out for other sources and in different fields .
It is better to have knowledge over differnt fields for bright future .

Person having skill among various fields can work at different companies and can achieve more investment along with knowledge .
Most of the software companies are looking forward for persons who are knowledge among several aspects .
Thus , the need of knowledge over different acadamic subjects is better than to specialize in one particular subject .
