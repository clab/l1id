I srongly agree the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are becuse , advertisement is showing up their product to evrybody and products has lot of compition so they try to tell thier product has more worthful and more better than the other produts .

in the same way , same product has lot of compition in the society so they tells about teir product throught advertisement but they did n't think about the quality of product .
Forexample last month I watch the adverticement about Dove Shampoo .
So i thought is was good shampoo .
i bougt it 15 days ago .
I used last thursday .
i felt like it was not good in qualitywise .
After that I realised advertisement shows more eligant but quality wise not good .

like wise , this product hsa more worthful than other product .
As an example , last week I saw the Advil Tablet advertisement .
Then i disided to buy advil when i got headache .
so yesterday i bought Advil for headace .
I used Advil tablet than Thylinol nevertheless , It takes same time for decresing my headahc But , it shows in advertisement it reduse the headache faster than others
