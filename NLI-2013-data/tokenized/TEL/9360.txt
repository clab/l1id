I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

It is very important for students to understand things or ideas which are told by the teacher or parents .
The understanding ideas will be immensely benfitical to the students in many ways .
if the students having this capability to understand things they can acheive any thing , that means they can win in any feild .
This capability of understanding is also useful in their future .
I mean this understandability is useful while spending with their friends , and with their life partners .
If there is good understanding between friends and lifepartner , There is no possibility of clashes .

The students should having this understanding capability from their childhood .
The teachers and parents must having the responsibility of learning this capability to the childrens .

This understanding capability stands a person in very high position in the society .
thes kind of people can survive any where in the society .
And these kind of people can solve their problems and they can solve their neighbours problems also .
There by the people automatically give respect to them .
And there by they can increase their friend circle .
it is benfitical to them .

ILerning facts also important for the students .
But it takes lot of time for learning facts .
In this mean time people may do many mistakes .
Rather than learning , if the people having the capacity of understanding ideas there may be little chances to do the mistakes .
for example if we can understand if touch the fire , it burns , we never comit that mistake .
if we are not that capacity of undersatnding , the fire burns us .
Thats why the undersatnding capability is very important for students .
