For the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , in the question i strongly agree the statement .

I agree this because of some many reasons .
Firstly a Success can not be done with out taking risks and there is a proverb `` NO PAINS NO GAINS '' .
I agree , successful people try new thing and take risks , because there is no communication between the people who were far if Graham Bell not invented the Telephone .
The reason is basically Graham Bell is a engineer in electrical and have some knowledge of electromagnetic waves .
Graham bell worked a lot and took risks for inventing this Telephone apart from is electrical knowledge .

The second reason i agree this statement is because Computer is invented my Charles Babbage who is succesful person .
For inventing this computer charles took so many risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Charles Babbage firstly invented a big computer called super computer .
It occupies very large area and requires a lot of electrical power .
But after working hard and taking so many risks he invented a small computer called Personal Computer , which we are using daily .
This computer occupies less area and requires less amout of electrical power .
This shows that always a successful person works for new thing taking risks .

Finally agree , this statement from own experience .
When i was in tenth standard my mathematics teacher given me a problem which is easy to solve and i solved it .
In the next hour he given me a difficult problem which is based on previous problem .
He asked me do on the board and i solved it .
But when teacher asked my classmate to do same problem on the board .
He is not able to do on the board because he copied first problem from me .

In conclusion , considering above example i strongly state that succesful people try new things and take risks
