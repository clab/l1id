It is important for the students to understand the ideas and cocepts and also to learn the facts about those ideas .
This is because only knowing the ideas does n't help them to understand the theories accurately .
The facts help them to get the live ideas of the theories they study .

For example if we consider the lightening and the sound which will occur during the time of rain gives them the idea that the sound is heard before that the light appears .
This is the idea that every student knows .
But the fact behind it is that the sound travels faster than the light so it happens as such .
So it is important for the students to know both the ideas and facts of any theory .
Just knowing the idea without the fact makes it waste as they could n't apply any where .

As experience is the best teacher , the facts they come across in their day to day life even helps them to understand some new ideas that they learn in their classes .
If the student just understands the concept of the way of arranging all the parts of an automobile in the mechanics class and if he or she do n't know the facts based on that that is how to do it practically , it is not possible for them to arrange it in the real life time .
In all the ways it is necessary for a student to know the ideas and concepts as well as to know the facts .

As I am a student doing a project now and as I see my friends who know only the ideas but not facts suffering because of their lack of knowledge based on it and I myself doing the project and answering the questions related to my project without any difficulty as I know the facts of the subject on which my project is based on .

So I can say that if the student knows both the ideas and facts then only he or she will come out with flying colours in their real life .
