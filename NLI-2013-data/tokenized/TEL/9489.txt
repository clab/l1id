I agree with the statement that it is important for a student to undersand ideas and concepts .
I belive this because in basically a student should should have curiosity to know more new things this can be achived by understanding the ideas and the concept .
Without curiosity there is no fulfillment of the purpose of studing .

One reason i belive this because while understanding the ideas student develop his practical way of thinking the subject and new ideas raise questions in the mind .
In order to solve those questions understanding the concepts is important .
for example when the student is working in a physics laboratory if he is familer the concept of the instruments then he can play with the instruments otherwise he hesitate to touch them .

Another reason ideas and concepts are more use ful because in understanding the subject the understanding of ideas and concepts is important .
for example if a student dont know the cocept of vibration he cannot understand about the sound .

lastly it is important to understand the ideas and the concepts is when we are familer with the ideas and the concept of the subject then automatically we come to know the facts .
all the time we cannot relay on the facts ever time .

in conclusion to to above points it is important to understand ideas .
