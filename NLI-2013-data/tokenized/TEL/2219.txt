I strongly agree on the statement that young people are enjoying there life than older once .

As per the changing of the time the people have to change .
In the older days there were be certain restrictions given to stop things tobe done which give lot of happiness .
Consider the situation of my parents .
They have certain to point out , many restrictions over there life 's .
The education what my grandfather insist to study , my father continued .
But it is different in my condition , i have my own views to which i can and i do probably .

In the same way many cases , consider another example in which older peole are not that much free to their children , as the thing they missed lot of things to share to their parents for example some college situations .
But the children now are enjoying each and every moment of their college life with their co-students and sharing the things to parents and commenting .

And the other more is improvement of technology .
In olden days there were not any amusement parks , recreation clubs , theatres and stuff like that .
But the improvement of technology gave lot of fun over life .
The younger people are able to enjoy themselves by going to parks , recreation clubs , parties along with friends and tours .
And the tours will give lot of fun along with the information about the places where people are going .

In this way i can give the examples like this to tell many things and the young people are having the ability to do there things of their own with fun , but previously people have to depend on some one to complete any work which they want to do .
So i strongly agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
