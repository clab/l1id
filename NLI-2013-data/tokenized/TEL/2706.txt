I dont agree to the topic given to me that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This is because , enjoyment is a vague term and there is no unique way of measuring enjoyment .
The defination of enjoyment changes from person to person .
I ca n't take a firm stand and state that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .

Lets take my own example .
As a young guy , I love playing sports , freaking out with my friends , going on an adventurous trip , listening to music etc .
I enjoy myself when I involve in these activities .
This is enjoyment for me .
Lets take the example of my grandfather .
He is not in a position to do all that I can do , but that does n't mean that he does not enjoy life or enjoys less than I do .
He enjoys the serenity of the place he lives in , he enjoys playing with us and also enjoys spending quality time with our family .
This is the meaning of enjoyment for him .
What I really ca n't do is to measure his degree of enjoyment and compare it with mine .

The defination of enjoyment might also change when I take an example of an other old man or an other young guy .
Lets consider an other old man who is fully fit and is in a position to indulge in all the activities that I really enjoy .
Though , the old man might not perform to the same level as I can but there is a possibility that he might enjoy doing the same .
Even in this case , measuring his degree of enjoyment and comparing it with mine is not possible .

Lets take the example of an other young guy who defines enjoyment as attaining success in his desired field of study .
He might enjoy each and every step that is involved in making him a successful person .
The same activity can be done by an old man but he might define enjoyment in a different way .
He might enjoy only by reading the same and not having any sort of concern towards the result of such a study .

I conclude my essay by saying that the term enjoyment is very vague and its difficult for me to take a firm stand on who enjoys more until and unless I am provided with a method or a formula that measures the degree of enjoyment for each and every individual .
