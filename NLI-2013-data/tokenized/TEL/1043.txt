Gaining knowledge is a never ending process .
Hence knowledge is considered to be Divine .
Knowledge has played an important role in life , which the humans always tried to attain .
Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a very good sign .
Knowledge is attained in various phases of life .
From an adolescent stage in primary school to the graduate level .
Considering the aspect of undergraduate study in a field of science , consists of various academic subjects to learn .
They form a pretty important basic block in the learning process .
In this period of study each and every student is exposed to the different academic subjects that he/she is pursuing .
Each and every subject he/she learns is connected to different subjects .
These subjects provides a variety of information which the students gain in the period of their study .
If the study is restricted to a single subject being specialized then no of questions are left unanswered that are related to the respective field of undergraduate study .

I agree with the gaining of knowledge with no of academic subjects is better than to specialize in a single or specific subject .
Specializing in a single subject in undergraduate level will lead to complex problems of the student not having enough information in developing a model which the student usually pursues in life .

Once the undergraduate study is pursued by a student , the student is more aware of different subjects and the knowledge he has gained in period of his study .
All the knowledge he has gained is only a superficial layer that acts upon the student .

The requirement of specializing in a single subject arises now . ''
Jack of all trades Master of none '' .
The quote gives us an illustration of how the student is incomplete without a specialization of a particular subject .

In conclusion having a broad knowledge with no of academic subjects is as much necessary as that of specialization in a particular subject .
The Study has to be in done in different periods rather in a single time .
