Some people think that having board knowledge of many subjects is better than having knowledge in one specified subject .
But I disagree with it .
As I think specilization in one subject is better than having board knowledge about many academig subjects .

Firstly , having specilization in one subject , the person can have good hold on the subject .
The person will have the details of the minor topics of the subject .
It will prove to be helpful from his job perspective .
He can be able to perform his job very well without anyone 's help .
He will be able to solve any kind of problems .
Thus proving to be more successful in his career .
This may not be possible if the person had not done specialization in one subject .
For example , the person may put his creativity and develope more intresting things as he ha more knowledge on the subject .

Secondly , the person can have full confidence on what he is speaking .
He can also help others in that subject .
He can attempt to carry out some research in that perticular subject , provide more information about the subject and also gain more information about the subject .
This way he can not only improve his knowledge int subject but also help others improve their knowledge by carrying out the research .
For example , by putting in his knowledge on the subject he can develope new and reviced theoriea that would prove to be helpful to others who use it later on .

By having board knowledge of many subjects , the person may not be able to achieve the height of the success that he could by having specialization in one subject .
That would be so , because he would have minimum information about every subject , and that he cannot go deep into any subject .
Thus limiting his creativity .

Thus I disagree with the statement which say 's `` it is better to have board knowledge of many acadimic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject .
