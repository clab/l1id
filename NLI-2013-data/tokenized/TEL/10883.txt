In my opinion Successful people try new things and take risks also .

In the whole world every one wants to try new things and some people only takes risks .
so in that risks some one will succeced and some one will not succeced .

Some people will try for new things .
In that case the people who had already done research in that one some people take that one and also study in that also .
why means they want to try for the new things .

Some people have the idea to try some things and they will do also but they do n't know how to keep that in a well manner .

In our world many scientists discover many things .
For example `` Charles babbage '' invented computer .
So this computer is playing an important role in every human lifes .
so the whole world is using this computers .
Many scients invented many things like Lights , Printing machines and etc .. , .
so the scientists are the successful people .
why because they had tried for new things .

So in my opinion every one has to try for new things .
so that we can gain more knowledge .
But every one ca n't efford for the new things .
why means for new things to discover lot of money must be needed .
so all will not have so much money .

For this reason the students or who ever wants to try for new things can come forward and they should ask the Government to provide some things .

The government should come forward and they must encourage the students .
so if they tried for good things the country will get a good reputation .

Finally those who are talented they must come forward and they have to use the resources what they had .
so that he wil be in a good position .

I agree with this statement .
successful people must try for new things and they must also take risks .
In thse days with out risk nothing can be done .
