I agree the statment `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' becouse most of the successful people belive in hard work and they will have avery much enthuyazam to make expariment .

According to the example it can be state vary acuratly .
the famous sceintist gam bell who invented the phone which is using now a days .
will he is doing he expariment on the phone many thimes he was failed but he did not dissapointed he had dedicated his life fo this exapariment this show 's his hardwork and his dedication .
he condectend his exapariment nearly thousend times .
Douing the single expariment in difarent method is not so eassy .
after getting successful in his exapariment he never repeteted his exapariment every thime he make new method to get the product .

In caser of many other famouse person who are invalved in many expariments they know as most successful person .
after they invention is competed they never starts his expariment again .
they always think new to do they never look back the successful people love to take risks rather than only doing what they already know .

The most successful people never care about the money and socity value the allways think about new things they never think to save the money and they least bothered about this fucher they bilive in the hard work and dedication towords the work .

The successful people never show intrest on the rewad and publisity they do there work in secret and aftere the successful copletion of his expariment then ther come in to the light of public .
they bilive in more and more hard work so this ststment is fals .
we need to encarage the successful people to make the new thing in fucher .
