i disagree with the statement that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because it is very difficult to gain full knowledge on all subjects , nobody in this world i think who knows everything , every one in this world is specialised in a particular thing for example a pilot he knows everything regarding an aeroplane but ask him about a train he may not b able to discuss .

i have seen many elder people giving me an advice saying that `` traveling in both the boats is always difficult '' well it wos an advice given to me by my teacher when i wos preparing for an entrance exam while pursuing my engineering he said if you are really interested in the entrance exam then concentrate on it rather comin to the school because going school and studying for an entrance will not land u any where u neither able to get good marks in your engineering nor you get selected in the entrance it worked out for me got good marks in engineering when i left studying so we can consider this example for the given statement .
if we want to acquire the broad knowledge on many academic subjects we cannot able to master in all the subjects which is of no use in this society to get a good job even for working it is important to master a specific subject unless u have a complete knowledge reagrding a specifi subject hoa can anubody offer you a good job u just cant get a job saying you have a broad knowledge on many subjects

it has been always a difficulty for a human being to do many things at a time due to the many factors which he depends on for example the time factor , tiredness etc. which can b obstructions doin the things at a time even if you review the people around you you fill find people mastered in a specific subject for which they work for example a computer software engineer who is specialised in dealing with computer so it is always better to specialise in one subject rather goin for many subjects
