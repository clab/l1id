Yes , i agree from the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn the facts .
There is a saying that `` practise makes man perfect '' .
Practise is donbe mainly by understanding the ideas and the concepts .

By learning facts we will just know about the fact .
But by clearly undersatnding the main idea and the concept of that fact we will remember it for a longer time so that whenever we will come upon the fact we can clearly answer that question .
But by listening the fact we may foreget the fact .

Students are the people who will make the world . ''
Todays students are tomorrows future '' .
In simple language we can clearly explain it by theory and practical .
By theory we just get the information about a fact or about some information .
But by doing the practical we get a clear view of that information .
By doing reseach on that fact or by getting information on that fact by different sources we can clearly grab the information into our mind .
By clearly undersatnding the idea about the concept we get the full knowledge about that fact and we can easily explain that information top othe people also .

By practising or by doing any research on that fact gives us a lot of information on that fact .
By doing that research we not only gain information not only on that fact but we will gain knowledge about some of the interesting things related to that fact .
Understanding the idea will remain in the mind .
It 's not that learning will not be in the mind but understanding the idea gives both practicaL and theoratical knowledge .

Thus understanding the ideas and concepts is more important for the students rather than learning .
