I rather agree and disagree with the statement that ` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ' .
Well it depends on the people on how they take the situation .
Young people who are more enthusiastic towards forming a community can tend to help more .
And they would rather give enough time to dedicate on helping their communities .

On the other side , some of the people show less concern towards helping their communities .
Perhaps they would be rather busy with their day-to-day activities .
They would be more selfcentered and they would never even bother about helping their communities .

It is not necessary for the younger people to dedicate much of the time helping their communities , infact a little amount of can help much better .
Sideways poeple with positive views towards developing a community are more concerned to help their communties and dedicate their sufficient work to help them get the communities better .
They will organise more effective programs to help their communities .
They will arrange more and more effective plans to take their communities in a straight way .

The young people should be motivated about helping their communities and effective programs are to be implemented to motivate people .
Moreover some or more young people are more than enough for a community to develope .

However formation of the communities helps most of the things to grow in a straight way .
It will also give suggestions to most of the problems .
Communities should be developed in such a way that they should drive the people 's attention towards them .
They can do this by organsing some cultultural activities in some occassions .
By doing so , most of the young people will be motivated to help their communities .

So by all of the above points , not all young people are not concerned about helping their commodities .
It depends on the people on how they are .
And the activities taken by the communities which drive the attention of young people .
