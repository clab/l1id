I agree with the statement most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , in advertise ments they will show so much about the products , but when we buy them and use them they r not really as good as they showed in the advertisements , in my opinion they shows like that to incrase the production and for the marketing purposes .

I have come to that conclusion because i had three personal experienses , first i bought one dress from one shop by seeing an advertise ment , in wich they showby byed tat they are selling very good dresses in terms of quality as well as the prise and by seeing that advertise ment i went to that shop and bought one dress , after using it i have obseved the color of the dress is going , after washing i recognized i t and i could not return it .

And the other time i bought shoes form one shop by seeing an advertise ment in the t.v they showed the shoes wearing one of my favotret star and i bought them , but the are very coastly comparing to the same shoes brought from the other shop In my third experience , one of the grocery shop has advertised in such a way that every body should attract to their shop , but all the groceries are very coastly and some of them are expired , so they want to sell them as fastly as tey can .

thease are the three personal experiences i have come across and so i strongly beleave that the advertisements will show more about the products than they rally are .
so i strongly belive the statement .
