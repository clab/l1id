The issue in hand is that , whether the number of cars in use will reduce in twenty years .
This issue is important because a means of transportation is very crucial in this busy world .
The believe that , the use of cars will not reduce in the next twenty years because car is the best way of communication in the present century .

I think this opinion of mine is better because travelling from certain distance in car is very comfortable .
This is because many people travel in bus as they feel it is more cheaper .
But the buses now-a-days are so crowded that it is very difficult for a person to even stand in the bus properly .
Their transport becomes very tiring and this is the one best reason I feel cars should increase in number in the near future .

Additionally , I feel that travelling in car reaches us to the destination on time .
For example , there was one of my friends who would travel in train from his part-time job to his campus .
During winter , due to some problem , the trains have been stopped and later resumed their journey after an hour which made him go late to his college where he had to miss his one hour exam .
Based on this , i feel that if that person woud have travelled in car , he would have atleast taken a different route which would have made him reach his destination on time .

Thirdly , I strongly feel that the price of the cars now-a-days are getting cheaper than they were earlier .
This will certainly make most of the people to have a car of their own .
Moreover , many people are preferring to travel in car to any place within their country as they feel it is much more safer and convenient for them .
So , these are all the reasons that make me feel that my opinion is the right one .

In conclusion , I would finally like to say that the number of cars in use will not reduce in twenty years , but rather they would increase in number .
I believe this because cars are the most effective way of transport in this present world and it is very much important for every family to own an individual car .
