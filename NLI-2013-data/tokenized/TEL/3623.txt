Young people do contribute to the communities in some or the other way though not all do .
But most of them get involved in social activities helping the communities and the society as well .
Youngsters always have a special feeling for their country and the society they live in which makes them to contribute for the communities .
But not all are with that spark , reasons being many like the atmosphere there are brought up , the personal experiences they had and etc .
Many help their nations by offering social service and thats how they take time to help their communities .

Youngsters due to many reasons feel a lot for their nation .
The have a very good spirit of helping the society .
One reason could be the heartwarming delivery of civic lecture from an well versed professor .
It could also be the different TV shows broadcasted on the theme of patriotism .
Young people are engaged in their colleges with variety of tasks .
Most of the them point to their responsibility towards their nations .
The classroom lectures and the general conversation among the peers makes them to think about how well they can do for the betterment of the society .
Once the thought occurs , the very first answer would be to get involved in social activities by joining a community if not many .
I can cite few examples from my personal life .
There was this conversation among my peer group with our lecturer guiding us .
Suddenly , the technical aspects of my country were related with the political issues .
On further discussion , it came to my notice that the infants too were the victims for the country 's citizen 's carelessness towards the society .
We started by browsing for communities doing good social service .
We all joined it and helped it in encouragin children to opt education over work .
We helped a charity home from being devasted by filing a petition in the high court and giving a consistent strong support .
In my experience of getting involved in such activities i realised that there are many students and younsters trying to do something for the nation by joining and forming communities .
I think things have improved when compared to past regarding the young people .
Their interests are quite of a matured kind and contribute to the society one or the other way .
A living and popular example of youngsters taking enough time to help the society is `` LOK PARITRAN '' , a party formed by five Indian ex-students of IIT 's .
Its lucid that they take out more than enough time to help for the nation 's betterment .
But i admit that not all youngsters take out time for the nation or communities .
There are few who dont take time at all and wander here and their ticking their moments way .
Be it any community , not all show up active participation .
Few of them keep themselves away from such things intentionally and few are not aware of such activities .
Few of the younsters are too busy with their acadaemics to even think of extra ciricular activities .
Few stand right considering their situations and circumstances and few do n't as they dont come forward though they have a chance to .
But most of the youth has focussed and is focussing on improving situations around .
They join communities and aim for accomplisments that serve better to the society .

Though not all young people take out time for social activites , majority of them do .
Few take out a little time and few quite a good time .
There are people from the youth who dedicate themselves to communities .
Coming to a stand would be very difficult because of the varitey of people living and acting according to their circumstances .
On and on the , younsters do contribute to the communities by taking out enough time , but not all .
