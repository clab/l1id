Its true that young peole do not give much time in helping their communities .
In my opinion the author 's statement is true .
and there are many a reasons associated Now a days young people are held up with lot more responsibilities pertaining to many aspects .
some need to look after their family , their elders for this reason few youngsters have to attend a job in order to receive certain payment .

While these group of youngsters are busy working with the welfare of the family few other youngsters indulge themselves in planning about their future and career .
I a hurry to catch up todays world 's pace young people hardly find any time to think about helping the community .

people generally think that spending their time in helping out their communities is a mere waste as they dont fetch them anything in their lives .
they feel that instead of wasting their valuable time in helping out their communities they could better think about thier own future , they use their time and talent in designing their own future .

For the young people to think something about their communiuties they should need some back up or rather some amount of encouragemant through their elders or teachers or friends .
in this busy world people rarely think about encouraging someone in something as every one is busy building their own future .

Man these days tend to act selfish as he doesnt recieve any correct reward for what he has done .
when there is no one to recognise the part of work an individual has done in turning out his community the man lacks entusiasm in taking part in changing the shape of the community ther after .

If any individul wants to shape his community he has to recive a lot of encouragement .
if this is there trhen may be afew will lend their hand in tunin
