Ever since the advent of cars they have become an integral part of human life .
The production of cars has seen a considerable rise over the years and this trend shows no signs of slowing down .
I personally disagree with the statement that twenty years down the line we will see fewer cars on the road than we do today .
A host of factors are responsible for me holding this opinion .
These include improved production practices , fierce market competition , increased buying power of the consumers and a desire to push knowledge beyond the existing boundaries .

The production practices involved in car manufacturing has come a long way .
In the early years of car production the process was entirely manual .
Orders for cars had to be made years in advance .
As silly as it may sound it is all true .
But today Car maufacturing is an automated process .
It takes onl a few hours to assemble together all parts in the car .
Another interesting feature of the production system is that cars today are mass produced , not made induvidually .
This reduces maufacturing time .
Once a customer places an order it is just a matter of a few days before he sees the car on his doorstep .

This enhanced mass production sstem ensures that cars are delivered as fast as possible , and this is like an added incentive to the buyers .
So the production system has contributed significantly to increasing the number of cars on the road .
And with better manufacturing practices being implemented it only points to a greater number of vehicles on the road in the near future .

The Market for automobiles is a very competetive one .
There are man plaers in the market ; this is a reference to te automobil compaies producing cars .
It is not like the old days where there were only one or two compaies coming out with cars .
There are a host of compaies producing cars in various segments .
There are price wars on between cars in a particular segment .
As soon as a company comes out with a price for a particular model his rival would come out with a slashed price of an equivalent model .
All these market wars lead to slashed prices which is music to the consumers ears .
These reduced prices so to speak contribute greatly to the increae in the number of cars sold .

Times have been changing and the automobile market is not restricted only to a privileged few any more .
The purchasing power of the consumers has gone up manifold .
More people can afford to buy cars now and today owing a car has socila reavace as wl .
ars are produced b mafaturers in ma segments to cater to te needs of the people that fall under the particular segment .
With this increasd purchasing power of the consumers the car sales have gone up and will continue to do so in the near future .

Finally enginners are alwas pushing the limits in search of newer pastures .
The motivation amongst the engineering community will always results in the production of newer vehicles , beter production techniques etc .
All these will certain cotribute to an increase i sales of the cars .

Considering all these factors mentioned above i feel that twenty years hence we will be looking at a world with more cars , though thats not essentially how we want it to be ...
Happy driving !!!!
