most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are i agree with the above statement .
today the best way to sell a product is through advertisement .
so you have to show the product in a much better manner even though the product is not good .
i will explain the reasons in the following paragraphs .

first , for example advertising for a washing powder or liquid .
In the media whether its T.V or radio they advertise by showing that by using little amout of powder of liquid you can wash many clothes and make them shine a new .
but in real you need more powder to wash the clothes to get rid of dirt and the about the shine , they do n't shine as they show on T.V. its only the means to attract people by exaggregating the product .

second , lets take tele shopping as example in this they advertise products and explains its uses and they also show how it works , and show the results , now lets take exercise machine , they say by working on this machine you can build good muscles by showing the person in the T.V. but in real you cannot make good muscles as they show on T.V. because they use only well trained and well build muscle man to advertise .
sometimes it is difficult for us to perform some exercises because we need some trainer to help use do some excercises when you are doing for the first time .

lets talk about the drugs they show on T.V .
They advertise the drug by telling about the uses and advantages but they do not tell about the disadvantages of the drug and the sideeffects of the drug , who should take the drug all this information is not advertised on the media .
because you are creating a negative impression on the drug .

In conclusion i like to say that watch the advertisements do some research on the products and then plan to buy the products .
in this way you do n't waste time and money behind the products that never give you the results .
so think while you act .
