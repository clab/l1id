I agree with the statement that , it is better to travel in a group and with a tour guide rather than being on our own .

It is always fun to go in groups , so that we can enjoy more and get to know new people , their habits , hobbies and we might find some thing very intresting to learn from others , for example drwing , painting or anything which is intresting to us .

When it comes to traveling , most of the times we try to see new places and will be curious to know each and everything about that new place , but we know that we can only hope when we are on our own but for sure we can do that when a guide is with us .

First of all , a guide is the expert who will be knowing most of the things and he would have certain planning for travelling as well as sight seeing .
So our time would be sufficient to travel to the places where we want and see what we are looking for .

Another important thing is , financial aspect .
When we are on our own , we might spend on unnecessary things and land up in ` empty hands ' .
So , it is wise to have a deal with the tour guide and relax without bothering about the financial aspect .

The last and the most important aspect is'safety ' .
When we travel on our own , we may not be aware of how secure our visiting place would be and also how safe the people are in that place ? .
So a tour guide would be a best person to travel with , so that he knows the best safety procedures related to place to be visited and we can relax that we will be safe .

Concidering all these things , I personally prefer going in a group led by a tour guide which will save my time , money and I will be fulfilling the purpose of my journey .
