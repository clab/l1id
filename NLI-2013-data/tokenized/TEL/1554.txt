There is a famous aphorism that says `` Jack of all trades but master of none '' .
I agree with this saying and hence donot think that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Instead , one should specialize in a single subject .
Firstly , in today 's dog-eat-dog world , it is important for a person to get ahead in the rat race .
Specializing in a single subject helps an individual to have exclusive knowledge of that subject and hence he will secure more lucrative offers in the field of employment .
The demand increases and the supply being less , the individual is rewarded amply for his spcialization .
Also , there is an abundance of academic topics to choose from and very little time to pay total attention to them .
Gaining knowledge about many subjects is simply impractical .

Secondly , if a person concentrates on myriad subjects at the same time , unless he is an exceptionally brilliant individual , there are chances of his getting overwhelmed with the sheer diversity in the subjects that he has to deal with .
For instance , it is a widely known fact that Leonardo Da Vinci was a true genius and had mastered various fields ranging from science to art , which is evident in his works ; from model aircrafts , to bridges , to the `` Vetruvian man '' , to `` Mona Lisa '' .
This goes to show that unless an individual is confident about his capabilities , that is he can deal with a vast number of subjects like Da Vinci did , he should not bite off more than he can chew .

Also , from the scientific view point , the average human brain can process only a limited amount of information at a time and that too about a certain number of topics .
Though it is proven that we use only 10 % of our brain capacity , why not focus the remaining 90 % on a single subject and master it ?
Dealing with too many topics at one time could lead to confusion and chaos and could result in frustration for the individual .

Moreover , If a person has specialized knowledge about a particular subject , he can work in collaboration with specialists from other fields , hence enabling him to socialize as he simultaneously distributes his knowlede to others .
In this process he also gains knowledge of other fields .

Finally , I think that a person should have a basic awareness and not a thorough knowledge of as many subjects as he possibly can .
In this day and age , specialization is the key to a successful academic , professional and social life .
