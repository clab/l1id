Knowledge is must for every individual in order to scope with fast moving world .
It help us to reach the acme position level .
When coming to the knowledge of our academic level , some prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I personally prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

By having the knowledge of all the subjects it makes helpful for student to emphase on all the subjects and how each subject is somewhat related to every subject .
By having knowledge on each subject he or she can settle in any type of field , that is if one subject 's booms is not there he or she can switch to another field whereas if we are specialize in one subject and that subject field is not in boom to get jobs and we ca n't switch to another field as easy as possible .

By having knowlege of all the subjects we know the details of each subject and we can make use of it whenever we want it .
For example , after completing the engineering course my friend he specialized in one subject and i had broad knowledge of all the subjects and we fortunately got job in the embedded company , it is the field that we must know all the subject knowledge in order to make a embedded product .
A work is submitted to us and our manager asked to do it separately and who will do it first they will given bonus in salary and who will fail to do it they will be removed from the company .
In order to make the product we must know the knowledge of our academic subjects .
As i was having broad knowledge of all subjects , it made helpful inorder to make the product in time and to get bonus , my friend as he was not aware of knowledge of differnt subjects he was not able to do the task and he was removed from the company .
Where as myself i am enjoying the work and earning more .

Thus it is helpful for every individual to have broad knowlege of all the subjects in order to get sucess in their life which will be helpful in order to shape there careers bright and good .
