I strongly believe that people who try new things and take risks are more successfull than people who keep doingg what they already know how to do well .
By taking risks and doing new things you face newer situations which will help you to push yourself away from your comfort zone which will help you be a better and successfull person .
I have personally experienced and have read many situations where taking risks and doing things have helped changed lives and to be successfull .

In my first job I wanted to try out something new and apply for a position in sales and marketing , but since I was a very good software porgrammer , everyone said that I would not be suitable for the position and most of my peers discouraged me from taking up the position .
Infact I was a little doubtful about leaving my comfort zone and entering into untested waters , but I took the position which eventually helped me start my own business .
I would not be in this position if I had not taken that risk .

In the business world there are stories of many risks but a couple of them which fascinate me are the stories of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs .
Bill Gates quit his school to do something new , something he liked the most and something that was not done before , `` personal computers '' .
He became successful and changed the course of not just his life but the lives of everyone else on the planet .
Steve Jobs who should be given enough credit for his contribution to the developement of PC 's made a comback a few years ago with his latest invetion iPods .
Before Apple Computers ( which was run by Steve Jobs ) came up with iPod , there were many mp3 players but they lacked recognition .
Steve Jobs novel idea of attractive product descign coupled with seamless integration with computers created the new `` iPod Generation '' and completely revived Apple Computers .

Hence based on my personal experience and also experiences of many others I very strongly believe that by doing new things you improve yourself which increases your capability to do better things and to take risks and be successfull .
