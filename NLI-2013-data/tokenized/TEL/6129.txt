I disagree the statement `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
I would like to present few reasons and examples to justify my opinion .

In present scenario the use of cars has been increasing day by day .
The first and one of the important reasons for the increased use of cars is Urbanization .
With the increase of the Urbanization the use of cars has been increasing proportionally .
I guess the scope for Urbanization increases by a good extent within the next twenty years which further increases the use of cars .

Secondly , people got used to the luxury of travelling in a car and also the advantages of it .
Cars with more features and utilities are being introduced competitively .
These cars increase the comfort levels and also save their time .
There are a few cars which can even prevent accidents by their sensors , which can also give the details of the location that you are in .
So people get attracted by these additional features of the cars and thus lead to the increased use of the cars , There may be an argument that twenty years later most of the activities of the people may be completed through the use of internet .
But people never stop themselves from going out and having faun travelling distances , meeting their friends personally etc .

One more fact is that there are very few reasons for the decrease in the use cars like to control air pollution , to diminish the traffic on the roads etc. , which would be of less importance to people when compared to the need of the cars by them for their personal activities .

If we consider a decrease in the use of cars then what are the means of transport ?
The use of motorbikes , buses , railways , airways must be the alternatives which my not be as comfortable as using cars .

So i conclude that there is a very less scope for the decrease in the number of cars in twenty years from today .
