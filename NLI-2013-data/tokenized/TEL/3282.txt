I do n't go with the statement made .
In the present day society , young people face a lot of challenges most important being of them being coping up with the competition in every field of study and in various sports in order to excel .
They have to meet the anticipations of their parents and others from them .
Inspite of all these the youth today are giving enough time to helping their communities .
The youth today are well aware of the various problems that are being faced by their communities .

We know the disaster of ` Tsunami ' that struck south Asia a few years ago .
In rehabilitation of these areas , youth from these countries played a crucial role .
There were students from all over the country who not only gave financial aid , but also organized camps to do service .

In my own college , we have a famous group called ` My Nation ' whose primary motto is lending a hand to the poor and needy in the nearby villages .
All the members of this group are students .
Their activities include distribution of clothes to the poor , conducting evening classes for uneducated , and even electrifying the surrounding villages !
Funds are raised by various events conducted and through donations .

The youth are also aware of the political situations .
In India , recently youth agitated against the decision of the Government to reserve seats in educational institutions on caste basis and they succeded to some extent .
