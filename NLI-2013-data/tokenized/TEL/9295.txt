Learning Facts means knowing the past , who the culture of every incident and every facts are created and followed by our people .
I agree the above statement , Its is every important for a student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

Learning facts are more essential than to understand these facts .
Mainly the students must know about the fact and he must understand the facts and then he must understand the concepts .
The importance of these facts show a good nature and brightness on the students by telling him or explaining these facts to him .
He will be so active and will not do any misbehaviour in any certain accepts .
After knowing the effectiveness on thes efacts the students will be more positive in nature .

The importance of these facts is , we can learn easily these facts .
It is very difficult to understand and perform in the real life .
But putting on to the real life this lead a big role .
For example take a students , telling the future or subject is simple for a teacher , the student will easily grasp the subject , but inside these subject the exists some many facts that evena teacher does n't know .
The Teacher must get through these facts and must explain to the students so they may understand these ideas and the concepts must explain by the teacher to the student as to developed the sudents brain .

For Example take our Indian Culture , We can tell the students that out culture is this and we must be in such a manner who our beloved neighbour and the past people will be living .
The students make take this lightly and they may not be has every one live .
They live ther own life .
But if they understand these ideas and concepts they will complusory be like a past people be living .
Students are only one who make bring out nation forward .
so , they have to understand every facts and they have to improve the skills by calculating and producing the concepts .

Finally i conclude that students must know eney moments and facts .
Atlast i say that students must not only learn the facts but they must have understand ideas and the concepts .
