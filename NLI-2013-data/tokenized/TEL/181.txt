I agree with the statement that `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
I agree with this becoz nowadays we can see car in every ones house , there are so many methods to bye a car , like banking is giving us loans to bye a car & the showroom are also been adviticing that we can bye a car in instalments process which means that we can pay in 3 or 4 terms , not only the instalments process but also they are giving finance to us and we can pay interst very month till the lone is completed .
These many methods are there to bye a car who will not show intrest on bying a car .

In the early days , if we the cash in hand then only we can bye a car , due to this only the upper class people , 20 percent of upper midile calss people & the government servent how are in high possition are using the cars in those days .

However , the time being chaning all the things also changed .
The population also incresing day to day , people are very busy is their work , there is no time at all .
Along with this traving in bus or train is more difficult for them to go there jobs or schools or collages on time .
so , they are using there own car to travel , by this they can save a lot of time , they can travel when ever thay want to go , and in the weekends they can go out along with the famil ymembers and they enjoy .
The companies are providing us different models of cars using different fules , some of them are desels and some of them are petrol and some of them are domostic gases .
so the people can bye which will most sutable for there required .

So finally , there are esay ways to bye a car with out money in hands and they save a time in avioding traving in buses and trains and they can enjoy with there familoy members while going outin the weekends .
By all these reasons i can say that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
