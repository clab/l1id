The issue stated by the topic is whether the students need to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learnin the facts alone .
This is a very important issue because it is related to the students and the application of the knowledge they have gained in their schools .
I completely agree with the statement because of various reasons .

Firstly i feel that understanding the ideas and concepts is better option because the student will be able to judge by himself whether the facts are true or not instead of asking the student to blindly follow the facts which may create confusion in them .

Secondly by getting familiar with the ideas and concepts .
the student will better understand the outcomes of them and inturn will be able to apply them correctly .
For example if the student understand the concept of gravity thorougly rather than just knowing that all the objects throw up will come down , the student is more convinced and be careful with the objects he is handeling .

Another point why i feel that understanding the ideas and concepts is the right option for students is because they can retain the facts for longer period of time .
For example if students understand how the facts have obtained instead of just what are the facts they can always apply the concepts and get facts .
But if they learn only facts then if they forget them it will be difficult to remember .

Lastly schooling is never complete if the student comes out of the educational institution with just gaining knowledge of the thing , that is just knowin facts .
If the students are not able to appy them in their daily life then there wont be any meaning for the knowledge they gained .

In conclusion i believe that student should understand the ideas and concepts thorougly thaught in their schools and not just merely learn the facts inorder to fulfil their education and inturn to evolve as a complete human being and be usefulto the society when they come out .
