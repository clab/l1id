I am agrre with the statement ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' .

The successful people are always think about new things .
Because that is their confident behaviour to reach their goals .
If they find any new problem they will solve or they can think how to solve that problem .
And they are perfect in that because they already doing their present job well .
The persons who are already succed in their field are able to do any risks for new things .

The successful people try new things because they know the all secrets to reach the new goal .
And they are able to face the problems occuring with new things .
They try and they can easily done the new things .

For example , consider a successful soft ware engineer working with a company .
Assume , he works on projects with ` C-Language ' , and he is very successful in that field .
However , he has to learn the new upcoming softwares like `` JAVA '' , `` ORACLE '' , `` VB .
NET '' , and `` SAP '' programmes .
And he may take risks for that courses .
He attended the coaching to learn those at the time after completion of his work in present job .
He can effort more to learn those .
Because he has to enter in that field to work .
then confidently he can succeed in his thoughts .

Another example , assume a successful state player of any game , he succeeded in his team with the state players .
Then he try to get the chance in national team .
He knows that it is very risk to get the place in national team .
However he struggle for his aim .
He is able to face the difficulties , because he already struggled to get the place in state level team .
So it is easier to him to get the place in national team .

Finally , with the resons and examples discussed above I am agree with the statement `` Successfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
