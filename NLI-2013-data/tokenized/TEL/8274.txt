Facts are those that often people believe .
If the facts are not derived from the ideas and concepts of the relevant subject then they does'nt have strong roots to be considered as facts .
People are almost all fooled if they believed in the facts in which they does n't have enough understanding ideas and concepts .
so i prefer in ideas and concepts in which most of the facts are emerged .

In favour to my decision i can suggest the examples of physics area in which Newton has made a theory that every body in the universe is attracted towards the earth due to gravitational force .
This fact has not just emerged from the idea that an apple thrown up has fell down .
He went deep into the idea why the came down and made him do a research that prooved their is a force of attraction towards the earth .
As a result we learn today the Laws of Newton .
so as far as the example is concerned i strongly believe in ideas that led to facts and the student community should focus on that The example i give is the invention of electricity that Benjamin franklin has given .
The mere idea that she felt the shock during flying her kite didnt led to the electricity .
she made efforts to learn why this happened and she felt that their are some charge particles which are responsiponsible for that shock .
This led many theories in physics and later scientists created wonders with this concept .
The argument can proved in all other areas not only in science .

Students does understand the facts unless they are projected with concepts and ideas .
So unless the facts are supported with enough ideas and concepts the facts are never facts and there will be a black spot always if it is believed blindly
