I believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

The first reason why I feel this is the fast diminishing petroleum and crude oil reserves across the world .
According to one survey which I have read in the newspapers , all the oil reserves in the world may cater the demand for a maximum of another 100 years if the usage continues in the same phase .
So the governments may force the public to use less cars to save the petroleum for other important tasks like cooking etc . ,

Another reason is that even if we develop cars which use electricity in the form of charged batteries as fuel instead of petroleum or diesel , the generation of electricity needs water or coal which are agian non-renewable sources of energy and they can be replenishable .
This means that there is no guarantee for those models unless scientists come up with some source of energy like hydrogen gas which can be used as a fuel in the broader perspective without any problems in future .

The third reason for my belief is the changing life styles of the people around the world .
One may wonder how this effects the usage of cars .
Now a days , the life style of the modern man has changed a lot , thanks to the luxuries provided by the advancements in the technology .
Man has so much been addicted to the technology that , even to go to the nearby grocery shop , he needs a means of transportation like car .
So the problem of obesity has started .
This problem is not now confined to only developed countries .
Even developing countries are facing the same problem .
In fact , obesity has become a global problem .
So the doctors are advising the people to have more physical exercise .
So I think the means like bicycle may provide the dual benefit and the usage of cars will come down .

So , given my reasons , I agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than they are today .
