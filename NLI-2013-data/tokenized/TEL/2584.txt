It is said that `` Youth is the best period in life '' .
But few may argue saying that the older people also enjoy their life spending with their children and grandchildren and experiencing the freedom a teenager gets .
However I agree that Young people enjoy life more than the older do and I will explain my view in the following paragraphs .

Firstly , Young age is the time when they have time to go out with friends and party around without any sense or fear of resposibility .
They can go for trecking and can visit beaches and swim in the beach which usually a older person will not be able to do .

The youngsters need not worry about their health and will not have to carry medicins wherever they go .
Here comes the older people who will always have to think about their health and necessary medication .
Also for heavy journeys which needs lot of strain they need a youngster to take care .
But a youngster would love to go for long journeys with more fun and enjoyment without much pressure .

I saw my grandfather who is very healthy and more funloving when he is home but he gets very much strained when he comes out with me .
He is as active as i am but he doesnot have as much energy as i have though he wants to enjoy .
He can watch and enjoy but he cant jump and have fun the way I do .

Being a young girl I think young people have more ways to have fun and enjoy life than older people .
They can go for concerts , plays to have fun .
But older people will get conjusted and will not be happy with the loud sounds in the theaters .

We can get adjusted to any environment and get along with all friends without any place or accomodation problems .
I mean we can do nightouts with friends and go for night shows which is rather difficult for the older people .

Young age is the precious time and have to be enjoyed to the fullest .
Because as we grow older we will have resposibilities which will not let us enjoy to our extremes .
Older people 's health will not let them enjoy .
So according to me young people will wnjoy life more than anybody else .
