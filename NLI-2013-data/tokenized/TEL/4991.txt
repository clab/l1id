Advertisements have been the means of selling a product for a long time .
Advertisements are not only been used in the modern era it has been existant even in the past world .
In past , where the modern means of advertisement was not there , there were places where the art works and things that are to be sold were exhibited where the artist or the seller used to talk about his work and sell the product .
But in the modern world there are many means of selling a product through televison , internet , newpapers advertisements .

I do agree that most advertisements make their produts seem much better than they actually are .
Many companies who sell their products though do give the details about their products at the same time they give in the details that may be false or of a very little importance , or may not be actually useful to the consumer .
And most of the times they use celebrity personalities to sell their products which itself is a means of providing a false information .
For example , a advertisement in which a celebrity is shown using a soap or a cosmetic product .
Is that product really used by that celebrity ?

Advertisements do not provide with complete information of the product .
For instance , while selling some dolls or toys for kids , they are advertized in the televison as they move by themselves and show them in a huge sizes which is definitely not the size the real toy might be , kids get facinated with such advertisements and kids get disappointed when they get to see them or play with them .

A simlar example can be presented with advertisements show for the various food places , where they show a enlarged vision of a food item making it more appealing and colourful , though they do put in miniscule unseen asterix mark and inform at bottom as it being an enlarged vision which is missed out by most of used .

But ia also agree with the fact that unless such a kind of advertisement is not done the consumers cannot be attracted easily .
Though there is so much of advertisement done if the quality is not god the consumer can never be convinced .
So i agree with the fact that advertisements make products seem far more better than they really are .
