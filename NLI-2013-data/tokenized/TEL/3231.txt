Youth needs to come out of the dark

I agree with the statement that young people these days have very less participation in the activities helping their community .
Due to the advanced thinking and mindsets of the people nowadays they are more oriented towards personal benefits .

There are many reasons for such trend and thnikng .
People these day face much more competetion in all levels be it high school or graduate school .
More the competetion more is the pressure and people tend to involve themselves in achieving the single set targets than to think about society a bit .
Economic factors matter a time like in the middle class the parents have lot of expectations and to cope up with them you have no other choice but work for your goals .
Which is obviously a very good thing for people have have determinations towards their goal , but in turn its affects their social life heavily .
Many of the people do n't even realise that they are a part of the community and need to work helping a better one .

Due to advent of the modern age people tend to enclose themselves in their private places with the electronic media , and spending much of their time with it .
Number of social gatherings and mutual co-ordination have gradually be declining these days .
Gone are the days when people collectively fight for the cause to help the majority of the community .
None of the youth have any interest in politics these day , they do n't care about functioning of the state .

All this is gradually declining and it does n't mean that no cares now about anything not they own privately .
Still there are many people who actively engage themselves in helping others for the general cause , however tight their schedule is .
This number needs an increase and thats not what we find happening today .

People need to understand that the community they live in belongs to them and everybody needs to contribute for its the healthy functioning .
They needs to come out of the selfish attitude .
Also taking part in activities that help the community will give us a feeling of self satisfaction and happiness .
And can also be an effective way for stress relief , which is a big problem these days .
