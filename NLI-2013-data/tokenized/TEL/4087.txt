I agree with the statement that `` young people do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
Because in this modern world there are many things to concern with to them and the young people donot find time to helping their communities .

The young people are most enthusiastic when they are doing some thing .
Easpecially when they are spending their time for a variety of aspects , they may include studying , playing , watching the new vesions of films , listening music and to be say honestly they much inclined to enjoy themselves .
Most of the young people are students .
They do not find much time to think about community , their life goes through their studies .
Most of the young people are ignoring the community due to their competion among themselves .
At this era of their life they put more concentration for developing their future .
They donot spend their time for thinking about community , also it is not possible for them to help the community at that time .
Because every student is ruled by his or her parants .
One may think that he or she can serve the people when they stand successfully in the socity .
This may be the best time for any young person to think and serve there community .
There are many young people who are mainly facing the problem of poverty , thay even cannot efford for their education , in such a way they are in capable of helping society .

According to my opinion finally I can conclude that the age of the young people is the mainly and only cause that put them to ignore their community .
