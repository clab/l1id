Well i certainly agree with the following statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ''

Well , i feel that it is always important to have a good knowledge about all different subjects .
Well for example taken in the medical history , say a Doctor from a medicine field , is only specilazed in only one subject or say only one field .
And for suppose he is a speacilist in heart diseases , and if a patient comes in for a treatment in different part of the body he will not be or he is not in a position to give him the medicines for that disease .
And the patient might think that he has got no knowledge and moreover he might not turn to him again .
And if he has a knowledge about many academic subjects he will be able to give a medicine for that .

Well what i feel is that a person is said to be complete person if he has a good knowledge about all the things .
So i feel that it is better to have the broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Well , if we are into only one specific subject i say we will endup nowhere , wherein we donot have the knowledge about other things .
And this might propably mean that our knowledge in limited .

Well for example in the software field if we are good in only one basic software and now a days our information and technology is changing day by day , so here we need to have some knowledge about other software'stooor we will be in a situation where we will end up nowhere , not knowing what to do next .
So here we can say that if we have some knowledge about many academic subjects we can survive .
