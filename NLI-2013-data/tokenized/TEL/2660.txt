I believe that people do enjoy life more when they are young than when they age .
Life is a gift and needs to be enjoyed to the maximum .

Consider a young kid about 15-20 years of age , for him life has just begun .
He is opened out to a world where there is joy and peace , sorrow and grief both at a time .
For this young lad , almost everything he does is his first time at it and will be excited no matter what .
On the contrary people aging lets us say about 35-50 years have already seen all that the young kid has seen and gone through .
For the old lifes just passing by .

Younger children often are more energetic and enthusiastic and yet more vibrant in doing something mostly if it is for the first time .
While for the elderly , they have too many responsibilities and burdens on their shoulders that they do not seem to enjoy .
Thats why they take time off from work for a vacation to relax , just to get back and start all over again .
In a way even if the old want to enjoy they still are held back and are circumscribed in their ways .

I believe the main reason why the young enjoy life more is that they do not have any burdens at their tender age .
All they have to take care is their grades and studies .
The rest all are taken care of from their parents .
The old even when they retire think of their grandchildren and their education .

The beauty in life as i think of it is to live each day as a gift as this is mostly found in the young .
