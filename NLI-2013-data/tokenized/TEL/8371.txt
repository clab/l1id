Some ideas and concepts there is no facts But lot of ideas and concepts proved as a facts .
Facts are little important for students to understand ideas and concepts for that he just have an understanding power .

for example , If we take a physics class that most of the physics subject is any imaginary part of the science .
They first get the idea and after that they try to prove that idea into concept after that prove into fact .
If we take newton under the apple tree .
when he sat under the apple tree one apple fall down then he got an idea `` why this apple fallen down ?
why it is not gon up ? '' with this idea he found gravitation .
with this extent there is no use of the facts to under stand the idea or concepts .

one more example , If we take a maths therams , students do not understand the idea and concept just explains that therams , similarly any problem in the mathamatics have some facts to understand the idea or concept .
If we take a formula ( a+b ) ^ 2 there is some proof is there that is the fact .

another example , One lecturer says that Mahathma Gandhi is a freedom fighter there the concept is clear but if the student ask 's the lecturer is it write lecturer , then the he gives some to facts about he did in the freedom fighting .

facts are not important in some places .
But if we have to show that it is true then it is important to explain the facts .
