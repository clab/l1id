Young peoples are majorly useful to build a nation .
They play a vital role in economic development .
They have to build communities to help the nation .
Unfotunately , they are not showing interest to participate in a community .
They dont have time to help their own communities .

Community means that discussing their views in one place .
This could be developed through the internet or by the clubs .
Here they will communicate with their colleagues and freinds .
When there is more discussion there will be more development .
The discussion should be healthy .
In communities people exchanges their views .
They wil gain more knowledge with in a time .
But unfortunately they are spending their time to help their communities .
This is loss to a nation .

For example , a computer engineer have time to help their community but they are wasting their time in consumig liquor , parties , and sleeping .
This situation ocurs because of working overtime .
They have lots of work to do , lots of competition and new tasks to be done .
They can spare half an hour to help their communities .
They are not caring it .
Every one has become selfish .

Another example is in the case of a doctor .
doctors are gained mainly through their communities .
Even they have more to work but they should spend some time in helping their community .
They have become busy in their work .
They are taking more rest .
If this is the case nation have to face severe problems .

Young poeple should be made help their communities .
It is the respnsibility of the government to encourage them .
They can encourage through news papers , advertisements and movies .
They should be told the advantages in helping their community .
Ofcourse they are inspired quickly and positively .

In coclusion , young people have to spend time to help their communities .
If this is not the case they will loose communication which may effects the nations economy growth .
They have to realise in the importance of helping their community .
