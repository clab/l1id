I disagree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' .
There are so many reasons and examples to support my opinion .
It is each and every one 's responsibilily to help their community .
Young people have to spend some time to help their community .
In so many communities there are so many poeople do not have minimum requirements like food , cloths and shelter .
Youth people should take forestalls to prevent the spread of this to future generations .
My personal experience is that I saw so many people who are young in participating the social development activities .
Even though youth is busy with their works they know that the nation 's development depoends on the individual development of all communities .
Generally Young people inspire by their patriots and the social workers .
For example in our city I observed so many poeopole who are trying improve the literacy and ameliorate the lives of fetid slum areas .
Really I impressed by them alot .
So it is necessary to young people to help their community ..
Then only natiion 's development will occure .

Nowadays life became very busy .
But it should not affect our participation in helping our community .
We have to share our time for all the things .
Young people are spending their time improve the way of life of poor and they also increase their time to involve in social developoment .

Finally I conclude that it is necessary to give enough time to helping their community .
