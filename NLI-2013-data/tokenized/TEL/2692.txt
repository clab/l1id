After careful scrutiny the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' renders to be unconvincing as it stands .

First of all people in young age will yet be premature and they are in such stage where they will be facing the ebbs and tides of life whereas old people have crossed all these stages of their life .
Young people will be struggling with their studies and then to make it high in their life .

The argument is premature as it is cited that old people enjoy more than young people .
They might party during weekends with friends and think that is enjoying while passing through all kinds of stresses like thinking about the grades they might get , nearing deadlines of their assignments , fights with friends while the old people have nothing of this sort to do and they have the whole day to laze about .

After studies they might be thinking what to do next , searching for a proper job to settle down and even if they land in a job they will be required to complete projects within the pertained deadlines and that will consume many sleepless nights .
They wo n't be having much time to spend with family and due to frustration they will be shouting at people .

They will also have the problems of jealous colleagues , a complaining boss who is never satisfied with the work .
Moreover the children will be nagging to take them on a holiday .
The Young people are Prone to endless blues .
They will be feared of what the boss might say as they were running late to the office .

In sum there are lot more problems the Young people face while the old people can spend time in each others company as they have full leisure after retirement and as elder citizens they are respected a lot .
They have gone through all these problems in life already .
They can plan Holidays and surprises for others as are free from all those burdens which the Young face .
Finally the old people should not be seen as crutches that dissuade the society but must be treated with respect and in comparision they enjoy more than the younger lot in their prime time .
