Knowledge is power .
I feel that we are in the period of the knowledge explosion .
I strongly feel that is better to have broader knowledge of many academic subjects because they enhance our quality of life , increase scope to move around and experiment with different jobs and we get to meet people .
It increases our employment chances , thereby brings in a lot of life , vitality and adventure into life .

I would like to give an example .
My sister has studied law , political sceince , literature and has taken computer courses too .
Ihough it was tough for her to coup with so many different subjects with different natures , now it is paying her a lot .
for her majors , She had gone to the USA for her majors in Law .
With her knowledge in many subjects , she is succesful in life .
I mean she is happy with her decisions and now enjoying the life doing the job of her choice .

Another friend of mine was only interested in Mathamatics .
He continued studying Mathematics and he is doing the job of alecturer in Hyderabad .
He is not happy with his job as he is always interested in doing research .
But his family responsibilities and committments prevent him from doing so .
He is forced to do his job .
He comes to us and feels sorry for choosing only subject because it is not helping even to do parttime job and earn .
Therefore I strongly feel and suggest to people to study as many subjects as possible and increase their knowledge .
