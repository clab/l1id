Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing things that they already know how to do well .
I actually agree to this argument the reasons being the following .

Success doesnt come to any person overnigt .
It is achieved by an individual through dedication , hardwork and knowledge .
Few people think that success is got only by luck , I do agree to this but it happens very rarely and the success that is achieved by mere luck isnt permanent at all .
Any person wo has tasted the essence of success consecutively for a coule of times would have learnt it only by the hard and straight way .

A successful person would have tested all the possibilities to achieve success .
He would have exploited soo many possibilites that he wouldnt get scared to go on taking new risks since he knows that before he takes that risk he needs to do some study on the same cause knowledge is an imporatant path to success .
I would say that his attitude towards the situation is also an important key to success .
He would'nt ever say that a problem is difficult cause if it was'nt difficult it would'nt be called a problem at all .

When a successful person chooses to take a risky path for example take over a company which is going on loss .
The person will surely analyze the reasons for the failure and once the reasons for failure are found out it is quite easy to be rectified .
Since that person knows how to approach things in a systematic way he brings the company back to form without any doubt .
There are many real time examples of successfull companies buying smaller companies running in loss for less value and then developing the company to such a position that it sees so much profit in the frst year of purchase itself .

We see that there are so many successful companies that are experts in a certain product like for example detergents would jump into introducing a shampoo product and gain lot of profit through the same .
Hence iam sure any successful person would try new things since they will want to taste more of success in every field they enter and that too with new ideas and experiments .

Hence summing up all the above said points I would say that a successful person would surely seek different ways to carry on with his success cause he knows the tactis .
Above all he also knows the three key points dedication , hardwork and knowledge combined with the right attitude lead to the success of any person in any field .
