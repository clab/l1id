I agree with the following statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Successful people always try for new things because for successful people sucecess is not small thing they feel success like `` thirst '' , so they go on searching for new things and they very eager to take risk and succedd in that what they do .

The people with success donot do what they already know because what is the use in doing the known thing always and keep on doing that is a waste of time the successful people donot waste time as time is precious for them .

Take example of our scientists who are successful in one topic also successful in another topic also , becuse they donot want to stop there research and they are not doing their reseach for name and fame , so they will go on doing their work until their death .

Risk taking is another good task of the successful people because successful people always take risks and the way they handle the risks differs from the normal people and thats why they are successful .

Trying new things and risks handling are the tasks of successful people , because a normal man things the same way he thinks every time because he donot want to take risks he comprimises with what he had , the successful person is the one who thinks in the different way and takes risks and he owns the credit of it .

And with out trying how can we say that they are successful people by trying and greater innovation only leads a person to success .

With the above points i agree with successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
