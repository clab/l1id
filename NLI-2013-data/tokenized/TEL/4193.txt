I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I support this statement because of the busy schedule of the young people which make them run out of time .

Majority of the young people now a days have busy schedule either with their academics or with their regular office work .
Well because of the heavy competetion in this modern world the yong people who go for schools will have a pressure on them to get good grades in their sections .
To achieve this they have to work hard which consumes a significant amont of their daily time in studying which saps their energy and concentration .
Usually after this hard work rest is needed and no time is left for them to help their communities .
For example when i was studying in my intemediate i was made to study for about sixteen hours a day which made me to ignore the things and happenings around me .

young people working in offices do not have time even to spend time with their family members so how they can help their communities .
They will face a lot of pressure from their heads and upper managment to complete their project and the work in time which leaves them with no time either to spend time with family members or help the community .
An example of this can be taken as the neighbour working in an company who leaves his house at seven in the morning and returns at around nine in the nigt which makes him restless .
He just talks to me just twice a month or so .

In the view of the above stated statements and the examples that the youg people do not have enough time to helping their communities .
