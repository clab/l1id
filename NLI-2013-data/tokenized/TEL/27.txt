The issue at this hand is you should better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I belive this because all the subjects you have knoledge is not uued in future why because if you inter in to any interview taht they ask spasalization .
This reason is used to define the above statement .
This is importent because if you have broad knoledge of many academic subjects than to specialized on one specific subject .

I donot believe this because is you have many academic subjects in your academic years .
These all subjects you reed not used in real life first reason is if you attend any organigation interview thy spcify the subjects .
Because you need not have a broed knoledge of academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .

Another reason is that all the subjects you have broad knoldge is some academic subject used in future like if join any college that if you are a computer student the collge is give you two or three subject give for lecture at that time broad knowledge of many subject used for lecturere .

Finally l belive that broad knoledge on many subject used in future thn that the specialized in one subject .
they are many reasons to that if i have broad knowledge in many academic subject than specialized subjet .
Speacialized subjects are used for yor jobs .
If you have any specialization searching for any job organization mention the specialized the subject for perticular jobs .

I belive two thinga that the broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specialize in one specific subject is used in carrir .
