Personal intrests are far more important than the intrests of the community , especially in a world where it requires utter dedication and hardwork to survive .

In the yesteryears , the world would have been moving at a far more relaxed pace and never this competant .
This not only enabled young people to dedicate their time but also their energies toward their community there by taking it forward .
Not only this , there would have been much less distraction to their work .
For example , if we take a student pursuing studies at a university , he would had to deal with far less competition in his studies .
There by allowing him to allocate certain amount of his time for community activities .
With less population in olden days , there were sufficient opportunities for suitable young people to work at their hometowns - giving them an opportunity to work with their communities .
The young people of the bygone days would never have had to deal with the pressures of contemporary times .
Hence there would have been an obvious amount of time for them to work towrds their communities development .

The situations which the current generation of young people have in their hands are far from what the young people from the bygone days would have had to endure .
They have to deal with constant pressure to succede in life without loosing out much .
And young ones of this generation are often burdened with the responsibilities of family .
This definitely leave them with very little time and energy to work towards their communities .
Adding to this , the everlasting temptation to earn more money and enjoy the luxuries that other seem to enjoy , which in a sense not a negative thing at all .
After all every single indivudial has the desire to enjoy his life to the fullest .

I therefore conclude that , it is not wise to accuse the younger generation of not being able to apens much time for their communities , given the desire their reach great heights in life .
