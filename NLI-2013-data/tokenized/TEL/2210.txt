Life is a game it is to enjoy in the right path but its not bed of roses unfortunately .
The word enjoy is a word which people universally are familiar with and there no human who does not want to enjoy life .
The preference in the way to enjoy life might differ from person to person .
Enjoying the one which we all like makes us happy , keeps us away from problems which we think of all the time and brood over it .
Enjoyment does improve the life style and the way we look at our lives .
We do learn much while we enjoy something we relish .

But people do have certain restrictions as they grow old it might be the decrease in interest , mental stress , much work , heavy responsibilities and ofcourse health conditions .
There is the fact that its how an individual wants to lead life .

I personally feel that the younger generation these days are enjoying more than the older people do that could be mainly because there are many areas which offer people to enjoy especially for the youngsters .
Secondly the youngsters of today are much bold and courageous and the way they look at lfe is diffrent than how the older people do .

The youngsters are much aware of what is happening in and around the world and even that arouses the scope to enjoy .
Even the stress that younger people have theses days is much , which ever field they are up to stresses them and thats because we are into the computer world and the rate of competition is much higher and keeps growing and hence to over come the amount of stress and to stay away from the stress is to enjoy thats the only way one can do

When i was kid there were hardly any house that had a Television but now every house does have and most of the children love watching television they really enjoy it .
There were no computers in houses 22 years back but today most children enjoy playing games , watch a movie , browse the net , chat and so on .

As people have changed there life styles even the society builds much more corners giving the way for the younger people to choose what they like to enjoy the most .
Younger people enjoy concerts both jazz and pop .
There are places for the week ends that does give way for the youngsters to dance and relax themselves .
There are resorts in almost all places where the youngsters can hang around in the weekends and in the holidays .

Thirdly there are wide ranges which one can choose to enjoy life and it is also safer and healthier .
Which ever one chooses its within his or her own reach .

Certainly the stress , the explosure to the world , the rate of competition , the wide varities one can choose is making youngsters enjoy life better or more than older people .
