I agree with the statement that people should try new things rather than holding blindly the older ones .
So , by this we will improve our knowledge , we will be differ in the society and we can guide others .
Otherwise life will be boring , pale and we will be machines doing the same stuff again and again .

If people do not try new things how the world would know that new things could happen , for thesafer and happy life for the people .
If Einsein would n't have think differently how the world/people know about gravitational force or if Mahatma Gandhi did n't think diferently then how could India would got its independence and if Michael Jakson who came with pop music would not be known to all of us today .

Person thinking in a differnt way will make him feel he is special in this world .
Whenever he speaks or walks or he does any thing he will feels like heaven and willl be confident .
And where ever he goes he will be the important member over there , he will get respect and he will be in the memories of billions or we can call trillions of peoples mind eventhough he is not there in this world .

If a successful person doing the new thing then there will be another type of environment because all will help him , guide him and make his work easy with their thoughts and ideas and he can take the help of the people with his popularity .
And those people are placed in different position because thay can do any thing with in a fraction of time .

Or if his gioing with the same daily stuff then i think if he isa popular figure also then is no difference between a comman man and in himself .
And the life will be adventures and every moment a new feeling and we will be alert every minute to achieve our goals and prove it that we can do anything with the true heart .
