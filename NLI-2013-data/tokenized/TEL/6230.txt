Although I understand the comfort of own car driving , i support the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
There are several reasons why i feel this is right .

First , we know how many people are getting the diseases like cancer and so many respiratory diseases from the pollution delivered from the vehicles , cars especially .
In addition to causing dangerous diseases , the use of cars also spoil the greenary of environment .
Furthermore this pollution from the cars may lead to green house effect .
By considering above reasons the people may reduce the use of cars in coming twenty years .

Second , The cost of fuel for the cars is trying to kiss the sky .
Normal people are too eligible to use cars .
In addition , the natural resources like petrol and diesel are getting diminished in the earth .
This may result in avoiding of usage of cars like vehicles which consume petrol and diesel .
To increase the alternate for petrol and diesel people may have to grow natural bio plants which will replace the normal petrol and diesel .
By using natural resources we may improve the availability of sources , in contrast it may decrese the efficiency of cars .
This may result in decresing the usage of cars in the future .

Another reason i can give is that with the increasing technology scientists may invent new techniques with which people can fly with their own hands .
They may invent flying machines with which a group of people can travel at a time like as comfortable as in the car without any cost .
Morover this type of inventions will reduce the pollution problems that we have now like sound pollution and air pollution .
In addition to that it not only prevents accidents but also the life style of future citizen .

In my opinion , when technology is increasing it will definately replace a fault thing with a new thing which will be more effective than older one .
In the same way the usage of number of cars will decreas with the replacement of new technology .
