`` KNOWLEDGE IS OCEAN '' - is a popular saying .
This knowledge is accquired by reading many books , watching various news etc .
And there are many more ways in which this knowledge is accquired .
I opine that having knowledge on one specalised subject is better than to have knowledge on the various academic subjects .
It is because , it is our specalised subject in which we are much intrested and carry on our own research work in future .
If we arnt having a proper grip in the subject it is impossible to go further in our research .
Thus it is better to have complete grip over the subject .

If we take our academic subjects their may be many and different subjects like mathematics , science , social , english etc .
But if it is an specalization it contains only one subject in depth .
For example : Take if a person 's specalization is english .
It needs lot of grammar , sentence construction , tenses and much more .
if u need to carry on with the subject it is necessary to go into the depth of the subject where the knowledge on the other subjects may dosent work .

If the person is much intrested to carry out his research work in his own specalization then it is necessary that he should have complete knwledge about it .
Even when we take many items during dinner doent fill our stomach , but one item which we like a lot makes our belly full .
Instead of joing for differnt subjects .
it is better to have a quite good knowledge on one subject .
Having knowledge on differnt subjects dosent go in vain , but having complete knowledge on one makes you gain a , lot no matter what is your specialization .

Though how much knowledge we accuire in the subject it is drop in the ocean insted of making it uncomplete with having knowledge over different subjects it is better to make it a complete full drop with knowledge in one specalized subject .
