According to my view in this twenty years there will be higher usuage of cars than there are today because noweverdays people are thinking to have much luxury and comfart travelling .
So the best way of all those comfarts is cars .

Where as in this present generation cars shows the royal look of ur family and how are they ranged .
Nowever days many people are perfering to go by cars because going on other vechile like bikes and local trains , there cause there causes lot of disturbance and polluation .
where as when u go with ur own cars you can go out on your owm time no disturbance no poluation and can have have a safe driving by your selves .

In this presnt days poluation has became a major problem in the world wide so by going on cars ur can prevent sound poluation and you can go anywhere as u like any time any where .
By going on cars we can move to the excepeted place soonly and safely with out any poluation and disturbances .
Otherwise we need to wait for train for bus or we shuld move before the place before excepted time to go earlier .

There are many more ways and advantages of a car where as a large famaily can travel easily and comfartly and these days many this cars are used like mobile bussiness justlike small stores and can sell anything .

I conclude that in the twenty years have been used much and by many people because it has got many advantages and saves over time to move from one place to another .
