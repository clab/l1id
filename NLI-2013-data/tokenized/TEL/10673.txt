I agree with the statement that ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' .
Successful people always have some rules and regulations and preplans everything , they do in advance and get success by implementing those rules and regulations .
They are having very strong determination and will power to get success in their work .

Let us consider an example of the great freedom fighter who was well known as Mahathama Gandhi of the country India .
He had been successful in implementing the non-violence movement and also bringing awareness among the people about the movement and succeded in gathering the people and bringing in them awareness .
He had struggled lot for bringing freedom to the country with the coperation of other leaders .
He had all the qualities which had mentioned in the 1paragraph .
He was puntual and sincere and hardworker and also the best freedom fighter among all the freedom fighters of India .
He had taken a risk in implementing a new movement and succeded in it .

In another example , consider a good proffessor .
A good proffesor normally make plans evrything he has to teach for students in advance .
He will make a proper time table and also how to prepare students for exams and get success in it .
He even prepares how to mobilize the students for their future career .
During the class sections , he will implement all the palns he had been made before .
He will finish the portion in time and prepare students well for exams and also give suggestions to thier career .

Finally , I conclude that successful man always preplans everything and follow his rules and regulations .
In former example , if Mahathama Gandhi thought that why to take risk then he may not succeed in bringing freedom to the country .
In later example also , if a proffessor thinks that why to take risk in giving suggestions to students about their career then he may not be a successful proffessor .
So I will say that a successful man always try for new things and take risks rather than doing regular things what he has known .
