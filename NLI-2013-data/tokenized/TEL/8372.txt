THe topic deals with the improtance of understanding ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts , the purpose of studing is to gain knowledge about the topic he is studying , i agree with the above topic and i am in faver of it .

In order to do some work or implement it in or daily life you must know about the main contantys of the study and core concept , you may think of `` COMPUTER SCIENCE '' in order to handle a computer you must the components of it and the function of each part .
If youn take the help of teacher it may help you a lot in any concept or in any object that you want to learn about .

When u know deep about it only you can operate it or repair it if any damage takes place , whit out knowing it you canot touch a single part in it so must know the `` HARD WARE '' concept of the `` COMPUTER '' or if you want to use a `` SOFT WARE '' like `` WINDOWS '' you must know or have a knowledge about `` SOFT WARE '' also .

Similarly if you want to design a car you must know what are the main parts of it and they functions , you must know about the machine mats how they work and also how they are connected internally , and also you must know about the micro processor that in dult in cars which can not be learned practically .

The main concept of each and every object is known by learning about its concepts and the main ideas of it , if you have idea on the perticular topic then you must gain practical knowledge of that perticular object on which you are going to work .

You can ride a bike only when you know the operation of each object of the moter bike , orther wise it may lead to accedents also , so i conclude that it is more important for a student to under stand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn fact .
