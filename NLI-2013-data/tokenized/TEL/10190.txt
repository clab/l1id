Yes I agree with the statement given that `` Succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already knoe how to do well '' .
I think it was important and necessary that the succesful people might go on new things .

Here the reasons for my agreeness are stated .
For example take the person who has in the book of Guiness records , let 's think he was able to done the feet that he can balance a twenty number of glasses by placing them on his mouth .
By the next time he was trying to or attempt to balance the one which has more wait than the previous glasses and not to increase the previous number .

Let take examples about our scientists who discovered or invented the things that are now very useful in our daily economy like fans , refrigerators , televisions , telephones , etc .
Coming to the technology first they discover the telephone with the wiring communication .
After that they did works on improving the communication without wire or wireless communication and not stoping there .
Now a days we can made remote controls so that we can operate or control something else what we required .
I think these may not happen if the talked people were not take risks and invent the new things .

To agree my statement I can take cricket heros who had breaked or won the many number of records .
Recently in the 2007 world cup that was going on one of the match between South Africa versus Netherlands the south african batsmen named Gibbs made an unbeatenable record by hitting six sixers in a over and scored thirty six runs that no bats men evermade .
Telling more about the cricket related to the statement given every team must put their maximum efforts to create the new records .

So , I can agree the given statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
I think the statement can motivate the persons s who can do the same things everytime .
