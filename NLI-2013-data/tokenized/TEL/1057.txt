According to the statement , there should be knlowdge on the academic subjects and should gain more knlowdge on specialize specific subject .

` I disagree the statement .

According to the passage there should have some knlowdge on other subjects , than the specialized subject .
For example take an electrical student his subjects are totally consider of electricity , powerstations , grids , capictors , insulators , and etc .. , if he has knlowdge o9n this subject he can move forward for higher studies .
If the subjects for electrical student he have material management , environmental science , and etc .. , wats the use if he gains more knlowdge on this subject .
he cant for social subjects r statisc r banking .

I wont tell that the student should not have knlowdge on this subjects but he have to know som knlowdge on these subjects .
If he gains more knlowdge on the specialized subjects ho will move on his course go forward for any compitative exams he will perform good and he will get score in that exam and he dont want to jump into other banking exams .

And he keep his intrest on his specialized subjects rather than his the unspecialized subjects , he will becom topscorer i any xams and he might be famous all over the world and he is king of all continents .
if he worked same for the board knlowdge of many academic subjects as well as specialize subject he lost his much time on the board subjects .
If he spent that time for specialize subject he gain more knlowdge and he can score top in that subject and he can be school first for ever .

From conclusion i give message that keep knlowdge on the boared subjects , but dont neglect that subject and keep hard working on the specialize in one specific subject for more knlowdge .
