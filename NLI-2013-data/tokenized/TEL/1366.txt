I totally agree with the statement that having a knowledge on many subjects is better than specializing on one subject .
The world now is growing fast and the diversity in all fields is maximizing .
In such a new and modern world specializing in one subject can be challenging .
Fields which have once been thought to be in isolation or independent are now requring support from other fields .
This interdependency has given raise to more sophisticated companies which require people with a minimum knowledge in many important fields .
This has a lot of applications .

A multi national company ( MNC ) is the best example of a place which require people having knowledge in many fields .
In an MNC there are various levels of work .
Let us take an example of a Human Resource Manager .
His work is to employ new people suitable to the firm , monitor the progress of projects and constantly deal with economic issues of his form .
The above three tasks require aplication in various fiellds like to employ new people he must first basically understand the needs of his firm .
This requires him to have a knowledge in the field of firm bussiness requirements .
Next to monitor a project he should know the platform on which the project is being built .
For this he needs to have some skill in the computer languages .
Next to deal with the economic issues of the firm he must atleast know the basics of the laws of bussiness running .
Thus a level-3 worker like a HR manager requires a knowledge on three totally diverse fields .
If this is the case with a HR manager then we can easilly understand the requirements a CEO needs .

Even scientists need a knowledge on many different fileds other than thier own subject .
For example a physics scientist needs to know mathematics for calculation in physics .
He needs to have grip on topics like trignometry , calculus etc which are essential for solving complex relationships in fields like dynamics , solid state physics etc .
The computer which can be called as the new face of the world changed a lot of approaches in many fields .
It is being used in fields like astronomy , physics chemistry in many ways like embedded systems .
A space research scientist , launching a rocket needs to calculate the astronomical distance between the earth and the target .
This if done with help of a cmputer needs him to understand how to use the system and other such complexities .

E ven the present educational system seems to have accepted the need of having basic information in many fields .
The schools of the presemt day have many subjects lke maths , science , social , languages etc .
The students ought to take all these subjects atleast till a certain grade and then opt for subjects they are interested in .
The courses in collges also have many subjects in the courses which they feel are needed .
For example in engineering all the students also have common subjects in the area of computers , electronics etc .

Thus in view of the new world i feel a knowledge in a many subjects is needed for achieving success .
A specialization in a single area has no great use today .
