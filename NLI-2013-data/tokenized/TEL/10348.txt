I absolutely agree with the statement mentioned .
Success itself means the accomplishment of a risky or a tough job .
People who take the least trodden path , come out with a whole new experience , and more knowledge than the others , who believe in convention and conformity .
The whole essence of success , in my perception is achieving something that has'nt been done before .
So it is all about doing new things , and doing them well .

Most successful industrialists , and businessmen in the world are known to have tried and accomplished something new rather than what they are already familiar with and skilled in .
Larry Page tried to design a new kind of search engine , coupled with a wide range of services related to he internet .
At first , it was considered to be naive and not much useful .
But later on , his creation `` Google '' became very famous , and is now , unconditionally , the best of it 's kind .
One more example is the Indian businessman Dirubai Ambani .

Without people trying out new things , our life would'nt have been the same as it is now .
We would'nt have had new kinds of clothes , infrastructure and modes of travel .
We would'nt have had new genres of music if musicians of those days did'nt try them .
Rap music , for example , was actually a form of minstrel songs sung by the African Americans .
But some musicians attempted to commercialize them , with modern context , and they succeeded .

Risk is another major ingredient of success .
It is because of people 's positive outlook on risk , that man has achieved a lot in the field of science and technology .
Today , we have missions going on on other planets , and on space , only because our precursors risked to do something innovative in this field .

I finally conclude that , successful people , do take risks and try new things .
I even feel that doing something that we are already good at , and that is already tried and done by several others , hardly counts as success .
