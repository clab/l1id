I partially disagree with the statement that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .

Because according to my view most of the students can gain knowledge by learning the facts practically and i belive the principle `` practice makes man perfect '' this proverb says that by learning the facts that is practical experiences will lead a sucessfull life .
Suppose if a medico student who newly enters into his field he may not have an perfect idea how to treat the patient and the patient may lost his life in such conditions the doctor or medico student should not get depresed and shouldnot give up his job , if he do that then he is unfit for his profesional field .
During such sort of conditions he should be very sprotive and should learn the facts .
so that he may not repeat the mistke next time .

And i partially disagree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas , because each and every aspect we cannot learn by facing the practical experiences , so by reading good books which contains the history of succesfull persons like famous writers , politicians , social workers etc we will get and clear idea and concepts so that students lead their lifein a successfull way .

By the understanding the ideas , concepts and leaniong facts will help the student to build up his career in better field .

ATTITUDE + CREATIVITY + TALENT = SUCCESS of student

So due to the above reasons i partially disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
