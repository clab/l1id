Some students prefer to gain ideas and concepts , but I prefer leerning facts .
Facts are mandatory to learn history and culture , practical exposure improve man 's ability , and soul satisfaction .

First of all , facts provide ancient history and culture .
If one experience ant incident one never forget that incident .
There is proverb say `` historynever repeats ' . we can get more knowledge from past and our experiences .
History of our forerunners helps us to life made easy .
Now scientists discovering new things based on past history of theories .

Secondarily , practical knowledge is better than abstract .
Our personel experiences help us to guide how to deal issues in the future .
Facts enable man 's ability and empowers confidence .
For instance , based on clinical tests scientists are discovering new drugs but not on abstract ideas and concepts .
Ideas and concepts are visionery but facts are saving human lives .

Finally , facts make us realize and provide soul satisfaction .
Man need to learn practical things because when we face any problem in the future we have to handle the situations .
Experience feel us confident and happy in life , otherwise we might affect with our issues .

In conclusion , students should learn facts .
Facts deal our issues , provide knowledge , and history .
Hence , I feel facts are essential for students .
