I disagree with the statement that `` IN TWENTY YEARS THERE WILL A FEWER CARS IN USE THAN THERE ARE TODAY '' I strongly belive that the number of cars that are used will definetly increase but not decrease in any sence .
I support my argument by using the following ideas The no of carts that are being used is incresing day by day & it will continue to increse in the future also because the nessity of the cars is more , nower days the temparature is incresing day by day and travelling on two wheeler involves more risk when compared to thecars .
many people can afford to buy a car nower days with the improvement of bank loans and many other factors .
The usage of cars in next twenty will not decrease because even if the natural resourses are getting exhausted people will find out an altrnative over come the problem like developing the solar cars which run by using the solar energy .
Even if the natural resources get exhausted it will definetlu not happen in the next twenty years .
Nower days the battery runned cars are invented , research and development is being made to improve the technology and after twenty years it definetly improoved a lot .
its really hard to immagine the world with out cars , since they are really important to people in many ways .
its hard travell on a two wheeler when compared to the cars .
in the comming twenty years there will a decrease in the two wheeler but in the four wheeler like the cars .
some cars can be driven using natural gas there fore there is no problem that the petrol or the diesel will get exhausted and the cars will stop working .
The technology used in the cars is also developing day by day there fore more sophisticated , more comfortable , more economic , less fuel consuming cars will be developed which makes life more easy .
I sum , the number of cars used will definetly increase due the improved technology & needs of the people .
acoording to the statistics from a decade the the usage of the cars has been increasing and not decreasing , the proof is just take a look at the roads in the cities .
the growth rate in usage of cars will increase but not not decrease .
