To begin with , everyday the manufacture and usage of cars are becomin more and more .
and hence the high percentage of pollution levels in our country ..
and at the same time ..
cars have become a necessity unlike food to survive ..

There are advantages and disadvantages to the following statement , `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .

Firstly the advantages for fewer cars in use is that : -

1. The main aspect is pollution , if the supply of the cars have become less in number automatically the usage will reduce and hence the pollution ..

2. Every one loves travelling in a fast means to get there targets on time , for this they use a faster means of transport .
so when the situation is that way if it is outstation , where is the need of a car one would rather take a flight or a helicopter to meet there targets by which the expenses and rates for each transportation i.e for flights and helicops ..
will come down to reasonable rates ..

Disadvantages : -

1. As every individual have become accustomed to their own lifes , when this new concept arises people would automatically take a back step for not using cars than walking down to some store .

For example , In India , people have a tendency to be lazy enough to get their things done ..
that is if a person wants to get his things from a near by super market he would rather prefer going in his car than walking down to get them .

2. The market share and value its got now on cars , wont be having then as in the next twenty years buying a car will be an asset like owing a flight or a land as their prices will be put up that high ..
as the commodity value is less in number the prices will be high .

To conclude , i do agee with the quotation that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years , but at the same time i say that it would be very costly affair to get the quote right with every individual ..
