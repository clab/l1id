In my view young people are enjoying life more than the old people .
A perfect example to support my view would be me [ young ] when compared to my father [ old ] .

I have no responsibilities to take care of .
So I have more time to fish out , hang out with friends and participate in social activities .
On the other hand , my father has lot of responsibilities .
He has his time devoted to certain activities .
He is so occupied with this that he does not get any time to enjoy his life .

I also believe that attitude is another factor which can support my view .
Young people have possitive or open kind of attitude .
While the old people have reserved kind of attitude .
Yound people think that here is lot to enjoy in life .
Old people just think opposite to this .

Another reason to support my view would be spending factor .
I normally spend more than my father .
My father prefers to save instead .
By spending I am able to try our new things , party , going places etc and enjoy life .

Technology advancement is also one of the reason .
Today technology has lot to offer .
It makes life interesting .
I watch movies , take joy rides , play computer games .
This facilities were not available in the earlier days .

The very meaning of life has changed with the generation .
