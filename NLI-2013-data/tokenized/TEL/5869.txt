The topic at hand is whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
This topic is important from many points of view .
I disagree with the statement .
I think the number of cars will not decrease in twenty years down the line .

World is growing at a rapid pace .
Time is the utmost important factor .
Even though there is an increase in the pollution from the increase in number of cars , people will not avoid cars .
They are very much busy with their daily schedules .
They have things to be completed within the deadlines .
They cannot imagine themselves with out atleast an automobile .
They have to run with time .

People find other ways to reduce the pollution , but they cannot sacrifice their cars .
They would say that increase in the number of plants would decrease the pollution .
Even they would invent new methods to reduce the pollution but there would n't be any comprimise in the car usage .

Car number would decrease if car owners comes forward to disown their cars as the cars are creating the environmental pollution , which is impractical to considerable itself .
Maintaing a car is also important from esteem point of view .
There is a craze for the cars in the market .
Some people wants to buy cars as soon as a company releases the product .

Even there is a scarcity in the gas or petrol , new cars will be invented which do not require petrol or gas , instead uses the natural resources like the solar energy or biogas .
Besides `` As necessity is the mother of invention '' people would certainly do research to create new cars which solves the problems created from the existing cars

The technology is also supporting the increase in the number of cars .
With the ever growing technology , new cars with different power , style and with high efficiency are being invented daily .
There is a competition between the companies for producing the best car .
This competition and thrist to win the market will lead to increase in the number of cars in future .

In conclusion , I think the number of cars will increase with time , even though there are some negative effects from the increase in number of cars .
This effects are nullified from the advantages and necessity of the cars
