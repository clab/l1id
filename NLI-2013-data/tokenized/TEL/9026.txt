I agree to the statement that students must understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The reasons for this is an incident occured in my life , i prefer tell my experince about this statement .
when i was doing a project i used to sit wit my project team consisting about 10 members where each one gives there own ideas which come to their mind , when i was in the team i should understand the idea given by the person so that i could implement the idea to get the good result .
in the same way when a person is working in the group he should respect the ideas of others by listening and understanding them .
One of my friend works in the IT company as a designer of the website .
when he is doing that he gets many doubts about that page which he is designing then he askes his partner to give him some suggesstion and to share some good consepts relating that design .
when the partner gives the concept it is the duety to understand by the one who is ready to implement .
Otherwise there is no use of taking concepts or ideas from other ...
In the same way when a perticular person gets any idea in his mind the next job he does his understands the later part of the idea .
based on these examples that i have given i could fairly agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Learning facts is obviously done by any one who experinces the incident that he could remember very fairly .
according to me when ur around some people you should get to understand what they are talking about and understand their ideas and views produced by them .
Finally i would say that i do agree about the statement reguarding the issue given .
