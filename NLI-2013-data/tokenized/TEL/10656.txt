I will agree with the statement that Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .
Success depends on the proper planning , the amount of effortness , taking the right decision at right time .

There are many successful people that they become successful by taking risks .
For example Thomas alva edison who invented the electric bulb by doing almost one lakh experiments by trying the new ways and by taking risks finally he succeed .
There so many scientists are there who sacrified their life the world by inventing the new things by taking risks .

In politics there so many succesful persons are there .
For example Abraham lincon the americas formar persident who came form poor family became the president of america .
In the early stages he was also unsuccesful but by perseverence by taking risks he became succesful .
Another example is Mahatma gandhi who sacrificed his life for freedom fight .
His weapon is non-violence .
He took several years for getting the freedom .
By taking risks and try the new things to fight agaist the rules of british government .
Finally he was succeed .

According to bussiness the most successful person whom loved is Dheeru Bhai Ambani the former chairman and managing director for Reliance industries ltd .
He came for a middle class family and he started his carrier with small petrol bunk with a little money .
After that by taking new things and taking risks he became the most successful person .
Because of the hardwork and the perseverence taking the right decision in right time he became more succesful .

However by taking too much of may cause so many problems .
Some people think that doing what they already know to do well .
By that way the successful people try new things and take risks and get success .
