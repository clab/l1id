Ya , i do agree with this statement that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do wel . ''
Most of the well known people who got successe surely went on with lots of risk 's .
This is because one wont have a special attraction untill he do somthing which is extrodinary .
If he/she is success with that new idea , then they will surely be praised .

Succesas only comes with one who came over lots of hard work and faced lots of hardships .
The person who wanted to invent an aeroplane , at first kept there life at risk by flying themselves into air .
The shape of that idea is an aeroplane .
If they wouldnt have get that creative idea and if they wouldent have implemented that idea one couldnt see an aeroplane at this time .
Such great invention are to be remembered forever .

Every individual should have a right goal and should know how to succesed .
Success play 's a vital role in ones personal life .
One will have its impact surely in his upcoming carrier .
Even though there are lots of success stories around us , we maily give our importance to the one which is unique .
Doing the same old thing may also bring some importance , but as when compared with the success which includes risks and different turns all over its way , its nothing .
We have many well known people such as Newton , Right brothers and so on .
these people are well know for ther great inventions due to which we now have the `` Law of Gravity '' , aeroplane , telephone and all .
The major aspect of success is hard work , creativity and a good intelectual brain .

Every person can become an inventor or somthing else only if he/she is studious , very much conserned with his/her ideas , innovative thinking .
one should surely try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do to come out with flying colours .
