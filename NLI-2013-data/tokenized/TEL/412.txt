I partly agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of the many academic subjets than to specialize in one specific subject .
Because it may be acceptable in some aspects and it may not acceptable in some apects .

It is better to have knowledge in many subjects .
Because it is a very best method to know about the all the subjects and to get awareness of all the subjects which is very useful .
Bcause by having an idea about the all subjects people can easily overcome the present competition .
For example in many campus recruitements the softwarecompan are asking the questions about the all the subjects rather than a particular subject .
They are trying to test the knowledge and idea of the person about the various subjects .
So it is better to study many subjects rather than a particular subject .

And all the times the knowledge of the more academics is not useful .
Because it is better to know to study clearly about the particular topic and improve the analysing capability of the subject in a keen way .
Because specalist in one subject will know about the detailed information of the subject .
They can solve the problems which are araised in that field easily because of the vast knowledge of the subject .
They can do the reaserch in the subject and can develop new technical methods which are very useful to the humanbeings .
The specialists are required in every field to manage the system .
So it is good to have vast knowledge in a particular field .

So it will be better in many situations to have knowledge about the academics to be aware of the all the subjects in order to be a succesul person in the present competition .
And it is also very good to have deep knowledge about the one subject to be perfect and to manage a particular field .
