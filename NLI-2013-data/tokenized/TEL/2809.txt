I partially agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .

Being young genereally means that you are single and dont have much responsibilities on your shoulders .
Young people show great interest to experiment with various options they are given .
They show enthusiasm with lots of energy .

Older people also enjoy their life but in other ways .
These ways are very different from that of the young people .
They enjoy their work , home , children , and if they are retired from their jobs , they enjoy each and every moment as they spent their entire lives earning , taking care and doing their responsibilities .

However , being ready to experiment sometimes could be very dangerous .
Young people in a mood of being too enthusiastic to do new things , may fall prey to drugs and other illegal activities .

Having no responsibilties makes them a kind of free bird which can make young people reckless in the work they do and also be harsh and insensitive towards fellow beings .
Sometimes having no responsibitly makes young people not to take things seriously about their personal and preofessional matters , which eventually leads to depression and sometimes life threatening .

Older people due to their age , failing health and other reasons may not be that optimistic about going and doing an outdoor activity .
Most of the old people love to go to museums or go to a picnic with their families or play golf .
Young people usually prefer to go to pubs , trekking and some adventurous games and places .
They prefer activities which are risky and also challenging .

However , I feel that it is all in one 's heart , what you feel about yourself , what you want and what you can do .
Because your age is what your heart feels .
