I agree the following statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject '' .because for several reasons one reason will be a the student will know many subjects in different areas .
Because he may helpful for these subjects in future instead of learning in one subject .

for the future he wants to know every section , so for practising he will learn the as many subjects as possible .
The another reason for this will be a some students should have more talent and hard work to learn more subjects in different areas like languages and know the different traditions and cultures , for such type of students it will be a very useful the learn more subjects .
For learning one subject and known fully about such subject is useful in such subject in certain conditions , but the several conditions it will not useful for the people .
so learn more is better than learn less , the people known about many skills will have a good compare to the others .

The main reason for the learning more subjects than the one specific subject will be a , the opportunities of the society in now conditions will be high to the knowledge in several areas .
the people should know the subjects clearly and understandble them , then only he has a opportunities .
learning different subjects in a same time will also be a good skill and it will useful in future life for learning new objects fastly .
the reason should a man capable of understanding different areas at a time then will be a good communicator in several ways .

The knowledgw of many academic subjects will be the good aspect for every one , so as iam considering learning more subjects is helpful compare to the learning one subject .
