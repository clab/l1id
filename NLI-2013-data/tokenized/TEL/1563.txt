I agree with the statement that one should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specializing in one specific subject .

I believe in being `` jack of all trades and master of some '' .
We should aim to increase our competency in the subjects that interest us , but should also have broad functional knowledge about the other subjects .
This will also enhance our capability to integrate various subjects and arrive at a solution to a problem .
It is because , in the present world scenario , the distinction between various subjects is becoming increasingly ambigious .
There are lot of topics that are related to more than one academic subject .
Our real world systems are also mirror this ambiguity .
Fuzzy logic and programming IT domain are two concepts that address this fact .

A person is also expected to be adept at handling more than one kind of issue .
We are looking for people who are versatile and who have a variety of skill sets .
For instance , managers are expected to understand market dynamics , organisational hierarchy , strategy consulting and even do performance appraisals .
Similarly , in the IT industry , we are looking for good programmers with ` domain knowledge ' in more than one field .
If a person restricts himself to specialisation in one subject , he will be completely ignorant about the other subjects that may have a critical impact on his daily life situations .
Also , he may be missing out on some interesting facts related to the other subjects .

A broad functional knowledge of many academic subjects also increases our ability to comprehend a problem and arrive at a holistic solution .
We will attain a deeper understanding of the workings of various systems , both natural and man-made .
Then , our thought processes will also tend towards analysing a situation , integrating our knowledge of various subjects and enabling us to be more imaginative and innovative .

To put in a nutshell , a broad understanding of many academic subjects will make us become better solution providers and all - rounders in most walks of life .
