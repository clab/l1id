I agree with the following statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
When a person wants to learn the facts first he has to have some ideas how he can come to the end point .
first of all he has to make clear about the concepts he wants to include to reach that destiny .

For example , if we want to do some project to submit to a professor we have to have some dead time to finish , then we have to concentrate how we can finish that assignment with in the time .
first we have to create some ideas like which books we have to refer , how we can present that paper , the order of the paper , we have to show to someone who can give us the some more information that can be included , put the paper in clear format and submit the paper .

Factual information may be the true information to learn that before we have to understand what are the hidden ideas and the concepts .
when we be in a family everyperson tries to reach a fact so easily about others but before going to a conclusion about that person we have to have some idea about his behaviour that is how he talks , how he moves , how he behaves with in the house , then we have make a concept about that person then atlast give the facts about that person .

I conclude my passage by saying that every person , for example student should create an idea about which graduation he wants to complete and what courses he is intrested and prepare a concept that what is required for him to complete the graduation .
take some suggestions , know how difficult it is and then enter in to fact that he wants to end up with that certification of graduation in which he is intrested with joy .
