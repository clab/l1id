I agree in part with the statement that It is better to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects than having speciality only in one specific subject .
I give my views and opinions to my decision .

Firstly , having broad knowledge in every field of academics is essential to know the different aspects of our day to day life .
Like having a knowledge about Biology is essential even to a Mathematician in his daily life .
Silmilarly , having knowledge about Buisiness , Art , Technologhy is also essential to him .
These apply to all the fields of people , a Botanist or Zoologist needs maths for his statistical analysis and Geography to study the distribution of life .
A Buisinessman should be aware of the Software programs to use in his Buisiness life .
A Software Engineer also requires knowledge regarding changing costs and about the finances .
On the contrary spending so much of time in studying all the fields makes his time less to master his own subject .
Society needs specialists in every field of academics from Doctors , Engineers and in every field of life .
Taking example of a Doctor , he needs to study all the subjects in medicine to a basic extent .
Later if he specialises in a particular subject like Cardiology , Pediatrics or Gyneacology .
He should have awareness of the complaints and diseases all kinds of people suffer from .
Because if a women comes to a see a Cardiologist and he finds she also has a Gynaecological problem he should immediately refer her to a Gynaecologist .
This shows the respect and smartness of a Doctor in dealing her overall health status .
But he is a specialist and he can correct her cardiac problem alone which a nonspecialist doctor could not do .

So specialisation is required in every academic subject to show maximum results of the study and master the field one is in .
On the other hand basic knowledge about all the other subjects should be incured in every individual which is required in this current era .
