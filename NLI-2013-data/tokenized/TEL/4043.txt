I agree with the statement young people do not give enouh time to helping their communities .
Actually young people do not have enough time to helping their communities .
The examples and reasons are as follows .

Firstly today young peolple are busy with their schedules .
Every young person running along with the clock to survive in this busy world .
People are working hard to acheive their goals because of day by day population is increasind and also competition is increasing .
Young people are totally exhausting their energy for their carriers itself .
There is no extra energy to help communities .
Some of them are not having enough time to work for themselves .
For instance , today many young people surviving by their own without creating problems to their parents .
Students are working while they are studying .
Some students hardly fine time to study because of their work .
This is the main reason why young people are not having time to helping their communities .

In addition to that , Now a days education is so much stressed that young people have no time to look upon communities atleast those young people even dont know that communities are search for help .
Today schools are giving lots of home work to do that these young people are not in position to do other activities .
Like students employees also having same problem with their work .
Today many companies not considering the time that the employees work .
They want the amount of work .
They are imposing the work on employees .
I have an real example for this statement .
My elder brother is working as a sofware engineer .
In his companie 's policy they have holidays on saturday and sunday .
But my brother used to go to the office even on sundays also because of the amount of he have to do .

By considering all the above reasons and examples I conclude that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
