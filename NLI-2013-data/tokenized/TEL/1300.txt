I agrees that it is better to board knowledge in one specialized specific subject .
They are many reasons to claim for the second option because to have board in one specialized subject we can know the deep concept in that subject .

I did not prefer boarding knowledge of many academic subjects cannot bring much concepts in all subjects .
When we r specialized in one subjects we can apply the concepts in the real world .
By studying about the different subjects some people cannnot know the concepts in their aware subjects .
Most of the people are intersted to do specialization in one subject because some willl show more interst in their specialized subject .

If people is forced to do the academic subjects he will show the preference in this intresting subject .
But knowing of the different subjects come may confused by the concepts they did not know the concept is specified in that subject .
Doing job in one concerd subject is our aim .

By studying about one specilized subject one can grasp many ideas form that subject .
by know tooo may subjects is waste because we cannot grasp the concepts in different subjects .
The familiar in one subject make theman a scientist .

In conclusion , doing the specialised in one subject is better .
By knowing one specialised subject we can challenged to the real world by our concepts .
We can tackle the subject more and more .
We can apply the fundamentals and we can invent many many kinds of concepts in that field .
So for these reason i support specializes in one subject is better .
