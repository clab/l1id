It is very important for the students to learn ideas and cocepts . b because ideas contribute to the fundamentals which are very important to learn in the initial stages .
with out idea one cannot proceed futher so understanding these fundaments will help in building a strong base for the concept .
for example a good reasoning will always help in drawing conclusions .
only when a concept is clear the solution could be deduced from the information .
for an example if an experiment is conducted learing only facts will not help .
having the basic knowledge about the idea and how its developed will often tend to futher research and study .
more or less ideas contribute to many things .

secondly the basic idea of the concept is to learn about how the concept works .
one can reach the conclusions if the concept is clear so understanding the concept is very important than learing abt the facts .
with out proper understanding of the concept may often lead to bad study and the findings may not be accurate .
only when the concept is clearly understood then it can explain the possible solution for the particular experiment hence ideas and concepts give rise to learn about the facts .
just learning facts is not helpfull unless a complete understanding of the concept is not clear for an example in experiment the pupose of the experiment and how to go about the experiment is an idea .
and understanding the pupose is the concept .
and the result is the fact so before knowing the idea and learning the concept one cannot reach the fact .
hence i stongly agree that it is important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts than learning facts .
