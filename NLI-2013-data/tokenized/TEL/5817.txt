Cars are the main means of transport these days in many parts of the world .
But I do not think that this would be a case in twenty years from now .
Many reasons can be stated in support of this thesis .

The first reason is that the cost of fuel is growing at an alarming rate as the petroleum reserves are becoming scarce .
Also there is no alternative to petroleum which is environmental friendly and economical .
This will surely reduce the dependence of middle class on cars .

The second reason is that today 's cities are growing at a rapid pace due to the migration of villagers to the cities in search of better work and living conditions and also due to industrialization .
This will increase the time taken to travel to work and other places .
Also there are traffic jams which can further increase the time .
So people may prefer public transport like the rapid transit system which is cheap and fast .
This will also help in the government in generating more money which it can spend for other useful purposes .

The third reason is that there may be a new invention which can transport people quickly and comfortably .
No type of transport was constantly used from the time of early man .
From horses to automobiles man has come a long way in inventing new types of transport .
After such an invention the car might become a museum exhibit like the horse drawn cabins of the past .

All these points can considerably bring down the number of cars runing on the roads .
Finding out new forms of energy which are both renewable and environmental friendly should be an important concern of today 's governments .
