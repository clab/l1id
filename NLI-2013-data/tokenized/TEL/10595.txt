I agree with the statement that the successful people try new things and take risks rather only doing what they already know how to do well .
There are many reasons for this , some of which i would like to present in this presentation .

The success in one 's life make people to explore many things .
They get intrested as they succeed in the things they do and try to take risk rather than fixing to the things they have done before .
They some times try to see the same things in the different perspect so that they can do even better .

The statement `` successful people try new things '' can be even much explained with an example .
Let 's take Thomas Alva Edison , the great scientist who had many inventions to his name .
Edison had more than 1000 inventions to his name which proves that successful people try new things .
Let us consider the invention of the bulb .
If Edison had convinced with that invention and try to do the same things repeatedly would not have fetched him anything .
He being a successful person tried the new things and took the risk involved in it .
Eventually , he succeeded in everthing .
He kept on inventing many new things which were very useful to the people .
This shows how the successful people try different things .

In my view , successful people should try new things which would help him to gain not only knowledge but also increases the creativity , seeing things in different attitude .
Trying new things even helps one to learn more from his mistakes which would be very helpful in his further things .
Successful people influences the surroundings in which they are , helping the other people to succeed in their part .

In sum , the success which the people get makes them to try for many more new things rather than sticking to the things they already know .
