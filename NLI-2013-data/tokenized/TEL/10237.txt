Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I agree with the following statement because success comes with hard work .

Those who know the taste of hardwork they will try and do more things in life .

This can be explained with a very well known example of Mr. Mittal .
He tried new thing like coleberating with the top steel manufacturing company Arcelor .
Initially there are lot of problems arised .
They are like competition from other companies and racial abusements etc ..

but still because of his hard work he has successful in making his dream true of coleberating Arcelor .
Now it is named as Arcelor-Mittal steel industry .

Successful people know how to overcome risks .
success in life can not be achieved overnight .
success is a hardwork and determination of a person for many years .
successful people like taking challenges in life .
They will fight for success .

Successful people like trying out different things in life .
They want there name to spred all over .
To be a verygood successful person he must have good leadership qualities and ethical principles .
We can have many more examples of successful persons .
Reliance Ambani is the most successful person in our country trying out in many forms like cellular , petroleum , steel , etc ..

Therefore by these examples illusrated above i srongly agree the statement that successful people try new things by facing risks .
Therefore successful persons always win in life .
