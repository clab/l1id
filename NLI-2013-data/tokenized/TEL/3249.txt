The statement claims that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I disagree with the claim that young people do not spend enough time to help their communities .
Some of the reasons for my opinion is stated below .

First , these days we see that are lot of charity organisations which are being taken up and run by young people .
Let us take an example of an organization called Banyan , which is very popular organization in South India .
The organization mainly aims at helping people with mental disabilties .
This organization gives them love and support and also educates people about certain disablities like Alzheimer 's disease , etc .
This organiztion was formed by three young girls in their mid-twenties who realized that these people need the support and love of a family .
There are many such examples of organizantions coming up all across the world all run by young people .
These days youngsters because of greater access to information and also as the overall standard of living of young people in the world is increasing , they want to give something back to the society that helped them grow up .
There are young doctors who are ready to go to the remotest parts of the world and treat people , there are youngsters starting rallying and processions to fight for the various problems faced by the communities of the world .
Young people these days are aware of the situation in many parts of the world where poeple do n't get the basic neccesities of life .
They want to work towards a society which is truly free and does not discriminate a person based on his color or the language he speaks or the place he comes from .

Let us take the 30's and the 40's , most of the youngsters then were at war front fighting for their countries .
Fighting for country does not exactly translate to working for the betterment of your community .
You fight for your country to ensure her freedom .
These decades , were the time when almost the entire younger generation of the world was engaged in the World War , and could not spend time explicitly helping the community .
Following the war came the Cold war and the arms race , during this period the youth of the world were wary that a war might start and were busy protesting against it or preparing for it .

Following the end of the cold war , started atime when young people start making many great achievements in different fields and they all wanted give something back to the community .
Let us take the example of Chris Martin , the lead singer of a band called Coldplay .
The albums he and his band have made have sold in millions acroos the world , however he spends major part of his income in the fight against AIDS and he also to charity shows to raise money to eradicate poverty in the Third World countries .

Thus in terms of money , time or effort young people these days are actively taking part or they are starting their own efforts to help the communities across the globe .
