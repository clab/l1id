I wil agree that the best way to see places is by travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
By doing so we can get a good company , as there are many people with us , we can see more places , and we can collect more infrormation about the places , and further more many people can get their living by doing the travelling guide jobs .

I belive that there are mainly three reasons why I agree travelling with a group led by a tour guide .
The first reason is we can have a good company .
This is because many people are travelling with us .
we can have a good talk with them , and even more we can learn some thing new from them .
And the second reason is we can see more places in the tour .
We did not feel lonly by that .
By visiting more places we can learn more informaton about them from the travel guide .
He will say the history , and importance of that place .
He will show us each and every place that has importance .
As a good example , when i and my friends visited Kalahasti one of the most important place in Indai , we dont know any thing about that palce , just we got few directions about the palce like where to stay and how to go to places .
When we came to place with that directions , they are very confusing we cant understand any thing .
So , we share our money and keep a guide to help us .
He helped us very much by showing all the places and keep on telling their importance .
Even though we spend money , we enjoyed the tour very much .
And the last reason why , i prefer the tour guide is , they make the living with the money , the tourists gave to them .
their entire family is based on that money .
this money will encouraging the people to do the job of travelling guide .

For all these reasons , i prefer travelling with a group , that was led by a tour guide .
