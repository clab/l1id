I agree with the given statement which states that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are number of reasons and examples that support this statement .

The objective information that most of the advertisements show seem very attractive to the public and in many cases that information might not be necessarily accurate .
I cannot comment that the information is incorrect , but some details might be hidden in the information that they show to the public .
The best example for this is the ` vehicle fuel economy ' numbers that the auto advertisements show .
If the vehicle is driven under specific conditions , the stated fuel economy can be achieved .
But practically , under normal driving conditions , it is simply not possible .

Another reason is that the fine print in the advertisements that people in general ignore and would face the consequences later .
As an example , once I opened the home equity line of credit account with a bank because the interest rates were lower .
I ignored the fine print which says that I need to pay huge penalty if I terminate the accouint with in 2 years after opening the account .
Interest rates went up soon after opening the account , and I had to pay fairly big amount to terminate my account with them .

The reasons and the examples explained here might be specific , but in general one way or the other , the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
And , I believe that one of the main purposes of the advertisements is exactly that .
This is one of the business strategies of most of the big companies to suceed in today 's business environment which is extremely competitive .

In conclusion , it is very obvious that most of the advertisemsnts make products seem much better than they really are .
And as discussed above , to some extent , it has become essential for many companies to follow this strategy to succed in the businees in current competetive environment .
