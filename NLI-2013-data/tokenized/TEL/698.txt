In these modren days the technology is developing rapidly , we are going in to competitive world with very complex technologies so inorder to survive in this modren world so one must have good knowledge of many academic subjects .

The broad knowledge of many academic subject makes the person to think more flexible as he get wide variety of knowledge , he can grow up to his own with out any dependencies , when we come to persons carrier it can be flourished and has no limits only the sky will be .
When the person is having broad knowledge on differnt academic subject he can help out others with the knowledge and become a useful resource to many others .
For example our proffessor mr john has wide knowledge on all the academic subjects that we have in this semister he can explain and help us out at any time and the things said by him simple and esoteric , so one can acheive by having good knowledge on differnt subjects .
This knowledge makes him to know that which subject sounds well and which is the interesting one and makes him to know the general awareness of all the subjects .

When we get into job then we need to work on differnt platforms just by knowing only one subject we cant survive in this world so differnt knowledge makes a person better and makes to get well adjust to the environment he is living more over there are some disadvantages also by having the broad knowledge on different subjects the first thing is he cannot manage to have broad knowledge on differnt subjects its quite difficult for him , he cannot get specialized when he has such broad knowledge he can just emphazize on the subject rather than revealing it .

When we come to this specialization on one specific subject that serves a big purpose for example consider doctor , a general doctor has just idea on the particular disease but he refers to specialist in case to heal it or to survivie the patient from it , so specialization is also equally considered important .

Finally i think both the strategies have equal importance the first one make more points than second .
