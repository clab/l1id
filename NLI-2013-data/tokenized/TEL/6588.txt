NO , I do n't agree with this statement .
Because , now a days present technology is improved a lot .
Peoples are introducing four wheelars with different modles and different infrastructure .
Not only this four wheelar two wheelars also .
Now a days buying a car became a prestige issue .
So , every people going to buy a car if they had enough money .

Most of the people in the society feel that if they have a car then only people respect them .
Now a days there is a no person without a car those who had enough money .
People now a days only using cars large in number .
So if u consider the future day-to-day technology is improving a lot .
So , people are crazy about buying a car , especially recently setled people .
In olden days people were craze about buying a bike when they got settled .
But the present situation is not like that , people are paying more intrest on cars not bikes .

I want to share my one of the personal experience .
Consider My uncle , working as an advocate only .
All of his colleagues in the court are bought a car .
So , Inoder to show his prestige issue he simply applied for a loan and he bought a car .
He consider it as prestige issue .
Not only my uncle people in the society are consider it as a prestige issue .

I want to share my another example , i had a friend .
She is younger to me .
She got a job in software industry when i am in B.tech first year .
Before she got settled she always told me that `` i like bike very much , so when i got settled i will buy a bike '' .
But Two years back she bought a car .
Then i asked her , sister two years back you are crazy about a bike , but now you buy a car what is the reason .
Then she replied me `` ohhhh , where are u my dear now a days people are more crazy about cars not bikes , that 's why i bought a car , its also a prestige issue for me '' .

SO , what i conclude is according to the present technology and thoughts of a person ( he/she ) definitely after twenty years the usage of cars will be increased a lot .
