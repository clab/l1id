Yes , I agree that the authors primafacy recommendation is militating .
Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know already how to do well .

Firstly , successful people try to do new things and they want to innovate some thing for others .
For instance i admire Dr.Adul kalam ajad .
He is one of the great , scintilllating and dynamic strongconsistancy person in India .
he is one of the successful person .
Actually he was a techer in a school .
But his anxiety and strong determination makes him now a President of India .
though he is a successful person but he dont want to do what he already known .
He was great scientist in India .
Secondly , the other example is Nelson mandela .
He is a great leader in South Africa .
he had imprisoned for twenty years .
even though his experience made him as his dream strong and deterministic .
at finally he can achieved the independence of his country .
so he is my one of the great leader .
at present he is working as a president position of U.N.O.even he is also a great succeessful person .
But he never thinks that only doing what they alredy know how to well .

Thirdly , Gandhiji is god for India country .
By his only his efforts made now india is on at present position .
His slogan is peace for all things all over the world .
He is also a great succeessful person thst ever known .

so according to my view succeessful makes people and thinks innovatively .
so try to think positive dont think negative .
go ahead and for u r dreams .
