Ideas , concepts , facts are three important methods to know the topic , this will be there for every aspect .
In somecases all three are important to know the topic in detail .
My opinion about this statement - I am disagreeing with following statement .
each and every method is essential for better knowing of the topic .

some aspects will require any of the method for understanding .
while all some require all the three for better understanding of the topic .
for example if a boy was thaught about a topic , and he is thaught all the theories related to the topic and some reasons lying under the subject , the boy will understand partially about the topic .
If he is given some in examples where and when the topic is used and shows how it works , then the boy understand the the topic clearly .

However the methods depend on the age and in which grade is he studing .
If the student is in primary grade all methods are not necessary for him , moreover he rather gets confused if he is thaught .
And the student who is doing graduation or undergraduation , He requires all the three methods as he has to submit research papers on every subject .

in conclusion , I rather believe that all the three methods are important to understand , moreover the main reason for this is the student will be having no doubts on the subject and he will be familiar and perfect with the subject .
I think it is better to know all about the topic , so that will be like `` digging a mine of wisdom '' .
