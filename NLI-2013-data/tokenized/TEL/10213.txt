I agree that successful people do find new things from there experienced knowledge .
Because there is nothing is not invented by the people , how the new things are producing day by day .
so , people used to try for the new things by apllying there skills and abilities on the pertucular work .
Definitely one day they get success in there feild .

Like nowadays we are using different things which are we dont know how they are made and invented .
Behind thereid most hard work and greal knowledge of people who inventing them .
Trying to find new things is very much intrested and more imagination power should require .
People are very talented that they are inventing different types of new things , that we ever seen before .
These successful people are very intresting persons because their thoughts are amazing , unpreditable .
Because they have greate talent , good knowledge in their work , and mainly the strong ability to do the work by any cost time .
They are very energetic to find new things .

But the people who are doing in the work which is already know by them is not a greate thing .
Because doing the regular work brings us boring and tired at work .
Then they become the lazy fellows .
their 's mind alway taking rest .
They do n't want to take risk in their life .
Its not a good idea .
They have to think in different ways like how the world is moving fast .
How the people grow day by day .
such a new ideas brings them also in a sufficient way .

Finally , I concluded that successful people will always stand at top of world .
They get many oppertunities to develope new things for their company and the society .
successful people never work for them , they work for the nation and for the owl world .
Successful people are like the scientists , they think always diffrerently .
But think positive and good for all .
These people had many ideas in there mind and they enable put them in practicle .
They should have greate future .

`` A successful people will try until get the good results , and never stop trying ''
