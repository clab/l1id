the young people have to spend more time in reserching centers , computer centres for improving a lot .
some young people enjoyed a lot with these works .
in the modern technology peoples are working hard .
for the relaxation they go to any enjoy places and spend some releif time .

by this enjoying some young people spoil their life nd did not take care about their futures .
some people are dodnot understand to other people .
but some peoples behavior like this .

older people did not have any technologies compared to now , they did not enjoyed .
because in their days , they dont have good technologies and always tried to do hard work .
