On my opinoin i go with the point as the secces ful peopel will always try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they do already know how to do weel .
In there aspects they go with many succes ful aspects , peopel will may go for risks and they should be more confident in there life if they take risc in it The peopel taking risk shold be in ln order to compete market that is if he is having business of product say soap he had to introduce different types in it to competeate market other wise he may be loss in his way this task is introduce in the oter part of altery having business ( say ) many people follow to take risk in business in order to compete market in the other way he had to see him self more confident abt the way he introduces in to the market he had to work hard for what he is thinking abt the product the succesful person usually work out there objectives in the manner they achieved by .
taking risc in there own business it ressembels a lot in the peopel who depend on them or the firm they working ever .
the aspect should be so planned in order to achive better results in the risk taking strategy for all the succes ful persons Altough there is no written state ment that evere succes ful man will be as lucky in his aspects he may think on the way he was he has to verify the things in the field he is entering and work harder to obtain best results in it Asucces ful man is the one who has great will power with dedication sincereaty altough hard work for his life he is leading if a person is well knowledged he will deside his possisive ness for what he has been thinking about the situation .
in my words the person holding these all good qualities is only a succes ful person by satisfiying him self and the oter who depend on him
