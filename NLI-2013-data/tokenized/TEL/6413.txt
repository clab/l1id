I do not agree with this statement that in twenty years there will be fewer usage of cars than there are today .

I dont agree with this because , firstly , when the technology is increasing there will be more cars in use than they are today .
with the increasing technology we can have cars which seem same as being in our home .
now-a-days we are getting formula1 cars which are the fastest cars in the world .
as the saying goes `` increase in technology will increase the world in many ways '' .cars are also in the same way , with the increase in technology the technology of cars will also be increased rather than becoming fewer in coming years .

Secondly , now-a-days each and every person is prefering to have a car because it is a best as well as convinient way to go in a car rather than going in buses and trains .
because they may consume a lot of time waiting for all the people who are travelling at that time to come .
but when this is compared to cars we dont need to wait because we have our own car to travel .

Thirdly , as petroleum is decreasing day-by-day , we may say that cars will become fewer in use than they are today , but technology is now inventing cars which run by gases for example , gases which we use for cooking etc , .
by this we can say that cars can also be run without petroleum and can be run with gases either .
so this will also not affect for cars becoming fewer in the upcoming years .

So i conclude by saying that cars will not become fewer in use than they are today with the above stated reasons .
the usage of cars will increase rather than decrease in the coming years .
