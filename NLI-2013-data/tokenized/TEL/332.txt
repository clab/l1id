I do agree with the statement , untill unless a person is willing the take risk and try things differently the posibility of success is less .
as doing the same thing will produce more of the same results , which he or she already is experiancing .
if they are not enhancing a persons life , no matter how much he do what already he know will not make him successfull in anyway ,

in my own example i did by moving to united sated , if i whould have left in my hom country i would have not been successfull as i am right now .
by moving to this coutry i took the risk of leaving my safe job back in my country , which i was doing for almost 5 years , i was well estabilised in job know what i was doing hence i dont have to worry about job , but the pay was not great .
if i would have stayed i would making same amount of maney , and my experiance in life would have remained the same

Ever since i moved to united states i have making more money , i have bought a home and leaving very happy life .
and more imporatanly i have oppertunity to meet the new people and know about various cultures , as many people from different coutries come and settle heit whould have not possible if i have stayed back .
