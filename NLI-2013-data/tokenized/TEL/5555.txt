The issue under consideration is the argument that most advertisements attempt to project their products in a manner that showcase the products in much better light than they actually are .
This issue appears to be a very common and valid statement , since more often than not , it is a general complaint among customers that products never seem to deliver what they promise in their promotions .
However , I would like to disagree with this statement , keeping in mind my consideration of certain important factors , such as the process that people use to choose certain products , the efforts being made my manufacturers towards developing their products , government , civic and judicial laws that mandate advertisements to give the correct picture , and the role of public interest groups that strive to increase customer awareness regarding the buying of products .

The first point that I would like to highlight is the motivation of customers in buying products .
Many customers do not realize that the products they buy are actually not targetted at them at all in the first place .
For example , people who face hair loss on their scalp tend to buy products like hair loss prevention shampoos , without first checking whether that shampoo is indeed formulated for their problem , which may be occuring due to more serious medical reasons .
When such customers do not get the results they expected , they tend to blame the product , and accuse its advertisement of false campaigning .
To prevent this , customers should become aware of the fact that they need to excercise discretion and perhaps get some medical or non-medical advice ( like in the shampoo 's case ) when choosing products .

The next point I would like to emphasize on is the sincere efforts being made manufacturers of products to provide more information on the intended targets of products , product composition , possible shortcomings or side effects of their products , etc , through easily accessible mass communication channels like the internet and television .
For example , companies issuing public mutual funds do make it a point to issue a warning at the end of their promotion on television , asking viewers to exercise caution and prior research when investing in their funds .

A third very important point to note is the role of government and/or judicial bodies or authorities in passing laws that ensure that advertisements do not make false claims , and allow customers to file suits as applicable , against such companies .
I believe that such laws deter advertisers from hyping up their product .

Finally , any free society has a large number of public interest groups that volunteer to monitor and check wrongful acts such as over-promotion of goods or services in the intent of gaining profit by misguiding customers .
Such societies provide a framework to actively patrol and educate people about such misleading ventures .

In conclusion , I believe , that due to a host of factors , some of which I have detailed above , advertisements of today , though capable , do not actually make deliberate attempts to mislead customers by over-hyping the features of their products .
True , they may use popular celebrities to endorse their brands , or use jazzy visuals and other media , but the actual claims made are largely truthful , and they do make sincere attempts to clarify who their target audience is .
