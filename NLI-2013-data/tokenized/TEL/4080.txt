I definetely agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not spend much time in helping their communities .
Although their maybe certain individuals who find time to help others in their community but the majority of the young people are busy with their own committments and do not find time to help others .

One of the reasons for not helping others maybe that young people are not able to find time to help even though they are willing to do so .
The young people nowadays are so engrossed in their committments like studying and working on a job to support their career that most of them do not find time at all to help others .
Whatever little time they find they use it for relaxation from their heavy schedule .
Their daily activities are so cramped up that they cannot find time to help someone in their community .
I myself faced this problem when their was flooding in our locality .
I did not face any problems but certain low lying areas around our house faced problems .
Instead of helping those people I was busy in preparing for my final examinations which were going on at that time .
How much ever I wanted to help them I could not as I had to prepare and do well for my final exams .

The other reason might be that the young people nowadays are lethargic and tend to spend time for themselves rather than help someone else .
Whatever time they find they tend to spend it for themselves and enjoy rather than use it for certain charitable causes like helping someone else .
I had an experience thats fits into this .
This occured during our vacation time .
Their was an opportuinity to help certain poor students in our community with their teaching during the vacation .
But some of my friends who had just taken examinations decided to relax and get away .
They went on a holiday for half of the vacation and thus could not help those students .
Their should be a sense of self sacrifice in order to help others .
But majority of the younger generation now have no such values .

Finally , what I think is that majority of them do not help others because of the above specified reasons .
Their might be a little percentage of younger people who find time to help others but as a whole the younger generation is busy with their own life .
This has to change and young people need to find time and help others in their community .
