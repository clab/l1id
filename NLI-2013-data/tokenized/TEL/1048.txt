Contemporary world demands a wide repertoir of skills and a reasonable fund of knowledge to enjoy the comforts and facilities afforded by advances in science and technology .
I agree with the idea that it is preferable to have a broad base of many academic subjects rather than having specialized knowledge in a narrow specific subject .
I would like to substantiate my point of view in this essay .

There has been an unprecedented explosion of knowledge in the recent decades - it is impossible for any single individual to master any field .
In the same breath , the advances are so profound and far reaching that knowledge has no subject boundaries any more .
A specialist in a specific field cannot contribute at the periphery of his subject area unless he knows about other subjects that interlink with it .
For example , physicians who wish to deal with genetic diseases cannot function efficiently unless they have good back ground in genetics and biochemistry , two closely related subjects .
Similarly the advances in gene unravelling would not be possible if computer scientists and geneticists had strictly compartmental training .
Bio-informatics is a new field emerging to support and solidify the biological information with the help of computer technology .

One can quote endless examples : the advent CAT scan is an engineering marvel that yields invaluable information to the treating physicians about the interior of body .
Use of computer and internet is an insepetable feature of our daily life , which is not possible without learning computers .
Being a great scientist would not suffice - one should be trained in the social sciences too - sociology , psychology and economics .

Most North American universities support this view by encouraging students to have a graduate degree ( of any subjects ) before one can apply to the med school .
Most other parts of the world seem to be following the same trend , and a variety of new courses with innovative subject combinations are on the horizon .
With such developments it would be easy to find students with a broad based general information and a few of them with intensive knowledge in specific fields , like an astronomer trained in music and enjoying his piano in the space !
