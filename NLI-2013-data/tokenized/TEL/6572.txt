The world has witnessed a dramatic increase in population and also the amount of abuse that humanity has done to environment .
I feel that there would be a considerable amount of increase in the use of cars in the future .

The world undergoes a goelogical cycle inorder to maintain the balance of nature .
Man has been very instumental in creating an imbalance in nature .
In order to create a balance , the world has witnessed unforseen natural calamities which have killed millions of people .
The movie , `` The Day after Tomorrow '' has made real sense in showing what would be the state of the world in sometime from now .
Our natural reserves are being exploited to their limit .
Soon we would have none of our natural reserves left .

But , technology has made giant leaps in exploring the unknown .
We will have to depend on alternate methods of energy to run our automobiles and other equipments .
Solar power is the best possible example of an alrternate source of energy .
Battery powered cars have been manufactured which are eco friendly .
Although fossil fuel consumption would become low , the number of cars would see a dramatic increase .
As more number of eco friendly cars are produced , the more affordable would they become .

Population would as usual continue to rise unless a major catastrophe occurs .
Cities would grow bigger witnessing a major problem of faster transport due to conjusted roads .
Industries would have to service more number of people .
Thereby to increase efficiency , they would have to have a better transport facility .
This is to ensure faster delivery of goods .
Residential colonies would be located in satellite towns far away from the city to ensure better facilities .
Therefore , cars would be of a major concern .

For time to come , I feel that with the current demands of industry and population , cars would be used more than they are being used currently .
