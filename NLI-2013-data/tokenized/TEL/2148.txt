Many people spend their time in different ways .
Like chidren spent more time by playing as they enjoy it and similarly younger people find enjoyment by spending with their friends and so on depeding upon their interest and ways of getting enjoyment .
which does n't mean that some enjoy alot others donot as all get enjoyed well in their own ways .
From this I dont agree that younger people enjoy more than older people , because even older people enjoy in their own ways .

As older people become weak enough as their age go up , so they might not able to move freely and comfortable as like young people .
Even if they do them they would suffer from pains and injuries .
They enjoy alot in their own ways by telling stories , or by telling their past experience to children .
Also they find lot of enjoyment by going on for small walks near by .
When i was a child i got a great time in giving enjoyment to my grandmother as he feels alot a happy in telling stories , flashbacks and even we used to go to garden and pluck some carrots and ate which made by grandmother to have lot of enjoyment .
So by this we can say age does n't limit aperson in enjoying his life .
Every one got their own way to spend time happily .

Similarly Young people find their enjoyment by spending time with friends or by going to parties or even by participating in extra curricular activities .
As they have got a good health and energitic they can participate actively unlike older people , but this does n't mean that the older people do not enjoy their life .
Rather i feel that older people enjoy more than younger people .
As younger people participate in the events which needs alot of energy and makes easily tired up .
So all these states that enjoying life can be done different ways according to personal fitness and interests .

So i strongly state that like young people older people also enjoys but only the difference is the ways they get enjoyment .
