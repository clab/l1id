It is an increasingly busy life that we all , are leading today .
Presently the day 's are such that we do n't even have time to talk to our neighbour , or as a matter of fact we are too busy to spend time for ourselves .
Under these circumstances it is hard to expect anybody to work for the welfare of the community or for other people .

I completely agree with the statement that `` YOUNG PEOPLE NOWADAYS DO NOT GIVE ENOUGH TIME TO HELPING THEIR COMMUNITIES ''

Today 's youngster 's are leading a very busy schedule .
In order to cope up with the pressuers of life , the person has to be multitasking .
while , studying in the university , today 's students are requires to work and at the same time , concenterate on studies to get best of the grades .

Even , for those people , who only work , the company that they are working in leaves them no time to spend for themselves .
It 's a global world , which is characterized by a lot of competion and only those who are willing to put their best efforts in work can survive here .

Although , young people are not able to do much , because of their schedules , a device has to be worked out to carry out the welfare activities .
