I agree with the opinion that having the knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to have deeper knowledge in one major subject .
It is more important for the undergraduate students to have the basic knowledge in the fields like biology , history , chemistry , archeology etc .
The students should be able to know the basics of the various subjects before taking the major subject .
For example , if the student dont have the basic knowledge in the biology subject then he may not know the various organs of his body and their functions .
Then the student may not know the kind of food he must take for the proper function of the particular organ .
He need to face so many problems if he doesnt know about the functioning of his own body .

One more example is that , student can be able to know about the origin of the his culture and tradition if he has a basic knowledge of the subject ` history ' .
He can know about the different places in the world and he know better about the world map .

The students should also be perfect in the general knowledge .
He should know what is happening around him and also should know the changes in the political affairs .
Then only he could judge the things in a better way .
He must know the current affairs .

The university is the major source from which the students gain the basic knowledge in the different fields .
They should provide a good environment for the students so that they can have the overall development .
For the student the overall development is very much important to compete with outside world in the future .

Before choosing their major field the students must have a basic knowledge in the other subjects also then only they can compete with the outside world .
