`` success follows those who sweat ''
I strogly agree with the statement since in life we have to take chances i.e risks .
By taking risks it not only increases our confidence level but also give us self satisfaction , acclimation to our actions .

For example Scientists try to discover new ways or invent the things which works faster , effectively , low cost and higher reliabillity and which out date the present product , so they try new ideas to invent a product which have a high risks , such as marie curie has devoted her life to study the radium and it 's patterns with high risk factor .

Second example is of Stunt master who always take risk to make a shot for film , each time he performs new feat with courage and risk and so he is rewarded , Third example is of Japan technology since , each person in a firm has his own importance , such as take the manufacturing of television , in this one person manufactures only picture tube and other manufature only the equipment of the television , by continuously manufacturing they innovate new ideas of manufacturing with some bit of risk , because of it their technology is now very advances .

In my opinion man has to take risks since after risk it would be definetly success , which follows in one or the another way .
A succesful man need not to look for oppurtunities but turn the risks in to oppurtunities .
in summary man has to take risks .
