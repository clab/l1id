From my point of view , it would be really an impressive option to have the better knowledge of many academic subjects .
As far as i 'm concerned i think it would be splendiferous in improving several academic topics , besides they could increase the general knowlege and also creates splendid improvement in the case of different subject skills .
But in the case of a unique subject provides the improvement in only one subject .

In this instance , let 's consider an example , if we presume a student who is concentrating in only one subject , consider political science .
He might be thorough in only his concerned subject then he might not get any additional skills towards other subjects .

When in the case of another student who is concentrating in different kinds of subjects , in this hypothetical case the student definitely gets familiar in many topics that he had read .
if we presume some of the topics choosen by the student would be from software engineering technics , embedded systems , japenese literature , data mining and ware housing ...
so on , through his streunous attempt towards learning thse topics would yeild him several sponteneous achievements by educating him inthose subjects .
So educating in so many academic subjects would overweigh towars the results brought up by the single subject , because the specialization on many academic subjects outputs the spectacular and magnificient and picturesque results .
And student must feel amour propre towards him .

Eventually , i conclude that taking several academic subjects in order to get specialization in some subjects all at a once such as , political sciences , japanese literature , software engineering techniques , embedded systems , data mining and warehousing , the student would get the out standing benifits by getting skills , rather than the student practicing in only one subject .
Eventhough he could get the broad knowle
