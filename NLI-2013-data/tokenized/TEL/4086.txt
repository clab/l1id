Yes , I agree with the statement that young people are not showing up intrests in helping the communities rather most of them are intrested in other useless activities as far as concerned .

Many communities need helping hands to cover their problems .
young people should be their icons , but unfortunately they are not , added to that they take up a large participation in damaging those legal communities .

for example , their are many communities for old-age people , They are forced to live up in boundage houses wheir they lack their family sentiments though their children are financially sound .
Most of them feel it to be a burden to look after them and to get relieved from this they , force the aged people to live apart
.
Young people now-a days are more attracted towards the external affairs they are not supposed to be .
They are not sparing up their time to help the communities even in their liesure time rather they are attracted towards the entertainment section like movies , clubs etc.they dont even have time to spend on the communitie in which they live , they simply try up to escape from it as much as possible .

I think they shoud to be focused to the advantages and satisfaction they get when they help the communities .
The abase response to this , should be shown to them theoritically .
The matured quality in such matters shoud be inheritted into them .

Young people , these days are misleaded about the importance of the communities and their uses .
communities accumulate forms the nation .
They are a pride factor for resemblence .

finally , I conclude that young people should always approach the communities in a possitive way and help the communities as far as they can .
Helping the communities tend to help themselves in all
