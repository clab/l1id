Although there may be some special cases where youngsters are helping their communities , I agree that they are not spending enough time .
There are three reasons why I arrived at this conclusion .
Firstly , in these days every one is striving for a good career - to get a good job in some reputed company or to start his own business .
In this race for a good career , most of us will not care for what is going on with the outside world .
Instead we will concentrate only on our aim until we get it in our hand .
We will motivate all our thoughts in that direction .
We will spend each and every second in our life for that goal .
So we are not getting time to help our communities .

Another reason is that , now a days a person becomes famous mostly because of his wealth .
He will be given respect based upon his fortune .
In this scenario , it 's no surprise that every one becomes greedy for wealth and fame .
So we does n't waste our time for non-profit activities i.e , activities which will give no profit in form of money like helping our communities .
We will focus all our time on doing some work to earn some thing .

One more reason is that most of us enjoy playing sports .
So if we find any leisure time we will cater it to playing instead of doing any other thing .
What we also feel is that playing is conducive to health and also maintaining a good physique always fetches .
Obviously there will be no free time to us when we are spending it in another way .

Finally , youngsters now a days are giving more preference to their career , accomplishing wealth and also maintaining good health .
They are missing the fundamental rule of helping others , which inturn helps us .
Let 's hope a time definitely comes when our people will realize this truth and thrive for the prosperity of our human community .
