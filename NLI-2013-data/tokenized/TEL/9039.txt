Students are the best study materials for some researchers at various stages in there student life , they are much more interesting to study when it comes for there ability to undertstand something or to do some work given to them , many students go through a particular protocol given by there teachers or there parents at home at the other hand many other students work with there creative brains which makes them much more active and intelligent than the earlier students with particular protocol .
Researchers have concluded that people with protocol have less creative brains than that of the others .

I agree to the staement given that students understand ideas and concepts more than it is from the learning factors because students interact more with their friends rather than their teachers and it is easier for them when something is put into their minds at the level of friends , for example a kid need to be punished to learn that he or she have to be quite in the class room when a teacher is teaching something , but at the same time he learns to share his toys with his friends when they both have a different kind of toy .

Students logical brain work more faster when compared to that of an other student with protocol because one of the student is bound to certain rule to do that thing in a particular way where as the other student need not go in a bounded way , he can opt any way to attain the goal , learning facts have become so boring and routine that students try to avoid such facts which is a great loss for the future of the students .
Another good example of self learning is when a student sit in front of computer he or she themselves start exploring that topic or that particular computers buttons .

Finally i would say that students need to concentrate more on ideas and concepts they face in there real life and learn lot much of it , present situation is that students who have more creative brain comes upin life much faster than the student with a particular protocol .
In future school authoruity need toplan how they mix up learning facts with that of ideas and concepts tomake students much more creative .
