I will agree with this statement that says `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than ther are today '' Now a days cars are came in to demand to improve the quality of the life and save the time and maintain the dignity every one are using the cars .
But after some time these are replaced by the other means of trasportation .

modern man invented airoplans with his great intensive knowledge .
I think these airoplans replace the use of the cars in the future generations .
Because day by day technology also improving to meet the greatest adanced things in the modern life .
With the help of the technology man invented differnt things like computers and satillites and airoplan to save the time .
as well as improve the standerds of living .
Time saving might help him work on the other thing like to invent the different advanced thing .

I think after twenty years ther going to be a marked change in community like in food habits and transportation .
In the olden days they are only buses , trains .
but now cars are replaced these things .
i belive after twenty years marked change in the economy system of the whole community like in they can spend more money in tavelling and try to improve the technology more and more .

Now a days globle warming effect is really showing the affect on the environment .
Increase in corbandioxide in the air causes the deplication of the ozone layer .
corbendioxide is basically comming from the using of automobile realising .
They are the aggrements are made based on the use of automobiles .
they said automobils are using of the automobiles are reduce to improve the environment conditions .
