The issue states that there would be fewer cars than there are todayin twenty years .
I do not agre with this statement , moreover I feel that the use of cars would be doubled in twenty years than they are today .

Fifteen years ago computers have been rarely found with the software industies and only with the managers of various institutions and industries .
But now each and every software proffesional , many students shopkeepers of various stores use it .
In a similar way the usage of cars also rise since the cars with less costs are also available in the market a person with an average annual income can afford to buy a car for the services rendered by it .
A car is used as a luxurious commodity for the modern man .
Also it can carry many peoplefrom one place to another unlike a motor cycle .
Cars have been developed to run not only with fuels such as petrol , diesel which pollute the environment heavily but also with the gaseous fuels which are environmental friendly .
Cars using gaseous fuels are also economical .

Cars have also the advantage of safety carrying of diseased persons compared to motor cycles .
Cars have also been designed for a single seater which is more economical .
Cars using solar radiation as a fuel is under research .
Such cars would benefit us more .
They give us more comfort to sit and even facilities of air conditioning are possible in it .
Everybody is now used to such luxurious comforts .
So people work hard to make themselves more comfortable and make his travelling easyby adopting a driver to the car where as this facility is not available with other vehicles .
Though buses have this facility , they may not be readily available in need of time .
so in order to save most of them prefer cars .
People have the idea of deciding what is right or what not .
they know how well a car would benefit them .
Many of them instead of preferring a motor cycle wait for some more timeand then have a car .
So I feel that cars use would be doubled in twenty years and not reduced .
