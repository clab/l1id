The above statement that is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' it is not right .
I disagree with this statement .

Many of the old people enjoy with thier life than youngers .
In the oldage the people have leave all the burdens and they are spending their own interested work .
infact younger have more responsibilities and work in that age , sometimes they ca n't enjoy because they dont want to loose their official work .

Forexample , long toor we want to go , in that time spending fifteen days of time for that , that is not sufficiant for all the youngers .
some of them are missing for thier own impertent things But old people are spending maximum time to that toor .
Not only toors but also in daily things .

Moreover , Old people enjoy with childrens and playing with them .
they can act like a child like playing criket , chess etc. they can enjoy thier own way .
old people work in their young age and then taking the rest in this old age with their interesting activities and abilities .

I conclude that , older people also enjoy .
enjoyable things and ways are different but they can also enjoy .
not young people enjoy life more than older people .
Young people and old people can enjoy themselves in thier own ways , styles and adjustments .
