I strongly opine with the statement that it is best to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
If you visit a new place , it is always better to consult a guide since we will be ignorant about the historical information .

There are lots of benefits when you have a travel guide around .
The guides will have vast amount of information regarding the place .
For example , they could give you historical significance of the place or any other important reasons for the fame of a particular place .
It would be of no point in visiting places when you are completely unaware of its significance .

And also , the guides will have vast knowledge about the places around so that we will not miss any of them and repent later .
It is also convinient to interact with people when guides are around .
There could be huge linguistic difference and also cultural difference .
Also , there are all possibilities of getting cheated by people when you are a foreigner .
Usuaully , the guides are multilingual and hence there are no chances of getting cheated .

In India , a south asian country , there are many historical places famous for its magnificient architecture .
There are stories depicting their significane .
It would be of no point if we look at the work without any knowledge about it .
It would merely be a piece of work .
But instead if we know the story behind its significance , we will be in a position to appreciate the work .

I could give a good example to support this point .
One of my friends had been to a historical place in India .
When she returned , she told me her experiences and the work she saw .
She did not feel anything special about it .
I then , explained the significance of the place .
It was then she really appreciated it and felt that she should have known it then .
She then appreciated the culture and did further research on the topic and the culture .

Hence , i feel that it is always better to have sufficient knowledge while visiting any place .
