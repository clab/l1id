advertisements play a very vital role in sales of various products .
they not only enhance the sales but also bring awareness among public about the product .
but i agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
there are some advantages as well as some disadvantages .

it is sometimes good to advertise the products more than they really are .
but not all products can be done like that .
because if people become aware of it then there might be chances of decline in the sales of the product .
advertisement does good to the product because most of the people rely on the advertisements .
if it is attractive then they show interest to buy .
because many people who dont have access to these advertisements dont know much about the product and therefore they dont show interest to buy them .

but due to heavy competition nowadays they are promoting the products much better than they are .
but this is not healthy always .
many try to show their product as the best product .
once i was fooled by seeing a mobile phone advertisement online and only after purchasing the product and recieving it i came to know that it was not at all attrative as it was shown in the promo .
i nver got my money back as they couldnt take it back .
from that time onwards i started being careful about thae advertisements .
i make sure that i see the product before purchasing it .
some of the companies that give the advertisements are not reliable .

therefore i conclude that some advertisements make products look much better than they are .
we must be very careful about the products and it is always better to have a look before purchasinginstead of just relying on the advertisements .
