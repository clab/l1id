I partly agree with the statement that `` It is more important for students to under stand ideas and concepts than to learn facts . ''

Because students offen read textbooks of certain school or collage and in those books we only read the lessons and come to an idea and learn what the concept is , rather than knowing the facts .

and coming to a chemical lab in our collages we require facts rather than ideas .

For example go for a lesson in an english text there we find n number of stories and by reading those we come to idea of what happened in the story ratheer than knowing the facts .
And coming to the lab we know about the fact that which reaction will come by combining two acids or bases .
Here we requirefact rather than idea .

So understanding ideas , concept and facts are helpfull to the students according to the subjects they are reading .
so at perticular time ideas and concepts play a major role where as facts on the other time .

So , By these resons and examples i partly agree with the statment that It is more important for students to under stand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
