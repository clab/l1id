I dis agree that there will be fewer cars used in the next twenty years .
Even though the present fuel for car will not available in the coming future as it is now , but there will not be decrease in using the cars .
scientists are working to find out the alternate fuel for automobiles than the fuel that we are prestently using in cars .

some cars have also came into the market which will run through soalr system i.e using sun light as the main source of energy to the car .
Research is going on over bio-fuel .
scientists saying that this fuel will be much more cheap tha the fuel we are using now in the cars since thus fuel is coming from the trees .

There are some areas in India where the farmers are growing this tree ( i.e bio-fuel trees ) .
Designers are playing an important role in car industry .
Every day Automobile designers are coming with frequent changes in the car design in order to attract the customers .
They are making sure that a car contain all laxurious items in it .
like AC , Digital music system , capcatiy of the engine , speed , flexible bumpers , horse power , brake horase power , modifiaction in steering , convient seating ect .
even the designers are changing the body of the cars and also using modern shiny colours to it which are actually harmful to the environment .

The car companies are using media a lot in order to attract the customers .
They are using eminent personalities like heros , players ect as a brand ambassdor of their company .
Many Banks are even offering loans at least finance so that every one can have a car in the future .
