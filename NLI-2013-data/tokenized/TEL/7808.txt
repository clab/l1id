I would like to agree with the statement that ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' .
The reason for my agreement with the topic is there are plenty of advantages when there is a guide when we travel in a group .

The major problems which we face when we are moving in a group is that defenitely the group includes people of different behaviours , the time punctualities and there will be no coherence between the people , If we are led by a guide defenitely everyone in the group listens to him and follows him as he is leading them .
Another advantage is that the guide will be familiar with the places we visit and so we need not waste our time on finding the ways to that place and we do n't miss the places which are of greater importance .
Some people may think that hiring a guide will increase the cost of their trip , i think it is not true infact we will save alot of money we can ask the guide to take to the motels which we can afford and there would n't be a chance to e defrauded since peple tries to cheat the tourists who are not native to that place likewise we can even save our valuable money and can use for another purpose ..
Guides also shows the important places of that area as we may not be familiar with them .
For instance , when we planned a trip to canada on last summer we are familiar with the places over there we got only one week to visit all the places and we got plans to victoria and vancouver , as we know thay are located nearby but some of my friends does n't liked to lead our group by a guide they think that they will loose privacy but they did n't realized that we are lack of time and they decided to go seperately and we do n't want waste our time as the semester begins after the weekend , decide to hire a guide and we successfully completed our trip within time visiting all the tourist places over there , unfortunately our friends who went to the trip without a guide failed to return back intime , afterwards they appreciated our opinion .
Hence i would rather suggest a group to be led by a guide on visting an unfamiliar place , which would save money , time and provides us with the facility to enjoy the trip with more ecstacy .
