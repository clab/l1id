I wo n't agree with the statement given that `` It is better to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ''

Specialization in one particular subject will keep a person with whole knowledge of the subject and he will be able clear any number of doubts on that particular subject .
He will eventually become professionalised in that particular subject .
There is also a proverb that `` Practice makes man perfect '' .

If a person is specialised and got propfessionalised in his own subject then eventually he will be recognised in the society for his knowledge and efficient work in that subject .

As he got the recognition about the knowledge and efficient work he got in a particular subject he will be able to get more chances from many companies or from researching centers to develop his carrer .
And the door of success will get opened wider for his career to develop further .

When comes to the person having knowledge with many academic subjects , he will have less accuracy about the subjects he really familiar with .
The one truth every one knows that `` Rolling stone gathers no mass '' will describe how foolish to think to be get familiarised of many subjects at a time .
In this way he will be partially professional in all the subjects he known and looses many important gains in life .

From all the inferences given above one could say that specialization in one particular subject will be better when compared with the knowledge of many academic subjects .
