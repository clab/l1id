As iam an young people i will not agree the statement `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' Mostly young people have many respondsbilities in these young ages like education , part time jobs and looking there family works even thouh young people are helping there communities in many ways directly and indirectly .

Mainly the young people help the commnity or there nation by joining the defence services for there country .
the young people were the first persons to oranganse any functions or meeting in there colonys or societies and these people only maintain all the orangements and success to activity .

When people or country were facing problems with natural cliamatics like earth quake , heavy rainfalls , or destroes mainly only the young people come first to collect the funds and gives morals support to the people and govering bobies of nation .

when an univerisies or collages celebrataing any event like collage day or any activity the success beyond that was none other then these people The young people were good in helping the people in remote areas by giving knowledge for them in education and promoting goverment projects and programs in development process .
people now a days were aslo partisprating in many events which were relating to social and economics factors , mainly in social activities like helping the poor and old people in homeges and giving lot of support to these people who were in need .

espeaicaly the young scientics and software enggineers were becoming backbone to the nation economy and development of nation .
In many communitical actives like marothons and sports events only the young people were getting all the pretiege to nation and communities .
not only these many events like protecting commnity from cleaness and emplyment all thing were going to be done by the young people .

So my support to young is always good and its good to nation .
