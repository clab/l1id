I completely agree with the statement - '' Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
The reasons for my view are lack of ethics , lack of seriousness and lack of time .
My reasons will be explained in the following paragraphs .

Firstly , the young people lack ethics .
What i mean to say is that the youth no longer respets the concepts like helping nature , modesty and empathy .
The youth has become selfish i.e. , young people always think about themselves and no longer cares for the people who are in need of help .
Many friends of mine keep going for movies and parties , very frequently .
Their expenditure comes to around 1000 rupees a month , only for enjoyment .

What i would like to say is that these people can help the community with money or by devoting some time but they dont .
The reason for this might be lack of responsibility towards community or may be they were not tought about these things .

Secondly , many of the young ones are in the mind set - what does i get by helping the community ??
My neighbour who is quite young and rich ( earning a slary of 40000 Rupees per month has never donated a single penny .
Rather he spends the money on pubs , buying a new car , etc .

Thirdly , few youngsters think that since they had gone through a tough time in their life , they try saving everything - not spending either for the community nor for themselves .

Also , few of them dont get the time of their busy shedule in order to spare some time for the community .
Lastly , many of the young people dont really understand the problems of the community i.e. , they lack empathy .

I would like to conclude by saying that there are young people who help the community but are very few .
In order to improve the situation , the young people have to be tought about the need to help the community so that every one is happy and also the contry prospers .
