I strongly disagree with the statement made and believe that the number of cars would certainly increase in the coming twenty years .
The reasons and examples for my stand are included herewith .

Firstly , let me consider the ten year back scenario , when having or possessing a car was considered to be a big asset and people used to consider it as a property which distinguishes the people owning cars and the ones who do not .
To exemplify , I bring into picture my own experience , five years back , when i was going to the school , i used to feel that some of my friend 's parents who had cars were on a higher economic scale than our family .
But two years back my father who is a scientist bought a luxury car , even though he was not given any promotions in his job .
The answer that my father gave when i asked him regarding this was simply a straight one .
My father told me that the rates of the cars had come down rapidly and everyone of our caliber can afford a car .
I was amused to hear this , because of the fact that just in three years , the whole scenario has changed .
Not only my father but a lot of people started buying the luxury cars because of their availability and reduction in cost .

The advances in technology that are being made support my point .
The latest technical advances that we have today in automobile industry has drastically reduced the costs of the cars and even made them more attractive .
The growth of competition between the leading car manufacturers like toyota , maruti , suzuki etc. also solidifies my point .

Statistics show that , in some of the cities in India , for example Hyderabad , Chennai and Delhi , the sales of latest cars have increased by 25 % from the year 2004 to 2006 .
The percentage increase in the number of cars all over the country ( India ) was about 15 % from the year 2002 to 2005 ( The statistics are from the best of my knowledge ) .

The only problem that comes into our minds is the availability of power , which comes in form of Diesel or Petrol .
Because of the unavailability of oil , the costs of petrol and diesel have gone up drastically during the past few years in India and this might even hinder the people from buying automobiles but many Research and Development divisions of automobile industry all over the world are concentrating on this issue and they are trying to find alternative means in order to make the cars run , like the use of CNG cylinders , which has been now commertialised in New Delhi and slowly is shifting towards the southern part of the country .
Researches are also trying to find means by which cars can run on water , a recent team of 12 students from IIT-Delhi and DCE located in Delhi have come up with an idea where a car runs at 30kmph using water .

People use cars basically for a faster mean of transportation and also to assure themselves of a comfortable journey .
Most of the teenagers are also nowadays starting to learn how to ride a car , so that they can participate in driving whenever parents feel tired and this even helps them in developing new skills .

Hence with the advent of technological advancements it can be said that the number of cars would continue to increase and provide people with a cheaper , faster , comfortable and an easier way of transportation .
