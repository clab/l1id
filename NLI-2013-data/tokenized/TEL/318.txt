In the above paragraph author states that succesful people are take more riscs rather than only doing what they allready know things are how to do well .
How ever the successful people are innovate new things to develope the country more effectively , because they knows everything on perticular work in that time they need to spend some time for the main drawbacks of a work and how they avoid it , for thaat they are need to think effectively and take more risks to implement the new things .

For example we take an eroplanes , an eroplanes are invented by wright brothors they very common people in the world , because they implemented an eroplanes by using a birds .
one day they think that how the birds are flying in the air .
In that time they got one idea , yhe birds are having wings .
so it was flis in the air .
The wright brothers are differently and takes more risks to implement an eroplane .

Therefore what i am telling that the people who are thinking diferently from what they already known .
If they are thinking similarly about the work .
They do n't get any new ideas and they are not succeeded in that perticular work .

I conclude that the succeeded people who allready knows the work how to do well in that time also they having a chance to implement the new thigs , but they are not thinking in a broader way .
the sucesfu l people are allways trying to implement new things , because they allready knows how to do the work .
To implement new things it takes more time and enthusiausm to learn the work then only they are didicated to implement the new things .
