im the opinion that , the sucessful people try new things by taking the risks because theyare already succeesful persons and they know how to keep there reputation as it is .
they know to over come the bad situation when they are doing wrong .

however the given statement hold good for some contentions , for example , if a successful people trying any thing means they are so much familiar regarding that thing because without knowing that thing they will not take the risk and they will go in that way only what they know better is .
the successful people will go in right direction or whether they go in wrong dirction also they make that thing success because they are very much sharp and inttelligent .
the successful persons must take such risks because they have find the new things which are helpful for further .
it is waste when they go in way that what they already known .

in further analysis the statement is drawing an in appropriate and indefinsible in some cases for example , if successful person is trying a new thing if it will not work meanshis reputation and fame all will lost for making a small mistake .
the successful people should not take the risks because they have to lost so much when they are not success in that event .
they also loss so much fame when they will not success in that event and all the people will say that he is not a successful person .
he will suffer for simple reason that the person who is trying the new thing that he already know how to do well in that thing .

atlast my opinion regarding the successful people is they should take the risks because they are the people who can raise their aims by taking the risks .
the successful people should not think about the personal fame because they are very much useful when they got new thing by taking the risk .
the successful people should try daily new new things because they are used for further that it is easier than the previous one. `` successful people should try new things by taking risks '' .
