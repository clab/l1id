`` Give me ten young Indians and I 'll change the world '' - Swami Vivekananda

I strongly believe that young people are the backbone of any community and I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
The first participation will always come from the youth be it any type of community work in all the extreme situations .
I feel that youth play a major role in shaping of the community and its upliftment on the whole .

I would like to present a glaring example for the same .
Recently our country witnessed the worst tragedy - Tsunami which engulfed innumerable lives .
The sea ravaged the entire coastal strip and people lost their life , families , food and shelter for none of their mistakes .
I would like to highlight the participation of youth in rehabilitation works in the effected regions .
India overcame such a crisis with in no time due to the young people who spent sleepless nights for the rehabilitation work .
Young people from all the software companies , NGOs and student organisations thronged the entire area for rescue operations .
I was also part of my college troop BITS - TSUMANI who participated in the relief measures .
Not only this be it any crisis , first hand help is always given by the young people .

In addition to the crisis management , young people also play a role in moulding their community .
Just to state a few , they take part in maintaining the cleanliness of the society , security considerations , creating public awareness , health camps and the list is never ending .
Some active youth organisations like NSS , indulge in the rural development .
They spread awareness in the rural areas and they serve a means for serving the poor and the needy .

At last but not the least I cannot forget the young men in the armed forces safeguardign our nation risking their own lives .
My salutations to them always .
In the broader sense their might be raising modernisation but the involvement of youth in helping the community cannot be under rated .
