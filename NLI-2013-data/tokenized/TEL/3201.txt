Young people nowadays indeed do not give enough time helping their communities .
There are various reasons for this .
Most young people nowadays are engrossed in making a successful career and settling down during their youth .
Most youngsters do n't really care what happens around them because they are too self-centered .
Also , the economic conditions of their life too influence whether young people work for their communities or not .

Today 's world demonstrates the Darwinian principle , `` the fittest survive '' on a day-to-day basis , though not across species , but within the human species .
In the extreme race to achieve high goals that they set for themselves , youngsters hardly give any thought to the community around them .
Most of their time is dedicated to the achievement of their goals and themselves , and not much is left for community service .
The fact that it is rare to find anyone volunteering for community service ( rather than being punished with it ) shows how less youngsters nowadays care for community service .

Another reason why youngsters nowadays do n't give much time for community service is the profound change in mindset of youngsters .
They are more materialistic than ever .
Few youngsters know the pleasure , satisfaction and elation of dedicating oneself for the service of others , nowadays .
More addicted to the material pleasures of the world , they spare no thought of community service .

This change in mindset has not been sudden , perhaps .
Over the years and generations , parents impress the importance of community service less on their children , they themselves being materialistic .
Thus , gradually , children might have no notion of community service whatsoever .

The economic conditions in which the stidents are brought up also influences the perspective they develop about community service .
If a student is from a poor family , in which most of his time is consumed in his fight for survival , it is less probable that he might be interested in serving the community .
But this argument can be confronted with the fact that he might know the pains of being poor , and hence help the poor in the future .
Nevertheless , economic conditions do play a role in students perception of community service .

Thus in essence , pressure from all aspects of life keep today 's youth from giving enough time helping their communities .
Further , other issues like the change in mindset of people of all age groups , selfishness , and economic conditions are a major cause .
