Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I do support the following satement .
young people enjoy their life in different patterns than the older people do .
the old age people mostly prefer to spend their time by taking the rest instead of enjoying their life , The old peopleprefer to take rest is mainly because of their health problems , they mostly prefer to concertrate on keeping their health in a balanced state instead of enjoying .

Their daily schedule is widely different fro the young people , their daily life is more common compare to children and the young age people .
the old age people are unable to play games as do like the young people .
the old age people mainly wants to stay home and do the gardening , their life does not resemble most to the young age people .

most of the young people enjoy their life in different fashions , by wearing different kinds of clothes , by visting theatres and chit chatting with the friends .
The young people enjoyment is highly unique compare to the enjoyment of old age people .

The old people have less compliance than young people eg : old people showing least preference to visit outside viewing , going to the dance parties , doing different innovative things .
Today the life is more modernized than few centuries ago , more enjoyment in the life is widely seen in the young people than old age people .

As per my personal beleif is that , theyoung people enjoy their life more than old people do .
once again i strongly do support this statement by agreeing .
