I disagree with the statement saying , `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''
I believe in the other way around stating , `` It 's better to specialize in one specific subject rather than go for many academic subjects . ''
I am going to provide some of my personal experiences with specific examples in the passage .

Personally , I feel I have been off track since my schooling as I needed to go for many academic subjects .
I used to have knowledge on various academic topics every year .
Once I got into higher studies , some of my subjects were of no use and I was made to stress only on certain subjects .
From then on I never practically or theoritically implemented those subjects which I left off long way back .
If I were to be specialized in any one subject I would have been a more knowledgeable person than I am today .

Secondly , having specialization in any one specific subject can build a person in a right way .
The person could be able to make a research in the subject he learnt right from his childhood .
It makes him more motivated and results in an obvious expansion of the subject whereas in having knowledge in many academic subjects could really limit a person 's true potential and ability because there will be a time factor in this case and the person may not be able to make up the time for research purposes .

Finally , another advantage of specializing in one specific subject can make less burden on the children who are made to carry bundle of books daily to schools and colleges .
Studying only one subject can make this work a bit easier .
More over the students can spend their time equally in theory as well as practical classes which is more important for a human brain to work efficiently .
There must be more practical knowledge of the learnt subject rather than only book knowledge .
The student must be able to apply what ever he learnt in his/her practical life .

I would like to conclude by stressing my point that it is advisable to have knowledge in a specific subject rather than opting for many academic subjects .
More over by specializing in any one subject of student 's interest or choice , it helps development of research in vast educational field .
There is more scope for individual development here .
