Life is unique and is all what we have .
There are different kinds of people experiencing different stages of life .
Obviously the two major kinds of people are the younger and the older .
What everyone wish to do is to enjoy their life and i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life when compared to the old .

First , younger people have very less responsibilties in their life when you compare to that of a older guy .
A old man usually keep thinking about his family and his responsibilities .
He got to sacrifice many of his pleasures for the sake of his duties .
On the other hand most of the young guys main aim would be to enjoy the life whether its college or job as they got someone who cares for them .

Second , not all things are possible for a older guy as he doesnot have the energy or capability .
Energy is innate in an younger one .
Considering an example in which both the younger and older goes on an expedition probably a mountain .
The later could not do it alone as he does not have the potence in him .
Although he might have a good knowledge about the place , he is not physically suitable .

Finally there scope of enjoyment for the older is narrowed .
The narrowing is due to society and physical capability .
Normally a oldman cannot go around adventorous trips or play different kind of games especially outdoors .
Society brings a lot of change in the older people especiallty their thoughts , their character and their behaviour .
For example , he cannot flirt around with a girl as he had a wife , he cannot go on a risky job as he got many people dependent on him .
Coming to the younger people the scope is as broad as their imagination .
They can enjoy thier life in the way they wish to .

I hereby conclude confidently that young people do enjoy life mre than the older people do .
