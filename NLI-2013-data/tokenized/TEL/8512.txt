yes i agree with above conversation that student have concept than learn facts .
Its important that student know about any topic the concept is importants than learn facts .
At first i want to distinguish between to two facts .
If the student has concept he can have that knowledge or subject related to this knowledge lifelong .
If the student had learned any fact it will not stored in his memory and he cannot remember it so long time .
If student had concept he can explain the related concept anywhere at anytime .
the ideas and concept generated by the student will be remembered as much as long time than the learned fact .
If student builts a concept on related matter on his own ideas it will be very useful for him future .
student builted topic is related to his job then it will play a major role of life and he can settled in his life and knowledge about related topic will be improve his efficiency in his job also .
Due to this the student can well score or remember about that topic .

But where as in learned facts the student can remember much time about the topic .
The student who based on the leaned fact has book knowledge or theory knowledge .
Theory knowledge will not will stored in the memory for so much time .
Here i want to say my opinion , that is practical knowledge is much more better than theory knowledge .
By learning the topic it cant remembered so much time and it is very useful only for those students in exam point of view .
The practical knowledge is well remembered and it can explained to his junior students also where as theory knowledge cannot remembered by the persom after the exam is completed .

For example let us take mathmatics subject .
In this subject the whole matter is based on problems only .
Here only some formulas can remembered by the person or student .
the problem should be solved on basis of that formula related one .
If the student will learned the problem it cannot remember by that him so long time .
If he built the ideas on the problem he can remember the problem for long time .
Here in this subject it is improved that practical knowledge or concept of students are well efficiect than theory or learned knowledge .

In my opinion concept is better than the theory or learned knowledge .
