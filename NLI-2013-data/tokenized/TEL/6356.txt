This is a very diplomatic statment to say that the usage of the cars would be decresec in the future .
As the generation changes took place , the comfort and the benifits also has been incresed in the mordern society , So i would strongly condemn that the saying of number of cars would be decresed in the course of next twenty years .

There might be many adverse environmental consequeses due to vechuliar emisson of harmful gases and finding short of the resoureses of the petrolium products , but all these would not stop the usage of cars in the mere furture .
Since , as the technology improves soures also will improve , and the next generation cars would be battery operated or bio cars .
This would be best substitute of the cars which are running today .

The other main purpose for which , the number of cars would be incresing that , the population on the earth is incresing day by day , it would be very much difficult for the mass transporation to transport as many as people who are there , therefore many people would be having an eye towards the cars which would lean them towards it .
In this fast growing society , cars do play a major significant role , as they do be very helpful for quicker transpotaion , because time once lost cannot be regained , and for the world twenty years from now , time would play a very prominent role .

Their are many experiments going on now to make the very best battery operated and bio gas cars , which would would become a major resource for growing up the usage of cars in the future .
By using this type of cars their many advantages like as we disscused the faster mode of transportation , which not only improves ones only status but improves the whole economic development of the country .
Because to compete with the development of the countries the citizens should be using their time to the fullest .
and the other one is pollution free environment , which is very much important now due to gobal warming coming as a major consequence in the nature .

In addition its really very hard to any citizen to wait for government mass transoptation , who is in an emergency , or planning to go for picnic with his family members or so and would be perfering to have his own car than rely on any others .

The only thought which brings us to the conclusion that in the next twenty years the number of cars would be decresed is the problems of pollution , traffic conjuctions , or scracity of petrolium products , but their are many alternatives which have been taken as substitur to these problems .
and usage of the mordern improvisation in this aspect would capture the imagination of the nation for the alternative use .
and these have been proved through analysis of the last 2-3 years in most of the the parts on the world .

So , i would finally would say that the number of car usage would not decrease in the future but , the way in which usage would be changed , which would be very freindly scenario .
