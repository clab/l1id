Young people enjoy a life more than the older people do .
I dont completely agree with this statement .
But to some extent it is true .
Young people have a lot of energy and their brains would be very active seeking for adventures in thier lifes .
This would help them plan there life and lead in an interesting way .
They mostly hang-out with there friends , play a lot of sports , chat throughout the day in the college .
They can even actively participate in various cultural activites held in there college .
Having a lot of capability and strength to learn new things they usually update themselves as per the growing technology .
For examples using the computers , dancing listening to music and many such activities .
People in the old age cannot handle them properly and cannot easily mingle with them .

Young people can easily learn things or grasp things things than the older one 's do .
This would help them get used to new cultures and adopt new ways of styles and traditions and even the food habits of various areas .
All this would be a problem for the older people because anything new in style may deviate from their tradition like the change in clothing that younger generations adopt as per the fashions , it may be even the food that cause indigestion problem or someother illness .

The drawback that the younger generation mainly have is the stress , due to the work load imposed on them .
This burden may even lead to boredom or may even lead to a state of depression which would be very difficult for them to handle and even come out .
All this is due to the lack of experience they have .
It is at these situations that younger people come to the older people to seek their advice in handling or dealing such situations .
It is the experience of the older people , which helps them to come out of these difficult situations many times and get into their routine life .

The only thing appreciable about the older people is that they enjoy their lives at these stages by playing with their grand-children would would give a lot of pleasure and happiness for them regularly .

Illustratung all these events I would like to state
