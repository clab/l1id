As far as i consider , in now a days young people have no enough time to help others or to their communities .
how ever there is no time to eat food also .
in that condition how they help others .

In the developing country like india young people have so many responsibilities .
so they are bussy with their responsibilities .
avery person has his self duty .
For instance , a college students are bussy with there daily appointments , that means daily work with their books .
In adittion to that a B.E student has no time to take his tiffen also .
he is bussy with his collage work , he is having alot of work i.e.lab work , record work like that so many affairs are there to him .

And next coming to the point of young people , those are going to their duties , having full of work tension in there officies , so they cannot also help others .a very person in this world is full of work .
in order that bussy they have no time to help their communities .

some people have intension to help others , those are called samaja seva , with this they can help others , but they are affraid of others .
others means they are roudies .
the people who wanted to help others has to face some problems .
that why young people cannot show attention to help others .

More over , helping others is a good habit .
if we `` Helping one person that leads to help other two persons '' .this was said by south indin mega star in his film .
That film story is full of same concept .
i think at this movement south indian people are started to do helping others .

In the world like india , peoples are sentimental .
they can help us to each other .
but they are fully engaged with their work and responsibilities that 's why the young people is not showing interest on helping others .

Finally i conclude that , in present days young people really have no enough time to helping communities .
