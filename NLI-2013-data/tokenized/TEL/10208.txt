Yes i agree to this statement .
Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what already know how to do well .
By trying new things and doing it by own we can develop self - confindence upon us and by doing such things we can remember well what we had done and we cannot forget it .
It brings more self-confidence , ability , attitude towards the subject .
For an example i can say about great scientists like NEWTON , EINSTEIN etc .
Firstly NEWTON nor we doest know about gravitational force which was happening around us then he was the person who thinked about falling of the apple and what made it fall .
By doing vigorous research on that concept he came to know that there is a force which is pulling the objects downwards that was known as GRAVITATIONAL FORCE .

People from then came to know about the gravitational force and had done many experiments on that .
That states that successful people try new things and take risks in which they feel very satisfied .
For another example we can talk about children , they doest'nt know anything and they doest'nt leave anything in my view .
So they doest'nt know whether it is going to harm them or make them feel happy .
They do the things they never let it go and if they feel happy they will enjoy .
By doing the things what they already know will have no enthusiasm , anxiety , intrest , on the subject .
As we already know about the subject we doest'nt take much care on it nor concentration .
That 's why i can say that there 's great satisfaction by tring new things and if we achieve them .
If we cannot achive them we should not feel discouraged by ourselfes and come to know about it and copmlete it successfully .
In my view not only successful people everyone should try for the new invention and try for it till they achieve , if we take risks only then we can come out of flying colors in our life .
