I disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I disagree this because half knowledge is always harmful .

The primary reason why I prefer specialization in one specific subject is specialization gives you indepth study of the subject which could be very useful in the real time applications .
For example a computer engineer cannot be an efficient cardiologist .
This may effect the heart patient .

Another reason for specializing in one subjet is you can discover new things after going across insight information of the subject .
Most of the discoveries have been made by the scientists only after specializing in one subject .
That is after conducting repeated experiments on one thing .

Thirdly , specialization improves creativity in a person .
In every field specialization is the essential component .
However it is better to have some knowledge of many academic subjects and that is why when you come from graduation to post graduation then to phd , you are supposed to take specialized subjects .
Therefore based on the specialization students are classified as computer engineers , electronic engineer , doctors and so on .

In conclusion , I strongly recommend that specialization in one subject is better than having broad knowledge on many academic subjects .
