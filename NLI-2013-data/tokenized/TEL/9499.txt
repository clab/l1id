As the present world is a marketing world the employers will be recruiting the talenteds but not the learners .
This means that it is better to understand concepts than learning them .
My dad always says that `` understand the concepts but never try to learn them as it will be useful if I were not selected in campus placements and decide to start a firm to make money . ''

I thought what he said is right but after looking at the placements in my college I thought they will only select the learners .
The companies who are coming to recriut the final years , they give first preference to the the ones who got 9/10 but not to the one who got 7/10 and having all A grades in his branch subjects .
But after meeting them after two years the ones who got 9/10 and not having any knowlege about the concepts are in the same position and some gave up there job for doing there masters and the one who got less gpa but understood all the concepts are in a high post .
I experienced the same in my twealth .
I leant the concepts and ideas in physics and scored distinction .
But when I am doing engineering first year I faced lot of problems to clear the subject .

Then after I realised its better to understand the ideas and concepts than learning them and never failed in doing so and made my core subjects easier .
