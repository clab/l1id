Young people have the energy and passion to do anything what they want .
they are provided with lot of useful technology now a days which is used in accomplishing their goals and desires .

Young people have the extra edge to travel the extra mile .
I would love to give the best example regarding this aspect .
The two young computer geniuses Sergey Brin and Larry Page who have found `` Google '' which revolutionised the information super highway called the internet .
It is Google that has become synonymous for the world .
It is web based search tool for every individual around the worls to gather the required information .
It is a best example showing how they transformed their college project to a world recognising internet tool which is highly in demand .

These people have revelled in their success and boast of a unique lifestyle unlike the old corporates of the American Business fraternity .
It is the best example I stated because Iam working on the same domain they have invented .
Iam proud to be working on their domain as an young accomplishing dreamer to reach my goals .
Now they are enjoying their lives with true pleasure and satisfaction as they acheived their goals and working on future developments .
