I agree that Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Success usually comes to people who wok with determination and dedication to achieve their goals .
They work in all directions to achieve their goal .
For example , a fashion designer would earn more fame for her or his innovative ideas rather than retaining the old ideas .
They need to try newer things in order to pace up with the every day fashion , or they are termed as out dated .
In Buisness too , a person reaches a pinnacle only when he uses newer techniques to promote his project .
He needs to take risks to develop or expand his buisness empire rather than sticking to old ideas in this 21st century .
A computer software engineer should try something innovative and interesting depending on his capability to achieve heights in his career rather than just doing a job .

On the other hand it is always not necessary that a person who tries newer things are succeessfull .
For example , a Doctor should not try newer things or take risk on patients life , they should rather do what they already have been practising .
practise makes a man perfect .
A highly experienced doctor is more succeessful than a less experienced doctor .
He can heal a patient or cure him with his experience which teaches him as how to deal with the his illness , what appropriate antibiotics or what apt surgery should be performed .

So succeess conquer people who try new innovative ideas , work with dedication and determination ..
