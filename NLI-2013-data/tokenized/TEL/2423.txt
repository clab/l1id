Life is perceived differently by different kinds of people .
Similarly young people enjoy life more than elders do can be stated only by viewing perspecrtives of life partially .
What i mean to say is that i do not agree with the fact that young people enjoy more than the elders do completely .

In my opinion youth can be viewed as stage of physical stength and vigour and also as a stage of stress and responsibility .
In youth every day is a challenge and one cannot afford to while away the time they have .
Therefore it becomes more stressful for young people .
One has to attend their studies , fund their studies and at the same time earn for a living , compete with their fellow classmates for the first position .
Then comes a stage of choosing-choose a career that shall decide everything and choose a life partner with whom one has to spend the rest of their life .
Once satisfied about the stage of settlement , then comes the stage of feeling responsible for one 's children , their education , desires and their settlement .

Inspite of all these difficulties youth is an age of pleasure , vigour , adventures , friendship and love .
It is a blessed state , usually with constant good health that gives an oppurtunity to experiment and make the most of life .
I feel unfortunate are those who do not realise the importance of youth and neglect the age under the pressure of responsibility .

Old age to me in a stage of peace where one has to enoy the fruit of all the hardwork one has done during their lifetime .
Since elder people are often subjected to brunt of illhealth and illness they have to enjoy life to the maximum in the destined duration of old age that they have .

Therefore , I opine that one has to perceive life beautifull , all stages have their own importance and each stage should be enjoyed with an optimistic attitude .
Only then can one realise the importance of ouer birth .
