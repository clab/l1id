i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays donot give enough time to helping their communities.the reasons which i quote for supporting this statement are as follows :

firstly , coming to the family they live in , they dedicate enough time towards their family members and help them in all possible ways .
for example if a boy from a family is asked to take his grandmother to a hospital for a medical checkup , he makes time and takes her .
also he helps the family in getting the necessary household items , paying of bills like current , water , house tax etc . ,

secondly , coming to the friends community the young people make time in enjoying with the friends , help them in preparing for the exams , also clarify the doubts if any amomg themselves .
they can develop good communication skills and team work by dedicating time for their friends and helping them .

suppose a youth is enrolled in the blood donation community he registers his blood group along with all his detalis .
if anyone is in dire need of a very rare group of blood , and if that person asks him for his blood he shall definitely donate his blood .

not only are these the examples , there can be many examples which we find recently .
for example coming to the orkut online access community , i am a memeber of it .
i also became a member of many subcommunities like toefl ibt , ms spring 2007 , visa online .
i fine the members of those communities answering actively to my queries like what are the rules of toefl ibt , how is this different from cbt , how should i apply to universities , which are the best , which is the best time for attending a visaic interview , etc. many youth helped me in finding a solution to many problems i faced .

youth nowadays behave more responsibly .
donate money to age old homes , destitute , blinds etc. , they help these communities one wat or the other by voluntarily servicing them .
many take great people like mother therasa , gandhili as their role models and try to identify these great people in themselves

in summary , i say that there will be youth nowadays who doesnt give enough time to help their communities .
this may be because they might be unable to find the time for their communites or may be they might be busy with some important schedules , which they have to definitely attend to .
also helping communities may involve money which many cant afford .
otherwise , many youth find happiness in helping out their communities and they can cherish these memories for long .
