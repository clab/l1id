Ideas and concepts will play a major role in the development any product or component .
So , I strongly accept that a student has to understand ideas and concepts .
In todays world we have come accrosed many robust and complicated products .
For example , cars , computers and many automated machines .
These products were developed by engineers by understanding proper background information of it and its working principle , to get all these things done we need to understand the concepts and ideas of it .
For example , to design a bike , we have to understand the working principle and what is exactly required in order to make it work in an efficient way .
when we understand the above need we can have an idea to fabricate it .
Today we have many students who are very dull in their studies and they just memorise the answers and reproduce the same in the exam papers .
But they dont understand the concept of the chapter or working of a particular componentand , eventually when they finish there educations they will not have ability to implement the concept to develop a product because they have not understood the concept well .
so , todays science and technology has many complicated concepts were students are finding difficult to learn it .

Sometimes , facts also required to learn from facts .
For example , when a solid object is immersed in water , an equall amount of water is displaced out which is equal to the weight of the solid object whic is a fact that can be seen .
This information is very usefull for marine engineers which is got by a fact .

So , i always understand the concept and ideas in any subject rather then giong by a fact .
I have done this from my childhood and helped me a lot to learn so that I can implement the same to invent more and more products which is favorable to the people .
