t is a fact that young people are the back bones of the nation , they are the one who could strongly contribute to the countries success and eventually in developing the nation in each and every aspect .

Each and every one would dream to be posted in a prestegious job after the education , but there are some people who lend their hands to help the poor and people who are both physically and mentally retarded .
I believe one should be in a position to help others without asking anything in return from them .
to develop this kind of nature the government should release some documentaries which will explain the kindness of helping the othere which will inturn develop the country .

I strongly disagree with the point that young people are not spending enough time to help others , becauses in my graduation i accompanied with several classmates and visited oldage homes to help them as part of a lending hands program conducted by our college , we dint expect any thing in return either from the college in form of certificates or from the old people , i myself had a great time helping them for that couple of days .

My sir always use to teach me one thing , if u help some one dont expect anything in return from them even a thanks , rather ask them to help atleast three people in their life and ask those three people to help three other people individually , this concept i have implemented in my life from that day and asked many others to follow the same .
I am sure it will spread throughtout the society and one day the entire nation follows it in which not only youth will be involved but also the children and elders .
I am so confident because i have tasted its fruits in the early days , some unknown person repeated the same thing to do when i have recieved a help from him .

So , i conclude that anyone who believes that young people doesnt have time to help others are on the wrong assumpsion and i want each and every one to follow the above mentioned concept .
