I agree with the statement of ideas and concepts are important over learn facts .
With proper analysis of the ideas and facts one can learn facts out of them .
Ideas can form the basis to learn new facts about the particular area which you are about to know .
Concepts are much more important for the development of the facts .
In real life facts about the life , its existence are developed by concepts of Science .
Researchers are spending huge amounts of time and money to learn facts about the betterment of the life from the concepts and ideas that they got .

Now-a-days there are somany medicines and vaccines are developed to cure different diseases held with humanbeings .
To develope these drugs concepts and ideas are basis for the chemists and biologists in developing these .

Not only in disease curing , in the investigation of a criminal case , investigators uses the ideas and develope concepts to trace the facts about the case .
Ideas are back bone for the developing new concepts to trace the facts .
So students should develope to improve their knowledge towards understanding the new concepts and explore their ideas .
Ideas and concepts are just like fundamentals of a subject .
If one with fundamentals can learn new facts in the subject using those fundamentals .
Without fundamental knowledge one can not go to the destination .
Ideas and concepts are not visible but the developed facts from them are visible as publications in the articles .

Many science and art publications are publishing the truths developed by researchers developed from concepts and ideas of subject matter only .
These days are globalizing .
World is comming out as a villiage .
In this fast track society students with good concepts and ideas can frame their path beautifully .
Only learning facts can not develope one 's internal subject .
The student with conepts and ideas can go for research and develope new facts about the subject matter and can deliver to the betterment of the society .
