Be it young or old , everyone on this earth enjoy their lives in their own way .
The manner in which they enjoy differs from person to person .
But still , I feel that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Young people have a lot of energy .
They are full of enthusiasm that they love to enjoy their lives as much as possible .
Young people have a lot of fresh ideas that they think of innovative ways to have fun .

For instance , during the Christmas Eve and New Year Celebrations , I saw a lot of young people shopping late nights to buy gifts for Christmas and New Year .
And also they celebrated the festival in a grand manner by singing , dancing , partying and having lots and lots of fun with their friends and relatives .

Older people also enjoy their lives in their own way .
For them enjoyment could be to read a favorite book or to play with their grandchildren or to visit a place of their choice .
They also celebrate their festivals with their friends and relatives .

Whereas , as people tend to grow older , their energy levels deteriorates and are unable to participate in physical activities .
Though they would wish to dance or sing , their physical health might not favor them .
In their old age , they are pre-occupied with other things that they do n't enjoy as the youngsters do .
Old people have their own ways of recreation that differs from those of young people .

I conclude by stating that both young and old people enjoy their lives but young people tend to enjoy more than older people because of their high energy levels and enthusiastic spirits .
