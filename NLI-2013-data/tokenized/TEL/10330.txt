The question put forward by the issue is that , whether the succesful people try new things and take risks than doing the already know one .
The issue is very important becasue success only comes when their is an effort and risk .
I believe that sucessful people do new things rather than doing what they already know .

The first reason of my belief is that , success is the house of the people who take some risk in their life and people be successful when they have accomplished new things in a better way .
For instance , Issac Newton a great scientist the world has ever known did not sit quite after his success in the gravitational theory .
Instead he moved in other field of physics which is newer to him and earned laurels in all the new fields he has taken .

Furthermore , doing the things which are already know is not termed as discovery but it is development .
And discoveries are more appriciated than development .
Trying new things turns us to be versatile genius consedering the success in the field as the next part .

Lastly , I believe by trying or exploring new thing can lead us new discoveries or new thesis .
For example , when Galileo discovered pendulum , he explored to the newer feild of astronomy and discovered telescope and declared the previous thesis layed was false by his new experiments .
This shows that exploring in new thing is greater and more advantageous than labouring on the same know ones .

Ultimately , trying a new thing is more beneficial and appreciated than laying on the already known things .
Iam on the side of trying newer things because newer concepts are always intresting than the known boring ones and the search of newer ways , things or new ideas is always rewarding .
So I agree that sucsessful people try new things and take risk for further success .
