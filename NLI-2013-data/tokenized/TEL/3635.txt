Community is the very basic entity along which many Human civilizations have thrived .
It is the this feature that enabled man to evolve and be distinct from his fellow beings on the eath .
Community is not just living together , a group can be called a community only when they interact and help each other in all aspects .
Considering this as definition of community i disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community .

Firstly what do we consider as a community with respect to young people .
Is it the family , neighbours alone .
This would not be the example of community .
A community would refer to every one a person is direcly or indireclty related to .
In the case of a youngsters the community is vast and more diverse .
Hence it would be obvious that one set of people like family for example might see a lack of participation in its activities from the youngsters .
This is not actually lack of interest rather it is the fact that considering the vast communits with which the youngsters are in contact the amount of time they spend for one particular goup might be less .

Consider any calamaty or emergency , one will never survive such situations without the support from the entire community .
In fact in this case it is the young generation which takes the lead and helps people recover .
Their active participation and zeal to help others is always evident in such cases .

Finally the ` enough time ' which the statement emphasises is not relevant .
It is the need of the hour that is to be fulfilled .
The time taken for that can never be measured .
Helping the need in the way required and as doing it as quickly as possible is the best help and this is what the young people follow .
