I definitely agree with the statement that Young people enjoy their life much more than that the older people do .
But there are few people who can enjoy happily at their older age also .
The main factors why youg people enjoy a lot was , their mind may not be much matured , their will be very less problems to face when we are in the childhood stage , and also they were attracted by many things .

Firstly when young people enter to their school or collage they feel very happy they make a lot of friends and they would spend a lot of time by chatting to them differant things such as Foot ball match which take place in few days back , and they also spend lot of time in the play grounds are at cinema theaters , and many other places they tried to enjoy a lot because their would be not much problems sorrounding them , their is no need earn money either their is no need to do a job , and even though a student is going for a part time job he like to enjoy the weekands a lot .

Secondly when people are young they attracted to several things such as riding a car , going to new films , attracted to a new fasions or styles .
people at their young age they would be attracted to a lot of things , childreans mainly spent a lot of time by playing vedio games daily .
They will be attached to their TV sets long time .
And many people like playing outdoor games such as Football , Rugby , Cricket so on .
Young people spend lots of time in enjoying their daily life .

Finally most of the young people spend their most of the time to enjoy only , but in the end of the day they should realise that they should work hard in the present days then only they can build their happy feauters .
If they spend all the time by playing , watching TVs they cannot survive in they meare feauter they should face many problems , so every student should ellocate some time to study and plan their feauters .
