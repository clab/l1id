I agree that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts then it is for them to learn facts .
In a student age it is very much essential to get a idea and concept on the subject before learning facts .
For example maths is a subject where we shoud have an idea and the concept ie logical thinking of how we should do the problem .
If we dont have concept of how to do addition then how can we proceed furrter .
Concept is like a root to devolop furter .
When a student can understand about the idea and about the concept it is very much easy to learn about the fact .
The student if he starts understanding the concept and idea he can never forget the things .

witout a concept studying is simply muging up .
When the student starts understanding about the idea and the concept of a subject it is very much easy for him to learn .
At the student age only our main idea and the concept starts .
If a student is learning anything without a concept is something like root without a stem .
Whenever we want do something we shoud have an idea of what to do in a similar manner whenever a student is studying or doing any practical he shoud have an idea of wat to do and concept of it and then think about the facts .

Many students loose the oppurtunities because of lack of devoloping ideas , and lack of concept in the subject .
I feel if we have an idea and concept on the subject it is very much easy to learn .
Secret of success of many students because of there conceputial way of studying .
I conclude that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
