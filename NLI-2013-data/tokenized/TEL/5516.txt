I agree that most advertisements make a product seem much better than they really are .
These days the advertising has become so popular that some people even have this belief that they can not sell a product at all with out advertising it on television or radio or wall posters .

The first and the foremost thing in most of the advertising industry is presenting something bigger better or unrealistic than the usual product .
These days there are advertisements for everything from a mole hill to a mountain .
And thee days with the advancements in media ( radio , television , internet ) the advertising has become so easy and so effective that it is delivered to each and every person and who encounters that adverisement tends to buy that product .
They are so impresive .
Even if we go to a gas station there is a discount , for clothes , for medicines ,,,,, for every thing there is some bonus ( so called ) to the customers , which is just , in my opinion is , another startegy to improve their business and get profits .

The other day i was walking on a street and i see that on the other side of a road there is this man beging with a note in his hand `` need food '' and wen i looked at him and tried to walk away he had taken out another note with '' Need booze '' and asking me to give him some money for what ever note i liked for .
He really advertising more than his needs or showing something to others which isnt true .
he has money bu its just that he doesnt want to work at all .
Here is another incident , i saw this advertisement in the news paper stating that there is a store wide discount with a note on the front of the shop `` out of business store closing after 15 days '' and i went there .
I liked some shoes and bought them .
After a month when i go to buy something else in the same street i see the shop is still there .
And i talked to one of my friend , who is in to marketing , told me that these are some kinds of business tactics they play .

The most important thing is that the companies who advertise should recognise that the people dont mind the advertising , if its really genune .
I I have seen many advertisements in the news paper and television stating that loose weight and witha picture of before the treatment and after the treatment ( picture taken sideways ) .
And some wid before and after treatment for hair implants or regenration .
They say it is really successfull in most patients and if you go to them stating that it has not been successful for me they blame you .
They tell you that you are not the one who has done the excersise properly or didnt take the medication regularly .

I also agree that there is some genune advertising but we can hardly get to see that these days .
Due to these advertising strategies , over a period of time , people will realise that its of no use to fall in the trap of those advertisements .
And im sure the advertisers will come up with some other solution for it , after all they will have to sell their products and we will have to buy products .
I Guess it will just go on ... , ...
and may be in future they might advertise it genunely ( the way it is ) , but as of now my option is that i agree that most of the advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
