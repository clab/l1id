Knowledge is a very important aspect of a person 's life .
It influences the position of the person in the society .
Everybody relies on knowledge to make things easier .
Regarding the statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjects than to specialize i one specific subject . ''

I fell that the person with specific knowledge on one subject is better of with the person having broadledge base .
As we normally taunt the persons with broad knowledge as `` Jack of all trades , master of none '' we send the information that for a person to be succesful in life it is the specific knowledge that comes to the picture .

Proffessionally a person with specific knowledge is preffered to the person with a broad knowledge base .
Suppose a patient suffering from a heart disease approaches a cardiologist and not a general surgeon .
As the saying goes `` rolling stone gathers no moss '' tells that the person who keeps chaging his subject on not constant in his acedemic intrests will gather no useful knowledge .

On the flipside , age is a major factor in deciding the knowledge we have to acquire .
Suppose for example , when in school the children are taught various subjects like History , social , science , math etc because to form the foudation of a knowledge .
Suppose in school children are taught about first aid , which may be life saving for some one .
So , until a certain age , till the student is not sure of his fields of interest he has to gain some basic knowledge about a lot of things .

If the student is clear about his field of interest he has to go into the specifics of a single subject , this will help him in acquring a job .

Finally , as the saying goes `` a single coin has two sides '' the person will have to go through both the stages depending on his age and his interest .
After a certain age , the person with knowlege in a specific subject is rather succesful in his personal life than the person with broad knowledge on many subjects .
