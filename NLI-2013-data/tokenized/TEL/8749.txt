`` UNDERSTANDING IS BETTER THAN LEARNING ''

I completely agreed with the given statement , which stated as `` it is more important to understand than it is for them to learn facts '' . understanding of concepts are defined by getting the information that how it is intriduced , generated and developed .
understanding based on the knowledge that how the student receiving the information .
is it in creative nature or just knowing the nature ?
creative nature is defined as the application knowledge of student in the perticular ideas and concepts .
we will gain the permanent knowledge about the concepts , if we understand the concept .
this is the great use of understanding the concept .
so , anybody in the world , they will prefer the understanding skills than learning .

now i will show the results by learning facts .
actually what happening by learning process ?
In the learning process , we will concentrate about the concept which is stated in the given text books or extra material .
we do not think about the applications of that concepts in learning .
it is useful to get temperory knowledge .
not to use for long time .
the students , who are average in their knowledge , they will sure use the learning concepts for fulfilling their acadamic requirements .
if they concentrated on the understanding skills of the concepts and ideas , then they will get good knowledge and become brilliant in their academics .

now take an example , which strengthen my opinion about understanding skills .
when i studied my higher level school education , i faced a lot of difficulties to get good grade in mathematics class .
when i learned the concepts and ideas of principles and theories , i can not show my application skills in exams .
really i got great trouble in mathematics to get grade .
at that time , my mathamatics teacher told me about how to understand the concepts and ideas , how to improve the application skills .
importance of understanding of facts .
by taking all these stuff , i improved my application skill by understanding the concepts .

By all the above information , strongly i concluded that understanding the concepts and ideas are very important than learning facts for any student .
