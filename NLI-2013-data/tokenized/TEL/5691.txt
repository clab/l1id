Bussiness people try to market their products by advertising a lot .
Even though the product is not much important in our daily life , marketing people will make an impression that the product is very improtant for us .
So , I totally agree with the statement that `` Most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are . ''

I usally watch Home Shopping Network channel .
In that channel lots and lots of products are advertised .
people watching this channel are impressed about the products and ca n't wait without buying them .
For example , I was very much impressed by storage bags which are used to store vegetables in the refridgerator .
The advertisement was so impressive showing that vegetables will be fresh for longer periods , if we store in that particular bags and they have shown two groups of vegetables , one group of vegetables stored in ordinary storage bags and one the other group stored in that special storage bags .
So I was impressed and I ordered that particular item .
In the real , I do n't feel that lot of difference about the bags and I was not satisfied with the product .

Advertisements are only one type of way to introduce the product in to the market .
Just by seeing the advertisement we ca n't judge the reliability of the product , unless we experience the advantages and disadvantages of the product by using it .
Normally most people inculding me are easily carried away by the advertisements .
By doing so , we are wasting time and money .
So I suggest to spent some extra time to know the pros and cons of a product form friends or relatives who have used that product before and then decide to go for it or not .

I finally conclude that we should not buy a product just by seeing an advertisement of that product .
We must have the knowledge of that product , its use and how improtant it is and then buy it .
