I feel to have specialize in one specific subject because of various reasons .

Initally , as we are concentrating only on single specfic subject of our interst , it provides lot of scope to study in details of subject rather than , superflusilly .
I feel that having little knowledge is always dangerous because , it may results in many problems .
For , example if i know a driving car partially and i go for a ride then this may lead to accident .

Any student or professor who concentrates only on single subject produces very good results .
For example if we consider scientist `` ALBERT EINSTEIN '' who concentrated only in physics and produced great equation ( e = mc2 ) which is basis for famous princlple `` THEORY OF RELATIVITY '' .which is used in all nuclear reactions , to measure the relative velocity between to moving objects ...
etc .

If we specalize in single subject we can understand concepts involved in subject in an effective way .
Let us consider if i am specilazied in commincations then there would be lot of scope to get recruted in communications company rather than , the person with half knowledge in that subject .

Many universites ans colleges suppot to specilaze only in single subject as they provide in their finall semisters or in post graduation subjects of students interest i.e .. , electives .
This provides student to encourage in field of his / her own interest with out forcing to no each concepts .

so , I finally feels going for single subject is the best way to learn and understand as it provides scope for doing researches in our interested fields of study .
I feel that half knowledge is just like `` HALF CUP IS ALWAYS EMPTY '' it never gets filled up .
As there are plenty of oppurtines in specific fields students should choose subject of their to excell in their academic and be a good citizen to country .
