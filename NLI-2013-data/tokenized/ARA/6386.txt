nowadays the stress of traffic jam affect all the drivers & people all around the world iagree with the statment in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today .
people will replacet with internet services First of all the internt services will be the best replacement for the car on shopping we can search on the website about all what we need for example food , clothes & books at home by making an order & pay through using credit card it will took few mintues better than using ur car & stuck in thr trafficjum for hours , then search for parking & full ur car with expensive gasolin , u will be sitting relaxed at home watching T.V while ur items u order it through the internt will arrieve secondly u can do most of ur work using the internet ordering products , markting , selling , advertsing & sending the bills to the customers .
thirdly the education will be through the intenet no more students will go to schools & attend classroom all students will had their classes on computers , doing their homework & exams .
then if u plan to visit a country u can search & read about the intersting places on the internet & buy the tickets , reserve the room in hotel while u are drinking ur cup of tea in ur bed .

however we ca n't forget the advantages of the car if u plan to go to trip with ur family to eat in resturant or change the home enviroment , go for a picnic or if u want to show ur town to one of ur best friends planning to visit u because the internet able to slow down or had virus in the system which will spoil all ur programmes then u need to use ur own car .

finally each of the car & internet services have their advantages & disadvantages , i believe in twenty years there will be modern technolog service more that the cars & internt also .
