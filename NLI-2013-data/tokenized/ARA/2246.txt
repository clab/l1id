`` Young lpeople enjoy life more than older people do . ''
This statement might sound true because it is commomly known that a joyfulsoul and a young heart exist in a young body .

But i have personally an objection about both statements : a young heart can still exist in old bodies if one knows how to enjoy his life and make himself happy .

An old person should convince herself that she is not a teenager anymore and that she cannot do the thinks she used to do when she was young .
This way this old person would adapt to her situation and try to accomodate the things she is able to do to the ongoing life .

Many activities can fullfill the life of an old person and steel away the feeling of gettin board .

Few exemples may support my disagreement with the stated subject :
By reading , practicing sports if possible , helping people , a person may still find herself useful to the society .
This feeling breaks away sadness and unhappy momemts .
By working as a volonteer if possible , someone may feel that he is really helping instead of spending the day wondering what to do .

Grandkids , most of the times love to stay with their grandparents and listen to stories from the past .
Dedicating time to grandkids strengthens the relationship between parents and grandchildren which will bring joy to the life of a grandparent .

Many other things also help old people to integrate in the society , like participating into religious and social activities , working in a natural context ( agriculture .. ) , travelling ...

Still the problem persists with sick old people who are physically unable to reach anywhere or are not enough educated to fullfill their time with intellectual activities ...
These people still can be happy if they really have a young heart , if they love other people and especially their surrounding relatives .
When one knows how to love , he will be loved and will have a joyful life .
