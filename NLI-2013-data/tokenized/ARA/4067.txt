The young people in any community are the base of future if they are work will for their communities the community will be high class .
the aquition is the community give these people the appurtonity to helping in developing process ?
I think no .
the community did not give the young people the appurtonity to helping in developing process .
becouse the comunity today is just thinking to collect money by any ways .
one of the dagerous way is collecting by drugs which is channeled to young people like puim and heroin .

Also the comunity today looking for anjoyment regardless which type of enjoyment is clear and dont have problems for young poeple like sex movie or by enternet .
In some country they let young people work hardly long time under no safe condiotion like in some industry in some country of asia .
To say the trouth some country give the young people a big chance to educate from first year to graduate of unversity .
and tese country have some club for improving the thinking of young people but these countries are not much .

Finally the young people need more and more appurtonity to helping their communities in developing process .
