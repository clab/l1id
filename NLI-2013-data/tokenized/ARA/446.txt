The question mentions two types of knowledge .
Having broad knowlegde of many subjects and specializing in one subject .
Having a broad knowlegde means a lot of subjects but less information .
Specializing in one subject means less subject but tonnes more information .
They both have advantegs and disadvantages .

Having a broad knowledge of many subjects means that you have less infromation about many subjects .
Having knowlegde on a wide range of subjects is a good thing becuase it means that you understand a lot about many things .
However as it will be only broad means that you will only get the basic infromation you need , therefore this wont be enough to answer or fulfil certain things .
I think you should only have a broad knowledge of things when you want to be general in things you should do .
Example a general doctor should have a broad knowledge of what different diseases are and their symptoms .

Specializing in one subject means you only do one subject but you concentrate on it and you will get more information about the subject you are doing .
By specializing in one subject it menas that you will have more time to concentrate on the subject you are doing which will make you as a person an expert in that subject .
In some professions you will need to specialize in one subject , such as being a professer in a college or university .
Example and geology lecturer should specialise in geology , this will make him have more infromation about geology as he will have more time to concentrate on what he is doing and learning .
This will result in a more effiecient professor !

From my point of you i see that they both are good and beneficial depending on what you are going to do i the future and what you think is good for you .
If you want to know that basics of many subjects and have be a bank of basic infromation that go for a broad knowledge of many academis subjects .
On the other hand if you want ot be an expert in what you aare doing then specialise in the subject that you want to be an expert in as you will have a much greater knowledge about your subject , this is laso becuase you will have more time to concentrate on your subject .
