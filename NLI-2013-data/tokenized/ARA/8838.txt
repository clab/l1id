Many people these days have different ways of studying ideas or understanding them and this has become a great issue in our community and has had great arguments on this subject .

I personally believe that understanding the whole idea or the concept is much easier and faster for teh students than trying to learn the facts of the subject for many reason 's its is easier to generalize rather than specifying , students will have easier understanding to the subject and will require less time to understand them , and when a subject is generalized it is actually more understandable by the students .
For example lets say a class of students are in a history class wich is talking about the second world war instead of the teacher specifying on on the details and teh facts of what has happened and how the war startted he basically generalizes the whole idea and makes it easier for the students to understand and they will basically have less time studying the subject cause of the ideas given by the teacher instead of the long and complicated facts .
But even though understanding the idea is easier and faster way some times knowing the facts of a subject can be very important as well so it is not always just understanding the idea its also knowing facts about the idea .
Take the same example used above about world war its easier to just generalize and get the idea of how it started but its important to know the facts of why it started as well .
Well you see now that there is an advantage in just understanding the idea and a disadvantage as well .

Basically it is much easier for students to generalize and understand the idea rather than knowing the facts , but the facts of that idea might be very important and usefull to them .
