understanding the ideas and concepts is important in any learning process , but if the students ignore or were not able to learn and focus on the facts , that will be reflected on them in understanding the whole topic or subject .

from my point of view , i think that studying and focusing on facts is not less important than studying and learning concepts and ideas and this is because of many reasons , First is the need for the implementation of ideas and concepts , so when we take the nujrsing students as an example , nursing students read the concepts of some medical terminology throughout the course of their major but if these students do not implement what they read , this will be reflected negatively on them after they graduate and start their careers , Second is the need to observe the applications of these concepts and ideas , and for this point i will mention the medical surgical students as an example , when the students only study and read the concepts of suturing and wound dressing and only look at pictures in the books , they will never be able to practice these concepts , another reason that indicates that the facts are important , the pyramids in egypt , many of the students in the school of engineering learn about the concepts of archticture used to build the pyramids and as these concepts confiscated the most of us it will be more confiscating to some of these students as will , except if they watch the illustration video for the structure and archticture of the pyramids , and the fact of building these pyramids in the inside and the outside will be more clear to them .

as a conclusion , learning of ideas and concepts will be confusing for any student in any major or feild of study and will not be convincing enough , so the level of satisfaction for that student will be lower except if that student was exposed to the facts of the topic he is learning
