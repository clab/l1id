Traveling is one of the thing in life that almost everybody enjoys .
Everyone , however , has his own opinion about whether nor people should be led by a tour guide during the trip .
From my point of view , i think that traveling without guide will make us at ease and feel dependant .

Traveling wihout guide will help us to get more about the culture and get us to know the real people .
i am not saying that having a guide is not good .
it just will not make us know everything about the place you are visiting .
Tour guides always have a map showing places where tourists have got to visit .
In other words tour guides tend to show people only the beautiful places and cultural ones .
For that reason people who visit places by themselves tend to have more knoweldge and information than those who have been led by a guide .
Those that go by themself , does n't have to visit certain place but the whole entire place so they will get to see many things than the ones that have guide .
In addtion people that travel by themself visit and see the whole place freely .
the beautiful and the ugly ones .

Moreoever , When you travel alone , you will have to ask people to show directions so you will get an idea on how people think and interact with foreigners and even you can ask them questions about the cultures and the customs that they have .
Whereas , traveling with a guide you would n't be able to interact with the native speaker and you always be dependant on the group .
Traveling alone is cheaper than traveling in groups .
Because traveling in groups you will have to pay a fee to the company that will take care of you whereas , traveling by yourself you will just need your ticket .

In conclusion , i can say that traveling alone tend to be more fun and will help us to know a lot about the culture and will make us free to visit interesting plaves wihout rush or pression .
