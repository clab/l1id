I totally agree with this statement because many were those who were the victims of t.v ads , in advertsements the only intrest of the advertiser is to promote an object , an idea or a newly launched product not caring whether it might affect the consumer in a positive or negative way or if it was a product intended for internal , use if it might cause any bodily damage .

Ads are the best way also to increase the sales of a product so overall it is mainly to increase sales and thereby profit .
For example i have seen many ads on tv promoting for weight loss pills , or even shorts that when worn during exersice increases prespiration .
Some weight loss pills are FDA approved others arent which might cause severe drug - drug interaction or even food-drug interaction resulting in severe damage to health .

As for the shorts if not washed frequently , might also cause severe skin conditions .
Other things like topical creams that when applied can redeuse 1 or 2 or 4 inches from the waist or hips as stated by the ad can just make people more lazy , by believing the ad they buy it and use it then sit around the whole day snaking and watching tv thinking that a miracle will happen .
When the results are negative they just loose hope and look for another product or quit trying altogether .

Other products include skin care products that make wrinkles disappear , they have the same harm if they are not approved and if they are not being officially sold in pharmacies .
There are also ads promoting for long vacations in some luxurious resort , the idea may be appealing but on arrival there might be lack of facilities and some problems that were not specified in the ad which might make the holiday tiresome .
