i was allways thinking about what will happened in the next years , but every day i have adeferent ideai , and there are some of them .
some times i agree with this statement becuase in the next twenty years mabey the human will invent anelectritical door that we an pass throw it and suddenly we find our selves in another place .

or human can invent a flying car that we can transporting inthe sky for ashort spaces , and ithink this what will happend and we will say good bay to cars and trians .

but what i 'm thinking now is : this oil who long it will stell with us ?
and when it will be runout ?
if this happend so we will not see cars or planes or trains even ship , all of these things will go away and this time will be the camels and horses time .

but mabey we will atened to the natural sourse for the energy and getting and improve our life .
and these natural source are : first the energy of wind .
as we know the wind has strong energy , and if we know how to use it by puting big fans on the huge mountains , also the sun can give us alarge amount of energy , and we can get this energy by the sun cells , the same cells that artifical moons have in the space , and this way were used by some people and they said its a useful way for getting energy , becuase we can used for cars , plans , or trains and save the oil for another thing .

in aconclusion i think cars will be kicked out inthe next twenty years , but not all the cars becuase the cars which move with the sun cells will still in our life .
