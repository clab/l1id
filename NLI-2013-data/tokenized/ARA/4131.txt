Young people of this generation are different from the past generation .
We are more involved in growing technology and changes to the world around us , although many young people to spend time getting involved in their community and its activities , the effort is weak and only from a minority of young people .
The past generations that did apply themselves to their community and really put in the effort to be involved , may not have been so interested if they had the availability of technology that we have today .
Although that might sound very negative that young people are more interested in video games than their community , many do find more exciting and amusing things to do with their free time .
In this day and age we have computers and telephones , video games and music systems , we are all lucky to have such great gadgets in our reach at such a young age , and also for it to be so easily obtainable .
Although this is a wonderful thing for the younger generation , the past generations have chosen to frown upon it .
I have watched mothers scream for their children to move away from the television or unglue their fingers from the keyboard of their laptops , all because they are frustrated with what the younger generation has chosen as their childhood enjoyment .
The community should be a major part of a childs life , even beyond that if possible , children need to learn how to embrace the world around them , not be locked in their rooms with a telephone attached to their faces .
There is much more going on outside in the world , and by being involved in it all is where all of life experiences are gained from and how we all learn to grow as people into young adults .
Our communities need to know that there is more in the future than computers and phones , that there is communication through expression and fun .
The younger people need to remember their roots , their home and the enjoyment all around them , the many oppertunities the community has to offer .
The community is put in the hands of the up and coming generations and if we do not take responsibility , then no one will .
