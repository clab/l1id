Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities at all , and this will have very harmful effects on the community in the future .
Why are they not giving enough time to helping their communities ?
I think because the are busy enjoying their life , having fun , busy in life , Just thinking in them selfs , they are not thinking in others .

They will face the results in the future .
For example : poor people nobody take care of them , except when we have a problem and you can do nothing you will go to god and ask god to solve your problem and you will make an agreement with god that if your problem was solved , lets say you will give the poor people food , and thats because they do n't think in poor people at all .

This is not the big problem .
The problem is that in the future thoes povierty that the young generation didnot takecare of will start to act agressively maybe by murders , stealing toward this community and it will be very hard to stop them .

I believe that the best way to prevent this is by taking care of these people , who knows they might help the community in someway or other , for example : Mickale jorden , the best basketball player all over the world and he is very famous , this guy when he was young he couldnot efford to join a club , but when he found the care he bacame a star and now all the world knows him .
what i mean that we can help these people by persuading people to help the , Why do n't we make a special day in the year that all people an the world in this day will support the by anything , money , food blankets , anything , even used books , anything we might not find it useful for us maybe it will be usefull for them .
