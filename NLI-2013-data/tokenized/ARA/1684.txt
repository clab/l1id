The foremost business philosopher in America Jim Rohn said , `` To survive in the twentieth century you have to know more than one skill . ''
Today , life is changing at a very high pace and more than ever before .
The computer age which revolutianized every possible aspect in the world has gotten us to what we call the age of knowledge where to specialize in one specific subject is not enough in order to fulfill one 's self .
Therefore it is better and imperative that one gets specialized in more than one domain for economic reasons and personal reasons .

Everyone wants to lead comfortable lives and have a safe future .
Most of us want to be rich .
To do so , nobody is going to be specialized in only one field because now , and more than ever , all fields are related to another .
For instance , let 's take real estate .
An investor who wants to invest in real estate has to have an education in business , law , finance , banking , and even construction .
If this investor is only familiar in business , how can he know about taxation policies , or about which kind of construction material to choose from ?
Therefore , a knowledge in more than one subject can prove a valuable asset when it comes to increasing wealth .

To seek knowledge is everyone 's personal ambition .
The process is tough and lifelong .
It requires a thirst for learning and a hunger to seek the many truths which our world stores .
To have knowledge in a lot of subjects is a virtue in society .
It gives reputation and instant recognition .
Take a company that wants to hire a new employee and that has the possibility of choosing two candidates : a person having a business degree who has worked only in one kind of firm all his life , and another holding the same degree who has worked in many differenet trends of business .
The company should choose the latter since he 's been exposed to the world more than the other candidate .
Also , having an idea of a lot of subjects can be self satisfying since no one can laugh at the person or try to trick him .
The world is filled with cons and crook men .
If you 're limited to only one type of education , the chances of you being cheated are very high .
Therefore having a broad knowledge in many domains can be rewarding on a personal basis .

To sum up , being involved in more than one subject is much better than being only involved in one for many reasons such as economic reasons and personal reasons .
Today the world obliges us to invest our time in education since it will affect our living conditions .
Being more knowledgeable is also rewarding in that it gives a good image and reputation and can serve as a defence against cheating .
And the most important thing is to keep learning , keep living , loving , and leaving a legacy for others to follow .
