How many times have you got deceived by commercials ?
How many times have you regreted buying things you saw on commercials because they were not as good as they seemed ?
I am sure that this happened to many of you .

I think that commericals always inflate what products really are .
There are many products which are not good and have lots of commercials .
On the other hand , there are many products that do n't do much advertisement which are much better than products which advertise all the time .
So a product having many advertisements does n't necessarily mean that the product is good .

I can speak about this out of experience .
I once saw an advertisement on the television about a soultion that removes all types of stains .
I was so thrilled by the advertisement that I bought one for me and one for my sister .
One day my friend came to my house and she spilled blueberry juice on her white shirt .
I proudly got the soultion and rubbed it on the stain as instructed .
Shockingly , I figured out later that the more I rubbed the more the stain spread .
I was very embaressesed from my friend who had to throw her shirt after that day .

In addition , a lot of the things mentioned in advertisements are incorrect .
I once saw a toothpaste commercial that stated that this toothpaste gives 12-hour protection to the teeth from decay and plaque .
As a dentist , I knew that this did n't make any sense .
There is no such thing as `` 12-hour protection '' .
It is well-known that plaque starts growing on teeth right after you brush them .

Unfortunately , false advertisements lead to a waste of money and loss of trust between customers and sellers .
Therefore , I think that there should be a commitee to supervise what is being mentioned in advertisments .
