A lecture may be a useful , but boring way to teach a person about a country or a city .
Travelling , on the other hand , is a very unique way to learn because people gain the knowledge while having fun .
Not only does it teach about a historical aspect or a specific condition in the country or city , but it also gives the people the opportunity to live within what they are learning , and to actually be able to see , feel and even touch what they are learning about .
A person , however , cannot learn just by seeing or being in the place ; the best way to get the most out of the travel is to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

A tour guide is an expert who will give all the interesting historical , technological and even social facts and beauties of the place a person visits .
It is more fun if you listen to a person talking than just reading a book or asking people .
A tour guide will show you places you may not be able to reach or know about by yourself .
Also , if you have any questions about anything in a trip , the tour guide is a person who is already there to help you .

Travelling with a tour guide and a group is much safer than travelling alone , especially if it is a place not familiar or is not being visited before by the traveller .
There is a lesser chance for a person to get lost in a new place if the person was with a group led by a tour guide .
The place may also be dangerous , such as theft or kidnapping .
When you are with a group and a tour guide , it is less likely for you to be kidnapped or rubbed .

And so , travelling alone may be fun , but the consequences of it can be dangerous or less useful for the individual .
However , travelling with a group and a tour guide is both a fun means and an affective way of gaining knowledge .
