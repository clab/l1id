The statement says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
We dont know for sure whether this statement is true or not .
Twenty years is a long time , and anything can happen .
With all the new technologies that are being invented everyday , it is possible to have fewer cars in twenty years .

Today , we see that there are too many cars being manufactured than the amount that is needed .
In Kuwait for example , every house has about two to three cars , if not more .

Having too many cars can cause disasters .
As a result , more accidents will occur , and people would have to leave their homes earlier because of any traffic or accidents that would cause them to be late .

In twenty years , we could have flying cars , or a different trasportation system that would result in less cars .
More people might start using other forms of transportations .

In my opinion , I believe that there should be less cars in use , and that people should use other forms of transportation to get from one place to another .
Some other forms of transportation are the use of buses , subways , or carpooling .
If more people used buses and subways , there would be less cars in use .
Carpooling is also a good method that can be used to reduce the amount of cars in use today .

If there was a rule stating that each car should have a minimum of three people , less cars would be in use .

In conclusion , a possible solution is that in the future , people would realize the amount of money they are spending on gas , and how dangerous driving has become .
And who knows how much gas will be available in twenty years .
