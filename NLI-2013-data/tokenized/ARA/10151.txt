WELL , IN THIS STATMENT WE CAN , T PUT ALL THE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE IN ONE SHIP .
BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW THERE ARE DIFFRENT BTWEEN THE PEOPLE IN MANY THINKS .
SO AS REASLUT IF I AGREED WITH HTIS STATMENT I WILL NOT JUSTCE IN THIS CAUSE .
AND WE WILL NOTICE THAT IN DAIL OUR LIFE .
FOREAMPLE HTERE ARE TWO SUCCESSFUL MEN OR WOMEN HAVE TWO CAMPANY IN NEW YORK .
AND THEY REALLY HAVE GOOD JOBS .
BUT ONE OF THEM DOES NOT SISTIFY ABOUT WHAT HE OR SHE HAVE AND THE OTHER ONE SICFUY ABOUT WHAT HE HAS .
SO WE WILL NOTICE KNOW RHE DIFFRENICE IN THIS CASE CLEARLY .
BUT AWAYS PEOPLE WONTS TO TRY A NEW HTING AND ALSO MAYBE THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE OR MAYBE NOT .
BUT I THINK WHEN SOMEONE TRY A NEW HTINGS IS DIFFRENT FROM CREATION SOMETHING NEW MAYBE THERE ARE LITTLE DIFFRENT IN THIS CASES .
I WILL GIVE A EXAMPLE TO MAKE MY IDEA CLEAR .
THERE ARE TWO MEN AND THEY SUCCESSEIN THEIR JOB BUT ONE ONE OF THEM FOREXAMPLE CREATE A NEW CELLPHE AND HE WILL FACE A RISK IN THAT BUT THE OTHER HE TRY WITH OUT DID ANY THINGS SOMEHTINDS NEW AND HE WILL FACE SOME RISKS TO SEALE THE CELLPHONE .
IN THE END THE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE WILL STAY SUCCE
