A community can not stand up alone .
The government does its best to improve its community .
Those in charge do what they can inorder to help their communities .
But the question is : can the government or those in charge improve a community by themselves ?
In other words , can they improve a community without the help of young people ?

Some young adults think that they have nothing to do with their community .
They think that it is not their responsibilty to help their communities .
Others believe that they have to help their community , even if they do not have enough time .
In my opinion , young people nowadays should devote time to helping their communities .
There are several reasons why they should do this .

First , those in charge can not perform all their jobs or activities alone .
They need support and help from the young people .
For example , if the government decides to build a healthy , clean club for the sake of young people , can this happen if a young people enters this club smoking a cigaratte or if h/she throws a waste paper ?
Moreover , the youth should help keeping the river and streets clean because this would make their community healthy and free of any pollution .

Second , young people should help their communities by devoting time and money to charity 's activities .
For example , they would visit an orphanage , play with orphans , buy them new clothes and toys , and so on .
This would help in building up a flourishing , kind community .

In conclusion , there are many reasons why young adults should devote enough time to help their communities .
They have to support the governement in new project by avoiding doing such bad habits as smoking or throwing wates in the streets or rivers .
Second , they may help the community by performing charities ' activities which would help the community in lifting up the spirits of the poor and the orphans .
Thus , I believe that it 'd be great if young people devote much of their time in helpinh their communities .
