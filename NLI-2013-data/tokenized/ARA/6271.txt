I toltal agree with the statment , but before giving any argument I want to share this question and answer :

what is the hope of the humanity ?
A world with less polution .

The cars are more and more produced and used in all arround the world without any law for the environement care in some countries wich could be a desastre for the futur generations , for this reason some governments are looking for another ways to solve the transportations problems with less negative inpact on the environement wich is mainly caused by the car 's smok , Trafic jam wich are causing more and more noise into the big citis and some small towns as well .

on top of what I exposed before , people will work more and more from home , so they would n't need as many cars than today , the boom of the internet is opening the new perspectives for the electronique learning , home offices and electronique shopping and buying trought web sites using their computers and internet connection , we can see this alredy in the mature countries where some people are n't leaving homes for days so that 's giving them less stress and more time for home and familly .

To conclude , I 'll say that we have to find a realistic solution for our earth in order to leave it like we had it to the future generations , we have to use the technoligy as much as we can if it 's helping us to reduce using the transportations
