Transportation is very imoprtant these days and no body can live and make mony with out it .
using cars is very effectve and relayable for intown transportations , but these days using cars is becoming harder and harder because of many resons on of them is the increasing in gass value and its becoming mor expensive than before thats why using a car will be wery expensive and some people will prefare using public trasportations like buss and trains , and the other seaon why using car is beng harder is the waste of time in trafic jams , farther more people now care more than ever in the enviroment and many of them can gif alot saving it from polution .

in twenty years i think that things will get more complecated ans goverments will do what thay can do to save plnit earth from any thing that may be harm full to the contry .

in the other hand in twety ears comunnication technoleges will be improved , so many people may do ther works online and students may not have to go to schools each morning but they could get the classes on line too .

in twenty years no body know how markets wold be .
you may have the chance to buy any thing online and get it shept to your houes door so you wont have to .

There are many factors to reduce the nomber of cars as long as cars are expensive and not nisisory
