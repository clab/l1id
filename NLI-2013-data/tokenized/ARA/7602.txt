Travel is important , and everyone like to travel and enjoy his/her life due to that it is normally in the person to like travel and relaxed .
Because of that we see many people who travel every break or occassion which they can travel in it .
In my opinion , it is good or more useful to travel in group led by a tour guide than travling alone .
There are many reasons and examples why it is more useful to travel in this way .

First , the travel in group make the journey or trip more enjoyable and active .
For example , if you travel alone you will not get that enjoy which you can get in a small atittude such as male with a group .
In addition if you get any problems , you will find someone can help you .

Second , to travel with guide is keeping time and effort more than if you travel alone .
If you travel with a guide , you will go to the best place , the more comfortable or the more enjoyable .
In addition you will not get any terrible or any harsh time since that it has already someone visited or known more about the place that you would vistit .
On the other hand , if you travel alone , you might only spend time to find nice place just to spent the night in it .

Third , travel with a guide will help you to learn more about the place which you visit especially if your guide was a scinetist or someone has a long experience with place he/she will visit .
In addition , if you visit a natural place , and you could get information about it from your guide , and you will teach your family and friends about that place , plus getting a outstanding experience .

In the end , there are many reasons why it is better to travel in a group led by a guide than to travel alone .
Some of them I have already mentiond , and some of them you can figure them out .
Because of that try to travel in a group which led by a leader as much as you can .
