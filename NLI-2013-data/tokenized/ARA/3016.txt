Enjoying life varies from one person to an other .
It differs also from one stage of life to an other .
Such an issue remains controversial , because it implies a variety of factors and elements that should be taken into consideration .

Nevertheless , I do agree with this statement due to a number of reawsons .
First of all , the stage of life ( the age of a person ) plays a pivotal role in determining one 's interests and tendencies .
It provides a person with vision that enlightens and leads one to make the suitable choice one has to pick befre pursuing a certain activity that will generate pleasure and entertainment throughout the whole life span .

Young people have got a lot of choices in life , because they are supported by their ability to do and pursuit a variety of pleasure-generating activites .
on the other hand people who are advanced in age have got a very short list of options because they are governed by their advanced ages and can never pursuit some activites that require certain traits such as energy , mobility and agility .
So old people are hampered by the age factor .
In fact it is the main obstacle behind their limited pleasure in life .
Young people are usually able to get engaged in so many activities of activitee and hobbies that are pecular to young people such as athletic activites and participation in different competitions that entail young bodies and minds .
Old people can practice such things in a rather differnt mannerdue to their limited phisical and mental capabilites .

So , young people will find the chance to entertain themselves fully , and this will eventually lead to full pleasure and enjoyment in life .
However , the issue of enjoyment remains controvertial , because no one can define what 's real enjoyment !
The real meaning of enjoyment in life varies from one person to an other and also from one generation to an other .
Even differnt communites an d cultures will vary in this context .
Nevertheless , and in my own point of view , I believe that young people do enjoy life more than old ones .
