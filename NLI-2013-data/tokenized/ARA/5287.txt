Advertisments have been knowen for a long time .
Some historians say it began during the Roman empaier time .
It have been used since then in different regons and cultures .
However , It is used today for different porposes in different places .
The Advertisments could be on TV , radio , or prented forms .
Mostly it is posted by companies or businuss people to sell thair items or serveses .
As a result , all advertisments will make the product or serves appear in the best form or stuation .
In my openion , Almost all advertisments make products much better then they are in reality .

These days , companies and busnesses compest with each other to sell thair product to more costomers .
They use the advertisments as an essentual way to reveal the product for the costomer and try to convence him about thair product .
They try so hard to show the best feeatures of the product or the serves that thay have .
Alternatively , thay know the nagative parts of thair product or serves , but they never say these parts unless the low ask clearly to do so .
For instence , there are advertisments about fitness equepments on TV that apears all day almost on every channel .
These ads talks about the product as if it will help you with all your fitness needs .
In the ad they mention the easyness of using the equepment and how light it is .
Furthermore , thay say it dose not requaer frome you a hard work and it will save your time .
All of thease clames are not true at all .
Its clear in this ad that thay ara trying to say some thing thet the costomer wants to hear .
so that he or she will by it based on what they think about the product not about waht the product provide .

In canclution , ads these day is not what it should to be .
It sould talk about the true good things in the product and the bad things so people can determen wather to bey it or not .
