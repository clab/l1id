In these days young people want to grow older while old people want to be younger , the young people think that the older people live a better life then they do , but the older people think that the younger people are living a better life then they do .
I think that young people enjoy life than older people do , three main layouts is that young people have no resppnsiblity , they have more fun and they are getting care of from older people .

Younger people enjoy life without any worries or any responsibilty , oppisite from older people they have worries in their life and need are responsible for every thing they do .
Younger people don have to worry how to gain mony for their life so that they could eat or drink they easly get what they want , while older peoplle need to get a jobe to support their living .
Another thing younger people play have fun and enjoy life while older people work and get exosted from the hard working and responsibilty .

Secondly , younger people have more energy than older people , they run play lahp , but older people are old for these things you can see them just reading newspapper or watching the new on TV .
Also yonger people can play some sports and do some exersides while older people are too old to move that fast and have less powwer than younger people .

Thirdly , is that younger people are getting cared of from older people , if they get in any problems they get some help from the olders , also if they need some suggestion they get it from the olders , but the olders don have any one get care of them they take care of themself .

In my opinion i want to stay young forever to alwaays have fun and natural life without any responsibilty or worries on getting old , in short words no worries for young people in life .
