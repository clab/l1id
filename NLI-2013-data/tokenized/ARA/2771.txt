Life is nice .
It is our responsibilty to enjoy it .
Life ; however , has many aspects that could prevent us form enjoying it , there are diferent setuations met in life depending on a persons age .
Such difernses will affect the enjoment .
Some people think toung people enjoy life more than older people .
But I think that the elderly ` have much more enjoyment of life than youngsters .
Major reasons for that are finantial presure , difrent phses of dvolpment they met , and the butiful memories the have .

Young people tend to have a lot of pesure .
An employed person wants not only to keep his job but to get a promotion so hat he or she have better finantial situation .
There is always the threat if beeing fired and loosing the funds he or she can run his or her life with .
A unemployed person will always be under pressure of finding a job .
The elderly are usualy retired and get their retirmant benfets reglarly .
Those who never had retiment benfets can easly get acsses to government programes like socal security .
Sons and doters also tend to help their parents .
These factors help the elderly to feel relaxed , and by dooing so , they enjoy life .

Another important point is that the Older ganretion experianced life in diffrent devolpent phases .
For example , the elderly in Saudi Arbia witnessed the inrtoduction of electircty , the first radio brodcast in the reagon , devolpment in trasportation , and the introduction of internet .
This would help them thank the allmighty for the grace they are living in and apreceat it , while younsters may curese the low speed internet .

A wise man once said `` memories are anothor life '' .
This means that any person will enjoy his memories .
Not only does the elder comunity have more time to remember , but also they have much more memories .
Alot of memories with enogh time to remember will increase the posibilty of enjoyment .

This will continue to be a debative esue .
It may be true that generlisation will not give the corct answer , but it will help us to understand tha causes of enjoyment and aply then in our life .
If we uderstood why the elder comunity enjoyed life , our life would be much happier .
