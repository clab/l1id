To answer that question , we need to ask another question '' is success measured by the things we do or how we do things ? '' , if the answer was `` by the things we do '' then i dissagree , because people will always take risks as a fact of success and not as a choice , the reason behind that is that people tend and rather feel safe than to take risks with a big possibility of failure , for example : if there is a shoemaker who worked in that field for almost twenty years and have no experiance what so ever in any other field , then that man have two choices , to continue his work knowing that its a failure - we agreed that success is measured by `` the things we do '' - or changing his field to any other practice that he knows nothing about , and taking a huge risk by changing his field .
Fundimintaly this man will have a very low rate of success , and may lose his furtune by changing the work he does to things he dont .
At the same time this man wanted success and that what we all want , so in fact he had no choice , he had to follow that path .

If that was the case , we will find that many of the businesses will collapse beacuse of the shifting of fields done by non-specilized people , the doctor wants to be a pilot , the accountant wants to be an engineer and the cat wants to be the mouse .

On the other hand ; if the answer was `` by how we do things '' , then we can achieve our goals and success , for we will do our work in a well planned and organized way , even if risk is there , it wont efeect our work to the point of failure .
