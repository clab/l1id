Every idea and concept in the world is based on fact and it ca n't become only if there is fact that relate to it , there is a connector between them , soI dissagree with the statment which says that it is more important reason for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts .

First , any idea or concept should be supported to be more convincable and people can understand , so there should be at least one kind fact that happen or that known to make that idea or that concept is realistic and strong that can people understand .

Second , many idea that do n't have facts disappear with the time because they do n't have any thing that they are based on it , so most people ignore them and they become useless idea until one of the people aprroved it by a fact or some thing like that .

Third , most of people use facts in the writing or research because it make their writing or research more strong and show people that who wrote this article or did this reasearch knows what he is talking about and the writing or the reasearch would be rich of right instead of hypothesis .

Fourth , many scientists who has won prize of approving that there researchs are right , their reasearhs were basesd on facts that made their reasearh more convence and understand for all the world and their ideas become on of the importants laws .

In conclusion , facts are very improtant for students becase they are the base of the ideas and concepts by suppoting them to make them convencible , make the articles very rich of right information that helps people , and it can approved our idea and become a law instead of an useless idea .
