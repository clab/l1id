60 % of people who work do not have time for intertainment because of their work .
They can not do anything about this .
So I thik the young people will enjoy life more because they have a lot of free time , they are healthier and they and they are usually do not have children .

The young people have a lot of free time , and their life will not be affected if they wasted it .
When I was in high school I usually do not studu that much , and I always drive cars with my friends .
I only study before tha tests , and I usually get good grades .

When we look at health of a young man , it will be much better than an old one .
In competitions we usually see the young men and women win .
once I run with my father from our house to my grandfather house .
I was the first in that race , and arter my arreving I even waited for him .

young people usually have children and that will affect their normal life .
All their time spent on work or children .
When I see my older brother with his children , I say to my self that I do not want to have any child .

For these resons , I think young people have more enjoying of life .
They have more free time that they can waste on themselves , they are healthier than older people and they will not be bothered by cildren .
