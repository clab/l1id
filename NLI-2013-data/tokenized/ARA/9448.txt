I disagree that it is more important for student to anderstand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

One of the most important fact that students should know is ideas and concepts are not more important that facts .
because of tow reasons .

The first one is ideas alway can change by the times and place .
the science always change a lot of ideas about what we think in the past .
For example people think in the past the earth is flat and the sun move around the earth , but with the time science discover that all of that is wronge .

The second one is students can not egnore the facts , which other people concloded them in very long time , using large number of reaserches and experince .
However there is a lot of ideas change our world by scienses the change there life and humen distiny by good ideas , but that is not a reason to looke to the ideas as afact we should excepted all the time weather its right or wronge .
Some times people can get a lot of ideas in the same time they will changed .

All of these reasons are so important that make students understand that ideas and concepts are not important than Facts .
