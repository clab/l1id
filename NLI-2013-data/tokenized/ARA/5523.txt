Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , i stongly support this view .
The media has played very important role is misleading people , and made people to believe in what is not true however there are always exceptions .

The media industry has been playing with people trust in order to sell the products of diffrent companies because they pay alot to make attractive advertisements .
To verify my point i am going to give few examples .
For instance i bought a washing liquid after seeing it on the tv the products gives you garanttee that it will take away all the marks no matter how deep they are but after using the product i was not satisfied .
Infact it was just waste of my money and time .
I have a rough estimation that 8 out of 10 prodducts are not reliable , after my past experiences .
Alot of things play a role in making the product so appealing , a high budget advertisement even take well know celeberties to emphasis the quality of the product and to some extent we all believe the well known figurs and we might again mislead ourselves .
You may see alot of commercial on the weekends which compel you to buy the products which you really do n't need , you just get impressed by the comercials and later on after using it you realize it doesnot benefit you as the comercial shows .

Another example i bought a shirt from mall after seeing the model wearing it , when i wore the shirt it nothing felt or looked like the model has promised .
The light , the makeup and the setup made it appear far better than the quality and even the look of the shirt .

I do believe that there are few products from well known companies which have developed trust over time but mostly the others are all not at all satisfying and are just waste of money and time , they play with ones feelings .
The better the advertisement the better money the company has paid to make the advertisement to the reality itself .
