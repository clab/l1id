Adults and young people enjoy life .
Adults watch their children grow , and watching them succeed every step while growing up , walking through harsh moments and surviving , such as their kid 's first smile , first birthday , first day of school , first sport match victory brings joy and happiness to the adult .
Young people enjoy life too , mostly by playing and trying out new things .

An adult would have gone through many stages in his life , but that doesnt mean he still cant enjoy his time .
What interests adults might differ from what interests young people .
Young people are still growing up and having fun and doing activities and setting goals and ambitions would bring them joy .
If a teenage boy , joins the school 's soccer team with a goal to win the championship against all other schools , and his goal gets achieved , he 'll be very proud and happy .
His parents , would also feel the same joy , watching their child win .
When an adult decides to have children , he would most likely be committed into giving that child all the love and affection he has .

`` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''
I strongly disagree with that statement .
Young people would have alot of fun moments that they cherish and later on becomes a happy memory to be remembered , but who would have more memories ?
An adult or a young boy or girl ?
Adults know more than young people , and know how to deal with situations in a more serious and safer way .
While young people have not encountered such a problem , they would feel stressed and scared , and would eventually seek advice from the adults .
When a boy goes to his dad and asks for advice when he 's in trouble , then his father comforts him and ensures him everything will be alright after telling him what he has to do .
The father would notice that his child is growing up , and is becoming more mature which fills his heart with joy and happiness .

An adult with children would want the best for them , and he 'd be willing to do the impossible to ensure that his child has the best care and support he can offer .
Experience is the main key that brings joy in life , and adults would have more of that than young people .
Simple things would bring joy to an adult , a simple smile his child gives him is enough to keep him happy .
While , young people wanna experience new things such as going out with their friends , playing games , travel to new places is what makes them enjoy life the most , and that doesnt occur everyday .
But , an adult that watches his children grow more and more each day is what makes him enjoy life .
