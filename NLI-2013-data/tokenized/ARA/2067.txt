In my openion young people enjoy life more than older people do for several reasons .
I do agree with the statment because I have experienced life and I have seen it .

First , young people , children and kids do n't have any wories about any thing .
They do n't think of bills to pay or rents or what to eat or drink .
Their minds are full of imaginations for their little world .
For example , they have wild way of dressing up , like a prinsess or a solder .
They have a wild way of drawing , they draw their family not the best way or in a professinal way but in a way that make them feel happy and satisfied .

Another reason is , they like to have fun and be happy in all situations .
all they think of play , play play .
They can all day long if you leave them with toys and friends .
When they fight they do n't talk to each other for a minute or tow but after that they plat together like nothing happened .
Adultes however , do n't talk to the person that they are mad at for days , monther , and even years .
For example , my sister got into a fight with her best friend and did not speak to her friend for a very log time .
This caused their relationship to be broken untile this very day .

Finally , young people have young minds that are open to new thing and new ideas and learning .
Kids learn faster than an audalts can .
This show how they enjoy life and use it to make them happy almos in every situation of their lives .

In conclution , I believe that young people can and are enjoyiny life more than older people can .
You can see that through the exampels that I have described in this essay and also through experience of life .
I did not live my childhood life bacuse of many reasons that I will not discuss but I have learned to enjoy my life because I live it like a kid .
