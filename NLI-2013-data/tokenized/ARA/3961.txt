Young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
There are many agreements and disagreements with this statement .

Firstly , to agree with this statement , young people do not have time because they have their families to take care than the whole communities together .
Then , some of the young people do not know how to plan to help their communities .
Or maybe , some young people do not have enough money so this may affect time consuming .
So we may agree to thsi statement .

Secondly , to disagree with this statement , there are most people who have enough time to help .
Those people may create a group of people voluntered to do this job .
We call these kind of group of people '' an association '' .
This association do not make profit but they provide services .

In conclusion , I would rather disagree with this statement because I know that there are young people who have enough time to help .
