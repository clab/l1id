In facti agree with both of the statements , because i think that it 's an two adges statments .
In my oppenion i see that it important to make a relationship between understanding ideas and concepts with learning facts , because by understanding ideas and concepts , the idea will take an uneraseable part in the student mind so i think it an ecellent way to let the idea on mind , morover if ou add facts to the ideas , the ideas will have a stronger maening and impact ; example ; if the taecher gave the student an idea for example about wars and poletical broplems and add to this ideas some picture from the real world or facts and articals , the students will more able to understand the idea in the right way , and by this way they will have the opportunity to undrestand ideas and concepts also to learn facts .
