I definetly agree with this statement .
Most advertisement make products seem much bette than they really are .

People who do those advetisement , just do their job , in fact they must make the product seem far better than it 's , becquse of the concurence .
Indeed , now in our society , firms has to be the best , whatever the way they to be .
There to much choice whatever is the product you wnt to buy , for instance , there very big of shampoo , when you go to the super maket you can even not know what to buy .
And then advertisement has a very importante role .

An adevrtisement have to show that thr product that it 's presenting is the best one , and that you really need that one particulary .

Besides , people are very influencable by that , and that normal , if you don ' like an advertisement , you would not buy the product , because you will think it 's a bad one , even though in reality it 's much better than you think .

Well according to my own experience , advertisement really make products seem bettre , for example juste last week , I was about to buy a new perfum , I was thinking that it was good , and the bottle was very cute , and it was a very famous perfum , but in spite of all , wanted to taste , so I did , and it was simply a catastrophe .

What we should remerber , it 's that the advertisement is just business , it 's people who wants to make money , and as a result they do their best to present their products on the best way .
In conclusion , you should always taste before to believe .
