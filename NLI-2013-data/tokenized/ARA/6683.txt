In twenty years there will be more cars than there are today and these cars will be bought specially from the teenagers for several reasons .

First of all , nowadays teenagers need cars more than from twenty years old , because the teenagers are going to let their entertaiments be needs , for example having mobile was n't a need for a guy because it was only for business but nowadays it became a need for everyone and specially for the youth .
for that , we can see that with the progress of time , the youth will be asking more and more about needs and one of their main needs are the cars , because cars are so important for the teenagers and they use them for many usages .
for excample they like to go to the college in the car instead of go taxi or in a bus , than at night to go whenever they like without any limits to their wishes .

Second of all , cars companies are making nowadays small cars that have fewer consuming of fuel than the old cars , which is better economically and for the air pollution so when the number of cars increase , there is no big difference in polluting the air and specially if the cars companies sucess in saling cars that work on hydrogen .
so for who is asking about the air pollution we can say that the solution of that issue is found .

Third of all , in the progress of days , our world is becoming more and more a business world and everyperson woks nowadays .
although a person have a work with his studies so he need a cars

For that i do n't agree with the statment ..
