The world now is full cars .
Actually it is beleived that the number of cars now exceed the number of built houses .
So is this situation about to end at least in the next twenty years ?
In twenty years from now I do n't think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are now .
I beleive this is true for many reasons .

The First reason is that developing or obtaining any vehicle or tool replacing the car either in size or in price will require a long period of time actually much longer than twenty years , besides it will cost a lot of money so the replacing thing wo n't be cheap and most of the ordinary people wo n't be able to afford it so they 'll prefer to buy cars instead .

The Second reason behind my thought is that car prices are now decreasing , most of the people now have cars actually not only one car but many cars , For example , If I am in anybody 's place why would I replace a car that does'nt cost me a lot with another thing that is still new and will actually cost me a lot of money ?

The Third reason is that one of the main problems caused by cars nowdays is on it 's way to be solved within very few years .
This problem is the pollution caused by the consumption of the car fuel .
I 'm saying that beacuse research is being done now to find a replacement for fuel , that 's because we need a more cleaner replacement so as not to pollute the air , Also because the world is running out of fuel and the cost of searching for and extracting the remaining fuel is very high if compared to the cost of developing a replacement for fuel .
An example to support what I 'm saying is that recently a car was invented that works with heat energy .
Another one also was invented that works with water .

The reasons stated above were the reasons that made me think that in twenty years there wo n't be fewer cars than there are today .
