Does successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ?

Successful people try new things .
To be successful is to be the best and different .
If we are different that 's mean that we are always looking for new things , new ideas .
The world is always changing like as .
I think that the reason that make people successful is that they are always changing and having new things .

If this people are taking risks ?
Of corse they do !
But who cares !
Taking risks make as feeling in life .
Life become more exciting .
Successful people are not scarred to loose but they ca n't support doing always the same think .
Of corse they have to do well what they do but they are always lurning , and changing .

I really do not think that we can be successful with doing only what we know how to do well .
For me , I will called that '' stagnation '' and may be we can become successful for one periode but when the tendance will change if we are not able to try new things and change with the tendance we will not be able to keep our succes .

For exemple , for the scientist they need to do experience , try new things take risks to make some invention , or discover new medication .
Of corse they know how to do it well what they already know but to be on the top of the screen they have to find newest and greatest things .

So in Conclusion , we can tell that only doing what we already know how to do well is not part of the successful people .
For sure that will be a reason of the succes but not to keep it .
To keep the succes , we have to try new things and take risks .
