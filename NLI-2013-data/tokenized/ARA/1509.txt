I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
The academic subjects are very important to every body and we need to understand many academic subjects and try to apply it in our life to have good knowledge .
There are many academic subjects like nutrition and food sciences , chemistry , medicine , biology , pharmacology , histology and management which must be read about it and study it .

The cademic subjects will help us to understand our life and promote us to develop our life styles to the best way .
We have good chance in this time to reach many academic subjects by internet or library or any academic centres in the world ( universities or colleges ) .
If we take different academic subjects in this time we can focus on specific subject to be an expert in that subject and to take more experince .
Now , the world have fast changes which need different sciences to deal with it .
We need many people to take specific academic subjects to solve our problems in our life .
We need specific academic centres in many sciences .

Finally , Each person must be take many academic subjects and try to specified in specific subject .
