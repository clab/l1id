in my opinion .
i beleave it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn factslike speed and smoke .
for example when we talk about speed they must anderstand why it is dengures is beteer than if they have axcedant after that they learn .
second example like smoke hf they anderstand why it is dengeros and they bleave it is beteer than if they were sick or feel bad .
finally i beleave it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts it is for them to lern facts .
