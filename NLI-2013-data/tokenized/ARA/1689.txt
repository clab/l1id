I completley disagree with the statment presented in this section .
To posses any form of knowlege is an advantage for any individual .
However , stating that it is better to have broad knowledge in many subjects as opposed to specializing in one subject is a complete error .
There are many reasons which serve to justify this claim .
One , reason which serves as a contradiction to the claim presented in this writing section is if everyone had a `` broad knowledge in many subjects '' there would be no one to specialize in specific subjects and this would hinder any advancments in subjects that are not studied specifically .

The statement that having knowledge in one specific subject as being less beneficial then having knowledge in many subjects greatly contradicts the way our world operates today .
If in today 's world we did n't have people who mastered and speciffically looked into subjects where would we be in terms of advancment .
For example , when looking at an individual who specialilzes in computers , if they had just had knowledge in many academic subjects then how can we see any potential for improvments .
When an individual specializes in a field or subject they contribute to the advancments and discoveries , which in the long-run will benifet our society as a whole .
Another example which may be included to illustrate the contradiction of the statement presented in this section is if everyone `` only had a broad knowledge of many subjects '' then where would we be in the medecine field .
With an increase in diseases and viruses in today 's world it is necessary to specialize in specific subjects , that way we can improve the society we live in .

To have a broad knowledge in many subjects , and no specific knowledge in some subjects would be a disaster to mankind .
This is because you would have to picture a world with no technological , no medicene advancment and a world void of what our society needs to prosper and become a better place .
