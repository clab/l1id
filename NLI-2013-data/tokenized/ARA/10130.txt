I think it 's correct saying no one had to his goal without obestecals .
Any one want to reach to his goal must do many thing to win in your business and the life .
First , in the business life you will work hard for what you want to succsses for give must my time in it .
Also keep in your mind the risks are avialabe , maybe you will lose your money and you will be poor man or you will win alot of many .

Secanod , in the life every one hase his personality life and who want to be free for his life will resive many quastion from his family or from his freind .
They will aske him how you will compleat your life and with who .
This kind of peaple have expirance of how to deal with the life rather then other peaple who need some people to learn them how to live and how to deal with this hard condetions .
Peaple who want to be successful should know what they do and what they will take from them life maybe good things and that graet or bad things and from that shoud learn and understand from this hard life .
Every one should see what he do and learn also from other paople mistaks to fix this mistak in his live and learn other that proplems .
I t 's correct thing when you say Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .
