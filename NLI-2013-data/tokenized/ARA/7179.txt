I agree with the idea there will be less cars in twenty years than now for four reasons : oil prices increases , the devolepment of more thecnology , the more projects of citys ' street than now , and the unsafty of cars .
Maybe it is true that the prices of cars begins to decline , but that can not stop skip that cars will be fewer in the future .

The increase of oil prices has maken people feel dread about buying cars .
Because sometimes you have to pay more money in oil than the price of your car .
For example , my friend has pay one thousend dollars in his car and after three months he evaluated the oil he puts in his car and it was five thosund dollars .

Technology have make the usage of car unesecary .
for example , the microbus is cheaper than car , more saftely , and more comfortable .
you can buy for example a ticket for train for only one cent .
In japan , technology appered to be benefical for people than cars and that because in the train 's gates there is a map show you where are the location you want by pressing on it .

In twenty years , the cities will grow gradually to the point that cars used only in musems .
Because there will be more shops near from your house so you do not need a car for going to the shop you want .
