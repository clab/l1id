world is on developing , and every day scientists invente anew mation or car , and as we are living in this wide world we are using these new invevtions and will use what will be discovered later , so i disagree with the satement that says there will be fewer cars in the future for two reason , people need cars to move from one plase to another , and also i think that tows are geting gigger and wider even if these cars are poluting the environment .

my first reason is that cars are now a days like people 's legs they use car to go to there jobs , to go shopping or any where , moreover the weather is not always nice and sutable to walk so using cars with air condition is mor practical , for example i am living in emerits and the weather here is hot all the year so l ca n't wallk to reach my school everyday so i use the school bus everyday to reach my school .

the second reason of thinking that cars will be using in the futhur is that town are getting widder and bidder so it is hard not to use cars to reach your distiny in addition to that plains are expensive to use dayly for example when my father was working in a another town which was far way from our home towen so he usud airplans to go to his job every week it coast him alot in fact about of of his sallary .

in conclution i think people cant stop using there cars unless an another inventer invent something instead of the cars to help people moveng from on place to another .
