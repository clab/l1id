Succes is a commum goal of every one .
But the definition of success and a successful person differs a lot .
Some people think that succes is a logical and a natural consequence of a well done job , but others defend the idea that only people who dare could be successful .

In my own point of view , I am partially agree with the first statement .
In fact , to succed we do not need to be especially smart .
And the success of what we do depend rather on the occurancy and the perseverance of our trials than on our willengness to take risk or on our curiosity .

we have several examples of success stories of ordinary people that excelled in their traditional jobs and reach fame and wealth by offering their customers a usual products but with better quality .
And that relying on their own experience and know-how it means that their success was due to the fact of doing well what they already know how to do .

this point of view does not exclude the fact that a lot of people have knew success by taking risks or by tring new things , ways or methods : It is largely admitted that the dare , the courage and the curiosity of pioneers and scientists permitted to the humanity to make great steps in the way of prosperity and developpement .
Also discoveries and inventions will be impossible without a touch of imagination and risk .

In conclusion , I can say that a success is a sweet meal that needs , as ingredients , a bit of risk , a few of curiosity and a lot of know-how and a well done job .
