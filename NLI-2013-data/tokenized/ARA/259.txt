when it comes to the matter wether its better for students to understand concepts or learning facts I believe its more important for them to learn facts and its more is more convincing for several reasons .

the first reason I believe that why learning facts is better understanding facts and concepts because I think learning facts is more useful to students in their lives .
like when a students understand an idea or a concept it should n't be right or true or it might not be a good idea or a concept that will not be useful for him or her , on the other hand when they learn facts they can form their ideas about anything .

the second reason why I think learning facts is more important than understanding ideas , because i believe that facts can enourmosly develop the student 's character , the way he thinks about things around him and the way he talks .
like when a student are a part of discussion of a subject or any matter in life .
he surely can participate in the discussion with the facts that he learned , on the other hand understanding ideas wo n't do him any good in this area .

the third reason why I think learning facts is more important than understanding ideas because ideas might be more useful at later age but in the age of studets learning facts is more efficent and effective on them I also believe that facts are easier for students to comprehend .

for all these reasons above , I strongly suggest that students should be more interested in learning facts than understanding the ideas .
