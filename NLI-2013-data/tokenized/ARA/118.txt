No one can deny that the country needs alot of work and effort to become stronger .
so all the countries deppend in her people to become one of the best countries in the wold and that would not be until the all commmunity work hard to reach that .

So if we really want to become one of the best we should work hard ; and i mean by we ; all the people in the country young and old poeple because the county not only for one person it is forthe whole people in the community .

So about the question i think that i disagree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because i think that young people is the basec of the community and without young people there would be no community .

moreover , the community deppend most on the young generation becuase they have the effort and the ablity to work for a long time without complaning .
besides , the young people have the strong and the health to work in different places .

but nowadays there is alot of ald people who say that young people do not give enough time to helping the community and that is of course not corret because alot of young men nowadays can not find a job so they con not help there community .
but in the other hand nowadays there is alot of other young people who works hard and they are really interesting in there job so the give it there whole time and effort besides , the are creating alot of new things in the community that are very useful for nowaday and for the future .

So after all this things that the young people had made nobody can egnore there importance in the community .
