With technology , advertising products became much easier .
You can see advertisements in lots of places such as televisions , supermarkets , radios , and much more .
I think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First , with the technology available these days , it is very easy to make animations or make pictures better .
This technology has been used in making advertisments .
It changes the way people think about the quality of the product by making it much better than what it actually is .
This can be achieved by many ways , such as making the product attractive or by comparing it to other good brands .
Also , advertisements tend to be repeated alot , giving the public an impression that the product is something special to be repeated that much .
They will then go to the closest retail stores to buy the product just to find that the quality is not what they expected .
In addition , many different advertisements of the same product could be made .
Those advertisements could include famous stars such as actors or sport players .
This usually is intended for the younger audience , as they are most attracted to it .

In the end , advertising products attracts many people these days by making them belive the products are good .
I believe that in the future , people will be decieved to an extent that they will believe that the lowest quality products are the best of the line .
