`` The world will change '' this was what our teacher told us one day .
For my part , I think there will be fewer care in the twenty years than there are today for many reasons .

First I think that the sources of energy will decrease , especially oil .
So it will be hard to provide oil to cars .
Now the oil price is over 70 $ !
Unless if they discover new sources of energy .
In addition to prices of oil will get higher and higher .
People will have problems in getting gas for their cars .

Second thing , population of the world will increase .
So it will be hard to drive because of traffic , and it will a take long time to move from one place to another .
As most studies stated , and as many people immigrating from poor countries to the developed ones .

Third , discovering new means of transportation such as subways , or express trians will be a good reason that people will leave cars .
Because they are cheper , faster , and safer .
Also , Maybe there will be new `` generation '' of means of transportations as rockets .
Who knows ?

Forth , because of globaliztaion , i think , the prices in generall is increasing .
The prices of food or housing for example is getting higher and higher every day and the salaries is getting lower .
As a result of that , people will not be able to buy cars , or even to provide the things that cars need like oil or spear parts

I think the number of people using cars will be less than today .
But I hope that we will find new ways to move from one palce to another in a safe way that will no
