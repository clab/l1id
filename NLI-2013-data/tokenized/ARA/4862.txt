I disagree with the statement that say `` Most advertisments make there product seem much better than they really are. '' for many reasons .
One of the most simplest reasons but most effective resons is that false advertisement is illegal in most countrey 's , if not in all country 's .
So it 's not very inteligant for someone to lie about the quality of a product .
Another very logical reason is that all production companies ( no matter what the product is ) doesnt want the consumers to dislike the product , or be surprised to what the product turn out to be after have high aspactations to what it would be like , because the goal of an advertisement is to make people want ot buy the product , and be happy with haveing it .
If products arent as good as the advertisements say the are , the reaction of the buyers would be not to buy .
Which is the exact opposite of the goal of an advertivement , and that will cause the product to fail in the market .
If you ask people if they every had bought something that didnt meet the quality of its product , you will probibly find that most of the products accually meet to what was said in the advertisment .

And the key word in the statement is `` most '' .
So do most advertisement make products seem much better that what they really are ? !
I think not given the reasons above .
