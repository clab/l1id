Cars are verry inportent to a person , we use it for transpotatins , travilling and more , but it needs alot of moneyfor the petrole and inshorens and not forgeting the cost of the car its self .
There for i agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use .

Because of teqnology other replasments wich will provide a better service and sheaper cost will be invented or expanded .
For example before cars were invented people used to ride hourses and camls , as for the futer maybe jet-planes in the cise of car whold be invented .

Another reason for dicreasing the quantity of cars would be for saving the invironment from the poloted are causd by cars , espcially the ons that runs by desel , that is why those cind of cars are not allowd in serton countrys like Lebinon for example .

After twenty years i believe that evry thing will be provided at home , our work and things we need .
So no need for any body to get out of the house and go into their car and drive all the way to go to worl or to get somthing and go back home , because you can simpply pick up your phone or get on the internet and order what ever you wish .
As a resoult there will be no reason to buy a car is the first place .
After all , why go to something when that thing can come to you ?

At least I hope that fewer cars will be used after twnty years for the reasons i menshioned erlyer .
Because I believe that the world would be better of with less cars in the futer , because the invairoment will be less ploted , and we will get to save time by staing at home , and not driving the car around to go to places .
