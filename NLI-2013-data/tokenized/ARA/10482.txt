but you need to have limits if your a risk taker .

Let me tell you about my self am a risk taker and am definitly supproting people who take risks in there life why , because taking risk is one of the main reasons why people successed in there life but there are limits for taking risks .
If u want to study a major or a subject and you like and love this major you want to bulid your career on it but you heard that this major is very diffcult to take it and get a high grade , you take the major and you get your high grade .
Is this an example of taking a risk you know its hard but you go because you love it and because it desirves to take the risk for it .

See being a risk taker needs a special abilities of thinking and analyizing stuff .
if your not sure about something and you think that you ca n't do it you need to take the risk .
Taking a risk is linked to any person in this world who is successful in his or her life .

A stupied example of takeing a risk is if some one offers you to jump from the 99 floor and he or she will give you 1 billon $ now this is what i call is a stupid risk .
Something you know that there is a little bit of chance to get success on it than take the risk .
because sometimes in this life you need that courage and braveness .

Being a risk taker is one of the abilities and the quilies that any strong person has .
what i mean by strong person is the person who has the ability to control people like successful managers .
In my conclusion i prove for the reader that what makes any successful person is he need to have a little bit of that courge to take the risk and that any strong person that has strong personality is a risk taker .
