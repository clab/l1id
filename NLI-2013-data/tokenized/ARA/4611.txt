I do agree with that statment because an advertisement is all about baying a product what ever it is , so the advertiser has to show the positve aspects about the product and hide the negative aspects of it ending with an advertisement about a product that is much better than the product it self , not to mention that the advertiser is gets his pay check when the advertisment is really good and helps a lot selling that product .

first , the advertisor 's job is to help the murchent who is selling that product to enhance his selling rates and one of the methods to do that is to show the people all the positives and hide all the negatives of that product for example , when advertising for a car , the advertisor show the people who is that car beautiful and smooth looking and on the other hand she/he would hide a fact such as that car is a high gas consuming one .

another thing is that the advertisor has the motive to cheat and try to make a great advertisment out of any product even if it was not , because when the process of advertising function very well the advertisment bussiness will flourish and the advertiser will be able to ask for higher prices .

as a result of what has been said i think that the whole idea of advertising plus all the elements that interfear with the advertisment business ends up having an advertisment of a product that is really more than fair for that product .
