Cars number will be more in twenty years than today becuase populatoin of people get more and more increasingly , puplic transportation service is bad and convenience wo n't be available in that .

First of all , the human beings reproduction is increasing with the time all over the world .
So , it 's illogical to say that cars will be feweraccording to the real world because each single familly need its own car .
Furthermore , thesedays even young poeple possess cars unfortunately .

In addition , public transportatoin is not convenient as the new generation wants it to be .
it has many disadbantages such as : commitment becuase you should attend at certian time , inconvenience because you should be with forign people and this does'nt releave you especially wether you are aloof .
Public transportation has high costs , so it is much better to have your own car .

However , new cars have a very high technology .
wich attract people to buy cars more and more .
especially in the rich country the cars industry is very spread and distinctive .
although this element is not effective as well as the previos element , it is important in the western world .

In conclusion , we should go along with modernization and get satisfied with the advanced indusries .
What we need at present that goverments build more roads , streets and bridges to get ready to a near explusion of cars populations .
And expand the knowledge and awareness of good driving skills so that , we can make a very high model of real civilizations .
