I agree with this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Because media have a strong effect on people , and how much the product became a familiar to people it became better .

As we all know that advertisements is an essential step to make any product to be success .
It is also can be a misleading for people know nothing about products in market .
The advertisements is using a simple way to get simple people are not aware if that product are good enough for them or no , and as a result of worldwide media now and the expantion of it become more easy to get people in traps of these advertiesments .
As any company make good products or bad products all are seeking for binifits of these products .
But the difference that good comapines are affraid on thier respective , rather than other company produce less qaulity items for market .

If we take a soap product under consideration , and if we asume that there are two companies are producing such a material we call them X and Y respectivly with good product and bad product .
In the following situation we will see how that media will make the bad product of Y better than broduct of X. Company Y choose a international program that many of people like to watch it and they like to keep watching it continously .
They advirtise their product over and over for long time .
Which make people uncontionsly take on this product and being familiar with it .
So when people go to a market and want to buy a soap as our example .
The customers will find two products one is for X and the other for Y , and because the strong advirtisement of product Y the customer will choose the product Y. Even so product X is better than product Y the customer choose product Y .

So in my opinion how much the advertisements of a products were good and alot .
How much better the product will be better than reall is .
And here become the role of customer in seeking what really better not what he saw in TV .
