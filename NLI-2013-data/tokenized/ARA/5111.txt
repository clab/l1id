Is really everything you see in advertisments is better ?
its hard question to answer because ther are some products are really better than it shows in the advertisments and the others are do n't .

I disagree about the food 's product because they do n't care by the people at all , the important think for them is how to collect the money from people , but no body asks him selfe this quistion Is that really this food healthy ? .
no body from them asks How many one will suffring if they use this product .

Let me be more spacific and talk about kind of food which is the humberger .
We watch alot of advertisements about it , in TV , newspaper , magazine , and we hear them in the Radio station , but I never heard from those people explanation if the product is healthy or not .
Is the product helping peopl have a bad colestrol or not .
In fact the humberger increase the bad colestrol , and it couse alot of heart problems such as the hart attack .
Unfortuanatly , the government dos n't care .
they care only for colecting money from them , but the people it dos n't matter if they will go to the hill .

In the same time I agree there are a products show in advertisements helping the people .
For example the products helping the Handecab people , or any kind of product give a real advice to the people such as , the medicin product , of course we will ask our doctors abut it .
Also I disagree about the product became an a dengerous .
For example the advertisements call people to jump from over the mountain , or eat some insects like Fear Factor program , I know there is a warning in the program , but the people do like them exactly , and they got hurts .

So we need to be honest with our advertisement and with people .
