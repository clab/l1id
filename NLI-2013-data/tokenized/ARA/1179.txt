In my university , beside our specialization there are different subjects we must take in order to graduate .
For any freshman students , ofcourse he/she will complain about these non-related subjects .
But , when they finish their study they will realize the reasons why our university has done it , like I did .
I agree with the statements saying that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' for several reasons .

First of all , having a wide knowledge of many academic subjects would give ones the power of faceing any problems in the society later when ones garduate or even before .
Secondly , that knowledge would give ones a greate apprortunity to find the job he/she would like to be in not nessary linked to the academic specialization .
A computer engineering student , for example , attending different classes in designing and programming would give him/her better chance in finding a job than if he/she did not attend these classes .
Almost all job managers are looking for people with many different skills in different aspects of the life than an excellent computer engineer who does not know how to deal with customers or collegues .
Most importent reason , is that attending different classes with different people in each class means that ones will get to meet many people in his acadmic life .
This well help every student to gain more experience for future work life .
Learn how to deal with others is a very important skill , because all jobs are baised mainlly on dealing with the manager , dealing with teammates if ones is working in team project and so on .

In conclusion , I think all students should have wide knowledge of many academic subjects than sticking to only one subject even if they are not required to take different subject because it will help them a lot in their future lives .
