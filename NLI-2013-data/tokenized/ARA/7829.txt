I agree with the statement which tells that ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . '
Travelling with group is fun and having a leader make it much funner , because , usually , the leader is an expert in his area .
Travelling with a group led by a tour leader is better because you will be able to see more places , the tour will be well organized and you will not feel lonely and you will gain more informations .

Travelling with a leader give the treaveller a great opportunity to see all the tourism places .
The leader will be specialist in that and will know the best places to go .
For example , from my own experience , when i travelled first to london i knew hide park and nothing else .
On the other hand , the next trip was with my uncle and he was our leader and guided us .
He give me a chance to see the musuems , hide park - which i already have seen - , regent park and Big Ben .
It was amazing trip and much better than the first one .
For that reason , for the taveller to be with a leader make the trip much busier and let him or her see more places .

Also , having a leader saves the traveller more time and makes his or her trip much organized .
By travelling with a leader , the travellers will notice that he or she always refers to a schedule .
Every tour will be prepared before tavelling .
The times will be accurate and the whole period of the tour will be prepared to give the traveller an opportunity ti visit as much as possible of tourism places .
As a result , to travel with a leader makes the trip more organized and more rememberable .

When someone travels with a group which is leaded he or she will not feel lonely .
He or she will be most of the time with the group dicovering new places as it is scheduled .
Also , another benefit is that he or she will get more information .
Usually , with groups , which are leaded , the leader gives some brief information about every new place they visit .
That will let you as traveller to gain more knowledge .

In conclusion , to travel with a leaded group is much better than travelling alone for some reasons .
First , you will get better care , more organized trip and more knoweldge .
Also , that does not mean you will lose your privacy .
Certainly , you will have time to have a walk or go out walking .
