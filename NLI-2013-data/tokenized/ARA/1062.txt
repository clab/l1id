For me , it is better to have a specialize in one specific subject than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects because it is easier for normal human study one subject and spend his time on it .

People who prefare studying one languages sue do n't have time for that because there is many things in life take aolt of human 's time .
One reason that a human could have amny social prblems make him confused and not consetrating on his studying so it is better for him to study one subject .
Also studying one subject make human sucsessful in what he is studying .
For eaxample , if a person studied business administration and spend all his time and energy for it he will became amazing in his career and job .
If he had a little time he could take some courses of any thing he likes .

On the other hand , having broad knowledge it 's may be good to haver a well informations about many things in this life but i disagree to have many knowledge of many academic subjects because it is wasting for time espcially if the person has a familly and childrens , it would be difficult for him to take care of his family and his studying at the same time .
the family need time to spend with because it 's the main ting in this life and from the good family grow good peple .
But when one of the perents do n't have time for thier family that would reflect in a negative way at childrens .
So studying one subject would allow person to have time for his own life and take care of it .

So having one thing to study is better for the peaon him self also better for the country he live in .
I think having one subject to so study or not , well ..
that depends in person 's personality in his life and his scadule .
Each person has his own idea .
