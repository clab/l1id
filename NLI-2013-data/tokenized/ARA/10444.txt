Successful People who is doing Things

Do you know what is the best way to be successful when you doing things ?
My friend always tell me about doings new things such as in his house or his work or anything .
He likes to descover and he wants to make things differently .
In my opinion , I think make or do the things you know it already for make sure you will finish it and gain the time .

First , people want to finish the things what they have .
for example , If your boss gave you research , you should finish it , so you would work for paper with information that gave it to you or from work , so you will finish it because it would be easy for you to do it ; however , you would know the routin to do it .

Secound , people wikk gain the time .
For example , Like what I said above you know the routin , so you will finish it early or on time , but if you want to make new things maybe you will not finish it on time , so your boss will be angry .

Some people think you must do new things because you have to for make new different kinds to be the best and to be evolve .
However , it might be true , but maybe you spend a lot of time I mean `` Wast the time '' because if you did n't make it you will lost the things that you work on it .
for example , you will do newspaper .
If you did n't make it on time ( New form ) , you will be late to show the custmers and you will lose the custmers also .

All in all , The people who do the things what the know it already is better because make people sure to finish it and to gain the time .
I hope for people who want to make new things , they think and think more and more before do it if they will make it or no .
