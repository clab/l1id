Advertising is a major category and a fast-growing trade in today 's world .
It is a wide field that has managed to gain control of how we view everything around us , from politics to groceries .

We see advertisements everywhere ; on televisions , in magazines , in newspapers , on the streets , we even listen to them on the radio .
Adveritising has become a field of competition between companies , each company trying to present its product in a perfect picture to the consumer .
But is that product really as good as the commercial claims it to be ?

I agree with the statement , that most advertisements ( if not all ) make products seem much better than they really are .
For I have been a victim of such false commercials repeatedly .
I recall buying an expensive shampoo upon seeing its advertisement that promised and guaranteed longer hair in one month .
Of course , I did n't notice any difference to my hair growth rate , even after two months of usage .

I wonder why most companies ca n't release a product they are confident enough about , so they would n't need to add misleading information to their commercials .
I do n't think it 's fair to the consumer ( or to the consumer 's pocket ) to be fooled into buying something that does n't match the description he/she had in mind .

I think products should be professionally compared to their commercials before viewing them in the media .
That would , no doubt , decrease such misguiding advertisements .
But I guess that , over the years , one gathers experience , and eventually knows what to believe and what not to .
