Traveling in a group led by a tour guide is always my choice , if it 's possible .
As i experenced both types , traveling with or without a tour guide .
A tour guide has its importance especially in new or dangerous places .
Much to said about the tour guide , simply he or she makes many things more easier and also responsible for manythings that may be time consuming or tiring .
Let 's begin from the first , when a traveler arrives there .
Many world places have no clear maps or directions to get to the hotels .
This makes the traveler exposed to thieves and fraud .
If there is a tour guide , this problem does n't exist .
Also arranging the ransportation to the places of interest with good prices is always tiring and time consuming process .
A tour guide has the enough local experience to get the best for his or her group .
The best time to visit a place or to see something unique always does n't come by good luck but by good experience .
Local customes and traditions are usually hard to learn from books or magazines especially for people who comes from totally different cultures .
A tour guide is very helpful in this point .
Some tourists found themselves involved in legal conflicts or troubles with local residents because they simply do n't know the local habits or traditions .
A tour guide will not expose his or her group to dangers the strangers may not note easily .
While strangers go around in popular markets , they are a chance to some local sellers to sell them false or unworthy articles and this happens more frequentley .
A tour guide can be the advisor about buying local goods .
There is also a human side for accompaning a local tour guide , he or she is as abridge for the two cultures as he or she experience both from his or her natural living and job .
A tour guide can explain manythings that seem unsual , strange , or hard to hard to expalin .
