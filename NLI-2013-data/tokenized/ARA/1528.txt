Some people believe that it is important to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects while other people believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
In my opinion , having much broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one subject for two reasons .

Having broad knowledge has many advantages for people .
It gives people great experience in all fields .
By watching , listening and reading in all topics in life .
For instance , when anyone is interested in politics .
He may talk and argue with anybody in it .
Thus , it will let people have more conciousness about everything in their lives .
In addition , having general knowledge enables people to take right decisions .
Because the are not going to hesitate according to their knowledge .

Having general knowledge in all fields has disadvantages .
People are not specialized in one subject .
So , they are know only have partial infomation from all the subjects .
People may lose important information about any subject they have knowledge in .
Besides , if people are going to use any of these academic subjects they will not be able to use it in job .
Because they did not learn every single thing in this subject .

In conclusion , having a lot of knowledege in all academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
