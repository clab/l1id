Traveling to another city is good way to spind any vacation .
If i have to travel , i like to be in a group led , so there are three reasons why i like to travel in a group led The first reason is that a tour guide is going to help me to know about everything about any city .
Becaus he has the informtion about the city which i am going to go to it , i can ask him to give me anything i wan .
He will be helpful with me , and he answer about my question .
He like to aswer any question to me .

The second reason is that he will make a lot of thing to be the travel interesting to me .
For example he will put some activities like soccer football , swim , dance , and other activities .
If I like these activities , i will go with him next time .
I will tell my freinds , famlies , and everyone who i know .
It is good to go with someone who have a lot of activities .

THe third reason is that when i go with him , he will make everthing easy for me .
For example i do not have to be afraid for fodd .
Going to another city during the vacation is good for every people , and the will be relxing in the some city .
I know there are many reasons , but these are three reasons why i like to travel in a group le for me .
