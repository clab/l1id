Today , the advertisments are a popular and fast way to innunce about the new products .
However , there are some people who say that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
In my opinion , these people are wrong because of two reasons .

First , the companies pay a lot of money to make the advertisments .
Terefor , they are very concerned to show their products as they made them .
The companies ' managers know that when they make their products seem better than they really are , the customers will buy these products only one time and they will not buy them again .
As a result , the company will fail as people got a bad idea about it .
So to avoide this problem , the companies will not make products seem much better than they really are .

Second , why the good companies need to cheat their companies ?
there is no reason cause comany to cheat its customers .
Being cheater , that cause the company to lose its customers that it made the advertisment for them .

People who belive that advertisments make products seem much better than they really are say that these advertisments do that in order to attrct more customers .
However , these people should know that this way for commercials do not attract
