in my opinion i agree with statent .
there are no enough time for the young people to helping the communities .
first off all , the edecationat take the big part of this like if some body have atheraty no body look to hem .
secondly there are no body help the young people when they need it for example if some body need some mony to sport his project no body he can finde .

finaly , i beleave , the young people nowaday do not give enough time to helping their communities .
