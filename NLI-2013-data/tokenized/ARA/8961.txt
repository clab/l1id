yes i do agree because when student understands the idea he lives the moment in his mind he feels what is happing , he can imagine it he can belive in it but when he learns the fact he feels its just passing by his brain its coming from 1 ear and gettting out from another and its soon to be forgotten but when u understand you will have a moment with that idea and he can relive it when ever he wants and it will not be forgotten because he has a moment with that idea a history that would n't b easy to forget and he will be happy just knowing that he has all this knoweldge that he can relive it but when you learn the idea u just feel like its another dumb thing getting in and getting out , understanding is another thing understand is fun understanding is what live depends on .
when u understand u become a lagend , maybe an another albert anchistian it depends on your dreems and expections , living the moment i what live is about , belive me .
i 've tried it , i would love to understand things , but there is things in this life we can ' understand its above our abilities , we are not god or jesus we only humans when u do n't understand that does n't mean your stupid people come in diffrent shapes and abilites , but when u do n't understand anything in this life then that is what i call an abuse to life its self , life gave you this amazing gift its a called a brain try to pay life back with something nice like understanding liveing life it self , understanding is what life is about .

i would love to just sit down and understand all day long but like i told u we come in diffrent sizes and shapes .
understanding is a privlige and a gift u should benifit from it .
