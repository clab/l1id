I agree with this statement the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
there are alot of benfits some of the this benfit is to know the location , may be i have a qustions and he will tell me about good place .

First of all , the tour guide will tell me about all location and direction in the city in this case i will safe time and alot of money .
For instance , last summer i went to rome in italy with my family and we have a tour guide to help me and my family to now every thing about rome .

Second , whene i go any intresting place may be i have qustions for something and the tour guide will be answre me for any thing .
For example , two years ago i went to spain in barcelona city and i have a tour guide and we went together to wach a soccer mach in nokamp stadium and i ask a tour guide alt of qustions about this studiom what date is establish ?
and he answre me it was in 1877 .

Third , the tour guide will take me to good and nice places and he will help me to take a good picture with our friends .
For instance , many years a go i went to Paris with my frinds and we went to puitfull resturant it have a nice articul inside and me and all my friends we take alot of picture there .
after that we went to nice park it was so cute and pritty .
Also we take picture there .

Finally , my advice for all people they may be travel to another country to have a tour guide to help him in many ways .
For instance , may be he help him to delecius resturant or pretty park in the city .
Uther ways he will answre any diffcult qustions for any thing .
And he will make a good help to them .
