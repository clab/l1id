`` If you do not like to claim the montens , you will stay between the the holl and mad '' , avery well Arabic pronoun .
That means success on the live need to work very hard to obtian what you looking for , not only do what you always know .

This belive chang my live combletly , I had a good jub , wanderful appartment , nice car , and so many frienly relashenship .
however , I leave them and take riskes to travel to the USA and contunue my staduing seeking to admission to Master degree in Psychology chool .
I can stay in as ateacher in my home but I do not want to do the same thing every day .
Trerfore , I am sure , one day I will returen to my home to teach but this time not in high school .
It will be at the most famus univercity in my home which called King Fahad University .

I have brother who is teaching over than 13 years and he stell on the sate situation becouse he does not like to take risks .

finally , `` If you do what you always did , you always get what you always gote ''
