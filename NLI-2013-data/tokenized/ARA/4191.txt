Every one of the people around the world belong to a spicific community .
and he or she thus has different commitment towards his or her community .
we are parts of our community and can not detach from it or give it up .

all the three level of ages children , youngs , adults , and olds should help thier community as much as they can do .
when we take a certain stage like youngs , we can notice that they really do not give a lot or even enough time for serving their communities .
and i think this is arised from several reasons including that those youngs are only concerned with thier own pleasures and entertaintments .
in which they spent a lot of money to ride a new car or to buy a new expensive mobile phone or new cloths or to even gain a new pritty girlfriend .

Thier lifstyle is some what changed , they dont ever think of other inneed people to help them , or cleaning thier nighberhood , or fixing some broken public places or seats , or teaching childerin , or preventing some bad habits like smoking and taking drugs and drinking alcohols .
non of that could be done from them .

one of other reasons include that all the people inside the community are apart from each other .
in which parents do not teach , learn or arise thier childerin of loving other people and they arise them for being a speciall or unique persons .
persons who gain money and spent it on his or her self .

in conclusion these days are really hard on our community and we have to do something to solve this problems .
and that can only be done by increasing the education of loving our community .
and help any person who need that .
and every one who refuse must be punished .
