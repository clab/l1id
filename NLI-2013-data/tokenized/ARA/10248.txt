In away i do agree because its god to try new things and taks risks allso , but not to much it debase on the risk that you taken , and the thing that you will do .

for exampel , a man or women nows abuot mecanis and want to try electrecs no prablom its allmost in the same maiger , thets the way i can tell it ok to take the risk and its a new thing too .

But they shud n't take in baialogical or in speed rasing and they do n't now about rasing .
So thers is a lement for the risks that they well take becouse thre a lemit for the risk that they taken .
In another way i think ho want to do a new thing and take the risk should be a matuer person and nows what hes doing in the same time .

so he or she can make shuore that they are in the right plac , or they can get help from another people like people wheth experunes and , have the careg and , successful too .

So i think now you see the defrent in the two parts of being successful and try to do new things and take the risk in asafe way wheth help from experiens people and taking the risks in fare defrant way wheth out nowing what you are doing .

people ho think of being in the same thing of what they now are ether fraid of doing somthing new or fraid of taking the risk becouse they want to be cabted insaid like bing in him self becouse he or she thinks it will make him or here unsuccessful and they will lose the canfedanents thats in them .

In the end i think people shoul be more canfedanent in them selfs .
