At least I disagree with the statment saying : `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' .
To support this idea lets us explaine why it is important to specific in one subject .

For example , when the student enters to the university he should select one major and he should be specific in that major .
when the student graduted from the university he will get a job .
As we know that in most of the jobes everyone has specific assignment in specific field .
More than this , when you get the assignment , you should know all detailes which are related to the assignment .
If you are not specific in on major or you are taking brod knowledge you will not finish or you may face some difficulty to do the assignment .
As a result if that , to choose one major or to be specific in one subject is better that to have broad knowleg to understant whay the student should specifis in one major .

Another example to illistrate the idea of being specific in one fiels or in one subject is in the researching field .
For example , most of scintects are specify in one subject and no one can invent new things unless he specific in one subject .
Fore instantce , the scintects newoen was majoring in physic and he would not find his roles `` newten roles '' unless we was in the phisycs fild .
Another example in thr write brother , As we knoe they are specifc in aerospace engineering and they would not invent haw to flay until they are search and specify in the aerospace field .

As a concolusion to be specific in one fiels is very important that to be in others
