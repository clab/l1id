I totally agree that most advertisements often make products seem and sound better than the actually are .
There are meany reasons why adevertisements seem that way .
First , because those product makers want to target and attract the biggest amount of people , they will try their best to `` putify '' their products by using colore and mainly by using attracting words .
Mostly the will use words and expressins like `` 99 % Guranteed , '' and '' it will change your life '' .
One good example of a product the uses colorful attracting words if a beauty product called `` Aveeno '' .
On it written , `` recomended by dermatologiestes .
it will make , not it makes , your skin very soft , it will whiten it and will give you a beautiful skin for a life long . ''
My wife have been using this product for a preiode of few years and I never noticed any changes .

Asecond reason is that dvertisers use tricky and misleading words like `` help '' , and `` aim '' or 99.99 % , never 100 % .
By using these words , they make their product more convencing to the customers and consumers , especially hopeless people who tried other product , but did not get any positive results , will run after thrie products .
As an example , I have been complaining of teeth [ problems for few years and I tried different kinds of toothpaste .
I was attracted by one of those kinds called called `` Crest Senstivity '' .
I used this product for a long time , but my teeth never get better unti I was seen by a dentist who clarified to me that the use of a toothpaste may help in some xcases but not in all .
After he examined my teeth he said that I had a bad infection which can not be treated merely with any of the tooth paste brands .
Instead he said I need to have a clinic treatment at different sessions .
My visit to the dentist confirms that product advetisers use fake and misleading words which do not give enough information to the customers .

To conclude , in the field of advertisement and promotion , advertisers use colorful words and expressions , fake and misleading words and umproven facts just for the sake of attracting customers and consumers and selling the biggest amount and making more money .
