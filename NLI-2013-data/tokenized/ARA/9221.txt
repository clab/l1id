Ideas , concepts and facts are related , in a way but different in many things that we must consider .
Well if we looked at ideas and concepts it needs alot of effort for the students to learn them across the academic years it neads frome the student to understand the idea and creat a creative one .
Concepts somtimes needs to be expained , analize , use and memorize .
What i am trying to reach is that it needs alot of effort , help and time .

leaning facts can be fun and interesting .
For inctase we can know also facts from our experience in life , infact they are easy to know and learn , becouse there are many sources that we can learn facts from not only frombooks but also from programs in TV , internet , and also comics .

What i think is that it is important for the students to understand ideas and concepts becouse they are difficalt to lean by them selves while facts are easier to find , explore and understand .
Another thing is that the school will make it easier to learn ideas and concepts , becouse they are provided with capable teachers and competable students to learn whith .

Facts also must be understood by the students , but it is very easy to learn , so this is my opinion and my idea about it but at the end there must be facts icluded in the criculam , but not as much as the ideas and concepts .
