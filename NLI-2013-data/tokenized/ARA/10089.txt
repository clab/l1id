Success is really one of the most important issues for many people all over the world .
Some people tend to do what they already know to do well .
Others tend to try new things and take risks to do well .
Personally , I believe that trying new things and taking risks are really imortant in a person 's success .

On the other hand , there are those who belive that doing what one knows is better than doing what he does n't know .
They believe that it is saftey for a person to do what he knows , because he dose n't know what will happen if he tries something new .
The ARAB NEWS mentioned a survey last month about the people who tend to do what they know .
They made an interview with some of them .
They think that it is better to do what you know , because one does n't know what results will hapeen if they try something new .

In contrast , many people believe that changing is really important in people 's lives .
They have to take risks and try things that they did n't try before .
They cite research on achievement saying that most of the successful people tend to do things that they did n't used to do .
They can face the problem that they mau face in thier lives .
In addition , they can get what they want easilly .
So , they can deal with the life ' s hardships greatly .

In conclusion , success is really an important issue .
The plenty of people believe that one should try what de does n't try , because he may never taste the life if he dose n't face its difficulties .
So , they think that the right decision to do what one did n't try before .
Personally , I believe taht without trying one cannot taste the life .
