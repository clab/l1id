In order to be considered as one of successful people , you have to take risks in making decisions .
Because without these risky decisions that has been made by most of the great people thet wont be great .
But the problem is not in taking the risk , it depends on the when and how of taking it .
Some of risks that are taken does not affect the decision maker at all but he should take it any ways .

Taking risks is very important in business life .
Because it may make jump in peoples life in some decisons such as the stock market and the big deals aroud the world for huge business .
Or in banking , Bankers always take risks regrding their customer for bid and they stud the risk management sepratly as an indepndant subject like most univesities do in management schools .
Also , for political matters risks are very cretical spacially in wars beween cuntries such as the decision that Bush made regrading the war on Iraq .
Subsequently , If you take the risk with out any background or exparince you might be mistakin .

On medical wise , risks are diffirent .
They depnd on peoples lives .
For example , taking risk in medical operation is very sensitive and cretical that might kill or affect the patient .
But in this case the doctor and the patient should agree on .

I consider risk as part of every body 's life .
because even if you dont out it in cosideration you do it by default , with families , at work and between frieds .
Nawdays , risk for some people is a skill that they own and convey .
But being systamatic is no more seccussful in this world tha is full of comptetion and challeging thinghs .
and i highly recommend to study riskmanagemng if you work in a bussiness that needs ' .
And I think that the most known businessmen were taking risk that made them to sucseed in life .
