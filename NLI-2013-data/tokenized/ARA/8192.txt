i do strongly agree with folloing statment , i think it is very important for the students to fully understand the ideas and the concepts of the subject or the topic befor learning the facts .

i belives this way for several resones , first of all , learning the the concept of any topic will allow the student to learn the facts of this matter in many different way and memorize them in better way , for example in a mathmetical class , if the teacher starts giving the student a formulaes to solve some problems without explaning to them how we got the formulaes with approval , it would be very had for the students to learn the best ways of solving problems , eventhough somtimes students can get the answer right , but giving a fact without the maim concepts will not add to the students information .

another example why i think is good to know some of the concept about the topic befoer learnig the fact , it is more enjoyable to know the whole story 's concept befor you get to the end of it , for instance in you are taking a history class , it is more fun to go hear about many stories befor you get to some facts happen in the past history .

learning the ideas and the concepts of any subject will also improve any student wayes of thinking , it will devolope a wider imagenation and skills of thinking which helpe them in their real life .

in conclusion , students will enjoy , memorize , devolope the skillesof thier thinking and learn the material much more better by going through some of the idea and the concepts befor learning the fact .
