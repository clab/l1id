i disagree with that say that after twenty years there will be fewer of cars than today , which can be answered at once without even thinking of reasons and someone would say : how we are going to move ? .
and after thinking in the sentence , then all the thing and sircumstances around us doesnt agree with this sentence .

first , until now the most effective and cheapest way to move from a special place to one another is to use my own car , in which i will be the owner of my self , and i can go from any place to another in conveient and cheap way .
and if we think in a different way , like busses or trains , then i preffer using my own car to move rather than to use train or bus , especially in short movements , and because of beautiful things that are exist in cars those days , in which you can feel you are at home .

the second reason , is that the number of peaple using cars those days is increasing , and the need of cars is incresing , for example ; before 10 years there was only one car in my house , but now after we grow up , we need our own cars for me , a car for my mother , another for my sister .
and that is clear for not only my family , for a lot of families .
although , the demand of doing thing quickly ask us for more cars .

the final reason , as the oil exist , then we will have cars to move , especially , cars age now is 100 years , and the technology of prodction cars is now 100 years , so what can come in cars place and do what cars do with the same quality , the same luxury , the same performane with less problems .
although , is it possible to find peaple to deal with any new technology within 20 years ?

in a conclusion , i can say that its imposible to abanden cars if there is not anything better to take cars place , especially we didnt hear any reasercher come with anythin new to take cars place .
also , i think that the use of cars is incresing , and will continue incease .
