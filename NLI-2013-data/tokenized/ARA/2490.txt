Young people really do enjoy life more than other people because of alot of reasons and in this essay i will talk about them and try to explain more about it and i will talk about people 's opinion and my opinion mostly .

In my experiance about people and what they have told me is that older people do enjoy life more than young people do and that is because they understand the world more perfectly than when they were young and it is mostly true but there is other reason is that they enjoy the marritial life and developments when they are old , that is people 's opinion .

Personaly , my opinion is that young people enjoy life more than older people do because i like to think of it like the child has no fears and no ambitions yet and he got nothing to worry about exept playing and enjoying life , thats what i like about young people mostly .

Their is another reason why young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people dont worry about aging and they always think that they can do the impossible and they dont have the least bit of worryness on them or they dont feel anything about it and it is so good .

basicaly all life is enjoyable and fun but it is not all about life , their is family and more other things that need to come but enjoying life is them most important thing to do .
I agree to this statement and i recammend to pass it though other people to understand the meaning of this statement and to think about it very well .

That is all i could say for this statement and i think i have said alot of thing in it so enjoy life and enjoy reading it .
