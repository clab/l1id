Nowadays , young people and organizations are expected to support the communities in which live/are located in .
With life complexities and growing responsibilities , young people may not have sufficient time to help their communities .
While this may be true for some individuals , there is an increasing number of young people devoting their time to help their communities and other communities which need support .

I have observed young students sacrificing their summer holidays to help build houses and volunteer in poor African communities .
Yet have also observed other young people self involved in their day to day life not helping their community either because they do not care or they simply do not have the time as they have other priorities ( play with their friends , go to camp , etc . ) .

The broader issue is around education and what young people are being taught in the classroom and at home .
Many homes do not lead by example or embed the sence of community or sharing in the education of their children .
Hence young people not devotng any time in their communities .

There are indeed some young people who support their communities , however the support is not sufficient with the growing world problems we are seeing nowadays .
I therefore agree with the statement as not sufficient support is available .

Young people with energy can provide a lot of help to their communities by allocating very little time of their day .
For example , teaching a child of the community how to read or write , helping an old person with tasks they are not capable of doing , support in the building of a new school or hospital , etc .

Many people associate help with spending money , while that may sometimes be the case , helping ones community with ones personal time could be equally rewarding .
Helping ones community does not always have to be financial .
While in many cisrcustances , funding is an issue , many organization are not available to help fund communities in need , what is lacking is the human helping hand .

Seeing poverty in Africa and developing counties is an eye opener .
The number and size of the problems in the lives of these communities are horrifying and required help is not quantneeded in the world .
There will always be more problems in this continent than helping hand , however , we can start by increasing the help to our communities and do the best we can to improve the lives of the communities we live in .
