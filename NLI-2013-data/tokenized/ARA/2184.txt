I personally would n't agree with that statement for few reasons .
First of all , young people , sometimes , enjoy life in a very stupid way , not taking into account the results and sequenses , while older people usually have more wisodm that younger people .
It is hard to argue about this topic for a simple reason .
Since we have to consider different point of vews , `` enjoying life '' have so many different meanings .
For instance , a priest might be enjoying his life with no wife or children , stuck in his house and the church in what might be enjoyable for him .
Other people might be enjoying their life by addicting to drugs and smoking .
I might not seem vey right for me , But that 's the fun of life for other people .
So what I am trying to say here is that it is important and crucial to know and interpret what does enjoying life mean .
Another thing here is that we have to take the circumstances .
For example , if I am living in a country of people .
In the simplest case senario , Let 's see how people in different regoins on Earth are living .
I don not think that young people in poor countries of Africa or in Iraq are enjoying themselves ver much .
If we now compare those young people to older people living a better life , them I can assure you that those older people , having a better taste of life , are enjoying themsleves much more that young people .
I know that I was supposed to discuss the statement it self , but according to the information given , I could n't tell who is going to enjoy life more .
the statement does not tell the circumistances of people , so at the end I will ask you this question '' ; who is going to enjoy life more ?
Is it misrable young people or old peple riding fasny cars , living in million dollar houses ?
