There is no denying the fact that it is important for students to learn facts .
However , I personally think that understanding ideas and concepts is much better for me .
I can imagine that for some people facts are crucial in human life , but I think something else is better for me .

Facts are basic in the sense that they are stable matters and people can benefit from them .
To illustrate , history is full of facts that a major part of people in the globe benefited and will benefit from .
However , learning facts has some drawbacks .
For me , facts do not encorage students to use their creation or imagination and ability to agree or disagree with something .
Actually , there is no mental activities behind learning facts or expressing new capabilities that students are endowed with .

On the other hand , understanding ideas is much more crucial for me .
Understanding ideas makes me use my mind , imagination and mental capabilities .
Besides , it is an efficient way for student to talk and have a discussion based on an idea or concept .
For instance , students may talk about an idea by a writer like the Americcan Bernard Lewis in his book what went wrong ? .
They may for exemple tackle the idea of Islam and modernity or the difference between Jihad as a part of militancy and resistence and the concept of terrorism as a terrifying matter .
Another exemple could be the clash between civilisations and how people came to hate each other through politicians .
Furthermore , Bernard Lewisthe counterpart Edward Said with his book Orientalism conveys more tention between nations .
For me , students shouldknow about current and previous ideas and concepts to be able to be up to the level of the developments of events in the world .

As a conclusion , I really think that understanding ideas is better than learning facts .
Therefore , I agree with the statement that says It is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
