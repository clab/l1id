Our lives are affected by different factors .
One of the most important factors is the age , where there are some people who think that being young is better than being old and this what I am going to disscus in my essay .

There is a statment which said `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' and I agree with this statment becuse of many reasons .

First of all young people can enjoy their lives more becuse they still facing new things that they have not met yet and they still learning and having experienses , however old people had face lot of difficulties in life so they are tierd and sometime they might be pesimistic .

Another reason is that young people are active more than old people so they are able to do different activities that let them enjoy their time more than old people .

More over , the mental building of young and old people .
Where young people have differntn way of thinking and they take life as an easy thing and this might be a reason that let them enjoying their lives more than old people .

Also the physical part where old people do not have enough power to face everything .

An example might clariffy more why I am agree with this statment .
If there were to men one who is 18 years old and the other is 50 years old and they both were trying to have a new experience in their lives such as a sport activity of climbing mountines , so the 18 years old man can do this activity easily and he is adding something to his life and enjoy his time more than 50 years old man .
So as we can see from this simple example that the physical apperanse affect their time and activities .
But it does not mean that old people can not enjoy their time and have fun and this is because the best thing to do to enjoy your life is loving youe age and never think of it and take it as a number not as a problem or a fact .

Finally , I would like to say that even if I agree with this statment it does not mean that when I became older I am not going to enjoy my life and I would like to give advice for all people around the world that never take life as a problem and always see it as a piese of cacke .
