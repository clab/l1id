My teacher always gives us facts and information .
It 's difficult to learn and understand .
Once , i asked him about his way on teaching and i gave him my opinion about explaining the ideas to understand it .
He thanked me and changed his teaching way .
I am agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .

My reasons are listed below .
First of all , understanding ideas is help student to expand his knowledge .
If the student get only the facts without understanding , he will forget this fact fast with any useful .
Human has a brain to think and understand facts not just to learn it .

Moreover , we must give the student a chance to reach to the creative level .
Using the brain and understanding ideas madke the student eager to do creat something new .
If he understood how TV invented , he would thin to invent something new .

Finally , your teacher must help you to think and understand the ideas to do well at the exams and your life .
The information reas to you easily .
You can easily pass your exams and take a good experience .

All in all , understanding information expands my knowledge , makes me creative person and helps me to do very well in my life .
