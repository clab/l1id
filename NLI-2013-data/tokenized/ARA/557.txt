I most definitally disagree with the statement , due to the world we live on today .
the world today from my point of view is an ever colluding world .
In todays world there is a high and almost unreplenishable thirst for change .
Change as an engine need the feul of adaption .
this is only attainable by openmindedness and cameleon instinct .
Darwins evolution cycle seems to occillating into the positive infinity as the as the idea of what is desirable now is rather ephemeral and what is demended one day might be put on the head with a declaration of nuclear advancement in , lets say Indonesia .

We have time and time again seen the breathtaking speed with which global ideas are fished out of the chesspool of globalization .
As another siencetific descovery is made in japan or another oil refinery distroyed in Iaq so are also the thoughts of what is important changed .
Twenty years ago with the asian tigers rapid growth and the peg on the japanese yen , sewing and stiching were a must-master in taiwan .
Today taiwan is at the heals of silicon valley with the transnational corporation TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR .

There is a rapid wave of growth parallel to the arms-race in the cold year between the US and the USSR .
Today there is the sunami of the skill-race as we have seen with liest developed nations finding foot in the petroeum and natural gas industries .

Every one wants a piece of this cake , there is no shying back .
India has allready swallowed our presious american jobs at high-skill electronic-chip factories .
The american enterprise is not outsouring , to generate a higher GDP AND SAFETY for the american people .
The states must secure the middle east and if desirable the ever sino-influxed AFRICA .
In this era one must have a solid platform with as little as secular friction as possib , soas to be able to easily slide in and assist your texaco to assure the future of your country .
One must be openminded and at the same time conserved so as not to lose ones culture in this earthly swirl .
American students at Li Po Chun United World College in Hong Kong are struggling to keep up with the raceing pace of their Venezuelan counterparts in chinese lesons .
The race begins in the early years of life as rich sudanese oil/sheiks send their kids to school in Shanghai , to attain an education fit to collide with the red blanket covering African/oil fields .

The young generation , in which i myself born in 1988 , have a reserved spot , has to be as flexible as chain soas to stear away their beloved countries , if they-re not of blended descent , away from desaster .
One can not merely learn one trade .
The lawyer who only went to study NAFTA-bond law at Harvard will never reach as far as the swiss young man who decided to study international business law at Zurich Universtiy with a year abroad in Cairo .
Skills these days ciould be viewed as baseball-card , a great way for kids to leant the art of trading , negotiating and war .
Collect them all ! .

My mind is a sponge and I plan to learn four more langages fluently so as to be bale to compete in this cancer-paced wold with no vaccine .
