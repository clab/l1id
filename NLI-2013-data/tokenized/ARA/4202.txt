Humans like any othe living form on this planet live in populations that contain a larg number of ideviduals .
but the human community is carectarised by its organization in wich all members of this comunity partisipate in the bulding and structuring and protiction of thear community .
And a grate part of this depend on the on the strng and healthy members ( young people ) .
But in the real life we fined that the are the leest giving mey be because thear engaged in thear on activitys like studeing or sports or some sochal activities .
so I think yes they allmoset dont give any thing to thear communeteis .
so sumthig has to be dun about that .

I thin that the goverments have to put some regulations to controle thes by makin community sarvis an important rqurement for any healthy and good member by for the egsample regulating som law to make them work .
All so some benefets or rewordes have to be geven fore those active members .

In my community i partisipated an many activeteis like partisibating in awer daly nabarhood watch and some few activiteis an awer local school .
We have to have confedanse in the ugth and in ther ability to give and we as adults shuld suport them .
