Imagine a person in annual vacation in Rome and waking up at 7 o'clock in the morning .
This is what happen when the person travels with groups and usually the groups are more funny but they are much less comfortable because they visited less places , tight the person to a committment .

The groups usually visited less places eventhough they usually know more places but because there is a large number in groups and to manage them and take them in a tour or to guide it demands such a great effort .
But when the person is alone , he can goes indivisually , smoothly and simply from Point A to Point B andcan manage him self to visit where ever he want because the indivisual can tell if he got enough energy for a long tour among the old city or better for him to stay in the pool area relaxing , drinking and taning .

And also the groups always tight the tourist into a restrict scedule and committment .
When he sometimes the tourist is tired or out of his energy do n't ever try to miss the tour because it 's simply not repeated .
And for indivisuals it 's always a matter of mood .

finally it 's quite a difference between indivisuals and groups but i highly recommended for tourists to travel as indivisuals and enjoy the real tours and cruises .
