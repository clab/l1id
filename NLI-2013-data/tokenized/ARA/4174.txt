I agree , because young people nowadays are getting confusing from the interests in our life , and they give their full time to these kind of interests , video games , computer games and parties , etc i believe the devlopement of the techonology it has effeceted badly about the this generations , all these new technololy distract peoples from doing their job and study and helping their communiteies besides the time are running fastly these days .

Secondly , i believe that there is lak from the Universities and schools , that they should encourge the young peoples how to help their communites and countries , because if anyone explain and advise the students that they should be more concerned about their communities that would be usefel .

Thirdly , in the university in whatever major or what ever college , we are not getting free time to do anything since i am spending whole days preparing for projects and studying for exams , which caused us to feel that we are overloaded , this is how the university can effect about students ,

Nevertheless , i am sure that are many people who are helping their countries and tthat they should encourge the new generetion and the young peoples how much the comunity is meangfull to us , and to explain to them how to utilize their times to use to help our self and our country , times and that they should be helpers for their community
