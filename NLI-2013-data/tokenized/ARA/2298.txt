I have to agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
The Young people has good health , strong body and they are very active .

Young people has good health and they do n't need need to spend time in the hospital and taking midecin .
They enjoy their thim in many intersting things such as swimming , traval , football and so on .
On the other hand , the older people spend most of their time either in the hospital or taking midication for their illniss .
they do n't have much time for fun .

Young peole are strong .
they have strong body which help them to carry hevey things .
they can carry their cheldern and play with them .
they lift wight if the need to exercise .
but the older people are weak to carry hevey wight .
some of them are not be able to move his body .

Young people are very active .
They can work hard and making mony .
They can play sports .
However , the older people is not active .
They are very slow if they move from place to other .

In the end the live is short and if you are young enjoy your live .
