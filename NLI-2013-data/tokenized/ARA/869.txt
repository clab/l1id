Getting to know many academic subjects would be helpfull in life to know different things , but knowing one subjects is also a good thing .

The advantage of studying one major subject help you in applying in a job and concert your mind in one subject to get a very good mark in collage .
Example to make you understand more , if you want to work as an engineering for cars you would study physic and math topics , but if you studied in everything wonot help you because you wonot need all that knowledge in this specific work .

The disadvantage of studying one major subject , is that if you changed from engineering to pilot work your studies wonot help you in that section and you would go again study more in that section so that is the advantage of studying in more academic subjects , and if you open a supermarket and you donot have the knowledge in running business that would make your business fail .

In my opinion i would prefer to take study in many academic subjects so it would be helpful in managing your life , if you tried to change the way of life , but studying in many academic subjects will make you feel tired in our collage year but you would rest in the last , and having a good knowledge in everything that happens in your daily life .

plus in universities you my would take different types of subject that would variy in many .
