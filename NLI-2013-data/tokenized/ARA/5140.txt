Nowadays peolpe are using advertisments in many and different ways .
The huge companies main intresrt is to make an advertise for a certan product ; also the will hier experts in markiting just to give a good looking for the product .
However , these products could be as what they were advertised or could be totaly different .
I strongly agree with the statement that says that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The reason why I agree with this statement is because I dealed with many situations like that before .

First , I worked for two years in an advertisement company bake home .
It war really famous company and had a world wide name .
One day a maneger of a small company came to see the sall man in my company , and theay had a meeting later on .
In the meeting the maneger of the small company had a product with him , he showed it to the sale man and told him that this product is not working well and the number of people who are buying this product has decreased .
The man that was setting next to the maneger told him that this product will not go well becaused it has a really bad qeuality of materials and the maneger replyed to him '' do n't be worry , this advertisement company will increase the sell and the consumers will not notice the bad quality .
After two months from advertising for this product , it reaches a really high number of selling ; although it has a bad qeuality .

Second , I was wlaking ond day in the mall and a saw an advertisement for a cellphone .
It appered to me that the cellphone can work with really high qeuality in voice and signal .
Therefore , I bought the cellphone , but unfortenatily after two days the cellphone did not work with men and nothing happend as i saw in the advertisment .

In conclusion , an advertisement is a really great and helpful tool to sell any product .
On the other hand , it could be used in a good or a bad way .
However , some companies started to ubuse this helpful tool >
