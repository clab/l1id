Have you ever seen a depressed young person or a merry old man ?
Many of us would answer positively to this question .
I believe that enjoying life is not restricted to young people , though many of the joyful activities would certainly need enthusiasm and energy supposed to be abanduntly found at the younger age .

Through our life we face many happy incidents , as well as difficult moments that assist in formulating our attitude in life .
Still I strongly believe that enjoying life is a choice we make on our own .
All of us face moments of exhilirating happiness and others where we would be under the impression that we are living in a nightmare .
Unfortunately , such moments will not come evenly or suqeuentially , so as to get prepared .
That is , none of us can be happy or depressed all the time so better make a choice to enjoy life as it is , no matter your age is .

To substantiate the above said I will tell you the story of two of my dear relatives that unfortunately passed away last summer .
The story is about my dear uncle and aunt who were in their late seventies .
My aunt was divorced with very limited material resources to support her children , still she managed to bring up two young gentlemen and a beautiful lady and enjoyed her late days with her two grandsons , though her health was declining fast especially during her last days where she lost her eyesight .
Still she made a choice to enjoy living every moment of her life , I have never seen my aunt complain or grumble of her circumstances and in the end she died with dignity .

On the contrary , my uncle who was with ample financial resources , four sons and daughters and seven grandsons / grand aughters was complaining all the time .
Unlike my aunt he never remembered any of his achievements in life , he would always see what was missing and start blaming circumstances or his sons and daughters .
In the end he died so upset after having a big quarrel with one of his sons .
What a waste !
But it was his choice .

In brief , enjoying life has nothing to do with age , it is a choice we make .
A choice to make to get to know how to get the utmost happiness of the blessings God bestow on us and live peacefully with life 's inevitable hardships .
