in my opinion i disagree with the statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. '' the reasons for why i do not support that statement are written below .

firstly , when a person does a job for a long time and repeats the activities of his or her work over and over again , they become specialized in the work that they execute on a daily bases and this suggests that the person doing the job is best suited for it and that also means that that person does not have to worry about being unemployed any time soon whearas when a person decides to take on a task that he or she knows nothing about , this means that they are unsure of what they are good at and that they live their lives by the moment which is not a smart decision for anyone .

also when a person is firmiliar with their work , new ways on how to preform a task are developed and this saves time for the person doing the job , and also increases productivity which in turn increases profits the buisness makes , but if a person keeps on jumping from job to job and not getting himself firmiliar with any one job , this will most probably end in a buisness losing profits because the work was not done by a professional .
so many people in the world today take risks in the jobs they do but it is a known fact that only a few of them ever prevail and achieve their dreams .

so finally , i would like to end this essay by saying that eventhough taking risks can sometimes turn out good for a person we should not think that we will be lucky enough to have such goos fortune and instead we should work on the things we know best inorder to succeed in this life .
