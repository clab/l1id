The ideas and concepts came from the facts .
I somewhat agree with this idea that is important to students understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .
In my life I use to work on both of them .
I understand the ideas and concepts .
However , I learn facts from many stories .
To understand the ideas we have to think and discuess the ideas that have many types .
For example , it is easy to anyone of us to make ideas about anything , but on other hand it is diffcult to him to make facts .
The facts are learned and existed in our life by the past experience and intentions .
But the question , that is always occuring to us , how do we make idea and how can the idea be fact ?

Many students and professors have a great talent to make an idea .
I remember when I was undergraduate student , I spent two hours with my professor in the university to discuess the idea that my professor gave our class .
Two hours I spent to understand what is his idea focus on ?
And what is the goals from the idea ?
The idea was about business soluations to encourage the private companies to invest their money in our city .
It is provided many aspects and aims .
According to the example , I like to understand that I am interesting to know more about , but sometimes I do n't care about some ideas that do n't make sense .
I use to convert the idea to fact by looking on the internet for facts about thing that has related to idea .

In conclison , students are different some of them like to learn t but others like to understand the ideas .
We learn from facts that is sure .
and we learn from our mistakes .
But the idea should be understoo
