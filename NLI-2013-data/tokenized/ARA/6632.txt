Fewer cars in 20 years ??

As technological imporvement is taking over the cars industries nowadays , cost of owning a car is decreasing rapidly now cars are not made for the rich and famous only , any capable person will be able to own his own car .

Distances and the revolution if time and the quick need to move from one area to another is encouraging people to get cars or any other automobile .

The car manufacturer is presntly trying their best to please the consumers wants by giving him all the facilities for the least price possible , so that is an up push toward increasing the number of cars currently found on the streets of our country and land .

Cars have become an obssesion for money makers and wealthy people in which they compette in owning the best looking car and having the fastest car and the most expensive car and some compete in have the oldest car and the most preserved car , and that doesnt ensure the decrease in the number of cars it actually highlights the fact that thye number is increasing since the personal wealth and desposable income of individuals in rapidly increasing and the new generations love for cars and the uncontrolled car manufacturing is increasing daily .

i cant see a world 20 years from now which owns less cars than we do right now , what i see is a world that owns more cars than ever before .
now adays when you turn 18 the first thing we do is get our driving liscence and a time after that we go looking for a car to own , and within a period of time each family memeber owns a car and that is creating alot of traffic jams and an unbelievable increase in number of cars found on the streets .

It is somehow impossible to have fewer cars in 20 years than the current time .
