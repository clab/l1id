When you have a mastercard in the dessert will it be usefull for you while you want water to survive ?
This is the way who ideas and concepts work .
In real live you will act naturally as you are and as you know without refeering to the math or the physics .
You will drink water without thinking that it is compind of hydrogen and oxygen .
So , learnning the facts is more imprtant than understanding the concepts because in real life you will use the facts easier , and you can do it naturally without wasting time in thinking while there is no time .

First of all , in our life when we face something we cope with it easier with facts which includes an expieriance from father or brother or even from TV .
However , when you want to do something you will not bring your calculator and your pincel and think about it .
For example , when you sit with your grandmother you know it just want someone to sit with her and hear she talking about boring thing , but as you do n't show that you are not bored as your grandmother will love you more .

Second , we act as a human , and this does n't mean that we don 'd use our hids .
When you had a puncture you will rise your foots and try to control the car .
You did n't know that from safety program , but you learn it by using human sense , and this is the most important thing that we have , so we should use it .

Finally , our backgrounds about something and our natural behaviore are very usefull things .
On the other hand , we should not think that the concepts are n't important , but they are not important as the facts are , and as I have said you will not bring your notebook and your calculator to solve everything , and sometime you do n't have the time to think as while you have a puncture .
