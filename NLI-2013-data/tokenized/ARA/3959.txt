In this writting , I am going to discuss an important issue that most of communities faced .
The issue is that `` Young people nowaday do not give enough time to helping their communitiea '' .

This problem occure from different reasons .
One strong reson of this problem is that the new developement of technology that take young people time .
For example the internet which recover the essential things of a young people and satisfying their needs as young people always concern of how I can happy .
Most of young people feel happy with their friend as the internet provide them to be with their friends all the time by using the massenger .
Another point is that as we hear in Qatar , the education develope alot .
The result of this development the Albayan complex school and the independence schools which depend mostly on English languge .
To study the English languge in some subjects create some coflict in young people as they do not used to take .
This may encourage them to work hard and take English languge courses to improve themselves in English and cope with the development .
These take time , so it will not enable young people to be effective and helpful in the community .

Finally , young people noeaday do not give enough time to helping their communties , because of the pressurs of development and how I can satisfy myselt and be the best .
