First of all i would like to agree strongly with the statment , because i am working as a lectuter at the faculty of education , and as you see this statment match my work closely , and due to my practical experince with the students i conclude that the human brain is composed of two main parts , one is responsible for the logic , and the other for the memory , and i also found that it is better to the students to learn how to think rather than how to remeber , in another meaning it is better to the students to understanding ideas and concepts rather than to learn solid facts as it is for the followig reasons :

1 - If we used to drive a solid facts to the student and make them remeber it during the exam , we make the do not use the logic part in thier brain as i mentioned befor , and that is lead to make them lazy to reach to any knoweledge alone without the help of the teachers .

2 - Also the students who learned solid facts have n't the ability to solve any problrem out side the facts he learned , and that action kills the creativity inside them .

3 - But on the other hand , if we trained the students to thinking and to understanding ideas and concepts , we can improve the creation of thses students and make them reach to the meaning of the facts by themselves .

4 - Understanding ideas and concepts also help in the enhancing the two way communication between the students and rge teacher , becaause , as you now , there is a common role say that ( TO UNDERSTAND YOU MUST TO ASK ) , and as aresult when you ask your two way communication skills improved .

Finaly i would like to mention that using the system of ynderstanding ideas and concepts will emerge a creative students , which after graduation they expected to be a good teachers having the ability to communicate good with their studens , and and also they expected to be a brightfull persons in their community .
