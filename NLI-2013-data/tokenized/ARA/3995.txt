Communities , nowadays , need for help more than any time before , especialy from their youngmen .
I think that youngs should prepare enough time to build up their societies , otherwise , they will not go ahead .

There are no doubts that youngs should grab their communities hand to move ahead , or they will collapse infront of their eyes .
When you switch the pages of the history , you will see many examples of great nations that plunged because of the egnoreness of their young people .
The Greek , for example , reached at one time to a high place that no one else reached before , but it collapsed suddenly , why ???
because their youngs do not give their nation enough time to build and to help .

Young people , recently , are completely different from the youngs from the previous times .
Maybe they are differ on ways of thinking or on ways of acting against situations .
I am not saying that they are better than them but I am pointing that the more resposible the youngs are , the more powerful their nations will get .

Once a wiseman said `` The society is for the person and the person is for the society '' ,,, what did that mean ??
It meant that when a person is fully resposible to his community and he is ready to give his soul to her , his community will be ready to him and she will rise and rise .
The more powerful the country are , the more powerfull their nations are .

Finally , I think that what young people is saying about not having enough time to give for their nations is nonsense , because the time is always here but the will and care are not here .
