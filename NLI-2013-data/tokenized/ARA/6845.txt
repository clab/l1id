`` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ''

While reading the statement saying `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' , each person can have their own opinion .
Personally i disagree with that statement .
I will show my point of view in his essay .

After witnessing the huge evolution of transportation and communication , we are nowadays very much concerned about the environemental problems that are caused by this evolution .
However , people ca n't stop using transportation methods though it destroys the environement .

For the past twenty years , we have seen that the number of cars in use is increasing .
In fact nowadays it has become an essential part of our lives .

Twenty years ago , each family had a car , whereas nowadays each member of the family has his own car , which did n't only increse the environemantal probems but we are also facing a huge number of car accidents which , most of the time can lead to death .

On another hand , cars are being used nowadays to travel .
Many people think that cars are saffer than airplanes .
And sometimes cars could be used to take big or heavy things when airplanes ca n't handle the weight .

People today are very attached to their cars .
In fact , people can personalise their cars , by the color , the car model , the seats ...
It became part of our identity .

People are more and more attached to their cars , and that 's why i do n't see how in twenty years there could be fewer cars in use than there are today .

I personally disagree with this statement because i think that cars became part of our lives .
If we come to think about it , we all use the car on a daily basis , at least once a day ..

The only way to have fewer cars in use in the next twent years is having an evention that would replace the car , which ca n't really be made in a short period of twenty years .
