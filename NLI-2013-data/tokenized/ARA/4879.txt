I think that most advertisements make products seems much better than they really are .
They do make lots of goods more appealing , and colorful or handy .
The truth reveals when you buy it and us it .

Although advertisement is imprtant to a new products in the market , to show people a new line of food , computers or services .
It does not require to run the advertisement too many times a day .

I think that any good relaiable goods and services will eventualy control the market , regardless of how many times other products would run their advertisements because they will fail in the selling process as long as they are not as good .

When I want to buy a computer , for example , I think first of Dell , although there are lots of other popular brands which they have lots of advertisements that run several times on several TV chanals and even on the newspapers .
I still like Dells ' computer .

I guess lerning from personal experiance is way more valiable than all the nice things you see and hear about a products in an advertisements .

Another example of service .
When it comes to a TV cable I like Direct TV , .
This also because of a personal experiance .
The service that I had before was not relaiable and nothing even close to what they advertise .
You could never talk to a person when you call them after having a problem .
Which happened to occure too many times .
Like losing the singnal .

Aside from that .
I had always woundered how much these people ( producers ) are making to be able to afford these expensive advertisements .
Because this tells me that the products would really be much cheaper if they have not wasted lots of money on these advertisements .
Although the role of advertisements is very important , it mostly has been over used .
for example , in the city where I live I keep seeing this advertisement on TV that talks about how wounderful this chain of resturants are .
The funny part is , this chain of resturants is not existed in the state where I live .
Total wast of money , unless they expect from me to travel to other state to have a dinner .
