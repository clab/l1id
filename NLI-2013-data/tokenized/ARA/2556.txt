I dont agree that young people enjoy life more than older people .
Enjoyment and happieness doesnt stop at defenite age .
It depend on many other factors which are more important than the age .
It is not nescessary that young people enjoy their lives more than the older people for many reasons .

We can find many old people who enjoy thier lives by different ways for example , if we will see the travellers to any country , we can find that lots of travellers rare not young people .
On other hand , there are many young people who dont enjoy their lives as old people .
So enjoyment mainly depends on the person himself so if he / she someone who like to enjoy his life and has many interesting things to do in his / her life , nothing can prevent that to occurs even if the person was old .
Some old people live their lives as young people and some young people live thier lives as old people for example , there are some youngs who dont enjoy thier times and dont like advantures or to try new things they seem to be as complex people .
On other hand Some old people they like to enjoy thier lives so they do any thing make them happy so when you meet them you think that you meet young people not old ones !

Some people think that young people enjoy life more than others because the period of their life is the most exciting time and full of playing and new experiences because young people like to try any thing new but certainly this is wrong opinion because old people also have their methods and ways that make them enjoy their lives for example : marriage , money , travel , friends , ...
etc .

So the life is Enjoya
