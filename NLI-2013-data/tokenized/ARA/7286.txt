Thus , the travel with tour guide orginse your time to have a chance to see these place .
In addintion , to save your time for how to go to this place without losing your direction or your time .
Otherwise to get the apportiunty to meet differeant people from differnt counties in the group .

Second , the money is very important to for you .
if you want to go with your fimely or alone .
