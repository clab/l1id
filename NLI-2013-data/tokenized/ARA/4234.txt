Selfishness is probably inner in the human-kind .
But as humans started to live in community , they learnt to share their commons , space and time with each other .
With the appearence of the industrial revolution and theories and ideas like the capitalism , people tended to come back to a kind of primary form of selfishness .
This is not a condamnation of the capitalism , it 's the way it had been used for a while , especially by young people .

During a certain period of time , the early twenties for example , young people used to think , and people around them used to make them think , that because they were young , they got their lives to live in integrity in a selfish way and that the whole world belongs to them , they just have to live .
This way of life appeared especially in rich countries .
It does'nt mean that poor countries did n't know this way of life , they did , but later .

Some decades later , young people started to feel that even if it 's ok for them , even if they have every thing they ask for , it was n't enough to get a balanced , healthy life .

Young people nowadays , and at the contrary of the last generation , know that , to make your life better , you need to share your time , your money and your love with the others , that they need to make people around them happy to be happy .

So people who say that young people do not give enough to help their communities , are very far of the truth .
In all the wars , earthquacks , tornadoes , ...
and all the catastrophies that our planet lived and still live during the last century , nobody is giving away , sacrifying lives , money and time such as young people are doing .
Of course they are always irresponsible young people around the world , but the universal tendance today is for sharing everything .
