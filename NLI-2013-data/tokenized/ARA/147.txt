I agree that most advertisements made products seem much better than they realy are for many reasons .
First , they made a style that acceptable from customurs by puting thier products in a good shap to attract people to buy it .
For example , I will buy any product if it is not having a good shape .
Also , the must know what people love in thier product and do that so they can write that thier product contain some materials which dose n't exist .
For instance , I love natural materials in my product not chemical one so they write on thier product that it contains only natural product and that is not true .
Besids , most advertisements love to gain much money even if thier product would n't allow them to .
They get a cheap material for thier product and says it had good ones to gain more money .
For example , I used to buy a product for my child and suddenly he fall illness so the doctor do not allow me to this product for him again .
In sum every things know a day is not as good as it appears .
