I agree that travelling with a group which is led by a tour guide is the best way for many reasons such as : the tour guide knows many places than we do , gives us more information about what we are visiting , safes our money as well .

First , i prefer to travel with a group and which is guided by a tour guy because this going to give me a chance to know as much places i can know .
Also , the tour guide knows what are the best places we are visiting more than we do .
However , travelling individually make the trip more flexiable .

The second reason why i prefer to travel in a group is that the tour guide tries to provide us with more information about places we are going to visit with .
In addition , the tour guide knows that our time is valuable and we do not have that much time to waste in our things .
This is what makes travelling with a group enjoyable .

Third , travelling with in a group safes our money and the cost of this trip does down .
For example , i have travelled many time by my self for a ten days to Egypt and i have spent more money than my family did when they visited Egypt with a group guide .
For this reason , i have become to an idea which is travelling with a group is cheaper than by myself .

Finally , i encourge people to travel with a group for these reasons .
And , travelling in a group going to make the trip less costly for them .
