Although some people may think an advertised product is really typical to its form in the advertisements , I believe that products look much better in advertisements than they do in reality .

My opinion is based on several experiences and examples .
First , it is a known fact that all advertisers tend to show their product as the best in the market , a tendency that is increased by the increased competition among producers .
So , any producer will only show the advantages of his product and disregard its disadvantages .
For example , an advertisement for a certain product will only show people who were satisfied with the product , and allow them to give a lengthy explanation of how the product changed their lives , even though the product may have no impact on a person 's life at all , such as dog food , and in many cases the person talking in the advertisement has not even seen the product .

An important point to consider when watching an advertisement is the size of a product , which is , not surprisingly , larger in the advertisement than it really is .
So , a burger sandwich could be nearly as large as a pizza , and similarly , a piece of furniture , such as a table or a chair or a desk can be misleadingly large in an advertisement .
Another example is shampoo .
An advertisement for shampoo will show girls with silky hair , giving the impression that this particular brand of shampoo will make the curliest hair more nourished and healthy .

Another technique that misleads the customers in an advertisement is to show people , and in some cases celebrities , using the product and having a great time , which gives the consumer the impression that buying the proct will make him feel happier .
Since we are all searching for happiness , many people may be encouraged to buy the product .

Personally , I have had several disappointing experiences with advertisements .
I have bought bags , clothes and even furniture after watching misleading advertisements on tv and reading great customer reviews for products on the internet , which turn out to be much less satisfying than they are portrayed .
I have to admit that some of the products were good , but still not as good as they appeared in the advertisements .
The problem associated with the fact that products may sometimes seem better in advertisements than they really are is exacerbated by the use of the internet for shopping , where the consumer buys a product without actually seeing it .
Still , advertisements are interesting and do provide important information about products , we just have to learn to think before we buy .
