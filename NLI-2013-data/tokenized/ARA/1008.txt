Academic knoweledge is very important to each individual in our days in the society .
Social life oblidge us to talk fluently in any academic subject that triggers our knowledge to oversee reality and facts .
On the other hand it advocates our personality with ideas and opinions toward a certain issue .

However , being specific tells us that we are limited in our rational thinking and concentrating .
Academic means we should face people from differrent countries and cultures under a group working .
This group working is the reason why people are triggered to understand different traditions and behaivors .
For example , beliefs are good to discuss about .

Being inhanced in the academic subjects gives a great personality to the individual that which attract people to take a role in this subject .
Also , it help us to understand things that is related in real life in participating with other people and improving our virsues inorder to deal with others as we are dealt .
Alike specific subjects , the academic ones requires a high level of informations to solve academis problems and this comes from the experience of a person 's deplomate manners and the desent outer looking .

As a conclusion , in my opinion , I agree with academic subjects it illustrate our existance in life .
Teaches us how to deal with people from all human kinds .
Though , it grows in humanity to work together and help eachothers to abolish bad sins .
