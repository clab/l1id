A graet man said before in a long time ago `` the small ones are the once who rise the city up or take it down '' .
His words were right because that was the truth .

Nowadays kids refuse to help others and they wo n't give enough time and effort to help thier community .
I think that this is a great big fact .
So , I agree with the statment for two resones .

First , nowaday teenagers do n't do what they are supposed to do and they do n't carry the responsibility of thier behaviors .
They always act sush as babies and never care about any thing exept if they will have something as an effort if they took care about that thing .
That 's a bad acting and wo n't help them even when they grow up because that effects thier community .
In this way , thier children will act the same way and there wo n't be any exampels of cooporation .

Another thing is that the young people are more active and have more potinsules , so they can effored more than the older ones and they truly can rise their community by helping it and taking with it hand .
And so , every one can live in a nice , loving and cooporatoinal sosiaty .

In the end , I would refear that young poeple should do thier jobs and help their community to rise and be better .
