I agress with the statment made here .
Advertisment are a tool that businesses use to promote a product .
It is ofcourse quite obviuos then that they will only show the positive side of a product in an an attempt to get a customer to buy it .
It is not in their best interest to be honest .
Businesses live by the fact that they are legally allowed to lie .
Any advertisment has the purpose of selling .
If business were truthfull about what they were selling product sales would decrease significantly .

Lets take for example ciggeratte advertisments .
Ciggerates are bad for your health .
In todays world you will not find anyone to argue with this statment and be able prove their oppinion .
So how do you advertise for a product like ciggerates ?
How do you convince people to buy something that kills them ?
Clearly ciggerate manufacturers have thought about this greatly and have come up with the best answer .

Psychology .
Advertisments capitilise on human psychology understandings .
An honest ciggerate commercial would cause people to avoid the product .
So therfore Advertisers learn about human psychology and how to attract people to something they know is bad .
They highlight the package that comes with smoking rather than the ciggerate itself .
There is'nt a ciggerate commerical out there that convinces you to buy their product because of its taste or its feel .
They get you buy it by showing you the social and status rewards of smoking their brand .
Like Davidoff and its elegance .

So when people see advertisments they sometimes remember only its social effects rather than the product itself .
To me thats how advertisments can make a product seem better than it acutally is .
