From the first glance more people sees that cars help people to achieve their goals faster and more safe than any land means of transportation .
Cars save in time , go to the goals quickly and return to home quickly , and if the man has a sudden event happened at deep night he can take a quick decision to go some where rapidly to solve the problem .

Now aday there a huge numbers of cars for all the purposes mentioned above but on the other hand cars are the source of pollution and source of paying alot of money .

So , cars have advantages and disadvantages but with the progress happened in the world and the high technology in the field of IT , Communications and Transportations make people if they anything they call by phone or send by email to ask their needs either they need to buy goods or to acheive a service .

An Example :
For Man :
If someone wants to know his account in bank so he will enter via the internet and go through the web site of the bank and enter with his account from his office or home and makes all trnsiactions he wants to do .

For Housewife :
If sher want to buy any anything from the supermarket , She will call buy phone so her movement outside the home will become less .
For Student :
In the summer vacation and the student wants to know his result or grades , he will know the result from his home via internet .
and so on so the need of cars will be less than before .

Also , Enhancement on the means of transportation and the suitable price of their tickets make people do n't want to buy cars and using the trains and buses more than cars .

So , In my opinion , I see that these factors which are
- Progress in the world in IT and communication fields
- Enhancement in the other means of transportation like trains and buses and they become more comfortable and safe. make the no.of cars
- Suitable price of tickets either for buses or trains .
At the end , I am agree with statement which said that the number of cars will reduce in the next twenty than todays
