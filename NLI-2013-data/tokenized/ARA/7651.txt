Travelling is a very nice thing to do , for me I love travelling and I did travel alot .
There is actully a diffrent idia for travelling ether you travel with a group led by a toer guide or travel by your self .

For me i prefare travelling by my self becouse i ca n't make a commetment with a group that i do n't know .
I love to have my own space in the city i go to .
I might need a guide for the city , but I usualy take all the information I need from the reception at the hotel and I just go everywhere I like by my self or with friends but not with a group or guide .

forthermore , I can combine between having fun of travelling and relaxing at the same time , Yet when u commet with a groub led by a tour guide you miss your relaxation some times by beeing there for them on time or go to places that you do n't like just becouse you are commeted to them .

Finally , I prefere traveling by my self or with peaple I know and I like to have the best time ever .
