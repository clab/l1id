It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
First of all I would like to talk about the broad knowledge of many academic subject .
It is so much better to know alot of information about different subject , at least a background information about every subject .
This is because if a person read about something that he/sher had read or learned about it would be easire for him/her to understand what he/she is reading about , at least a background of it .
For example , in school every student study so many subject , some subject relate some not .
Student in school learn about differen background of every subject they take .
this would help them to see and choose what they want to be in future .

Secondly , I can say that learning about one subject would be much more deeper information about a subject than a background .
Moreover , it would be much usefull to choose what mager or what sort of jobes he/she would like to be in in future .
for example , if a student chose aspesific thing to laern about like bussenss she woul lear alot about busenss more that any thing that it would lead him/her to be a bussenss man/women in future .

However , I think that having broad knowledge of many academic subject can relate with learning about one subject .
this is because without a broud knowledge student cannot choose there future job if they want one , or it would be harder for them to choose what path they would go in the future if they dont have a broad knowledge .

In my opinion , I prefer to have at least a background about many different subject .
Then using my broad knowledge to help me choose what sbject I prefer to study about more , so that it would be easier for me to have a job in future .
