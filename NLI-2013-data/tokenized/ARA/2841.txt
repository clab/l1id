The issue at hand is chosing weather young people enjoy their lives more than old people or not .
I think that the answer to this question is obvious , the young people enjoy their lives much more than old people for four main reasons ; young people can go to to entertainment places , they have a lot of friends , they can be hierd easily anywere , and they are not counting down for their lives to end .

Young people can go to different entertaining places and have fun in their lives , they can go to parties any time they want , they can do most of the sports the want to do , even the hardest things such as climbing on mountains , or sky diving .
However the old people cannot get the entertainement the want wheever they want , that is because of many reasons , first thing they cannot go to parties because it is not appropreate for them to go there .
Also old people cannot play all sports they want to play , and that is because their bodies are not able to play these games , for example an old man cannot go skydiving .

Young people can easily get new friends whenever they want , and that is beside their `` living friends '' , so they will enjoy having friends , and they can even do anything thay want to do with them .
On the other hand the old people face hardness in meeting with new people , and also we can assume that many of their old friends are dying or will die .

Youth can get most of the jobs , even employers usually are looking for youth not old people to hire , and so all of the youth can get the jobs they like and enjoy them .
But the old people cannot get the jobs the want , and most of them cannot get any job , simply because they are retierd , and if they got a job usually it would be a boaring enterprenural job with no peers to have fun with .

Finally youth can enjoy their lives much more thn old people that is because the do not have to worry that they are going to die any tiem , but old people are fearing from the moment they will die .

In a conclusion , youth have much more fun in their lives than old prople do , and that because young people have the opportunity to see life .
