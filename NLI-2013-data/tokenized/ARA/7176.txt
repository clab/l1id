I belive that in 20 years the use for cars will decline because there will always be new technology , more safer ways to trave , and new fuel sources .
If you look closely in history , you will see that man has always been trying to find better substitus to what he has and for that reasone people are riding cars now .
For example , long ago people used to walk for transportation but thought that it was n't practical so after much looking around they started riding domesticated animals , after that they began to try and travel in groups the answer was the envention of the carages , later on they began to find other means of faster transportaion which ended in the envention of cars .

It 's true that cars are fast and reliable but their are not safe enough .
Car accidents might be extreamly damaging or fatal for that people started to make rules for riding cars like buckeling setbelts , not leting children sit up frond , and sitting in the right position .
Although there are rules most people wo n't go by them and try to `` do it '' their way , so a safe means of transportaion must be found .

In today 's world fossiel fuel is the most important resource , many machines depend on them like cars , planes , and trains .
If you look at my first reasone , new technology , you will see that because of it humans will find another form of fuel , like cold fussion , to use other than fossiel fuel because it pollutes the atmospher and cases diseases like cancer .

In conclusion , I think that cars are going to be use less in the next 20 years becaus there will be a much safer , more hi-tech , and nature friendly means of transportaion .
