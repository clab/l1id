Successful people try new things and take the risks rather than only doing what they learn already know how to do well .
Is it true !
Lets take it from the beginning of a baby just burn .
At the first of his life he wants to touch everything around , even it 's hot .
He does n't know , but he take the chances to try and learn what can this thing reply to him .

If we look to the small people we know what is inside the big people .
They would to take the chances to learn everything .
So they feel the successful feeling .
They touch the happyness in winning .

No person can learn if he afraid the thing .
How experiance get to his mind if he stop searching and keep working on what he only knew .

Lets talk about my self .
I 'm at marraige age right now .
So my feeling is to experiance the word marraige .
I know what does it mean , but I do not feel what it is mean .
I have to go throw so I can feel the new experiance .
Should has a lettle fair , but we need to win the life game .

Another example I new is a rich man .
How did he become a rich !
Money does not come from the sky .
By the blessing of GOD , he take the risk to try to feel how to be a rich by giving all the money he has and took some of his friends .
He Intered a new thing .
He success with paying back the many he owns to his friends .
Also reaching the level of rich people .

How is the pilots learn to fly .
He took the risk and grabe the yok to control the plane even he know the he is doing something denguras .
To lear a successful we sould take the risk and do a new thing we may learn from the first , the second or the third .
But invintially we learn .
