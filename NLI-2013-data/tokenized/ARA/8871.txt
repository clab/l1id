Without any doubt Iam strong agree with this statement because I see thiough my experences that we must keep our students understand any thing which we learnd to them not just give them the fact of any subject and , keep them to understand the fact with thierselves because they may do not anderstand the fact in the right way so this thing sure will make wast of our life .

For example of my opinion : when we learnd the students about some thing such as learning or education it is very important thing and everyone should learn , when we told them these words just without make them like it do you know what this means ?
this means that our chieldren may learn some time but , witgout beliving ant of information and the information do not keep in thier maind any more time after finshing thier high schools for example .

Another example is when I take with any one who wants to drive car about the methods of driving and saving others lives this person should understand exactly why I mean because if not he or she may drive fast so this will make a very big waste for all .

In a word I think that understand any small thing in our students lives will save our lives and I thi thin ; thise the very important thing and , this the resposbilty of parents and teachers .
