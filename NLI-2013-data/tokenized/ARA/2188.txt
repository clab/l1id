In my opinion , I do not believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
First of all , younger people have to work hard to get to the stage , so they can have the experience of an older man or older woman .
Second , as a young person , you are restricted to do many things an adult can do , and finally , as an older man/woman life is open to you , you are free to do what you want .

First of all , Teenagers have to work their way up to be successful in their lives , this mean carrying many responsibilities .
I will use myself for an example ; I am 16 and a half and im a senior at Woburn High School , recentley i have been hit with many responsibilites such as college .
I applied to 6 colleges , and have worked many days completing the applications .
I could have decided to not do all this work , but i want to advance .
When i grow old i want the chance to have a good future and enjoy it .
Young people do not enjoy life more than older people do .

Second , as a young person , you are restricted to do many things an adult can do .
For example , buying a car .
As a minor , a person under 18 cannot purchase an automotive vehicle without parental consent .
I am a big fan of cars , however , I ca n't purchase one until i turn 18 .
Older people do not have to deal with this .
Older people can go and buy whatever they want , whenever they want , but that cant be neccessarily a good thing .

Finally , as a man or a woman get old , they find out that life is open to them .
They have finished paying the morgage for their house , and they have a good amount of money in their bank .
What is there for them to do ?
They can do anything .
They could go to Florida and live the rest of their lives on a beach , or they can even stay at their house , and relax for the rest of their lives .
Younger people cannot do that .

In conclusion , Younger people dont always have it harder than older people .
Older people already went through the stage of their life where they worked hard to reach their goal .
For younger people that stage has just opened up .
