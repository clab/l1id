This is very important subject for argument , because there are two reasons they are help the subject health and bad habbits .
First , about the health not all things we can try it , because may be it very bad for our health without we know .
Forexample in one arabic country `` Yamen '' the yamenies people the use '' gat ' it is kind of drugs .
They are use the drug without any information about it .
they thought it is ver good for their health .

Secondly , about bad habbits some people when they leard about something new they like it .
Then when someone likes something he or she can not take off this thing .
such as somebody he tried to drive his or her car fast .
then he or she became uesd to drive the car fast if anyone trys to tell him or her do not drive you car fast he or she will not listen to you .

In the end , i think it is useful if you learn new things and try to do it , but you have to get alot of informations about what you will try to do .
Also ask your self `` is it good for me or not '' .
I would like to do avrey thing good not bad for me or for anyone in my life .
