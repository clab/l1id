I agree with the statement wich says it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learn it as facts .
Also , I think they have to learn how to use the ideas in thier life not to deal with it as facts .
There are many reasons support my opinion .

First of all , when a student deal with the ideas as facts he will be not able to use the ideas in his real life , and he will be act with it like facts with out understanding .
For example , when I learn some ideas in the chemistry lap I feel interesting and I can use the ideas in my life .
On the other hand , when I study some ideas in my book without understanding the concept , I feel boring and I feel that I cant use it in my real life .

Secondly , when you study some ideas without understand the concept will do very bad in the tests .
Let me explain to you , my friend ali just memorized the ideas as facts and he did not understand the concepts , when he took the final test he did very bad and he did not pass the subject .

Thirdly , many researchers prove that knowing the concept helps you to understand the subject more than deal with it as facts .
Becuase when you understand the whole idea you can imagine how does the theory work .

in conclusion , we can say that understanding the ideas or concepts is more important than deal with it as facts .
So , when you understand the entire concepts it is easy for you to use it in your life also it will be easy to unerstand how does the theory works and you will feel enjoyable when you study the subject .
Many people think in thier that learn ideas as facts is more important , but I think my opinion is the right one .
