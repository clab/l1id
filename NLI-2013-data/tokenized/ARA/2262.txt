Everyone in the world has a life , and everyone wants to enjoy the life , but not every one can has what he or she wants , whatever , I am agree with that statement wich says young people enjoy the life more than older people because the young people are good at sports more than old people and young people have more time to live .

First of all yong people are good at sport , and that meke them have a more things to enjoy , for example I do not see any one in the sacore feild any one his or age more than 35 years , also in valyball , and the pasketball , so when we think about this point we will faind many things in the young people life that make them alot happers from older people .

Not just that makes young people enjoy the life more than old people , but also the young people have more time to live and that makes them enjoy the life more than older people such as a chaild with amother and a father the chaild has long way to go and to start her or his life and time to enjoy it , So that makes them alot more enjoy the life more then an older people .

Fainaly , the young people are good at sport , and the young people have more time to live , makes them enjoy the life in more than these way .
In the end I thank that young people are so laoky unless they still younger .
even I wants to stay ayoung man .
