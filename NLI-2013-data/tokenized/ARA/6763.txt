in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I elive this satetment will not be correct in the coming twenty years .
The reasons for that may be many .

For xeample , the number of the population will incresaed , so the need for transpotaion will be more .
Accrding to this , the numbers of cars will increased inorder to meeet this need .
Also , in the future the roads may be more safe than what is it today , as duble ways , broader lines will be present .

Most of the female and male will be driving in the next few years .
as iam talking about my country , at present few women can drive a a car .
Then the number of cars manifuctured will increased ,, the campanies will compete to produce chearper cars that are affordale so , many peapole will be able to purchase a car .
Many peapole uy cars for lesiures and social and self satisfaction .
If cars became cheap , peapole will buy more cars .
As technology advancied mini cars may be produce for childern under the age of drivring .
Cars may not be only used for transportation , it can also be used as a living place .
starting from today , many peapole live in their vans .

Petrol may not be used any more as the source of fule , other sources my discovered or used like yhe solar energy [ by the use of sun energy ] .
This will reduce the pollutions caused y the carbones from the cars .
Also it will be cheaper and affordable by many Cars also may be driven by computers , so you can relax and enjoy the views .
Road accidents will be less .

All these reasons and more will help in increasing the number of cars for the coming years .
