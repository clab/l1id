I disagree to this concept because if most of the advertisment contains a false knowledge for thier product .
nobody will believe any of the advertisment .
which leads a lack of knowledge for a consumer which is the most suitable product to buy .
that means that all the money budget for the advertisment gone for nothing .
moreover , it will cause the hatrege of the consumer to the company , even if they sell a varies kind of products .
but its better for the advertisment companies to have a funny advertisment in the tv .
after that announce the name of the product .
In that way everybody body will remember the product because of the funny advertisment .

the only effective time to advertise about products is when you have a low amount of products .
and the company want to get red of it .
