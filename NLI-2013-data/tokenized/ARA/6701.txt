Nowadays there is an average of three cars to each family .
With the ever evolving technology at hand today , the world has become much more connected , unlike the olden days , people now need cars for may reasons such as comuting to work or visiting relatives of freinds living far away .

There , of cource , are pros and cons when it comes to disscussing cars .
Cars have increased in nomber these days for many reasons .
Firstly , they are a very comfortable way of travel , whith many having air conditioning , radio and some even have built in T.Vs .
Cars are also very easy to use and can take the driver to any destination he or she desires .
Currently with the increasing competition between companies , car prices have fluctuated .
These effective vehicles can take you anywhere at any time , unlike trains , buses and other public transport systems which have difined scheduals and destinations .

On the other hand cars have become a liability to some due to their constant need of maintenence and the large nomber of accidents which they cause , for example , you are 20 times more likely to die of a car accident than to die in a plane crash .
The increasingly alarming rate of pollution cased by cars has pushed inventors to try and find alternative means of transport .
The constantly increasing price of gas has led alot of people to abandon their cars in search of another , cheaper , means of transport .

I belive that while there are many problems , such as pollution and high oil prices , that come with the use of cars , they are still the most efficeint means of travel and while many scientist hope to find alternatives to cars the chances of that happening in the next twenty years are extremely slim .
I personally disagree with the statement , since looking back on previous years you can see that the nomber of cars being sold has only increased and at this rate the nomber of cars can only be predicted to contine to grow .
