since the begining of life , poeple stood shoulder to shoulder in order to obtain and secure the primitive sources to survive .
With thie time changes and eras follow years , the demand of helping and building up communities increased dramaticly .
its not only helping to survive and getting food any more , its about being an active member to afford lexurity of life and improve a life style not only for the indivisual , but for the society as well .

Young people who obtain the right education and got rasied upon to certain manners are always awared for the fact that they have to contribute into the society in a potant way .
They know that they have to give as thay have been given other wise the circle would not keep on going on .

It is not hidden that the challenges in life are increasing more than before .
It is also well known that with the high level of competetion the demand for more engagments is becoming a most on order to compete and survive .
With this mad rush for being thursty for the autherity and the confusion politics create , time is becomine more valuable .

Time factor is being an issue .
Regardless of the fact that an indivisual wants to help or not , its still obveious having the time to do so is not as easy .

A young indivisual does have alot of responsibilities and duties to do now .
He has to attend an educational program , a job to perfom along with many other social bonds of which he has to fulfill .

I believe those engagments youth are doing are part of helping the community .
Without an adequate education a guy would n't be able to obtain a good job .
Without those factors he would n't be able to start a good family with healthy well mannered kids .

A guy who does n't attend family gatherings is totaly being out from the basic social life of which would affect him psychologicly and it would affect his over all performance .

finally , I believe everyone is helping in his own way .
We just have to make sure we are helping right .
