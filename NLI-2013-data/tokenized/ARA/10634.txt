I agree with the successful people try new things and take risks rether than only doing what they already known to do well .
becouse ther are learn and try .
the sienctiest are try to be successsful such that one of them was discoverd the lamp in 1000 trying in tha last try he successed .
he said that I did not fail 1000 time I just learn 1000 mistakes .
trying help us to leane and improve our self .
The success will come with the hard working and trying .
So we must try many times and learn from our mistakes .
But it is not why the people eho do what they known are not success .
Ther are also success .
