Many companies spend a lot of money in advertisment .
Also , they have special section and skilled people for advertisments .
All these to market them products to customers .
In my opinion , I totally agree with statment that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are for three reason .

First of all , any products in the world have advantages and disadvantages .
The best product is that has many advantages and few disadvantages .
In all advertisments , only the advantage of products is seen but the disadvantages is not .
if person see advertisement , the product will seem much better than it really is .

Second , Most companies use multimedi - Text , sound , picture , vedio - in products advertisments .
These combination of technology will put the product in the suitable environment that will effect on the custome .
For example , if you would like to buy a television and you see advertiment about two kind of television .
First one using multimedi that shows the television with high resolution and you best program and best actor on it .
Second advertisment without using any technology .
I think you will select the first one because you think is better even though if the first television an dsecond television are same in features .

Finally , Many companies contract with beautiful men and women or with famous player or actors to present in advertisments and use products .
If you see product with your favorite player or actor , you will buy the product even though it is not good product .

Inconclusion , I totally think that products have less quality than they are appear in advertisments for three reasos .
only advantages are presented on advertisments , companies use mutimedi in products advertisments , and companies contract with famous people to present in products advertisments .
I think , we have to be accurate before buy any product especially if we see it in advertisment .
