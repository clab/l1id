The world we live is full of variety and diffrences between people .
We share diffrent cultures , diffrent traditions , diffrent jobs , diffrent responsibilties .
Everybody is diffrent for the others in his ways of expressing life .
The world is a huge stage and nearly everybody is an actor .
To be able to communicate with each others we should know about each others intresets , this is mainly based on what we aquir in our academic life .
It 's a vaste subject list .

It 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects simply because the society requieres the variety , requieres the change between all living humains .
This is to lead us to communication and communication is to lead us to knowledge .
Immagine a persons life specialized in one specific subject only .
No variety , no communication , no expanded knowledge .
TYhis is the type of persons who communicate with there ressemblance only , or in most of the times they become `` the outsiders '' .
COMPLETE ISOLATION of the society , and this may lead to a public danger , or to suicide .

It 's then prefarable to be an open person .
Meeting diffrent persons with diffrent intersts and charing diffrent aspects of life .

Image a man specialized in complexe physics and only complexe physics , can you draw a life for this kind or people ?
it 's very difficult for him to built a family , to communicate with his wife , children , neighbors , friends .
One step after the other they will turn to isolation , live and work outside society and thus a failure of life .
We live in a absurde world with so much of diffrent desiers and intrestes .

I herebly agree with the statment above .
It 's much better to have a broad knowledge pf many academics subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Life is an adventure , we live once , we should do what we feel is rite to do .
We 're like an flower , said Descart , we grow and acquire knowledge we feel we 're kings of the world , as we grow more we realise we know just a little of the perplexe and complexe world , we then start to become humble , and die .
