Advertisement is a very unique skill , it 's is the art of changing the nature of a product and achieve the sales target for a salesman .
It 's a very special skill that helps the maketeer to obtain his gaol .
It can work in both ways , it can be an honest advertisement and can be a fake or a dishonest one depending on the company/salesman goals and integrity .
Any product can be the best or the worst product depending on how it is marketed or advertised for .
An advertisement can be the most real , straight forward one or can hide half of the truth about a certain product .
It 's no doubt depends on the vision and integrity of the marketeer/salesman .
For example sales representatives for drug companies are required to fit into a certain format looks wise , dress wise , way of talking , the car they are driving and so on , because marketing is a science and professional marketeers know for sure that all these small things matters in the big picture and it has a great effect on having doctors agree to meet and talk with sales reps and in the end prescribe the product/medicine they are here to sell .
Second thing is colors and shapes of the gamexes ( prodcut related gifts ) , brochures , and product samples that are distributed by the salesmen has to be greatly taken into account , it has been studied/shown that certain colors affects the mood and influence doctors to write certain prescription medication , also the postion of the gamex on the doctor 's desk can influence his memory to remeber or forget a certain product .
So it 's all about a kind of audio visual brain wash that advertising is doing to influence any increase or decrease in sales .
This is also shown in the example of the prescription drugs and how advertisement make a prodcut seem much better that it really is when the sales reps starts explaining to the doctor the benefits of this drug for his patient and not highlighting on the major side effects that the patient might suffer by taking this medication .
Therefore , I do agree that advertisemants make products seem much better that they really are and everyone should make his/her own research before purchasing any product so that they do n't fall as a prey for advertisement .
