I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This is because although young people usually have a healthier state than old ones , this does n't mean that this is the only factor that controls a person 's enjoyment of life .
I believe that each of these two categories - young and old people - have their own way of enjoying life .
For instance , despite the fact that old people ca n't do some types of enjoyment that the youngsters can do - such as hanging out , and playing some types of sports - however , they also have a wide range of enjoyable activities that they can perform .

The types of activities that older people can do to enjoy life often depends on the age category they belong to .
For example people at the age of sixty or above often enjoy their life after retirement by buying themselves houses in quiet and calm areas , where they can enjoy the free time they have by relaxing .
They can also spend their time in gardening , playing with their grandchildren and taking care of them , or discussing any subjects in life .
They also have their type of sports that help them relax such as golf .

On the other hand , people at younger ages - from forty to sixty - often enjoy their life by making trips around the world to places they have n't visited when they were young .
This type of enjoyment , and other `` time consuming '' activities , are usually not available for young people because they often do n't have enough time to do it .
This is due to the reason that young people usually spend most of their time in their studies , doing homeworks , and writing papers .

I again emphasize the idea that each has his/her own types of enjoyment , and that he/she probably wo n't enjoy doing what other people in other age categories do .
