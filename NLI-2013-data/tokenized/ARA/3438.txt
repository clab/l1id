Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities cause these days the life situation its too difficult for live , cause they want to pay for them to have an own salary the dont want to go for example ; to the hospital and ask the patient how did they feeling about the helping them in the painfull or how the nursing treatment them & how the attitute from the doctors or nursing or about the cleaning for the hospital , if we try to push the young people to help their communities they must give them a good payment or recomandiation to opening for them later a door for agood expereince & give them a good community with apoor people & how to feel about poored people , Then we can find alot of young people come to the communities and ask them to help cause they put a benifites for these young people for example like :
1 - They give them a monthly payment .
2 - They give them a recomandiation lettere to help them for any work they will apply for it .
3 - They give them an experiouns .
4 - They will always try to push them to do a good things .
So that the young people they will have a time to help a communities and they will be happy for do that cause they feel they indeppendent on them self .

Finally I hope the young people they can find a good communities opened a door for them and give them what they need to take from them and Iam sure they will do they best and the better even in hospital or schools , company and on stage .
