Nowedays , competition between companies is feirce , every one needs do his best in order to sell his product and survive in the market .
and advertisements is a very efficient technique to sell and be successeful .

I totally agree that most advertisement make the product look much better than they really are , everything look so wonderful on TV or on a magazine .
new technologies are applied to make people and celebities so perfect , bottles of product look bigger and to easy to use and to open ...

As a result , advertissements are having a big and negative influence on people 's life , it is just and endless process of a `` must have '' .
We always find things that we do n't really need , but we buy it anyway just because we saw it on TV last night !
and we end up bu spending hundreds of dollars because we thought it was somthing that we ca n't live without .

aAother negative thing that influence adults as well as teenagers is using celebrities to promote a certain product .
everyone become obseste and has to have this product .
for instance , product for wrinkles or acne .
just because it worked for a calabrity does n't mean that it would work for you , everyone 's skin and hair is different .
another example is the clothes .
most of celebrities and models are thin and tall , and everyone has a different body shape , so , if those clothes look good on the model it does n't mean that they would fit you .
and the worst thing of all in teenagers watching those commecials , they can starve themselve or be anorexique in order to look like something irealistice , those photos shown in magazine are fake most of the time , they can make you look taller or thiner .

In conclusion , I beleive that advertisements are not real most of the time , and the producers exagerate and make things look so much better than what they really are , but companies that never keep their promesses will cost them a lot because they will lose the costumer 's trust and will have a bad reputation .
advertisement can be efficient and work for the compagnie and make it popular and efficient if the things shown are real and not just lies and exagerations .
