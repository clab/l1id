I agree that most advertisements make products seems to be much more better than they really are concerning the material used and satisfaction to consumers .
Useing a below average materials in some products and advertise it the best .
For example , a hire dryer that will be bought and in the next day it is burned .

The seacond reason is consumer satisfaction .
Seeing an advertisment about a very comfortable and wonderfull car for example and when rideing it it 's completlly the opposite .
In conclusion , not all advertisements are true .
It 's all about selling there products in other words it 's about mony .
Consumers are the last in there tasks .
