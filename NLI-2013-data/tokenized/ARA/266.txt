I agree for shor .
haw can the studens pas the exams haw can the be the best ?
I think thes is the reale questhion .
Ideas its the way to under stand the facts .
So if the student len haw to the , if the studen lern how to use ther ideas the will can araived to the fact .

most poeple do understand the fact but mos poeple can not araived to the ideas .

If we teech students the wat to understand ideas the will lern the fact emegetly .
the ideas is the topec of the facts .
lrenikg the studens the ideas have many advantegis :
First , the will do good thing to ther contry by giving them
same ideas .
Socend it will help them to be a good persons ik thes life .
Last but not least it will help them to pass in the school , in the unevercety and in the life .

that wy we should lren them the ideas
