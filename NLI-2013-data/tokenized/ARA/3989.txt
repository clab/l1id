Young people are the engine to build their communities .
They were the most benificial class in the communities years ago .

Some people believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
First , the higher authority places is for elderly and more experienced persons in the community .
This can limit young people 's chances to help the community .
Another reason is that their full time is only for studying and work to obtain their own income and benifits .

Many people believe that young people nowadays give enough time to help their communities for several reasons .
First of all , young adults have time to help people by their university projects and assignments .
For example , they can emphasize their topics on their assignments on helping people .
They can do projects to search people 's problems and needs .
Secondly , young adults have the enegy and health to utilize on helping people by visiting them at homes and determining their needs .
Finally , young people give enough time as they have real motivation .
Motivation can move them to help their communities as much as they can .

I believe that young people nowadays have given enough time to help people .
The more young people help their communities , the better achievements and improvements the communities have .
