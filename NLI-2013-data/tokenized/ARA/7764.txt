All the people need to renew their routine in the holidays with their friends and family , and they can do many things to do that .
They can go to movie theaters , sport games , and many things .
Nowadays , we can notice the most common way to renew the routine is travel to another country or state .
Some people like to travel alone with their family because they think the other people will bother them , and they 're afraid of meeting bad friends .
Others like to travel with a group by a tour guide .
I think the second way to travel is better than the first one because the reasons which I 'll discuss in this essay .

In a first , people may feel bored if they travel only with their family because they 're with their family all the time , and they need to meet new friends to make the tour more exciting .
For example , if a family travels with their child , the child will feel like playing with another kid who has a many commons with him .
Also , the father and the mother like to meet people like them to talk about what they like to talk about such as the mother likes to talk with other women about many subjects that she ca n't talk about them with her child or husband .
Therefore , this advantage will help all the family member to enjoy their time , and if they like to be alone with no people , they can ask the tour guide that they want to go out side alone for a while .

Moreover , if you travel to the most wonderful country in the world , you wo n't be happy if you do n't know where you can go or what the good places you can visit .
You need someone who knows a lot about the country which you 're planning to visit with your family or friends .
In this case , a tour guide can help you to enjoy in your tour , and he can show you the best places in the country you want to visit , and he can also tell you information about the country and its history .
I think this is an important advantage because you do n't want to only to enjoy in your tour .
You want to benefit also and know information about the country which you want to visit .

In brief , maybe traviling alone has some advantages also .
However , I prefer to travel with a group led by a tour guide for the reasons which I discussed above , and I beleive that this is the best way to travel with your family or friends because you wo n't enjoy only , but you will enjoy and benefit .
