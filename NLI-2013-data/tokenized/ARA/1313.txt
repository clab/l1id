AS TIME EVOLVES EDUCATION EVIDENTALLY BECOMES A VERY INTENSELY STONG WEAPON IT IS THE DEFENSE MECHANISM FOR MANY OBSTACLES THAT HUMANITY ATTEMPTS TO OVERCOME EVERY DAY AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DO BELIEVE THAT POSSESING BROAD KNOWLEDGE OF MANY ACADEMIC SUBJECTS IS MORE SUPERIOR THAT TO SPECIALIZE IN ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT I PERSONALLY AGREE WITH IN FACT I FIND THIS THEORY AS A DEFENSE MECHANISM AND THOSE WHO FOLLOW IT TO BE IMMENSLY LACKING IN SELF CONFIDENCE PEOPLE WHO TEND TO BE VERY EDUCATED IN EVERY ACADEMIC SUBJECTS OR A WIDE RANGE OF THEM TEND TO HAVE A SUPERIOR ATTITUDE AND FEEL AS IF THEY ARE SMART MORE EDUCATED THAN THOSE WHO ARE NOT AS GIFTED IN THE ACADEMICS THEY BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE MORE OF A CHANCE AND LESS NEED TO STRIVE AND EASILY ACHIEVE IN THEIR ENDEAVOURS HOWEVER ARE THEY REALLY HAPPY OR SATISFIED BEING THIS WAY ?
IN MY EXPERIENCE BEING ABLE TO SPECIALIZE IN ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT GIVES THE PERSON AN ADRENALINE THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY AVAILABLE FOR EVERY SINGLE SUBJECT IN THE UNIVERSE THOSE WHO ARE BOOK SMART ARE MERELY UNHAPPY IN MY OPINION AND EXPERIENCE THEY ARE ALSO CONFUSED THEY NEVER KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR LIVES HOWEVER TO BE ABLE TO SPECIALIZE IN ONE SPECIFIC SUBJECT ALLOWS THE PERSON TO DEVELOP A SENSE OF PASSION TURNING IT INTO A DREAM A SENSATION AND AN EPIPHANY IT IS A MENTAL PERUSIAL AND A WAY OF LIVING FOR EXAMPLE I AM NOT VERY SKILLED IN SCIENTIFIC SUBJECTS SUCH AS THE SCIENCES AND MATHEMATICS HOWEVER I HAVE VERY STRONG FEELINGS FOR THE ARTS SPECIFICALLY THEATRE I TEND TO EXCEL IN THEATRE POSSIBLY MORE THAN MANY WHO I KNOW AND I FEEL PROUD BECAUSE IT IS A HARD SUBJECT NOT EVERYONE CAN HAVE THE TALENT BUT ALMOST EVERYBODY CAN BE BOOKSMART EVEN A GENUIS WHO ACCELERATES IN MULTIPLE SUBJECTS MUST HAVE ONE FOUNDATION IN WHICH HE FINDS HIS EPIPHANY AND SENSATIONS HIS ADRENALINE THAT CAUSES HIM PASSION I AM A FIRM BELIEVER IN PASSION AND TALENT AND THE FACT THAT EVERYONE POSSESSES THESE TWO ELEMENTS HOWEVER IF ONE FLAUNTS THEIR EDUCATION IT WONT GET THEM ANYWHERE IN LIFE THEY WONT BE HAPPY FOCUSING ON ONE THING OR INCORPORATING MANY SUBJECTS INTO ONE CAUSES AN EPIPHANY AND A TALENT AND MAYBE THOSE WHO HAVE BROAD KNOWLEDGE OF MANY ACADEMIC SUBJECTS WILL GAIN THIS EPIPHANY IF THEY FOCUS ON ONE SUBJECT GAIN SELF ESTEEM AND ENTER THE REAL WORLD WHERE KNOWING EVERYTHING IS NOT NECESSARILY ANYTHING
