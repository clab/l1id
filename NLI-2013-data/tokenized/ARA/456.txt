The knowledge is to know things about every things , but specializing is to know every things about one thing .
I believe that all students should get as much as they can from academic subjects .
however , they also must by specialize in one subject , because of the link between all that sudgects .

According to that idae , if we want agert sintis we should teach him differnt kind of subjects that will help him in his wark , and those subject must be related to the euchother .
On the other hand , we must not teach the student any thing , not related to his subject , so he will not loss his time .

All students should learn how to teach thimsilf after they finish they academic years .
so they will be able to get more knowledge in there free time .

In conclsion , it is better to have droad knowledge of one or specialized academic subject than many subject .
