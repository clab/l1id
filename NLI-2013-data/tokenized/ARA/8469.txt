No i do n't agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because for my opinion i think both of them are imporatnt for students to know .
students for their knowledge need to understand the concepts and the ideas in order to answer the `` why '' question and understand why things work like this or like that andon the other hand they need to leran facts in order to understand better the ideas and concepts and especially that these usually are the conclusion of others works and most of them come from a passed period so you ca n't just ask the students to learn them if you can not prove them by real facts .

Imagine in mathematics course the student has to understand the idea of parrallellism and the teacher ca n't give a him a real fact or example about parallelism and how two parallel ligns could never meet or in physics he has to understand the concept of the light without giving him a fact how this concept works in reality and what about history course ?
how can a teacher teach history class without using facts ?

To conclude i would like to change this statement into the following one : it is as important for students to understand ideas and concepts as for them to learn facts .
