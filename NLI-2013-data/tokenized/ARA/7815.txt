Yes I agree that the best way to travel is in agroup led by tour gudi .
Traveling abrod is what I like this life .
Traveling in a group can be a better for many people .
Traveling give oupprotonty for a lot of people to descover the world and to know about other culture .
People who travel a lot can essaily travel in a group which gane be a great oupprotonty for the group to descover everything by them self .
So traveling in a group is the most importnat idia i ever had .
I will maintain this in two way .

First , choosing a group is the most esstional steps before any traveling .
you need to choose the correct group for your traveling .
So do n't choose any group for just traveling with them , because this trip can be very important for and for your family to enjoy in this trip .
For example , I choosed a very good group of people in my traveles before and they helped me much than the tour guide .
This group had a lot of experince in traveling for that reason you should choose the right group .

Second , choosing the right time and place for travel .
Some places are not good choise for traveling with a group .
If you want to travel in group you need to choose a good place like to travel to a safe country that all peopl know about it , because you do n't want to put yourself and your grup in prablems .
For example , I saw a group of people had a prablem with the local police in asian country last year .
In conclusion traveling with group can be woundrful for the people .
They will have a lot of fun togather , and they will share experince from traveling in a groups .
They learn how to help each other and how to find soultions for their prablem while they in trable .
