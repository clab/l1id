i agree becous if they learn facts they will learn the idea in the fact onley and no idea elss .
bat if they learn an idea they will learn alots and lots of thengs that related to the idea becous it is not limted in one thing like the fact so you can the see the defrens betwen the tow thing and what i toked abote the ideas it gose the same on the concepts .
even so we cant deny the important to students to learn fact .
bat like i saed understand ideas and concepts are far more important than learn jast facts .
students may doas not anderstand facts very will antell they ander stand the idea and concept that is related to the fact .
