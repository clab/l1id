I 'm not quite agree with that the travel would be the best when it has tour guide .
But it is such a good idea to be with a group .
And that guide lead you to know wonderful sites that the guide know them better than the tourists .
I would prefer have group guide if I have know idea about the country that I 'm visiting .
I will discuss that difference in details supported by examples .

Traveling is something nice and let you discover many things that you do n't know before .
First , to discover the site that you visit you must have a guide because you have any idea about it at natural .
You might be see this site by the internet or a catalog .
In this case , the leader of the group will show all the sites that you came for them .
Second , the leader will give you a coplete idea about the city that you are visiting .
For example , you might visit such a country that has historical sites and some these sites 's inhabitants home or their ancestor 's home .
And the leader has plenty background about the history aspects of this country the tourist might want to know from him .

In the other hand , I as a tourist I might use the tour guide for just some trips or some sites in particular .
For example , I can not use the tour guide when I want to visit a country that I have an idea about it .
Also I will not use the tour guide if I 'm going to visit safe country or small country which I can go around the country veery easily .
Many cases that the tour guide must be with you .
For example , if you are traveling with senior people or very old people .
The tour guide would make it easier to move from site to site for the old people .
