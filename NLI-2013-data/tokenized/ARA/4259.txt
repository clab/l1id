Young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

The reason why I said that is obvious .
Because nowday we see yong people are interested or we can say beasy with other selly things rather than helping their community with things can be usefull to them or to others in the future .
They spent most of their time in front of the TV watching some movie or watching a video clip for some stupid singer , if not then you can see them lestinning to the music all day long or playing video games with their friends like they never want to grow up .
By any chance if they get fed up with all these stuffs , they continue their day by playing some kind of a game football or basketball or volly ball or any other game they figure .
After they finish with all these game and eventually they want to behave like adults or grown up people , they go and date thier girlfriends and take them to fancy restaurants .

During the weekend they go swimmming or climbing or shopping or to do some other things .
what I dont understand why dont try to make some time to help their communities .

As I always say build your community if you want to build your self .
I think we should encorage young people to serve the community by putting some plans to create the love of their community inside them .
