I do not entirely disagree with this statement but I do disagree to some extent .
In my opinion , successful people do not just try new things and take risks but they also work on improving what they already know .

For any person to be successful they should build there success on experience .
What I mean by experience is taking time to make mistakes and learn from them .
This also means working hard in order not to repeat previous mistakes .
This is where success is built on doing what we already know .

On the other hand , it would not be very smart to keep our same old information as this would not improve us in any way .
Therefore we should take chances , take risks - but within limits which we set for ourselves of course - and learn to experience day by day .

Success can be recognized in many aspects of life , and as time passes we could be successful in many different areas .
I mean by that : success is not necessarily related to each individual 's area of expertise .
A person can be successful educationaly , as well as in there work field as they grow up and also in there personal life .

Success in school is based on studying , comprehending and practicing in order to achieve good results and ace tests whenever we can .
In school we could learn to be successful for example by keeping the same efficient way of studying that we got used to in order to achieve our best .
Where risks are introduced could be by trying some new way of learning perhaps suggested by a classmate or by taking the chance to learn a new language or study a subject which we do not guarantee to like but why not take the chance to be successful in somthing new ? !

In conclusion , one should always learn to do their best in order to succeed whether or not that involves trying something new .
