`` Knowing little about many things or knowing more about less things '' is a question that we face many times in our life .
The explosion of knowledge in incresing number of knolege fields make this question more provocative .
I think that answering this question is affected by expected gains of each answer as well as the personality of the individual to answer .
The life experience and career of a person can support one answer and undermine the other answer .

Speciality is a relative concept in this case .
Any career needs a certain degree of speciality in these days .
You can not go to any field without having the necessary knowledge and skills , as well as attitudes , that compromise such field .
I think that the question is related to the level of speciality that one needs .
In other words how deep we need to go in the field of speciality .
Another level of the issue is about wether this will isolte us from other fields , i.e ignoring horizental knowledge .

As a social worker , I think it is more empowering for me in my work and life to be of broad knowledge .
Having broad knowledge will facilite my communication with different types of clients .
When the client feels yuo share with him or her a language he or she will build trust and feel nearer to you .
Another reason for that stems from the ability of understding the environment of the case that may include different types of knowledge .
This will save you from going every time to somebody to help you .

Another point that makes me oppose ignoring broad knowledge for the sake of more specializing is related to the personality of an individual .
I think people who like to grow vertically in knowlege ignoring horizental growth will end up socially isolated wether they like or not .

In general , I am with reasonable richness in horizental knowled
