Young people nowdays go to schools , go to malls and other places where they meet new people and of course they need time to make friends .

And when they make friends they are going to be in community with them by going to their house or even by calling them and they have to give up some time to do that .

I agree with the statement that they do n't , and by not doing that they lose a lot of the benefits of the friendship like the friends can help them when they need to or they can have alot of fun by going out with them .

It has some bad effects if the person they are in community with has some bad ideas and he share them with young person .

Young people really should get some advise about that from his teacher , father or mother and by that they are avoiding alot of problems if they choose the right person .

By taking time to thing and by focusing on the person 's behavior you can know even befor talking to him if he is the right person to be your friend or not .

In conclusion if the young people give up some time to help their communities they can avoid alot of problems by choosing the wrong person to be their friend .
