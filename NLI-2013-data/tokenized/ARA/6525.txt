I think that I disagree with the following statement `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' to an extent .

I would only agree to this statement under certain conditions .
Cars would only decrease in twenty years if the crude oil diminishes by that time , I think .
Not only if it diminishes but also if it was scarce or difficult to drain out due to the lack equipments to reach far or sense such small quantity .
I say that petrol is important because with it out cars wont move .
In addition to that if this occurs the petrol price might rise and only moderate to wealthy people can afford having a car with such high expenses .
I would add to that that if rude oil does decrease or diminish less factories and electrical generations would stop working and by that less classical cars would be produced .

On the other hand , I dont really think that within 20 years this is going to happen , I hope .
As i see it , for the past three to four years the cars innovation and availability in markets with various shapes , modalities sizes and brands has been increasing non stop .
For instance In Jordan which is a middle east country that is considered moderate non developed countries have had a dramatic increase in cars as its sseen in traffic jams that has been increasing each year more than the other .
Not to forget mentioning the Gulf region where each family member who is licensed to drive owns his own car .
Cars for guys in this region is their main obsession .
Oman was considered one of the quite Gulf countries that was known for it wide empty roads for the past year its been having several rush time hours from initially starting with 2 rush our times on the way to and from work .

Ultimately , I anticipate an increase in cars on roads and in each house , 20 years from now based on what I see today .
I also think that maybe by that time new cars that are not petrol fuel consumers might be invented and in efficient use .
There was car invented that works on helium gas instead of petrol and I heard that it was seen in One of the sstreet in some western country that i cant recall it now .

In case crude oil was to finish , I have hope that scientist will create alternative sources of energy such as the solar power to provide us a normal sophisticated life life .
