With time generations start living on different life standards where they start looking out for them selves more than their own community .
the meaning of democracy came from the latin word democratus which was writin by Aristotle , a famous greek philosopher .
the meaning of democrasy is when a group of people are working for a common cause to help their own country or civilization .
I think that people today areussualy more keen on helping their own desires even if their own desires can interfere with other peoples standars or affairs .

Darwin 's Theory `` Survival of the fitist , '' is what basically going on in the world today .
i for one like to help both the community and my self , but i would stop helping the community if doing so will effect me personnaly .
One thing i have noticed is that helping the community is in such a low level , that most school require community service in order for a student to graduate , forcing people to help the community is a great sign that people are not really paying attention to their own community .

Helping the community can come in many different forms ; polution , respect , civilized behavior and following the rules. a person can help his community by buying unleaded cars causing less smoke in the enviroment , another problem that can be characterized as polution is littering , i have watched many people in my community litter as the government doesnt have strict rules for people to abide by them .
respect between people in the same community is quite necessary where a person should never fight another person or argue , which is good for communal stabilization .

People should work harder on helping their communities instead of their own , because by doing so your benefiting yourself and the people around you inderectly .
If the community is shown as as a quiet peaceful community then the urge to benefit ones self will become less , for other people can be benefiting you .
