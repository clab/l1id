Traveling is sometimes a risk if the travelar does not know about the place he is visiting or travelling to in many ways such as you may be lost in acity that you know nothing about or even be kidnapped .
One more reason that can make your trip risky is that if you travel to a place that you do not know you are risking your money that you paid for the trip .
I beleive that the best way to travell is with atourguide for many reasons .

First of all , a tour guide will be , for sure , exprienced about the place he is guiding you in , consiquantely , ther is no risk on you at all to be lost or stolen by the forign people .
For instance , one one of my friends decided to go to a town that is known not only its water falls but also for Mafia groups that it hold and when i advised him to be careful and acompany a tour guide , he refused .
doyou know what happened ? , he came back walking because the Mafia threatend him and forced him to give up all of the money he had .
Thus , traveling with atour guide is way safer for you htan travelling alone .

In addition , when you acompany a tour guide he will show you the most beatiful places in the area ( city , town , ...
etc. ) , so that you garantee that you are not risking your mony going to a place where you will waste more mony and time looking for the best place to visit in that area and here is an example about that : one time my mom wanted to travell to another city in a near country of ours , this city ( Ollu ) was famous for a resturant that offers sea food , after she got there she realized the she was in the wrong city , she traveled to ( Ollau ) , she was so angry and depressed that she had wasted her time and mony without tasting that food .
therefore , a tour guide is a nessecity when it comes to travelling .

Indeed , tour guide makes travelling esiar , safer and more enjoyable , Want my advice ? , never go on atrip without a tour guide .
