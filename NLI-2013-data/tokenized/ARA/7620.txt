In my opinion , I think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour gide because of several reasons .
First , some people feel more comfortable with the group because they not alone .
second , many people likes to leding by a tour guide to show them the places and explain it to them , also the guide usually use the launguge that the people use it in the country that they traveling to , so that the travelers do not have a launguge problems during their trip .
Finally , some people like to be organize and follow a schuale that they not responsible of it .

People will feel comforatable when they travel with a group of other people that probably their first time to see these places too .
I belive it will be more intertanments , and make anew frinds .
Although , it will be many programs during the trip that will make it better than lonly trip .

Many people likes to leding by a tour guide to showing them the places , as well to explain it .
The tour guide always known the history of the places the the tour will visit it , so that , the tour get more information about the places that they visit , and learning anew stuff about that place .
Culture , food , clothing , and traditions are the most important issue for the traveling , the tour guide who usually from that place , he is the best one who can explain all these stuff for the group .
However , the guide usually knows the languge that uses in that place , as well the languge of the group , so the travelers do not have any problems that the may face from that issue .

Finally , many people are organizing and they care too much about the time , so that the like to be a part of a group to organize everything for them .

Inaddition , traveling is very good thing to learn more about how the other people live .
