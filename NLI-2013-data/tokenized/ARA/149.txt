Advertisements all ways make for exagiration , attraction and confussion the costomers than peresented the reality of the product , and Iam astrongly agree with statment that `` most advertisement make products seem much better than they realy are '' , for the reason above , First , advertisement make more exagiration that seem the product is perfect but in the reality we find the product is less than good , for example : one company produce banana juice , and abig advertise for that product , when I baught that banana juice I taste it then , I feel unable to take it agian .

Secondly , some companies make ahuge colors on cover of the prodect to attracc costomers , in the end I find the prodects are less in the quality .
Thirdly , most advertisement make confution to costomer that make them unable to determain the quality of prodect .
In the conclussion the advertisment allways make the prodect seem much bett
