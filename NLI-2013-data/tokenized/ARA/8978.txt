Every one knows that when we are learning we learn facts and ideas .
No one in the world can change the facts becusae facts are facts .
Some people just like to know the fact and they do not pay attetion to other ideas .
In my case , I strongly beilive that understanding ideas is more important for students that understanding facts .
I think like this beause of many aspects which are a good way to learn how to respwct others , makes you creative and makes you persuisve .

First , understanding ideas opens very good and big ways of thinking .
It makes you think and respect other 's opinions .
If we look at facts , we will find that most of thefacts were just ideas in the past and by disccuss them they becam facts .

Second , trying to understand ideas is a good way to make your brain working .
It makes you creat new ideas and new opinons .
On the other hand , understanding facts is like open your mind , put things in it and close it .

Third , understanding ideas led you to the facts .
I beilive that most of the facts are coclusions for ideas .
If you understand the idea you can easly figure out the fact .
I think understanding ideas teaching us how to be a persuisve person because when you are trying to get a results from an idea , you are following certain and clear steps .
This certain way of thinking can appears on your personality .

Finally , I belive that understanding ideas is very important but also we can not say understanding facts is not important .
We should know the main and important facts of every thing .
On the other hand , we do not o make understanding facts our way of learning and thinking .
I beilive of that because of many aspects which are a good way to learn how to respect others , makes you creative and makes you persuisve .
