Most products , regardless of their brand names , depend on advertisement as a main means of promotion .
The question is : Are these products as good as they seem ?

Some of those products have been in markets , and people have been consuming them for long now .
These products have been able to maintain their quality and thus their name has survived until these days .
We still even repeat their brand names , which proves that quality has outdid any role of advertisement

On the other hand , some new products have emerged , and manufacturers have tried their best to draw a resemblance between different products .
Nowadays , if you are watching a commercial on TV , you can hardly notice the difference between products .
They look the same , the way the product is introduced would also sound familiar to you .
For example , in their commercials , they depend on showing the best of this product by getting it featured by a good looking model !

Once the audience view the commercial , he / she would temptingly go and try out the product .
But the problem that we are facing nowadays is that some products are not as good as they seem .
TV , newspapers , computer , and other means have facilitated some ways to make all of these products look just perfect !
So people would go , buy or try some of these products , and later get disappointed by the results or the outcome .

In my own opinion , I think that there should be certain committees to be held responsible for the quality of any product , especially when it comes to advertisement .
They should make sure that the quality of products would look as real as it seems !
Technology has a major role in making these products look better , but definitely it should not determine our judgment , insult our intelligence , or deceive our eyes !
