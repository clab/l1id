Do you know what is the most popular way of selling commercial products in this time ?
Of course advertisements on TV and the internte is the answer .
Nowadays , most people watch the commercials before they buy the products that they need .
This trend led to make some advertisements companies to decorate their products to seem better than its quality .
In my opinion , this is a negative issue for several reasons .

First of all , it is considerd a kind of cheating people .
Most of the purchesers follow the advetisements that attract them without thinking in the real quality of the products because they believed what they have seen in the commercial .
In addition , this advertisements would affect on the markets and stores that distribute and sell these products , especially if they were new stores .
These stores would buy the products in huge amounts and they may lose a lot of money when the customers stop buying these wily products .
Finally , this kind of advertisements leads to a limited happiness and success for its companies .
When the people discover the truth of this products , they will stop buying them , them the success end .

To conclude , I believe this kind of advertisements do n't last for a long period and cause many
