Knowledge is considered as a key for any progress in human life .
Through knowledge people can be able to develop the standard of their daily life .
They also be able to improve their social and cultural status among others .
For example , If some one who specializes in energy , but having broad knowledge about other branches of science and cultures could deal with so many matters as the same time .
Also this broad knowledge will help him to communicate with many societies of different cultures .
At the social level a guy with this broad knowledge will find himself having a very sensitive rank in the community for all people will refer to him to have consultancies and advises .

On the other hand a guy confining himself to a single specific specialization with no knowledge in other sciences will be isolated and have limited contributions at social , cultural and economic levels .
For instance if some one specializing in mathemics with no ther knowledge will only make contributions to development of this community through this field .
But if he is asked to contributed to other fields that are needed with aview of developing his community , he fail to do so .

From other perspective having broad knowledge means your are capable to serve you homecountry and your people whenever they need your help and assitance during hard times .

So we should urge all people around the world , in general , and our own people in particlar to make use of their leisure time to have a broad knowledge about different subjects that may contribute in the development of their countries .
For example , if some one 's major is in physician , but his countries is a great need for some one with a background in economics , he will provide unvaluable advise when needed .

Therefore , I strongly recommend and support the multiplicity of specializations for all people with concentrating on one of them .
