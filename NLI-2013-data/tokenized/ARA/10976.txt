A wize mane wance said `` knowing a thing about every thing is better than knowing every thing about one thing '' , he said it once and i will allway will repate it , i see my self as a successful persone in my community because i allways try to learn more and more in my life even the unneccassery issue i would like to know even a littel about them .

doing your job successfully is a good thing , but dowing more than one subject in a verey good way in better and more effective in your life. here is some benifits of having a several things that you can do corractlly :
1 - the abillity to work in more than one job .
2 - you will earn more mony .
3 - having a mind that is full of ambitions and attendans .

imagin yourself btween a new groub of frinds or withe your frinds at work and a very exiting subject has been ocuerd and the others are talking about it while you dont know what thay are sayng !!
that 's a scema i wolud not like to be in .

in a higher level , lets say community aspects .
in order to have a verey bounded and secure community it will be verey usfule if the partecepants ia this comunity know how to do more than one thing in there life 's .

even in the sports field it will be better fore your body to experince more than one movment like hikking and swimming one is in the water and the othere is in the mountens but both are good and healthy even if its risky in a way or anothr but risk is the only attribute that makes this life more enjoyable and tastable .

pepole live only one life - as far as i know - stoping yourself from doing any thing in your life in un questionable if you answer this question : How many times you will live ?
