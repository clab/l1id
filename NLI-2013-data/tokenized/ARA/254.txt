Many organization centres depend mostly on teaching their students the concept of a lesson or structure , as they think it would provide them with better knowledge skills and life experience .
But other organizations are strict enough to teach what they were thought , and what books are to mention , that is `` facts '' .

I agree with the statement , as it is true in my opinion .
Being a student in a class requires a lot of efforts of listening to the teacher , in many cases , my classmates and i used to daydream in the class .
This is subject to happen only when facts are to be learnt .
Like for example , if we are told about a result of a particular policy in lets ' say , economics subject , it wo n't sound interesting at all , instead , most of us used to feel bored and felt sleepy .
If economics is to be more interesting , these facts which are being thought could be diversified into ideas and concepts based on reality , for example , our school could schedule for us an access to different industries from different sectors , depending on the lesson objectives .
This will not only create a joyful environment in the class , but , instead it wont vanish from our brains so easily ! .
Facts are to be forgotten in a day or another , whereas , concepts and ideas would never be forgotten .
We would always picture the idea or experience again .
Many of us graduate annualy from different universities , but has anyone of us gained a job experience based on our major in the university , the answer is no ! .
Instead we have to ought ourselves to hard work to get the experience from companies , and get paid low wages , some of us are humiliated ! .
Many of us have n't yet completed our master degree , and we require a job to pay for our masters , however , many companies do not employ us because of the lack of experience .
This problem can be solved by providing the undergraduate or high school students with life based experience , not far from facts , but facts attached with reality and which can be cleared from doubts and misunderstanding .
