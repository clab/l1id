First of all the years of young is great years and they will be a great memories when the young get old .
The young years is like a fresh flower but will be dead when the young get old .
Every body does n't want to be old , every body want to be young .
Actually the young people has diffrent properties than old people .
The young people they are more healthy than old people .
The young people also they can run long distance than old people .
But the young people they ca n't feel about their young years untill when they get old .
Which is that wrong .
The young poeple they should secure their young and trying to keep it with them untill when they get old .
Some examples for how to secure their young years by playing sports , eating fruits , vegetabils , and doing excersice every single day , etc .

Secondly iam not agree or diagree yet until i finish from my explaining about the young and old peoples .
Actually some of old people they are tired and they have physical problems .
These problems what they have from their young years because when they were young they did n't use it correctly .
By different reasons could be smoking , not that much exercise , or do n't eat goods , etc .
So the young people they should take care for them selfs and try to get away from the bad things that can harm their young .

Thirdly the young people life could turn to the old people by the reasons i mentioned in the second phargraph and also the old people life could be like the young people life .
So the young life is not everything unless they take care of it .
Also if the old people take care of them selves they will live better than the young people life .

In conclusion i agree about the young people enjoy there life more than the old people unless they take care of it .
Finally i would say if we take care of our selves we will enjoy our lives with out any trouble or facts that can stop us from enjoying our life .
