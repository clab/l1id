I certainly dont agree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
If a person wants to enjoy his/her life they can enjoy it no matter how old they are .
Enjoying life doesnt depend on how old a person is , however ; it depends on how the person is .
being sociable , appreciating what you have , and have the positive way of thinking are all characteristics a person contains but it differs in people , what kind of person they are .

Being a sociable person has a major affect on a person .
If a person dislikes being around people then he wont be able to enjoy life because he/she are not seeing people of different cultures that entertain you .
This unsociable person would end up being alone not wanting to interact with the outside word .

One of the major reasons that would make a person enjoy his life is appreciating what he/she has .
If a person does not do so he would n't be living that of a nice life .
For ex : If a poor girl is friends with a rich girl and this poor girl wants to wear and have what the rich girl has the that is a big problem because the girl would not be able to afford certain things .
By not appreciating what she has she would suffer alot and would n't really enjoy life .

If a person wants to really enjoy life he/she would no matter who he/she really was .
Sitting around thinking of all the bad things would just depress the person more and more and not allow him/her enjoy there life .
Therefore a person shoudl just live his/her life and enjoy it .

In conclusion all people would enjoy life no matter how old they are .
If the person wants to enjoy life then this person would enjoy it no matter what .
