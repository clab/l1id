Travel with Tour guide

Many people travle to anothere country to learn or to see the other cultures .
in order to do that people should have some i nformation about the country thery are going too .
Then they can konw more about the country or the place thery are planning to go to .
there many way to do that one for example reading abook or ask some freinds or go to atravel agency to help them or to advise them to place that they sould go to .
i think the best way of having more information and konlwegd is have tour giude that can help the travlers and makre them have fun .

I think that is i good way to know more information and make the travelers dont miss the best places that people should visite .
I think that more effective and helpfful because , having a tour guide and he or she is usualy form the place that the traveler are heading too .
The tour guide will provied much inforamtiom and rsonse to the traveler much then asking a freind .
For example he or she will have the best to teach or inflounce the traveler .

In addetion , some times the tour giude will teach the traveler the country clutures and languge or slang that travel agency can not do .
That will make them have more infornmation knowleged and inflonuce about the people who live in this country .

Also , it will make it easy for the travelr to ask them about the culture .
Because usualy traveler have a lot of question that they need to now about the culture that they are going to and it is not easy for them to ask someone who live there .
Also the tour giude can interduoce the people or the travelr to the cultur food or best places to go or the best hotles or city because they will much konlwged about it .
For example , last year i went with my famliy to Hong Kong , China which is the biggest city the east cosat of China .
We had toure giude , he helkp us and lead us to the right places that it is covienet for my family and the othere travelers who were with us in the group .
actually he advises us to the cheap and good hotle for us .

I think that people should tkae a tour giude if they want to enjoy there time and mkae thier trips teach them and inflounce them beside just having fun .
