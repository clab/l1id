I totally agree with the statment that states `` most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are '' .
In order to begin my essay and to build it on examples from real life , we have to understand what is the role of televisions , radios , newspapers , etc , they all wants to collect profit , as they are all considered to be profitable institutions .

By making products seem much better than they really appear in advertisments in different kinds of media , they are actually encouraging the consumer ( people ) to buy from that product .
To support my idea , lets take an example of something that people face in real life .
Nescaffe , yes it is a delecious hot drink , in most advertisments they say that it makes the person to relax from the daily problems and obsticles facing him , but indeed , it is a drink that contains caffeine , and caffeine is a substance that makes people to be more offensive or active .

Another example , which is widely spread especially in the United States of America , is the advertisments of the `` take away '' restaurants or those who deliver jung food as MacDonald and Berger King .
Food is nice there , yes this is a fact , but what is also considered to be a fact , is that eating too much of the jung food has an enormus effect on the human health , as it increases the chances for Diabetus , increases the risks of having high blood preasure and increases the chances of developing atheroscloroses , especially for aged people .

Another significant example , is advirtising for alcohol drinks as beer , the advertisments are made in order to attract people to a certain commodity .
By making the advertisment , they are not taking into consideration that there might be underaged people or teenagers that are watching the advertisment .
What is known about teenagers from both sex , is that they are passing a period of time where they are curious to try and experience everything .
And from here , it is obvious that advertisments not only make things appear much better than they really are , but they control the human mind as well as the human desire .

All in all , i agree one hundred persent with the statement where most advertisments make products look much better than they really are .
In this essay i focused on dealing with the topic by giving eaxmples from real life , and examples that are important for the people to be aware of especially in our century .
