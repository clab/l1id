I totally disagree with the statement .
In fact I do not think that neither young people nor older people can claim that they better enjoy their lives .
Each group can enjoy it 's life equally .
People who claims that young people may better enjoy their lives may claim that this is because they have helthier bodies , this is not true because nothing is absolute in this world we can find a lot of older people who are even healthier than younger ones .
There are many young people who have disabilities , does this mean that they can not enjoy their lifves ?
of course not , they maybe enjoying their lives much more than other individuals .
The secret is in the spirit it does n't matter how old you are to use your time the best in something you really appreciate and that brings joy into your life .
I could even claim that older people might have better chances to enjoy their lives much more than younger ones and this is simply because they have much more time than younger people who spend most of their time working and spinning in the wheel of the life to cover their basic needs while older people who are most propably retired can find some time for their lesiure and nobody would belame them cause they have already completed their mission in life and it 's just time for them to look after themselves , they can travel all around the world and have both the time and money to do this while most of the younger people do n't have the time except for a week of vacation every year and if they have the time they might not afford this .
It 's always thought that the best time the farmer can experience is the harvest time when he can see all the efforts he 's been doing for the whole season in front of his eyes and this is very similar older people can always enjoy the harvest of their entire life especially when they had done it right and had been working hard for their entire life .
These are some of the reasons that make me think that young people do n't enjoy life more than older peolpe .
