Young people are the futers communitie .
I disagree whith that for several reasons .
First , they are helping there community by living in it .
Second , they are studing real hard to acheave something to represent there community .
Finally , they are doing community projects all there life .

The existance of Young people in a communite gives it the strength to survive .
Young people usually spread joy , happyness , and movement whithin the place there at .
For example , a house full of children is usually loud an crouded which brings the sence of life in the speret .
On the contrast of the childe free houses which are quite and boring .

The students are bulding there community .
When a student is studing to become a doctor or an engeneer or a fireman , he is doing his communety one of the biggest help his community could ever get .
He is going to give hid community someone who could cure the sick or help the fritened or give the homeless a shelter .

The young people are projects for there communities .
The successful life of the young is the hope of the old .
The young people have alot of goals to achive , alot of dreams to presode , and every acomplishment for them is an acomplishment for their communities .
When a young person achives a high goal he makes his whole community proud .

To conclude , the young people are the harte of the community .
they are the doctors , angeneers , firemen , and every important thing of the futer .
they are there commities success and faliar .
Even if it does n't seam that there making time for community serves , they are serving there community all there time .
