studying is important for people through all the world because it is the only thing that you can use to face the life problems and need .
i think that it is more important for students to learn and understand ideas rather than learing facts because ideas and concepts are better in many ways such as if you understand the idea or concept you will be able to use it or get benifit from it .
other than that ideas are more easy to be understand from any person at any time and it is easier to be used or done .
the facts are things that you learn and do on paperand you well quickly forget them if yopu dont use them butideas well remain in your brain and you well never fogot them tell you day while facts are think based on paper and equations the new schools and university depend on both ideas and concept and fact but as a student i think that fact are helpful in the school and universities while ideas are important for both life behind the school walls and in this huge world where knowledge can act as the boat you seal with in the ocean of life and the candle that shine you life .
further more ideas and concept are easy way to examine the understand of the student and easily presented by the student also the teacher at the same time at the end i well remind with the importance of studying and knowledge to people and student because you with out them mean nothing and no one will respect you some thing other than this students get board from only facts and school books they need to understand and know other ideas which may help them in school and there extirior life .
