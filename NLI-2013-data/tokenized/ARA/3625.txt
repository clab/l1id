Nowadays , the people are not as the same as the people in the past .
In the past they were wise enough and give enogh time for everything .

The time now is very important , and we must be carefull of it , because it is in our hands and also everything now rely on the time .

But the young people , they want everything to to be done as quickly as possiple .
For example , they do not like to wait much .

They must do everything carefully and wisly and like this they will not waste time , and they can help their communities in everything , they can do all their works in a good way .

But , nowadays , they do not take care about these things , because of the new envitions , which make them like this .
And we all are responsibe about this , I mean that we must help the young people in everything that will make them take care of time to help their communities , because the young people can do everything better than the other people , and this is because they have a streangh and the power to do difficlt works .

For example , in the important places like banks , they want everything , whatever they do , to be done quickly .

And as i said , the new envenyions today , make them like this , for example , the TV , computer , internet and another things .
They make them careless , not care about the community generally , they will do everything they can do to make the time go faster .

In the end , I think that everyone must take care about the time , like he oung people , because everything rely on them to make the community better , and to make it very beautiful in it , and we must help each other to do this .
