I do not agree nor disagree with the statement .
Traveling with a group led by a toure guide is intresting , the tour guied will stat information about the place we are visiting , so we can get knowledge on the place .
Also he is an expert with the famous places which attract visitores from different countries , so we can denifit from his expierience .
Furthermoe , we will guarantee that we did not miss anyplace with in the tour .

The beautiful part in traveling with group is we can share information about different cltuers from people all over the world .
i like to learn about cultures it is very intresting to find that some beleives that are forbbiden in some cultures are allowed in others , therefore when people visit other countries will knoe how to react with some people .
For example certain words are allowed to be used in me country but not allowed in other contries , so when I visit that other country I would say a wored that would cause a big trouble for me

On the other hand , when traveling in a group the individuals will be tied up with the group , sometimes we need to spend some family time to explore the country weare visiting and try some restaurants , spend more time in a musiem and buy some sevoniers .

In my opinion I will try both traveling ina group led by a tour guide or travel alon with my family , because each one of them has its own experience and adventure that we can keep wonderfull memorise in our mindes , i would like in some day to visit all the lovley places that i heard from people .

Each individual has a different point of view , and every person will make the right selection for themselves to enjoy what they can to make good times las
