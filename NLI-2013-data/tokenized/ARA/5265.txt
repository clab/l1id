nowadays the technology advanced and still advancing huge steps .
this is true in every field of human life and human interest , specifically the media .
also it is obvious the tight relationship between medias and advertisement .
since no one can fight a today war by a yesterday arms , the advertisement introduced himself in every single field of our normal life , going from education to food etc .

advertisement also has a primordial role in publishing and presenting any new isuue to the society .
in order to succeed his mission the advertiser has to sell his product , means he has to present to the the public , to challenge other products and to prove the new product the best and more efficient one in answering the consumer 's needs , here is the tie and here lurcks the danger .
the product needs two things to succeed .
at first it needs the advertisement to present itself to others , otherwise nobody will be able to hear or now about it , a good example is a heeling herb in an isolated country .
nobody can get its benefit other than the population of this country unless it has the advertisement it needs .

and the other essential thing is the quality .
because it doesn not matter how big the advertisement is , finally people will discover the truth and if this product or the fact that this advertisement is telling about is not good or not true the results will be opposite .
here the tobaco can be an example .
at first advertisement presented tobaco like a heaven vessels , able to bring them all the benefits and pleasures , but finally this advertisement was opposed and faced by studies and medical researches that proved this counterfactual stereotype .

in summ , i would say that always the best way is the direct way .
meaning the honesty which does n't deny the role of a honest advertisement .
