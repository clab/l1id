Is it more importent for students to understand ideas and concepts than its for them to learn facts ?
This question offenly asked by parents that have dificultis with the academic level of thier children .
In my opinion its better for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

An idea or a concept may sometimes be the result that becomes a fact .
So if we understanded the idea we could conclude the fact but if we memroize a fact we can not conclude its idea since we dont no have the main base which is the idea .
If we take for example Ineshtine , when he discovered the nuclears a wide path of both good and bad inventions were discovered .

the teacher in the school explains for students ideas and concepts then let them memorize facts becouse sometimes a whole lesson can talk about one idea that results many facts .
If you want to understand and memorize the lesson 's facts you must know the main idea that the lesson is talkin about .
Solving a math problem is the best example for this idea .
Supose u need to prove the fact that this equation is defined or not , you will began solving using the conepts and evntually end up with fact that it defined or not .

Although a fact seams to most of us easier to memorize than understanding a concept or an idea .
But if we only memrized a fact it will have no meaning or no logical explanation for it in our mind , so as a result , we forget it quickly .
But if we knew the idea or the concept tne memorization will take no time and the fact will live in our memory for ever .

finally , knowing and idea and a concept is much better than memorizing a fact and if the fact was described as a location , i guess that the idea will be the bridge that will lead you to that location .
