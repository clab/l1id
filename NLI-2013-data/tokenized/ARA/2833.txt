Young people are more likely to enjoy life than older people .
Age factor is one the main reasons that put life of older people whithin limits .
First of all , most sports require an age limit , such as Tennis and Foot-Ball .
As an Example , my father loves Foot-Ball but he can no longer play it , because he cannot run as fast as he used to .
Another example is Mountain Climbing .
Most mountain climbers are young because this kind of activity require good heart rates and endurance , and as we all know , the older a person gets , the less his heart operates due to age factor .
Second , older people have less sex drive than they had before .
Also , old women can no longer have babies after 45th year of their age .
Young people can perform lot of sports activities .
Most sports players are less than 25 years old as required by most sports .

As a result , unlike older people who are usually on diet or on medical treatments that prevents them from eating or drinking what they like , most younger people do not fall under those restrictions that prevents a person from doing what he or she likes to do .
