Nowadays life is tough and expensive and young people have a lot of responsibilies in their life .
Depending on the economic system and depending on the country where they live , most of the young people have to study to get a diploma to be able then to find a job to earn money and be independant from their parents , so studying takes a lot of time and some of them need to work as well as to study , so it would be very hard to hep other or give time to the community .
To stay healthy , most of the young people spend time in the gym or practicing sport outside and that will take an extra time .
A small percentage of young people get engaged very early and maybe they have family to take care of so this will lead to lack of free time other than for the family members and for work , depending on the employment law , young people would need to work full time duty and would n't have time to help outside .
when young people come from wealthy families , or depending on the family education they have , maybe these conditions will allow them to be helpful for their communities to improve the community they are living in , to help needy people , and each young person can participate with his personnal skillls and possibility for the best of all the community members .
Everyone of us can be a active member to help others , because in that way we can be stronger ans life may look easier to us and to others and who knows , maybe oneday we will need help so we will be happy to find support from others .

In my opinion , everyone can have little time to give to his community to improve our life and have a better future in our own country of citizenship or residency .

As an active member in my community , and as a mother of 2 children , i can help others by giving little time for psycholgical support for needy persons and helping children to have their vaccinations updated , in that way i can help improve our life in the community
