Most of people like travel all over the word and every one have his personatly which different from othres .
they have to think how they will sped time and make plan for that .
I disagree to travel in a group led by a tour guide because maybe he has different intersting and ther is no time for rest .
first , travel in a group led by a tour guide is not always good because i have my oppinone about which place i prefer to visit our to spend long time in one place .
for example , five yeas ago i went with group tour from Germany to franc but i did not find any time to visit my feavoert place because i have to follow the leader in addition we have big different in age .
so i will not did travel with a group leader .

Second , there is a spicfice time for us to visit many place and i have to follow the guider and lisson to him so you can not rest if you like this or that place because he has plane for the trip .
while travel in a group led by a tour guide good to see many thing in short time and with a person who has knowldge but it nice to do what you want with out any bother .

in conclusion , evey preson has a different intersing thing to spend and have a good time when he travel .
i disagree with travel in a group led one guide because , i have my intersting and i travel to spend a lot of my time in rest and relax not for follow a guide maybe he is deffrent form me .
