We live in a community that needs some help from all the its individuals , espacielly from the young people , were they give most of their time for playing games , going out and having fun .
By that they totaly forget about their community and the duties that have to do for it .

In our days today we have to give young people the maximume attention that we can offer them , because we live in a society that has many tools to blind them and make them lose the right track .
For example if we ask a young boy weather he likes to go fishing or go clean the beach from wastes , his answer is going to be `` lets go fishing '' , he might not even know that there are some people whom actually clean the beach .
This happens from the lack of attention that we should have given for them to know more about their community and the problems that their community faces .

Another factor which makes a young boy go fishing , is the number of places that we have for children to have fun and play and at the same time the absence of places that tell our children about out community and that we actually have duties towards our community .

I strongly agree with the statment
