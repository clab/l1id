I agree that people must try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well and that is because when you learn new things and do new things you meet new people and that is good because once you known alot of people you will succeseed in your life and if you do n't take the risk and stay where you are you will not be able to know new things and new people and that acually be boring and less fun and you will not be able understand the things you face in the future if you do n't known nothing about anything exept the things you know from before but when you learn new things you will be able to see things more clearly than before and if you do n't take risks you are not living you life like you should you must take risks and learn new things and meet new people to be a successful man .

For example if you have two companies each one of them works in a kind and one of them fail you will have the other one , but if you just work in one kind of work and have one company you will lose everything that is why i like learning new things the taking risks .
