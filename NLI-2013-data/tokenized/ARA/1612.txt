`` it is better to habe broad knowledge of many subjects than to specialise in one specific subject '' i surely agree with this statement because when you have a bigger baggage of cultural and scientifical informations you can be a better person and live a better life in all of its aspects but none the less for certain people to specialise in one specific subject will be more useful to them than to specialise in many academic subjects .

First of all when you have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects you have a good degree wich will help you in the course of your life per example you will have a bigger chance to get employed then another applier that have only specialised in one specific subject so it will help improve your revenue .
And this variety of academic subjects couls also help you in your social life where you are informed to lots of informations that could be a subject of a conversation with another inbdivudual .
And a person benefits the most by his broad information is the intellegence and the experiences that could help him in how he lives his life , the way he thinks about things , the way he reacts to certain things , his interests his taste .

All these advantages are useful to the person has decided to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and has the capacity of achieving this goal .
But some persons dont have the same capacity so for this category of people it is better for them to specialise in one specific subject where they can be good at it .

As a conclusion i can repeat that i am and i aplly this statement in my personnal life because it opens more doors and enhanse your life with various informations , but if someone hasnt the ability to conduct this way of life it would be better for him to specialise in one subject so he could be good at it because in this case it is better to be good in one subject than be bad in all of the others subjects because we dont have the time or the ability to succed .
