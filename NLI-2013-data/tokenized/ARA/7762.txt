Some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
Others like to travel alone without a tour guide .
As far as I am concerned , I think that travelling in a group led by a a tour guide is too much better than travelling alone without a guide .
This is due to various reasons .

A reason why it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guide is that it is safer .
When you travel to a new place , You probably do not know too much about it .
Thus , if you travel without having a tour guide , you can get lost .
Also , you might not know the language of the foreign country , so you will not be able to ask about directions .
Moreover , if you are in trouble , you can not ask for help because you do not know who to ask and you do not know the language .

Another reason is that it is more relaxing to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
You do not have to worry about what to do next or how to spend your time .
The tour guide will plan everything for you .
All you have to do is to enjoy your time and take photos .
It is certainly easier and helps you make better use of your time .

Beside being relaxing , the tour guide will help you and explain things for you .
For instance , if you go to a museum , he will tell you everything about it .
Further , If you have any problem , the tour guide will support you and help you find a solution for it .
Also , if you have a question about anything , you can ask your tour guide .

Most importantly , Travelling in groups and with a guide is really enjoyable .
You will never feel alone .
You can also do alot of activities with the people you travel with .
Moreover , you can be friends and keep in touch after that .
You will never feel loonely or bored .
It is really interesting .

In short , travelling in a group led by a tour guide has many benefits and advantages .
It is safe , enjoyable , easier and relaxing .
I completely agree that it is the best way of travelling .
