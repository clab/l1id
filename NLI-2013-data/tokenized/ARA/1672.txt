The following statement `` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. '' is a faulse statement lacking evidence to support such an argument .
The passage below will demonstrate , through three examples , how the above statement is inaccurate .

Firstly , if the population of the world continued to educate their children , or adults in many subjects then the world will have too many people that know a little bit about everything and none that know accuratley and condensly about specific subjects .
If we take the case of Jordan or Saudi Arabia , we find that the education system has proved to be less successful than that in the west , namely the A level , or IGCSE system .
Studies have shown that students tend to do badley when the education system includes many subjects .
The English system for example , has proved quite successul .
We find that students tend to choose subjects of interest , and tend to focus quite well and progress flourishingly at university since they focus all their efforts at subjects of interest and tend to excell .
It has also been proven that if a student enjoys a subject such as Math they tend to do considerably well , and may never excell in subjects they dislike due to the left part of their brain working better .
Studies have shown that the human brain is split into to categories , the more creative side , and the more mathematical side .
It is upto the subjects to excell those parts of the brain more considerably .

Secondly , if indeed we broaden the knowledge of students into many subjects , we will find a lack in quality in nearly everything .
If we take the following examples , we find that in disciplines such as Architecture , Urbanism , or even Medicine ; a need for an accumulative time frame where constant knowledge is used to develop in such subjects .
If an Architect , did not spend an approximation of ten years learning and mastering the topic , then the work will be far less than perfect .
Ofcorse , it is always useful for one to learn more about other subjects generally , however it is important to relate them back to one discipline to actively excell in a particular topic .

Thirdly , we find that at Postgraduate level , the reason the world is moving forward and excelling in terms of technology , science , and what have you , is due to researching specific topics at a higher level .
A PHD professor spends all his time focussing , and detailing a single topic for 3 to 11 years , and that is when the subject moves beyond it traditional scope .
We also find that respectable institutions have continuously been re-inventing new topics of education such as Human resourse education , and emotional intelligence .
If we strived to learn all topics in their totality , then we would lack sufficient resources to keep expanding and creating new forms of education .

In conclusion , we find that one needs to focus and free himself of external factors in order to succeed in life .
As illustrated above the definition of success is the amount of knowledge one has gained in a particular topic to the degree where he has created and invented a new form of language to offer back to the world .
If we all attempt to learn about many topics in general , then we will loose the devoted time to excell in just one .
As mentioned , and supported in the examples above , the art to mastering a topic is to devote much time to perfecting the information up to the final elements .
As the saying goes : `` God is in the detail '' .
