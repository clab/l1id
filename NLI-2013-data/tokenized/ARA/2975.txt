I do agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people have a lot of energy inside of them , that motivates them to go further into new fields and explore new ideas .
And that physical power that help them to resist hard times .
These explorations and resistance make them atchieve their goalstherefore enjoy life .
While old people have n't got this energy and physical power to motivate them and lead them to theiir dreams .

Young people have this gift , inside of them , energy and physical power .
This energy and physical power can motivate them and lead them to accomplish their own dreams , and by accomplishing their dreams , the term enjoying life is fullfield .
For example , if a young man has the dream to become a doctor , inorder to cure sick people .
Therefore to become a doctor that requires alot of work and study .
Alot of people might say that he does n't enjoy life , but the true fact is that , he is enjoying life by doing the only thing he thinks will proff his existance and will improve from people 's lives .

On the other hand , if an old person had the same dream of becoming a doctor , will be very hard for him to accomplish it , because he does n't have that gift any more , the energy .
Without having the energy , he will struggle to accomplish his dream .
I 'm not saying that he wo n't accomplish his dream , no what I mean is that he wo n't enjoy his life in order to accomplish his dream .
He will fight against his poor resisting body in order to reach his dream .
At last he did it , he accomplished what he was aiming to .
But if we put the young and the old of this example in comparison , the two accomplished their dreams , but the young is the one who enjoyed life .
He enjoyed the pleasure of using the energy inside of him in order to motivat him , so he may reach his goal

To conclude , young people have a gift , they may use it or not , that depends to their inspiration to fullfil their dreams .
This gift of energy and physical power gives them the opportunity to fullfil their dreams , on the other hand , old people lack these traits .
