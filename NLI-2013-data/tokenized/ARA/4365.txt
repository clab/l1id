Young people are the future .
They do n't realize this anymore .
They are becoming not effective in there communities .
Young people spend time on usless stuff , they are relayable , and have studying as an excuses everytime they are asked to do something .

Young people tend to spend so much time on fun stuff rather than helping their community .
Most young people surf the net for approximately four hours a day .
This makes them forget about what sorrounds them .
They also spend their time chatting on mobiles .
They hang out with each other and talk about what happend in their day .
They do n't spend time thinking about their future in this communty and how they must be an effective part in it .

Young people relay on adults in doing many things .
Relaying on adults would close their eyes from what sorrounds them .
For example , if a young son relays on his father in paying all his fees , he would not have the chance to try having a job .
Having a job would show him what his community needs .

Most young people have studying as an excuse for not helping in the community .
This is not a proper excuse for not helping their community because each one of us can manage time if they want to do so .
For example , students can help their communities by doing community work in their schools .
Such as selling crafts for charity work .
They may toture other students to help them with what is hard on them .
All of these characteristics would help their community improve .

Young People must change .
Their community needs them .
They the leaders of the future .
They must care about their community .
This community was improved by people that were young one day .
What do those old young people have that nowadays young people do n't ?
