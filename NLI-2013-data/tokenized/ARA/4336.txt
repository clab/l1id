I dont ' agree on the following statement because it is essential for people to contribute to their societies through volunteer work and youths in general , tend to be very active and motivated to offfer their help at any time .
Schools , universities , hospitals and many more present different tasks to encourage young people to help other people in their communities through volunteering .
For example , a person could volunteer to teach young children a non-native language , or others could organize a charity for the needy in their neighbourhoods such as donating food , clothing , medicine and money especially during the Holy month of Ramadan .
Helping the environment can result in educating students the importance of recylcing and maintaning a healthy atmosphere to live in .

We live in an age , where every person can be creative and can introduce new ways to strenghten the bonds between people and community work could do it , for instance the senior citizens need recreation so it is important for youths to find methods of entertaining them as part of their dedication to help the socieities where they live in .
Students can also do their best to organize festivals and gatherings for children and the handicapped .
Everybody wants to be part of a community that appreciates hard work and the enthusiasm of young people ready to make a difference no matter where they live or how they think .
