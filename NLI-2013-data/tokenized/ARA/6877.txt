Some people think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , i disagree , i think there will be more cars as cars are very succesful investment , it is very important way of transportation , and it is a wonderful tool to enjoy your life .

First of all , cars are succesful investment , every one knows well that these factories that producing cars earn millions of dollars every year , these factories are in great competition with each others they do their best in order to produce unique , stylish cars in order to sell more and more cars and so earn more money , every year we find hundreds of new models from different countries , such a competetion is increasing every day and so cars increasing also .

Another imporatant point is that cars is considered as one of the most imporant transportation , if you have your own car you could go to any place at any time taking your family members with you and it only costs you the price of gasoline , such a job would be so diffecult if you decide to use another way of transportation such as bus , taxi or train , it would cost you more time , money and more efforts , as a result car is considered as essential need nowadays and so it `` s number is markedly increasing .

In addition to have a car means you could enjoy your time , you could out together with your friends and go to any interesting or exciting place .
you could make a tour on your city , you can visit your friends whose houses are far away from yours , as car s are considered as a way of entertainment , it become a comon gift at these days , i cant deny that the most important gift i have ever received is the car i received from my father at my graduation day .

I think in twenty years there will be more cars in use as factories produce more and more cars in order to earn more money , and as our need of cars is markedly increase either as a good way of transportation , or as a gift .
