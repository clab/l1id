I agree that people should have knowledge of many academic subjects , rather than specializing in one subject .

Having knowledge of a lot of subjects helps a person be ready for anything that come up in his life .
Whether its a problem in math , science , etc. it helps a person over come them with ease .
If u specialize in one subject , for e.g. english , it is hard to solve a solution in math , therefore finding it very hard to co-op with math .
While as having a range of subjects , it will be easy to solve .

Another thing is that having a wider knowledge on more subjects , opens a lot of opertunity doors for a person .
If someone wants to be a pilot , he needs to know math , physichs , and english , but if you are just specialized in english , well math , and physichs will be hard subjects to work with .
I am not saying that specializing in a subject is a bad thing , but it does n't give you a lot of oppertunities .

Also having more knowledge on different subjects helps a student in college co-op with all the subjets that he/she is doing .
While as a person specializing in one subject will find it hard to co-op with the other subjects that he/she are taking .
Specializing is good when a person has a vast knowledge on the subject that , he/she want to specialize in .

In conclusion i find that having more knowledge on a veriety of different subjects helps the person in real life , and academic purposess .
It will reflect on that person as being smart , and being to co-op with many things in life .
