as the time passe , the world undergo many changes in all fields and aspects of life .
people can sense the changes in their surroundings , their life styles and ofcoures in their attitudes towards different issues .

we may think of the coming future in many different ways and see it from variuos point of views .
some of us are obtimistic looking at the future from a positive out look , expecting the best to come and hoping for further development with less damage .
others see the future from a different angle , thinking that the non-stop progress of modern technology will bring the earth into an unpleasant end .

the future is not our time it is the time of our comoing generations , we only have the present time , and only the present time that we could change and improve , however , our actions in the present time will participate in shaping the future , therefore we have to consider both the short term and long term consiquences of any action that we are about to take inorder to ensure our childern a better and safer future .

it is hard to predict wether if the number of cars in 20 years will be more or less than the presnt time .
taking into account the rapid growth of world population and the increasing life demands , that urges people to move from one place to an other , to get their needs done .
you may think that the number of cars is more likely going to increase by two or three folds , this is unlikely to happen for few reasons , first , in oredr to fit this great number of cars new roads should be built and the old one should be expanded to fit the significant number of cars , which means that government have to reconstruct the infrastructure of the cities in order to apply such alterations and to so great deal of money must be spent that will most probably exceed the government 's budget in most countries , on top of that the international economy is declinig and the economist perdicitons indicate that this decline will continue for next 40 or 50 years ahead .
governments will search for more effective means for transportation that produce less environmental hazards , like under developing the current under ground transportations and increasing the capacity also some regulating laws may be passed in which cars are not allowed to be used unless if the number of passangers exceeds 4 people .

as a result the number of cars in the future is most likely to remain the same if not decline upon the intorduction of new transporation means .
