Nowadyas , every one wants to make an advertisment for every thing that he has .
Ths is because it is a very helpful way to let people know about what you have , and what it looks like .
Advertisements are a way that helpe people to know some information about the products , but a lot of peple exagorate in advertising about their products .

Some people do n't know a lot about the itmes that they want , and they buy them without knowing any information about them unless when they read an advertisment .
For example , when some one want to buy a computer , he may read something about it and then he goes to buy it .
He may not find the right person to ask about what he wants to buy , so he believes what is written on the advertisments .
On the other hand , some companies take this thig as awy to help them in selling their products .
They may make a lot of advertisments to let people buy what they have .

It is imprtant to have someone has an experions in some cases because companies like to exagorat in their products .
When you want to buy something you sould buy something reasonable , or you should ask some that he knows about what you are buying .
In my case , when I want to buy a computer I ask my borther about it because he is very good in computers , and he knows every thing about them .
It is importnat to buy something that you know because you are not going to know about it till you buy it .

Companies sould care about how the people feel when they buy their products because when they do this they are not going to exagorate in their products .
On the other hand people should know what they are buying beucase it is safer for their money .
