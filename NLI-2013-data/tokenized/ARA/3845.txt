i strongly disagree with the statment which suggests that young people nowadys do not give enough time to help and aid their communities , because young people are currently much educated and oriented than other young people who lived in the past due to the advances in all fields of education , technology , social services and becuase of the emergence of the active social charities and communities all over the globe .

young people nowadays represent a major part of the community , and they are aware of how hard and difficult maintaining a good life can be , they are noticing how the crime level is escalating severly , and how there are an increase in the number of homeless children , and that a lot of people are not recieving good health services .

all of these mentioned examples will cause young people to be scared and force them to ask questions like :
- how might we survive through all this ?
- is what i am seing now will happen to me or to the people whom u love ?
- whats waiting us next ?

well , by asking all these questions , another one come in mind and that question is : `` what can i do to make this place a better one ? '' and the answer right away will be : '' act now '' . young people can do a lot of things , for instance they can participate in social activites , they can voulenteer in communities and charities which are directed to promote and encourage people life , others can enroll in programes that focus on environment preservations .

i truly believe that young people can and will be of great help , yet we must provide space for them express themselves , and provide them with all the means neccessary to ensure the integrity of their work because , sometimes the problem lies in us , that is adults in really understanding what young people can do , therefore we must quit the idea that these young cannot do any good , because they can .
