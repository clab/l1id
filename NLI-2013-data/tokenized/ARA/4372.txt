I think young people have the right to do whatever they want as soon as they are not hurting anyone or causing any problems .
But they have to give somithing to the community they are living in .

Nowadays there are so many things keep young people busy such as games and computers .
But that is not a good reason for them to avoid their assignment to their communities .

Most of young people nowadays are careless .
They dont want to work or help in order to improve their community .
On the other hand there are some great examples of young people who give help to their communities .

I think it is not fair to judje young because of few examples .
Everyone has to controll his wants and try to help his community as much as he can .
