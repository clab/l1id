Eversince the last century , the car , introduced by the worldwide-best-seller Ford-T in the twenties , has become the most popular mean of transportation .
And nowadays it has even become more than that .

Actually , the car is now much more than just a mean of transportation , it has become a real social attribute , the bigger your car is , the higher you are on the social ladder .
Reducing the number of cars does not only implies a change in our habits of transportation but a complete change in the way we think .

Another example of the way the car has influenced our society are the american cities .
The way these cities are built is nearly an ode the car ...
It 's too difficult to move without a car , but that does n't matter because cars are still cheap in the US .
I do n't think twenty years will be enough ( a genration is twenty-five years ) for our socity to change .
However , some issues could help .

Indeed , the environment and particularly the global warming have become major issues for our planet , and the car is one of the biggest pollution sources on the planet .
Furthermore , the planet is running out of oil , implying an expensive energy , and that 's becoming more and more a problem .
However I am not worried for the future of the car , because new technology will overcome these diffculties .
We are nearly entering a new era , electric or even hyrogen engines will soon be availiable , leaving a bright future to the car .
Cars wo n't disappear , they 're just entering into their revolution , that 's it .

When I was young I used to think that Aliens existed , well actually I do think they exist , and I thought that the first thing they 'll see when arriving on earth would be our roads and our cars moving at any time of the day and night .
For sure they would think that the inhabitants of earth would be cars ...
Why would you want the inhabitants of earth to disappear ?
