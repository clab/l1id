I agree with that statement because learning facts are based on understanding ideas .
Students cannot learn new facts without knowing where they came from or what corroberates them .
for some people , memorizing a new fact is enough .
It might not be that important to them to understand it or study it .
but i disagree with that .
there has to be a base for everything someone learns or it wont be concidered learning .

My favourite subject has always been Math because , unlike subjects like History and Literature , its all based on logic .
everything has an explanation and acknowledging that explanation leads to acknowledging a new fact .
When students understand ideas , they become more productive , and more accomplished , because grasping and analizing ideas leads to creativety which leads to creation .

Students have differents learning skills , some learn by memorizing conlusions , and some cant memorize without an knowing how they reached to the those conclusions .
Understanding ideas is more difficult that learning facts. a fact can be learned by reading a book or a biography , an idea has to be studied to be learned , which oblidges more thinking .

As a result , one who studies new concepts provide more in the community in the future , because what is his or her mind are not just fixed facts , they are ways of thinking .

If someone thinks about the technology that is enhancing everyday and the growth of our economies , it will be clear that it is the cause of knowledge , knowledge that is not only obtained by memorizing facts but by creative minds .

There is more to improvement than learning facts .
and when i say improvement i mean in yourself .
when you want to imoprove youself you need to understand what you learn to implicate it .
Thats how the process of teaching works as well .
Teachers could have just given out books and told students to read them at home and get tested on them the next day .
Wouldnt that have been easier if the point was n't to make students understand what they 're taking in school ?
