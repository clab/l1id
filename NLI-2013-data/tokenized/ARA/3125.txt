Although a lot of older people seem to be happy and enjoing life , I think younger people enjoy life more than older people do because younger people do not have a lot of things to worry about , they at least think they have more time in the future and because of the intertament objects that we hane nowadays .

Most of young people do not have childern so that they do n't have to care about any body in addition to themselves which make them spen all of the money they have on thier own way .
Also , younger people do not have to worry about a lot of other things that older people may conciern like health which gave the firest group the grean light to enjoy life .

An other reason I sould minsion is that younger people think they have more time in the future to worry about things and at the mean time they just have to enjoy life .
Nevertheless , old people had enjoied thier life when they were young , and they do not prefer to spend the rest of it on the same thing too which make them spend it in more meaningful things like education , for example .

The last reason I would like to bring is that we have a lot of intertament objects that we can spend our time in like computers , for example .
People nowadays can study and have fun at the same time which is the best advantage of the computers we use .
Moreover , the games and intertament ways that the older people used to have have changed to be more complex to sute the educational and intertamental purpses .

In conclusion , not having a lot of things to worry about , thinking that they have time in the future , and the intertament objects we have nowadays make young people enjoy life more that older people .
