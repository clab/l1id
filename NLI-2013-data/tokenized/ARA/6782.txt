If everyone had a car in this world there will be no place for us to live in .
I will agree with the statement .
The world is making it harder for everyone to get a car or even own one .
The improved public transport is another alternitave for transportaion .
Those are some signs cars are going down .

The cars now are very expensive to buy one .
A middle income peoson will have to pay more than half his income to get a car .
The expenses wont stop there you will have to pay also for the gas .
the maintance of it .
Even to park your car you will have to pay for it .
Anothr hassling problem is the traffic on the roads and no one is doing anything about it .
In a couple of years i think very few people will afforad to buy gas since they oil prics are going up so fast .

Some good signs that the cars will go away .
First you have the improved public transport , trains , metros , and buses .
Which will cover up the need for peoples transportation .
Since almost eveyone lives in a city and everything is close togther .
Also another thing that has a signs car will go away is all these anti pollution groups and the hard reglations in some countries regarding the emssions .

In conclusion , it wil be nice if the number of cars go down .
That will mean less cars accidents and less injuired or dead people from reckless drivers .
The will be a little cleaner not that much becase of the other factories .
With all the technology going around us and the good public transport .
i would say there is a very big chance the number of cars will go down dramctilly .
