Now a days , the number of cars in use is very large and many people believe that the next twenty years wouldnt be any differnet .
I share the same opinoin and think that streets are going to be overcrowded with cars in the next twenty years unless a solution is found .

This non-stope increase in the number of cars being used is due to many reason .
firstly , car companys are decreasing the car costs signifcantly and making their prducts more attractive to consumers , which encourages people to buy new cars more often and have mutiple cars for each family .
This would result in an increas in the number of cars .
Secondly , many banks are offering loans to people which help in provideing them with the money needed to buy new cars .
Thus , people who do not have cars now adays due to money issues , will have enough money to buy them in the next few yearss .
Thirdly , with all the support from the banks and car companies , more cars are going to be in use as the population increases rapidlly .
The young generation would find it very easy to afford to have their own private cars and the same would apply for the next coming generation .

Morover , the goverment also plays a very important part in this increase .
For instance , if a country 's rules state that driving for 16 year-olds is allowed , then the number of people using cars would increase resulting in crowded streets .
Also , if the gverment doesnt inforce sale and registertaion taxes on cars then drivers would be encourged to buy extra cars for their families .
in adsiton , the cost of car fuel is also significant in restricting the nuber of cars used .

in my opinion , the number of cars in use after twenty years would be greated than that used today and if no aproperiate solutions are enforced , then the crowded streets would be another big problem everyone should be envolved in .
