`` Do n't jude the book by its cover '' is a common say in English to send a singal to people that they should not be decieved by whatever they see .
However , it is not always true because there are other factors could be borne in mind before appraching such a behavior by a lot of companies .
As far as I am concerned , I disagree with the written statement for some economical and moral reasons .

Economically speaking , it is true that all of the companies nowadays think of the porfits , but they do concern about the satisfication of the customer .
These compnies should put in considerationd that if they got a compalint from a cusomer , there would a possibilty of losing a lot of csutomers .
Especially in countries where customers have the right to complain for the low quality of product .
A s a resutl , the company would lose a lot of money because other people would be encouraqged to do so due incoorect information might be exposed on some advertiements .
Therefore , the companies should think of how much money that it might loose for such a stupid behavior .
They have already put a lot of money on the advertiemnet and they are not ready to loose more .

Morally speaking , the companies shoudl keep a good repuation about the companies .
it shoud attract a lot fof customers by making sure that thier product are up the advetisment are put on media .
I believe the companies might exagaruate in nature of the advertisnemnt , but it will maintain an acceptable level of truth on the advertiement for future uses .

It might be true that compnies sometimes try attract a lot of people in thier advertiments but not to deceive them .
the finicail situation might result from such a bahvior could prevent the companies to think twice before taking this path .
Moreover , at the end of the these compnies are led by people who human and they are driven by principles like hoensty .
As it is known `` Honesty is the first policy in life . ''
This is why the possibilty of deceiving or cheating for money purpose should not exist in the advertisments due to the moral aspect in people 's life .
