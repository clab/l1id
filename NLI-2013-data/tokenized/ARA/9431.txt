I agree with this statement because ideas are the primary form of the facts .
The facts were ideas before they becaome facts .
therefore , it is important to underdatnd the ideas first then develope them and make them work as facts .

In addition , ideas are felixable and can be more useful than the facts bacause simply we can discuss the ideas and develope them but we can not discuss all the facts especially those which became `` dogma '' .
So understanding the ideas is the door of the discussion skills that the students need .

students can use the idea and get what is beyond it and get deeply into it to get other ideas out from the orginal idea so they will be able to undersatnd it and use it effectly .
This method also help the students to keep all what they need in mind and not forget it .

focusing in ideas are most important because every thing starts with an idea .
Also we can be involve in the idea and we can add our own idea so we are sharing the thoughts .

All in all , the idea is the passage for every thing .
it leads us to the truth , the fact .
ideas are what we live for and at the end , life is an idea .
