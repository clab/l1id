As the dictum says : `` hard work works '' .
It is hard to become a succesful person , but there is nothing easier than losing what we have been working for .
The goal of each person is to succeed .
But there is no limitation to success .
As an example , a rich person will always try to get richer .
According to the old philosophies , the human nature is based on desires .
A man or a woman is always in search of new things that will allow him to develop his or her experience .
No one of us is free because we are all conditionated by our perpetual desires .
The satisfaction of a desire systematically caused a new desir .
The philosophy calls this `` the hegemony 's human nature '' .

`` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''
Let 's take the example of Alexandre the Great who was dominating all the mediteranean area .
Because of his desire of hegemomism , he wanted to mater the whole world and that led him the the loss of his empire .
Let 's point out more concrete examples : In the capitalist world , a company will always try to conquer new markets ( as globalization ask for ) rather concentrating on his own market ...
this can cause the company 's failure .

As far as I am concerned , I completly agree with the following statement : `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
This is the human 's nature and no one can denie it .
But humans are trying to decrease these risks with philosophies as the oriental philosophies by defending the next theory : `` control the desires in order to master only what we know how to do well and avoid the risk of losing what we have '' .
