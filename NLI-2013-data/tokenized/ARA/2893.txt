ln the world we have many category of person and ages so there are the young peopie who want to grow quikly and the older people who want to become children again but each category enjoy his life and spend his time on his way and we say that `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' so what is my opinion ?
l totally agree with this following statement because l think that it is true .
first , when we are young we have a big life and a long carrier to live besides we have a lot of dream and we work very hard to succeed them .
second , we can practise sport and enjoy playing with friends in my point of view it is more important to have friends when we are young because we can spend more time with them because if we become old we don t have time to stay with them but we have to look after our children .
third a young person an immature person so he can do what he want and enjoy life without thinking in what will happen after in despite his parents who don t think about theirselves carry and worry about their child and how and what can they do to give him the more cnfortable life so they don t enjoy their life .
so as a conclusion l think that `` young people enjoy life more than older people ''
