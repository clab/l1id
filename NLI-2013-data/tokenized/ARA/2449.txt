Although both young and older people can live fascinated life , I think that young people enjoy life more than older people .
This may be because young people have wonderful dreams about life , they are healthier , and finaly , they have less responsibilities .

Having a dreams and aims is one of the most things that makes young people more enjoyable of the life .
Young have many goals that they want to achieve , for example they want to achieve good education , high position .
Also , they dream with a wonderful wife/husband and happy life , and they exert their best efforts to achieve these dreams .
Expecting and anticipation of better future is a main source of happiness .
Some , may aruge that older people also have dreams and goals , but , in my opinion , they faced and experienced the real life which may be hard and disappointing .

Another factor is , health is very important to enjoy life .
When you are in agood health , you can do any thing .
You can do any effort you want , any kind of sport , any activity .
Illness can cause the person to be disappointed and unhappy .
When you are ill , you should take care of your health ; do should not do any hard activity , any excessive effors , and can do only some kinds of sports .
You have to take care of times of different medicaments , and see the doctor regularly , and so on .

Moreover , less responsabilities help young to enjoy more their lifes .
They always feel with secure and safe as they live their families .
Also , they know if they have problem , they can find persons to depend on , and to give them advice .
They do not have to care about money , paying bills or preparing food .
All they have to do is focusing on doing well on their education .

To sum up , Young enjoy life more than older people as they are more hopeful in a good life , healthier , and have less duties to do .
