In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today Actually , I do not agree with this statement .
The world is growing .
The cities are expanding .
And the world population is increasing .
People needs transportation to transport from one site to another inside the city and even outside .
I agree that there are variety of transportation .
For example , buses , metroes , and airplanes .
But usually people like to drive .
They like to have there own car and travel with there family through the country .
Some countries , there are no metroes .
And some countries have minimal numbers of buses .
In my country , we do not have metroes , small number of buses and we have only one airplane company .
in my country , we are not used to use bus or even taxi .
We usually use our cars .

Cars can not be replaced by other transportation .
Some people will not feel comfortable without using a car especially their cars .
Other transportations can help in decreasing crowdeness but that does not mean that they will replace the car .
Mostly .
everyn body in the entire world would like to have a car even if he or she transports by other than car .
I think reduction in numbers of cars in use will be challenging .
And I think it will take more than twenty years to decrease the usage of cars in my country in the entire world .
