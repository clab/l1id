tring new things

I agree that people they have to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
People have to new more things and and they have to go in risks to see lave and haw it is to learn more and to be faithfol by lave and can solve problems and more people new things more the world be in good sityweion now bady gana lose if he learnd .

Theis is my oppinun , more you learn more you be smart , if evry persen tride to do something and sheard eitsh athor the world will be fine .
