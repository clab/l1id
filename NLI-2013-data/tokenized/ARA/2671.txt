`` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , agree or disagree ?
what a difficuilt question .
Thinking of the answers puts you in a closed circule , there is no definite one .

`` Enjoying life '' is not dependent only on the factor of age , despite that we say that `` inorder to enjoy life you have to feel young from inside '' , for my opnion age is one of the least essential effects .

To approve with this statemant or not , first we have to clearify what is the interpretation of `` enjoy life '' .
I think that we do all agree that it differs from one individual to the another , depending on their characters , their goals in life , their aspects , opnions ..
etc .

Talking of my self , enjoying life means to me : travelling through the world , to be in everywhere in the world and not only to pass by also to learn from it , to be interested in any new thing including every single field in life , to enjoy means to work hard on improving yourself , your socio-economic level , your intellegence , your personality , to enjoy means to introduce new people , because knowing new people encounters you with their life experinces , and that enriches your experince , and your thinking , your mind .
For me practicing all these things is `` ENJOYNG LIFE '' , and not doing them means , for me , your are not living .
