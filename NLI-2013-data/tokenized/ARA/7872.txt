Traveling for me is as important as eating and sleeping .
In fact , i would like to travel three times per year if i have the chance but that never happend .
In my opinion , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more realibul and more enjouabul esspichally for visiting a new place .
Therefore , traveling with a group led by a tour guide will be always my choice because that will save my time and money , gives me the background information about this new place , and gives me the chance to meet and know new people in the group .

First of all , since my budget is always law and fixed , traveling with a group is menimize my spending cost .
Also , i will save time rather than weasting it in seeing bad places or get lost when i want to go to a good place .
On the other hand , i will find a time for haunging out by my self on the streets because the tour time is limited during the day .

Another main reason , the tour guide will be the most knwn person about the history , musemus , culture , and food of the people of this country .
As a result , I will benefit of listin to these information and add it to my knolwdge .

Finally , most of the time i like to travel by me self , so , it will be a great chance to meet and know a new people from all over the world and have a new friends and talk about their culturs , In brief , traveling in a groub will be always my choice and i will recomend this way of traveling to my friends and my children in the future .
