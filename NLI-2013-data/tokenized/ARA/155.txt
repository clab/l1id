Advertisments are a good way to sell products .
In fact , they can make products look much better than they realy are .
Therefore , they can make them look in different size and more beutiful .

First , tricking customers eyes is a realy good way to get more money .
First , you can make your product smaller or bigger than it is just to make it in the desired look poeple want .
For example , I remember a TV show that was unnouncing to win a sport car if anyone ansewrs the quistion showed on the screen .
However , the quistion was so easy that I was going to call them .
I saw alot of people calling them ; in fact , the TV show got alot of money from the people calling it .
A person won the sport car , finally , and he was so happy .
However , the funny thing is that the car was a really small car .
Actually , it was a kid car toy .
Therefore , they showed the car , and everyone thought that it was a real car with a real engine , but that tricked everbody even me .
I think that this a smart way for marketting products .

Second , advertisments makes the producets looks more nice and beutifull .
In fact , they are using proffisional and careful workers who can handle the product without making any mistake that let the people notice any disadavtage of it .
For instant , i saw a knife advertisment .
The knife seemd so sharp .
that was just because of the careful workers .
however , when i tried the knife in my home i broke it .

In brief , advertisments makes changes the product size and making it more useful .
I think that it is not a crime because companies do not say any lie or show any different product .
They are just giving adantages of their product ignoring disadvantages .
