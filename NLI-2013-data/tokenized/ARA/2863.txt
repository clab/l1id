It apears to be more obvious that young people , especialy childern , enjoy thier life more that older people .
That fact depends on many reasons .
Here are some of them wich i would like to disscus , children have no responsibilty , older preople are wiser , and finaly children have all the time they need and more .

the fact that children have no responsibilities makes them carefree , no careless , but carefree where they can do watever they want and all they have to do is learn form thier mistakes .
learning is the easy part as there are no consiquenses .
As for the older people they have dun all the learning that is required and now all thier actiong have consequenses , and no matter how tough the consequenses are , the adults have to face them and pay for thier mistakes , which they have learned of before .
It is also harder for older people to enjoy their time because they are the ones teaching and taking care of the children that have yet to learn and understand , so while the children have no resposibility but to learn , the adults are responsible for their acitons as well as they are responsible for the children .

It is proven that most of the enjoyable things to do are considered rong and imature .
older people or adults are expected to be more mature that children and therefor they are not alowed or more precisly not expected to do these imature things , which everyone finds more fun .
The children on the other hand are their to prove that the grown ups are more mature , the children do nothing but imature things wich they enjoy , but eventualy they are bownd to learn form the adults , who are more mature , that these enjoyalbe imature acitons are not permited and rong .

While older people start to realise that they have less time , to make something of their lives , than they had , they start to focuse more on their careers and they devote all thier time to thier work and jobs .
Not noticing that they could be spending that time enjoying their presuse time .
Children in that case have nothing to worry about , for they have all their lives ahead of them and they have a lot of time left .
they do not think that they are running out of time so they just simply enjoy life , and not wasiting any of it .

It is clear that children enjoy life more than older people , even though adults could enjoy thier lives almost just as much as children if they want to .
Adults are always spending time teaching children about life , when it 's the children that could teach grown-ups a lot about how to live life and enjoy it completly .
