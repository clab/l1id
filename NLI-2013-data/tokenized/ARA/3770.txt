I unfortunately agree that the yuth in our time not sharing enough ihn the community development .
If we compared this share with available types of community needs .
I am always asking my self .
why this small available helping hands .

In deed I see the need for the volunteering efforts are increasingly clear specialy in the developing countries .
one side of the community needs is the need for the donatiions to get money to help the poor or even the hungry people allover the world , in addition to that these donations can be channeled to help the poor students to complete thier education , more over the richy man can patronize some of the sporic events to maintain the good health of theyuth in the poor towns .
in other areas that need the help of the rich , is developing some environmental projects that can recycle the wast droducts in the poor countries .
This type of help not only with economic value but also has a great effect on improving the health of the communitty due to minimizing the epidemic diseases caused by the pollution .
At the end I can see a lot os areas people can help community to develope .
But again the question arise ; why this little effort have been given from the yuth to th ecommunity ?

In my point of view there are some causes for the answer .
firstly , the government in many countries controls the donatiions of the volunteers insisting to expend in special areas , which dissatisfies the donner .
secondly th eperiorities of the yuth now is for fullfiling the the basic needs for their life wich are endlessly changing and very ycoastly than befor which not only take moneyy but also take alot of time .
this mone and time can be channeled to the community if th ey are simle needs as before .
