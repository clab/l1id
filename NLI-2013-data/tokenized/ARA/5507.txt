Nowadays , most companies if not all of them , rely on advertisement to make a certain product or object known and valuable .
They actually use the advertisement to compete with other companies and sell more .
However , are the advertisements the real image of what products really are , and how much they cost ?

Unfortunately , most customers are getting a `` disappointed '' feeling when buying a certain product , or after having bought it .
For example , when we see an advertisement about a car , the price is usually without taxes , and without any options .
However , when the customer sees the panel , he would get excited about the price meeting his own budget .
So he would go and prepare his savings and tell everyone about it .
Then , when buying the car , the company would tell him : '' Excuse me sir , do you need it with an automatic transmission ?
Do you want the windows to be electrically controlled ? ''
And with every question coming , the customer 's smile would give place to a sarcastic and fake smile , that would totally disappear with : `` Excuse me sir , this price was without taxes . ''
Now , can the customer change his mind after the price increased by a couple of thousands of dollars ?
It 's not that easy , after having sold his own car , for example , and having told everyone about the new vehicle he was going to buy .

On the other side , some companies have the option to refund their customers if they are n't satisfied about the product .
However , how many customers will actually have the time to go and ask for a refund about his product ?
In addition , will it be a total refund ?
In most cases it is not .
They would try to sell you another product instead of the older one .

Finally , we can realise nowadays that most of what we see on televisions and panels is n't true .
`` Lying '' to people will actually make companies lose on the long run , because a disappointed customer will not come back .
Therefore , every company is in a dilemna between `` showing off '' and losing on the long run , and giving the world the real image of their products .
