When success is involved i tend to find myself disagreeing with statments relating to the measurment of success .
When defining success and how it is obtained one realises that different methods and many underlying factors take a toll on the general outcome of any ordeal .
To simply encase a method of success into a vague statement is a contadiction in itself .

To find success is to define it according to each mans wants and needs .
For one person being successfull is to constantly change and to constantly adapt to the surroundings .
This gives him the offset of a `` jack of all trades '' .
He chooses to experiance all but master nothing .
And as such he also finds adversity in the decisions he chose to define himself as .
One would benefit from the adaptivity of such a persona , but might suffer from the instability of such a lifestyle .

Accordingly so , others might find themselves proud and in tune with the aspects of their personality which they have deemed powerfull .
It is another form of strength which benefits from gaining great wisdom and a more decisive approach to the lifestyle they would deem as successful .
Knowing ones faults and unwillingess to adapt creates a form of security and purpose in life .
But might also negatively affect a persons weaknesses when a forcefull unpredicted change in enviroment is brought about .

In conclusion , any strive to achieve success no matter the method should be considered a valiant one .
It is those who invent themselves and push forward with their actions who are successful no matter what the situation is .
Knowing that there is no guidline for success and there is only achieving content after effort will bring about instant glory to any man or woman .
It is that strive to maintain your identity which determines if you obtain your goals .
Therefore it is goals which define success , and it is only obtaining those goals that should consequently matter .
