Our world develops rapidly nowadays .
Cars , buildings and other things around us change from time to time , some times for better and some times for wose , I think that in twenty years the world will have major changes , especially in the transfomation technology .

I agree on the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The car technology is impoving rapidly and each year we hear about more developed version of the car , however , nowadays people are concerned about the invironment and how cars can affect it negatively .
So , alogside the developments , I think that car manifacturers will take this problem into account and think about creative ways to prevent invironment problems and solve them , such as : pollution .

In my prediction , I see the world in an optimistic eye twenty years from now , I think that cars will be replaced by less harmfull transformation devices , such as : a developed vesion of a bike or even skates .
There is also a possiblity that car factories may create cars with wings or small air-plains which will keep the cars off the earth .

Another reason why I think that there will be fewer cars in use , is the economy and the oil prices .
The demand on oil will increase which will make it 's price increase , the high proces of oil may make people think of other transportation devices .
Plus , the oil resources may stop producing , because their is a possiblty that oil may finish in the future and cars depend on oil in order to run .

In conlusion , I tottaly agree on the fact that cars in use will be fewer in twenty years , and I believe that it is an advantage for our world as well as our invironment .
