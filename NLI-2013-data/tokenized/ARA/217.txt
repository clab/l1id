According to what all government say , that all cars must only be transported from an country to another with in a five years of date of due from the company .
Every country must make a roule about controlling the number of car that is coming year after year .

Every new car that is made , it brings with it more pollution and more traffic to the world .
The government must have a limit or a regulation to prevent the additions of cars year after a year .

I think that in five or ten years they will be more fewer cars then there is now , but i do n't think that after twenty years they will be more .
because technology will prevent it and they will stop using cars .
They will use new technolgy rather then cars that bring us problems like pollution , car accidents , more traffics , death penalties etc ...

In the newer world they will find a solution for it , because if not it will be a catastrophe and a disaster .
Because logically world is not gonna get bigger in twenty years but cars are gonna get much and much more fewer then it can contain .
I think technology will take place in twenty years from now , it might use plane besides cars or huge escalators through buildings , maybe even escalators underground .
No one knows what is in the future or what is waiting for us then .
Life is much harder then we think we ca n't just imagine it with in a few words it much more complicated .

I hope for the best in our future life for all whom gonna participate in it. , and i hope that tecnology will prevent the catastrophy probelm of cars and stop it from growing into the world and multiplying by billions .
of countity .
Everyone looks for his best and goods .
Life is life .
