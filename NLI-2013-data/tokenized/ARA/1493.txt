Being specialised in one academic subject or in many subjects which is better ?
and is it true that the more subject u specialise in the more acadamic and better you will be ?

People 's opinion in the number specialization differs widely , but the question is which is better ?
First of all , to be specialized in one subject makes the person more professional in the subject he choose .
Secondly , in work he would have a higer rank which means that more salary will be offered to him which can lead him to have a better life like having luxury cars and house , but the problem that it may be hard for him to ind a good work if he was specialized in a rare subject .

Also their are quite alot of advantages for having more than one specialized subject like1-more oppurtunity for him to find a work2-give him the chance to work in more than one place which may lead to more salary but in the same time more stress3-makes him have a better place in the community due to his knowledge in many things which may make him help many people .

But in my opinion , having more than one specialze subject is better because it is possible for the person with many specialism to have the same degree in all of his subjects as the person who has just one specialze subject with the degree .
Also i think that having one specialize subject may take a big effort to find a good job with a good salary .
For example my cousin studied in US computer science and came to UAE to study there but couldnt find a job because it is not needed in this country so he had to studfy again another subject in order to live his life .
As they said the more knowledge you have the more important you will be in your county .
