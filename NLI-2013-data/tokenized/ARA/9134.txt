I disagree with that .
I think understanding ideas and concepts , and learn facts are conected togather I am going to support my opinion by saying seveeral reason .
First of all , as huna beens we have to live the the fact to understand the ideas and concepts .
In fact , it is not a conditonal rule , but it is the common thing to be a human been .
Second , when people learn any thing , they have to do it in the real life to feel it and how can it effect his life .
My third reason is , the people imgination be come larger and get more experments in their live .
also they would be able tomore creative and make new things that they felt it is important for the people live , and that is going to be by living the fact that had learn it and understood it .
If thedo some thing on the real live , and they have seen some thing like it on television like poorness or to be hungry , they will be sorry for the people who have these problems , but when they do it on real they help them because they felt the painful that these people are going through .
These are my reasons that i thing the are very reasonable and if every school is going to do it , it would be so helpful for the teachers and very effectable for the studint life and imagination in this live .
