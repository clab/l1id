Although some people believes that the young people enjoy life more than the old people do , I do not agree with this statment .
However , at my point of view , I believe that the enjoyment is not related any more to the old of people .
So many reason can support may point of view .

In this life , there are many things that can enjoy people .
These than are differ from people to other .
For example , the children will enjoy with playing the computer games .
but , when they become a lettel bet older they will enjoy with other thing like playing football .
By the years , there way of entertainment will vary according to their ages .

another reason that support my opinion is the diffrent circumenstances for the people .
some people was sad during their youth and become happy when they are oled an vice versa for other people .
this is becuase of the surrounding envirnoment .

one the other hand , some people believes that the young people enjoy life more than the old people do .
they supporet their idea because the uouth has agood helth .
Also , they have a better ability for doing thin \ s more that the old peopl .
But this will not be true alowas .

at the end , i would like to say hat the enjoyment of the life depend mainly on the person himselm rather that on his age .
so , i would like to say to the people .
live yor life this the good
