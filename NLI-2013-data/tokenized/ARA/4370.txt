Young people nowadays do n't care much about helping their communities , because the do n't have the idea that is , it is imprortant to partcipate in the commuinity social serveses .
This idea caused by many factors including parentes , media , socity , friends and thier priorities .

Parents often now engourage their kids to consetrate on their studying which is important of course but they have also rememper not forgot helping the community .
young people watch media intensivly but unfortunatly media does n't support this case that much , media channels prefer to show things that attract people like big news , celebrties life and movies .
The socity has an infleuance on the young people but not that much infleuance , the families who that make the socite tend to be not as close as in the past , they care about themselves and they do not worry about taking care of somebody else .
Freinds are a greate factor among each other they talk to each others , and exchange ideas , but thier priorities have changed now , they are concern about parties , girls , movies , cars and wasting time without much benefit .
So if we provide these factors to engourage young people to participate in the commuinty serveses , and have media make shows about the greatness and the benefits of the social work .

The mentalety of young people will change after providing these factors , they will tend to help their communities and be an effective individuals among others and spread take this thought to the next generation .
