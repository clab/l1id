I agree with the statement that is the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide , but not always , as for the statement , there are advantages and disadvantages .
Starting with the advantages , going with a group of people and a tour guide will prevent you from being lost , or even being stolen .
Also it is much more fun to go with a group , like a group of friends or mates from a certain class .
As a matter of fact , staying alone will also increase the danger for an individual because he might get stolen or robbed .

But there are also certain disadvantages for a tour with a group with a tour guide , althought it will be fun , it might be much expensive than touring individually , but also any person will just feel dependent on the tour guide , or even if he has a certain job to go by himself he will face trouble and how to start like booking a hotel , renting a car , going to a resturant , also he wo n't be able to discover something new , like he wo n't be able to make friends , nor he will be able to talk to anyone except if he was alone or with a partner ,

In my opinion , I would prefer to go for the first time with a group and a tour guide , and then when I will be familiar with the place I think I would try to go alone and figure everything by myself because it will taste differently .
In addition to going alone , going with a group of friends is really exciting , as I had tried it once when we went with my friends to Europe for vacation , althought we had n't a tour guide but it was fun exploring things alone and trying them , and looking at the fine places , and by asking you can reach any place you want to reach .
