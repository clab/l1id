Advertisements alwasys trying to make you `` when i said you it is mean people '' looke at the product from another side the best side .
This is there responsibilty and it is there job to market their products .
They are spending fourtune on Televission , Radio and posters .

In my openion I thought before that they are steeling from us by convencing our children in a product i am not interested in .
But by the time I have read and understand that this is bussiness and this is how it worked .
it has some advantages and dis advatages .

Although it brought to us the very new technology , and , it help us by using all of the facilities , but in my openion I think it is wasting for our money and sometimes it is not like what we see in the Televession .

Now aday if you opened the Televission you will spend muct time watching those products .
Even so if you go to the movie theator you will waste so much time watching those products and you were paying to watch it .

In conclussion if I had acompany I would do the same thing because people allways do not have the time to think or to try those things , they would say if it does'nt work well it would not matter because it was cheap or if I am going to returne it I would waste time .
If all of families were well knoledgable those thing will not appeare .
