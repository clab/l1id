I agree with this statement for many resons .
The first one is young people spend their time in other things .
The second , they focuse their afforts in other staffes .
The last one , they do not have good supports from people to help their communities .

First of all , young people spend most of time in activeties belonging to them self not for their community .
For example , they spend time in playing , visiting friends , studying and help each others .

secondly , they focuse their afforts in things which it give the benefits for them .
For example , young people may do some works with very hard work if they get money or at least a littel gift which it unforchintly does not happen often in communities .
Thirdly , they may not have good support to that nither from school or home .
The reson is the school and home - speacily home - told them to do some things belonging to them or make benefits for them without thinking in socity .
I think young people will do some scoity activities if somebody give them a littel adviesment to participate people and help them in so many ways .
In addition , it is scoity clubs ' resbonseblity to help young people to give something to community where they live .

Finally , they some youngs do alots of things to their socity and still .
But the other does not for resons which are minshond above .
The young people have huge enrgy that should every body take care about it .
