Some people think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in the use than there are in today and some diagree .
Whatever , there is many factors the show us the way how number cars will increase or decrease .

In my opinion , i think that 's trurly not because as we see nowdays the number of cars are growing up fastly because of the number of people .
In china the number of people is more than 1 billion person is there , and in india the number of people will grow up and become more than china in fewe years .
This crowed of people will increase the number of cars .

Other thing , if we take that last twenty years we can determind that the number of cars that the countries they asked were increased due to people .
What is more , the number of cars that is produced is become more and more and the companys will not stop producing because of the custemers demand .
As we see the traffic jam now days are increasing and they are going to be more and more .
As we see the number of studing who learn how to drive a car are increasing in all countries and the schools will need more cars to teachs these student .

In addintion to that , the veraity of cars are more and more , if you want a four wheel drive you can choice a car from a plenty of cars in one company .
how about the aother companys do they have the same ?
yes ofcourse they have many types of cars for of road for in road even the interior accessories .

These factors say 's that the number of cars will increase without stoping one day , so the world become more croweded and number of cars will be infinity .
