Every teacher has his/her way to teach sudents and each tacher has his / her technieqs in teaching .
One may let students to understand ideas , and one may let them to learn facts .
however , teaching students to understand ideas and concept deliver the information more easily to students rather than learning and memorising facts .
Understanding ideas and concept is make the information or the details more clear to students .

first , when a student is facing a new ideas and information , he/she may have no idea about the new topic .
And starting by learning the facts and memorising them will be hard on them and may lead to miss understanding for the topic .
Whereas , when the teacher trys to explain how the concepts and the ideas where direvered from will make it easier for the student to learn .
for example , if the teacher gives students scientific work sheet and tells students that they have a test in the next day on the difinitions , students will try to memorise the terms without understanding for the roots or the details of the facts that are in the sheet .
However , they will be confused about how the facts and the details are linked .
And in that case the teacher should have have talk about the facts and teach the students how these facts works , because that might help in memorising the fact for a longer time period .

second , if the student learnt for example , how the machiene works , he will be more knowledgable about methods used to invint it .
Moreover , when the teacher uses technieqs that alows the student to think and how to understand the ideas this piece of information will last in his/her head for along time and he/she can develope that new idea a year after a year .
Using this methode will produce alotof inventores and scientests .

To conclude , some students have the appility to understand more than memorising and the opposite is also true .
however , these two types of learning , depend on understanding ideas and concept .
and it make it easier for students to learn .
