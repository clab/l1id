First , I think that yes they are right to have a broad knowledge of many acadimic subjects is better than specific subject .
Because you will have a lot of informations in a lot of things that you already knew about them and you will be able to do avery thing you want it because i said before you alredy have a lot of informations about this thing you need to do .
Also you will have a problem of nothing at all and nothing will cross you while you are working on it because you do not need to know about it at all .

Second , or in other hand if you think that to be specialize in one specific subject is much and more better you will be right too .
Because i think or in my openion if you choose one subject and had focuced on you will be profesional on it because you have known every single thing and detail about it and i think that the second openion is much and more better than the first .
Although the first statement is good but when you have you'r knowledge about everything you wont be able to know every detail about it because it is going to be too much on you to know and you will say then that there is no need to know it and you will get boared from it and you will never know what is your work in a specific way because from the begining you wasnt sure enough about what you realy want or need to know .
While , in other side to be specialize in one and specific subject no doubt you will be able to do and work and study and do what ever you want because from the beginig you knew what you want and need to do and sure you will be specialiser in it and everyone around you will certanly trust you because as i mentioned before that you are already knowing what you want , love and need to do and if you asked me that question another million time i will choose the second statement everytime you asked me .
