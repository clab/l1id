advertisements is one of the most important methods that the business use inorder to increase their profet and to help to create a very positive mind image in the customers mind to buy this product as soon as possible .

However there are so many ways to advertise the product , such as producing posters and creating a T.V commertial or sometimes by radio commertials , in an addition small companies use the most affective and cheapest way in order to advertise the product to the people and that is by providing test samples of their production or by posting posters in the streets rather than creating a T.V comertial .

Advertisements will affect the income of the business and will attrackt the customer to buy the product , however not all products are perfict as they seem to be because the company will onlly state the advantages and the good points about their production and they wont state the disadvantages of the product becasue the main goal of the company is sell as much products as they can in order to gain high profit .

In an artical i once read they have found that the companies which they advertise their products befor selling it to the customers are likally to be succesfull and more garanteed to grow than the companies who sell their products without a pre-advertisements and without advertising the product to the people .

Neverless in my point of view and according to my personal experiance i think that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , however i do believe that the business should find that best ways to reach to the companies main goal that is to increase their profet by increasing their selling production and having as much customers as possible , therefor adverising the product in a very positive image is one of the best ways to reach to their goal .
