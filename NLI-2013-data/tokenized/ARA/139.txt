Some people say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I disagree with them and think that the communities are the ones who do not helping young people Because thier are no jobs and thier is lotes of stress and persure on them .

If you dont offer me a job who can I help you .
Ther are lotes of young people who could not find a job and they try so hard to find one but they could not .
If they had the oppertonty they would be great workers and help thier communities .

The communities are making lotes of stress on the young people .
From the school and the exames to the colleg and more exames and after that hard work he can not find a job and ther is taxes and the belles and the food and the loundry and lotes of stressful thing and they expect him to do more and more .

In a conclusion I want to say that communities say that young people do not help them .
I say that communities should help people and create more jobs .
