I will talk about my own experience when i was a student in the college .
I remember that when i was attending a lecture or my lab i had to understand everything told to me and if i didnt understand any part in the lecture i was going to my teacher to ask him to explain to me again , becouse if i didnt understand the ideas and concepts of one subject i would do bad on my test and my grade will be lower than if i understood everything and that is more important to me than a fact becouse a fact doesnt want me to understand just to learn it as it is .

I will give you another example if the concept about the sun as it rises every day from east this is a fact it doesnt make a sense to understand only what do you want to do is to know this fact , but when the object about the solar energy you have to understand the concept very well to be convinced you have to understand that it consists of heat and light and they cannot be separated yes it is only one beam but two components so if i told you that without explainig you will not believe me becouse you have to understand first then you will be convinced .

YOU can put anything else on that measure as for example the human heart consists of four chambers that is a fact but how those chambers get filled of blood and how they process the circulation in the body that is impossible to learn or just to know without explaning till you understand the ideas and the concept to believe .

i think in my opinion i can not believe anything without understanding except for the fact i have to take it as it is .
SO i agree with that statement it is very important not only for students but for any body to understand ideas and concept than it is to learn facts
