Many people say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree with them beacause of the fllowoing reasons .
may be because they love the playing more than the work and that is real .
Other reason I think because they are less intelligent than the old people so they do not know enough about the correct things .

First , young people like the playing so much .
I think all the people like the playing so much but not as the young people .
Also I think that most of the young people have a school so they have to study more than the adults .
So their free time will be very little and if they spend it at working I think they will get tired .
In addation , their bodies are weaker than the adults so they can not do the same job just like the adults .

Next , I think the young people do not think about their communities because it is over their thinking .
They have a limited brain .
Also they have a lot of fun which can make them busy .

To sum it up , I think that the young people can not service the community as the adults .
Because of they like the playing so much .
Also they have a lot of fun and homeworks which can make them busy to work like the adults .
