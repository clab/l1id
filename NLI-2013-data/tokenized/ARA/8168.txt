I disagree with this statement because without learning the facts it can get you nowhere .
Ofcourse , some people think that without facts it wo n't take too long to find out , but what if they did n't know if they were right .

To put it this way , say that you want to learn something in biology in plants , animals , fish , reptiles , insects and mammels .
To know how to learn things the way they were taught in the book , you can read through the main facts and details that was given to you .
If you want to know something or investigate you need the facts about each topic that you were given in your biology book .
If you know it and got the idea then that would be no problem .

Also , another way of getting facts is by finding out what happened , example who killed someone or who is the one responsible for commiting a crime .
To find out , you need to ask yourselves : `` How did he or she died and who killed them ? ''
The questions will be answered if you gave in every information you have gathered when you want to prepare if this person did or did not kill these people .
Either if this person is guilty or not guilty .

Life is not easy on how it sounds when it is important for students understanding ideas and concepts but a faculty is the way that shows what can be featured and how can you explain it .

Given through what the topic is about , to me , I think it 's a good way to have facts better than to ignore them .
It helps me learn alot when they were given to me and preparing to answer that I choose this because it is best to find out more than hesitating to answer it .
