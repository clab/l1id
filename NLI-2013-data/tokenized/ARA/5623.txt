Advertisors never tell the truth and nothing but te truth !!
I know that advertisors have to make the product seem as good as they could .
Thus , it 's obvious that they make products seem much better than they really are .

Let 's think about the task that advertising was created to accomplish .
It should make us , by convincing or persuading , buy a certain stuff or service .
To do that , advertisors must use any gate to penetrate into our mind , inspite of the credibility of the presented informations .
Thus they mention just the adventages of the product , and hide any inconvenients .

Once i was really impressed by a perfum advertising , and i buyed it .
According to the add it 's a long lasting seducer .
Nonetheless , according to my experience it `` s not lasting .
Furthere more it can be the easiest way to loose a women in ten days .
( Sorry `` How to loose a women in ten days producers '' ) .

Some advertisments could n't be believed at all .
I mean those which show things which are not sensible , nor scientifically accepted .
In fact there 's an advertisement on TV which shows what they called a leather spray .
Believe it or not , this spray-according to them - is able to cover any surface of damaged leather leather with the same material .
All that in spite of the color and the texture of the leather .
One point that i would like to mention is that advertisors are like lawyers .
You should n't be innocent just have a good atterney .
This rule works in the advertising world .
The product does n't need to be perfect , an efficient advertise would push you to buy it for the first one .
On the other hand you will not keep buying it if it does n't satisfy your needs .

In a large spectrum of add , truth is the last thing to care about .
Most of the product appear on the net or the TV screen much better than they could be in our kitchens or our garages .
