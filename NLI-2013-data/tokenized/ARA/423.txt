A person that is educated is highly regarded while , an uneducated person might sometimes be seen down upon .
knowledge is a way of knowing that many people should praise upon and take this advantage to their own good .

I do agree that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to have of one only .
This way a person would know a great deal of things in more than one thing and he/she would normaly share their knowledge with other people and get also information about other subjects themselves .

An example might be , a person that specializes in a particular field of study such as Chemistry and another person that has abroad knowledge of a lot of subjects including Chemistry meet up .
The first person might only discuss Chemistry while the other , person discusses more than one subject .
To me in this situation the person with the broad knowledge is infact , smarter and more experienced than that person that specialize in Chemistry .
Because that person might not answer or feel lost when the other person talks about other topics .

Another reason , might be that the person with the broad knowledge of many academic subjects migh find it easier to understand and learn about various topics .
On the other hand the person that is specialized in a single subject might find it difficult to cope with the other topics that might be introduced to him/her .

An example would be if he Business major student was in a contest with the other students that take Business and other subjects .
He/she might win or gain points in answering questions that deel about Business but , when it comes to answering other questions he/she might have a hard time answering it .
Again I do stand by my opinion that , a person should have great understanding in many academic subjects rather in one .

Who knows when that person needs to persuade another person in an area other than his/her own .
It might be helpful if they know information in more than one topic .
