In the past , scientists used to specialize in a specific subject and keep going deeper and deeper in this subject .
Nowadays many scientist try to learn more than one subject .
For example , biologests try to learn more physics and chemistry .

I totally agree with this .
Science has many branches and these branches may interact with each other very often .
If a chemist wanted to make a new midicine he has to know something in biology .
otherwise , he will not be able to make this midicine .
The same thing goes with physics and biology .

By studying more than one subject and trying to apply one subject in another one , scientists can make big devolopments in different field of science .
New branches of science has been discovered by combining to or more branches of scinece together .
Biochemistry is an example of those new branches .
Biochemistry is giving a big contribution in the frield of midicine .
Moreover , making new midical devices and artificial organs need knowledge in biology and physics together .

Specializing in on subject only will , definitly , narrow the contribution of the scientist to the society .
Contributing as much as they can to the society is the scientists goal .
Thef can have better chances of reaching their goals if the combined the knowledge of different fields of science .

I also think that a scientist can speacialize in one subject and he can also learn something from the other branches of science .
If this scientist worked with another scientist who has another field of speciality , they together can make larger contributions to the scociety .
Working in groups and uniting the knowledge is very helpful in devoloping the different feilds of science .
