Young people are less helping their communities than before .
That is a fact , they do not spend enough time helping .
In my opinion that is a sad fact and their are two major reason from this .

Nowadays , we live in a selfish socity where capitalism is taking the biggest role .
I talk about capitalism because in my opinion it is not only an economic fact but it is also a social one .
For instance , the games that my 17 years old brother play are much more different that the ones I used to play when I was younger .
He plays video games that are in my opinion `` selfish '' .
In those games he plays by himself most of the time .
So there is no socialisation with other young people .
This fact does not teach how to share things with others and specially how to help because they teach that helping others is a weakness .

People are independent younger than before .
They do not rely on their parents for a long time as before .
Most of the 16 years old children dream of leaving home and having their own appartment .
In my culture , the moroccan one , familly is really important .
But I see that young people are loosing this value more and more .
They tend to leave their parents , the `` first community '' the have been in .
They are selfish and they do not like to share things and help others .
We are actually fasting for Ramadan .
during this special occasion , all the familly comes together and everyone have to prepare something to eat for instance .
Braking the fast have always been something that we all live together .
But those last years , I see that my younger cousines does not want to share it with us .
It 's more an obligation for them than a happy event to share all together .

It emerges from this discussion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help and be with their communities .
That is an awefull fact but that is the truth .
