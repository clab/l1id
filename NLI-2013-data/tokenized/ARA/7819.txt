No , i do n't agree with the best way to travel is in a group led .
I think in this way they will have many probelme .
Firt of all , the group led will be not agree together each one want be the led .
Second , when they travel they will be fighting all the time .
also , they will not listine to each .
On the other hand , when you travel with a group wich has one led , they will be better than onather way for severl reasons .
First , all the travels will be nice and specifictly .
Next , many people like travel with agroup by one led .
finally , i do n't agree .
