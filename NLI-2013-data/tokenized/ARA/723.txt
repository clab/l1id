In my opinion , as a student , it is very important to go deeply to parsue the knowledge in my major .
However , it is also important to learn and have broad knowledge in different acadimic subjects .

From my own experience , it is very crucial for me , as computer science student , to learn more and more in my major .
This knowledge makes me proffessional and expert in my specialization and this in turn will benify me .
For example , my grades will be high and when I graduate , I 'll have the apportunity to continue my study .
Even more , if I want to work in a university or any other companies , I think it will be easy .

On the other hand , the scociety , that I am living in , is not only computer science .
There are many other sciences and topics I have to be a ware about .
For instance , I can not imagine that I 'll sit with my friends and other people talking about some topic and I know nothing about it !

So , it is important also to have broad knolwedge about many acadimic subjects .
Unfortunately , in my university it is not allowed to take subjects out of my field .
If they allow that , I 'll be really happy to take subjects in accounting , art , and history .

In conclusion , it is important to go deep in your major and parsue every new in it .
But also it is necessary to have broad knowledge that ables you to communicate with other people .
