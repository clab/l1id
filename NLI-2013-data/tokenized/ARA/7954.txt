Traveling is one of the best ways to have fun and get more knowledge about other coultures or whatever new things .
Therefore , planning for any travel or small trips is very important element .
And there is differents ways to plan for any trip .
There is people who likes to travel with groups with tour guide that he or she can lead them very well in the traveling .
And there is anothers who likes to travel by them selves and get the information by them selves , which it make more difficalte .
Actually I disagree that is the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide .
Also I think it is works in some cases .
But the reasons that made me disagree are , in any travel I think that is the best thing is to descover every thing by my self which I wo n't get that benefit with a guide .
And also travelling with groups give me less porsnality which I do n't like .

First , I uauslly travel to descover and get more information from other culturs and places .
And I like to know know every thing by self , because it give feeling that I did good job .
Also to know every thing by my self needs to communicate with other people , and that communication it also consedered as a descovering .
therefore , there is good things that I will get from my travel by my self that I wo n't get it with guide .
Whatever traveling my self give chalinges and that chalinges is the best things that I will remebar it from the trip .

second , in of the important things that every body want it in any time is personalty .
And this quallty is very important for me in any trip .
It give the aplety to descover more and make me think only about what I should do , not think about what others need or what I should obey of rules with any group .
Therefore , that give more chance to be by my own and only think about ny self on this trip .

Finally , there are some places that every body needs tour guide such as visting specfice place and to know about many thing there .
This kind of tours are usually temprorly and do n't take long time , so , I can that advantage beside that I can the eals by my own .
