successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know to do well .
This is true , but with some limitations .
becuase sometimes successful people are those who dont try new thigs and only do what they already know how to do .
Those poeple are usaually called old school people .

On the other hand , to be successful you need to be a risk taker .
as well as being able to change and adapt to all changes that occur arround , in technology , medicine , life style and science .
for example poeple who dont beleive in changing or trying new things , they will eventually fail to keep on the track of development and growth , which in turn will force them to quit or stay behind and accept the failure and loss .

For example : when computer was intoduced to every aspect of life , and then the internet .
if someone doesnt take the risk to change , or try the new technlology , in the following years will notice the bad effect on his biusness or life style .

Also , the other aspect is taking risks .
especially in making major desicions that can change life forever .
for example , when poeple from developnig countries take the desicion to migrate to the developed countries for better chances in studying , working and better life style for families which is more safe and has stability in good living conditions .

another example , which is real that me and my husband used to live in small town in north crolina .
we had very limited income , and very little number of poeple from our community , so we decided to take the risk and move up north to take our chance in dearborn michigan .
now my husband has better income .
we socialize more with poeple from our community .
which built our network here .
this helped us to find better jobs and gives us better commuinty support .
if we were not risk takers we would stay in the south with less cahnces for better life style for us and our children .
