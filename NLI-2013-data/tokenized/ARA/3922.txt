As unfortunate as it may sound , there is no doubt that it is true .
`` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , '' but why is that ?
What has changed in the principles and morals being preached to adolescents over the last decade or more ?
In reality nothing has changed , except for today 's previously unseen rapid adancement and development in the technology sector of society creating a world of technocratic countries .

Young people are really the victims of this technology-centered lifestyle , because they are the primary consumers of video games , computers , and listening devices .
Engulfed in their own world of entertainment , teenagers do n't care anymore about the slums and the sub-standard education that many of their country 's citizens are experiencing .
Today , what 's constantly on a teenager 's mind is whether or not his parents are going to buy him a Playstation for his or her birthday and not what he or she can do to help society .
Therefore , high-tech advertisement has created a highly capitalist consumer culture , which does not allow for adolescents time to think about their surroundings or world issues .

In regard to advertisement , television is its best and most common means of transfer .
Television as Neil Postman has said , is gradually corroding our once highly regarded societal values .
The discourse of television is quick and entertaining , introducing you to the world 's problems in an entertained manner and thereby rendering them as far away dilemmas with no conern what so ever to the person watching .
For example , a person might watch a news reel describing the high amount of toxic fumes in his or her area , but they would'nt do anything about it , because the advertisement following the alleged seriousness of the news cast puts infront of its audience a brand new Xbox .
Now the concern of the teenager is to find ways that could get him or her that Xbox .
What happened to the toxic fumes story ; it just becomes something he or she heard .

Technoloogy is quickly eliminating the importance of family and societal values .
As a result of globalization it is practically impossible now to hault the growing self-centerdness that is characterizing more children .
Children are growing up and all they see around them is fun and entertainment , even when one has the urge to turn serious and turn on the news cast all he or she encounters is another form of entertainment .
Therefore , with entertainment so easily accessable , then it would make sense that teenagers or `` young people '' would become engulfed in a bubble world of their own , where the problems of society are nonexistant to them .
