Todays world is very competitive , everyday there are new advances in many aspects of our lives that we need to keep pace with .
taking this fact into account , it is much more rewarding to have knowledge on many subjects than to know and specailize only one .

First of all , we live in a world that is exhibiting tremendous developments in many fields , in order to keep up with this rapid development , we need to further broaden our knowledge .
For example a doctor who knows alot about medicine , should also be familiar with other skills such as , dealing with the emotional aspects os the patient .
He also needs to have some knowledge about accounting and legal aspects to run his own private clinic .
In other words , he needs the specailized skills as a doctor , and the some general skills to know how to deal with some vital aspects .

Moreover , computer technology is one branch that has showed tremendous developments and has changed our lives in many ways , so a basic knowledge of the skills to use a computer is crucial to many people , no matter what thier field of study or interests are .
For example , a teacher in science class will get the information he/she needs from textbooks for his/her student .
However , learning how to use computer and to search the internet opens a teacher to a wide range of information that benefits both the teacher him/her students .
So a basic skill in computer is needed , besides the knowledge as a science teacher .

Furthermore , having a broad knowledge of alot a subjects opens us up to new worlds and show us what we really are .
To be more precise , someone who is an expert in geology might study art and literature .
and becomes more interested in museums , art galleries , and reading books .
This will open him up to intersting thing like travelling abroad to explore historical events and art in other countries .

In my opinion , it is crucial to have a wider range of information on many academic subjects .
It makes us more successful in our careers , it opens us up to new worlds , and show us our values and interests .
