Young people these days tend to have less contribution to their communities compared to the previous generation ( s ) , this is very obvious if we had a look at the behavior of most of the youngsters , for example Young people in the old days used to help their families working in farms , raising cattles or in any other business the family might run .

They were also very compassionate to other poor people were they used to look after them or help them as much as they can .
Whereas these days young people are found to be much less of a help to thier families or to the community in general ; they tend to look after their own interests or even spend any spare time relaxing .

There are several reasons to this change in behavior :
the first and most important reason is that the whole world is demanding more and more on currency for living , the demands of an an average person are increasing too which leads to more work required to keep up with the accelerating life style .

Communities are growing bigger which lead to having less effort being done to community members .
Also religious instructions are not being taken as seriously as they used to be and hence less help is being provided to the community .
In conclusion changing life style lead to change in behavior and personality of the young people and as a result young peolpe are less helpful than they used to be .
