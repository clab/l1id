i disagree about young people nowdays they dont give enough time to help their communuities example some people doesnt give time for their family they go to work or with friends but they forget about their family , and some people in work doesent give time for their work and they dont come at time and dont show any reasponsebility .
that all become back to the socaity cause we think that we can help any one just in words and in other ways we can make communications with people so we will have more friends more work more from anything good we need , young people is looking about something silly like going out to have fun with out caring about our responsablety , now we can make many thing to help our communities by teaching them giving them from our time to help them getting more happiness and more good feeling , when we forget about them we are making them disappointed so by our minds we can help them to get better we can make a party so they can share the happiness with us and taking them trip so they can have fun and feel that there is more people young once caring about them it will not take anytime from young people to make all this its just needs some free time for taking a break and make something personaly for communities but we ask always about silly thing such as going out having fun alone and that is so selfish why cant we think about someone else that will make us also happy i hope that young people think in that away and make something to help the communities not only communities will feel better even we will feel better cause we did something good and we gave something special .
