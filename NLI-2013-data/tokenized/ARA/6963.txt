It is a very important question , but the answer is not very simple .
The number of cars in use changes due to several reasons .
1 )
The Prices of Oil ( Gasoline ) in the world .
If the prices of oil in the world will be higher , then people will try to use the public transportation , because it will be Cheaper than using the cars .

2 ) The economic growth in diffirent countries will increase the number of cars in use .
3 ) The growth in population .
4 ) The developed infrastrcture constructing for public transportation such as : Trains , Subway trains , electric trains , etc ...
5 ) The efforts to make the enviorment less polluted .

The abovementioned reasons effects the number of cars in use in the future .
While someone may say , that the enviorment issue ( pollution ) will be a very important problem in the world , and it will be solved by reducing the use of cars , the other will say that this would be right for the countries with a strong economic basis , but not for the third world countries or for the non developed countries .
these countries may face an economical growth in the next twenty years , and therefore it 's citizens will use more cars , in particular if there will not be a convenient public transportation system for use .
In addition , these countries may invest there major efforts in the future in increasing the economical growth , instead of handling enviormental issues .

I believe , that the use of cars in the strong economy based countries will be reduced in the next twenty years , and that is because of :
1 - The develpoed public transportation system they have .
2 - High prices of the oil in the world .
3 - Enviormental issues , that will be very important to be solved by reducing the pollution of the enviorment .
4 - The minor increase of the population itself in these countries .

On the other hand , I am not sure that the use of cars in the third world , and develpoed countries will be reduced in the next twenty years , but it may happen afterwards .
