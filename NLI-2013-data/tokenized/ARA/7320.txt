Breif news `` An adult man have been lost since 14 days '' BBB cahnnel How people enjoy their trip in vacation ? .
I believe that any tour must have guider to manage the members , his/her knowledge about the locations and proper time to be in different spots .

The tour guider considers as boss of that trip .
However , s/he can a sign a duties for each member of that trip in order to make successful .
For example , I remember my friends and I , went in several trips .
One day , the chose me as tour guider due to my awarness of the place that we intended to visit .
I gave an assignments for different people in the trip like , who is going to be the driver for each car , where to go and where to stop .
At that time we did enjoy our travel with out any obsticls .
A freind of mine told me a story , that they planned for camping in the deseret , they were group of ten guys , unfortunatelly , about two of his freinds did not follow the group of guider , who has navigator , and got lost .
The group were expecting them that they will go back home , but the truth that they died after three days of struggling to find their direction in that vacant place that have only soil and sun .

Although , the tour guider sometime could be a dogmatic person , but i beleive it is the most convenient to make the travel successful .

Finally , I beleive any trips must be guid by one person
