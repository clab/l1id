Travelling is one of the most interesting beneficial , eye-opening , horizon-widenning hobbies a person couldn have .
Every time you travel and see a new place you get the chance to meet new people , be introduced to a new culture , and get acqaunted with new habits and tradtions , not to mention the food .

Yet Travelling if not planned properly can end up to be a nightmare .
Lets say you have decided to travel to a far-away country where u know no one , and ca n't speak their language , u have never been there , and have no clue on what to expect .

In this case its better to arrange your trip through a travel agent where she/he hooks you up with their partner in the country you are going to , to take care of you and arrange some guided group tours for you to go around and see the country .

This can be the right choice in many situations .
If you are going to a relatively unsafe country , where its not advised to wonder around alone .
If you are worried that you wont be able to communicate with the people in that country because of the language .
If you are travelling alone with no friends or family , and you want to socialize on your trip , being in group guided tours might be a good chance for you to meet people and have fun while site-seeing .
At the same time u gaurantee to get enough information about the sites you visit on your trip , since the tour guide will be briefing you about each and every place you pass by .

As much as this sounds safe , entertaining , and informative .
I prefer to travel on my own .
Something I got used to and enjoy doing .
I tend to find travelling on your own more interesting , and forces you in a way or another to mingle with the locals , to get more immersed into that culture , and get a better taste of that place you are visiting .
Besides , you would be able to follow your own schedule and go and see places you choose to see and not the tour guide planned for you to see .
It would give you the chance to do some research and reading about that place , before and during your trip .
You will be you own master , your own guide .

Our day to day life is already scheduled and going according to a certain plan , when I go on a holiday or travel , I do that to run away and relax .
On my trip , I do n't need to sleep and wake up , eat or shop , according to someone 's esle plan , not my own desire .
Otherwise I will end up not enjoying my trip while the tour guide ends up making lots of commission from each and every single shop or resteraunt she/he takes the group to , and most of the time they are bad choices .
