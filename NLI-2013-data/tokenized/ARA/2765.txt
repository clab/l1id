Every person in his or her life would have a golden period to enjoy his or her life in more than other periods , and in my opinion this golden period is in the age between 20 - 29 years , acording to that i absolotly agree with the statment thay says `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' and thats for many reaseons .

The main reason why i agree with this statment is that a person when is young have more energy than older people have to do a lot of things , and this energy let one enjoy life more than not having it or having it lees , an old man had lived more than a young one and saw more things and had more experience in life so he or she would be tired of life and would not enjoy it as like as a young one do , a young person is still freash minded so he or she would still have alot of ideas and a lot of beutiful things in mind wanted to do to enjoy life and in a young age she or he would like to do everything he or she could do in acording to enjoy life and would have more pationt to do such things than the older people do , also their are a lot of enjoyable things that older people can not do because of their age otherwise an young person can do it easily ,

Finally i would like to say that even i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , that doesnt mean that older people does not enjoy life , i think that older people could enjoy life by other ways than young people do that could be apropriate for them and for there age , in my opinion every person could enjoy life if he or she want to but in different ways .
