I agree with this statement that it is better to have knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Of course there are many reasont to agree with this statement , for example , studying many subjects will help us in our future life that we got alot of knowledge and experience of studying these subjects , also it will help u to study any major u want in universities because u had already studied most of the subjects , and for the far future for getting a job it will help alot that u studies these all subjects .
I think also it help in ur family life that you can help your kids in studying at schools by teaching them and explaining many thing that you had already know about it .

In conclousin , studying many subjects help alot in yuor future life , so i advice any person to go thru many subjects and read alot it helps in many ways .
