Having a successful career is what everyone dream and work hard to achieve .
When a people reache their goal they tend to be more protective about any descions that might not work well with them and causes them to loose everything they worked hard to obtain .
Though , the term `` risk takers '' has grown popular these days , I have to admite my disagreement about it .
Taking risks is a huge thing to do , it 's an act that you must think about very well before going through with it .
Any successful person at some point will admit that having a safe garintade lifr is better than living a life depends on taking risks .

My uncle is well-known business man in Saudi Arabia .
He is so smart and successful .
People actually used to say about him that everything he touchs turn it to gold .
My uncle was not known for taking any risks when it comes to his money .
However , when the stock market was first introduced and many people started to gain a good profit out of it ; he decided to give the stock market a try .
He put alot of money into it .
At the beginning his money doubled and than after a brief while the stock market went down .
He ended up loosing all of what he has put there .
Eversince , the only thing we hear from him is `` risks , never again '' .

Life has changed nowdays .
Everything has grown so expensive and the standard of living has definatly grow high .
Offering a good , comfortable and garintade future is the best way to live .
If your income will offer you that than why change and take riske that might end the future you have planed for you and your family .
You never know what might happen tomorrow .
Perhaps this is why successful people do not tend to take risks and try new things that basicly depends on pure luck .
