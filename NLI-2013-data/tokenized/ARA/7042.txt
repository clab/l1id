Now adays , technology plays main role in our lifes , as it facilitates communication through out the whole world .
Some of the aspects of these technology may now be considered normal , but few years ago it would have been thought of as magic ; two or three centuries ago cars would have been though of as mericales and not common as these days .

I guess that we have to consider this rapid changes in technology , before judging the next twenty years .
I think that in the next few years ; man will discover a better and less dangour way to transport ; he will notice how polluting these cars are , and that they already have damaged most of the earth 's atmosphere , then he will invent something new that will replace the car existance in our streets , and I imagine that the main issue of the era will be how to save the earth from the damages that happened through the last centuries .
He will also find faster means , that he will find it to be more convinient than cars , and this is expected as cars will not be enough to supply his needs in fast transportation .
Some people might consider the whole issue as imaginary subbject and that its impossible to make such a change in few years , but lets look at car history .
Cars were invented and became in use in less than ten years ; lots of companies were racing to produce it in several shapes and with distincit facilites .
As example Ford company was convinced with the idea , that cars can replace all the existing methods of transportation , and have a primary role in the market , so they made great production that the owner was said to be mad , but it came up that he was right , and the whole product was sold and the compnay became a major one .

Looking through out the history will make us see it clear that no technology , no matter how large or common , will last , so I guess that this is an enough reason to think that cars will disappear in the next twenty years .
