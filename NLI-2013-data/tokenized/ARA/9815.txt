`successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing whwt they already know how to do well ' yes i agree with this statement .
in general successful people have done this step before i know many people how have taking a risk in order to arrive to their aims .
for exemple Mr. Mohammed is a director of a company of construction .
he was a modest worker before .
one day he says .
why not having my own company / ?
so he gets a llong experience in construction then he tries to buy a small area of land then after he sells it by a high price then he buys other land .
after that he gets a lot of money to realize his company .

at this time he wants to have an other company for his son .
at the moment his son is a student at the institute of technology in the same field according to this exemple i 'm plaised to enter in a big risk to improve my situation and i 'm ready to support all risks that i will have in the future .

Most famous people do that .
to sum up having a risk can improve and help people to have a success life but it should be taken with a long study and responsability
