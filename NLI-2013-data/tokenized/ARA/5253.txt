Yes , I agree with that because that 's really happen , they try to make us buy their products by their advertisements on TV , radio , telephon and newspaper .
The companies are competing now who can get more customers .
most of them are not true just to keep people buy their stuff , and there are many examples about that when you watch TV they made a good advertisement to keep you buy their products .
Actually that stuff are not as good as they say , I believe that if I have a company I am not going to do an advertisement because the good products do not need an advertisement and I believe that many people think as I think .
The advertisement plays an important rule and it has an influence on people and big affictes as well .
You can see that when you go to mall or a big store there are many products some of then have an advertisement and they have no popular .
In the other hand , many products have no advertisement but they have a good popular .
As for me , I do not care about the advertisements in order to that no difference between them and sometimes I prefer to buy some products which do not have advertisement .

Finally , I believe that when you see the products are better in the advertisement that they really are , are cheating because they do not say the truth .
However , they lie and cheat people , and I hope that they can change their way to sell the products and stop cheating people .
