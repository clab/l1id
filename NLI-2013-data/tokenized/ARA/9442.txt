I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts it is for them to learn facts .
It usually for the students to know how they make a good life and understanting the fact .
Not only for the students but also in every peson in this life .
Learning facts is how to make your minds open .
There is many reasons for my agreement , it makes the student have more understanding for anything , and to keep the idea in his head .

Any student must make concepts the idea for him to understant the idea exactly .
If he concepts the idea and he understand it very well , he would not forget it any more , and he will learn the facts by this way .
For very simple example , if the student takes in the school that if he will not wash his hand before the meal , he would have a stomech aeche , so he will do it any more .

Not only for the student but also for any pearson , even children or adults peaple .
In their job or in their house they should concept evrything for them self to know it correctally or exactly .
Anybody should konw the fact for everything to make them minds open , therefore , it make them very understanding person to talk with them .

In conclusion , understanding idea and concept it for them is very good idea to know the fact exactly .
Knowing the fact is some thing very important to be an open minds person .
