There is no doubt that advetisements specially today look much more attractive than the quality of the product itself .
In my opinion this statement is correct .
While many other people may have different opinion .

From these people point of view , making good advetisement can encourage people to at least try this product .
So this product may be good and they buy it afterthat .
But if the method of advertisement is not good and not interesting to people , this will lead to failure of the advertised product .
So they see that the advertisement must be better than the product at least till people try it as it 's the first step for the product to succeed .

In my opinion this is not correct advertisement for a definite thing , but it 's called cheating .
The sincerety in advertisement must be considered for the general benefit .
If the advertisement did n't reflect the actual properties of the product , this would lead to a bad reputation and so death of the product by time .
In my life i have an example that makes me aggressive about these types of advertisement .

For instance , one day there is an advertisement about new meter for measuring blood glucos level .
They said that it 's the most accurate one and its needle causes no pain at all , etc ...
Then we bought it for my father who is diabetic .
We started to use it and every time it gives good and exellent readings about sugar level .
Suddenly , one day my father dropped on the floor .
When we picked him to the hospital we surprised about his sugar level which is very high .
As a result it causd serious complications to him specially on heart .

In a nut of shell , it 's right when you say that the products are not really good as their advertisements introduce them .
So , my advice is never to buy any new product except after it 's thrown in the market for a longtime and was tried by many people .
