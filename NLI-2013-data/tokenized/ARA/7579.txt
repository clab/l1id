I agree the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide .
Last summer i went to Itlay with a group and a tour guide , I liked my trip becuse I meet new people form diffrent places and shier same informations .
If I did not with the guide I would miss many places in Italy .
In the same time , I did not konw the history for the places i had visit .

Two years ago , I went to Japan with my friend , most of the time we were lost because , we did not speake thier language and did not know thier transportion system .

Travel with the group and the tour guide is cheper than trave alone and you cane see more places in limited time .
In addation , some trave agents have many tours so , you can select what you like .
However , they have programs during the trip to make the travels enjoy they trip .

There is bad thing when travel with group , some pepol do not respect the others and make the travelers do not like the trip .
But in genral I prefe travel with group and a tour guide .
