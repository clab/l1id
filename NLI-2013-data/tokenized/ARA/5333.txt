I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Now adays advertising and media is every thing to consumers .
Companys pay millions in ads .
every year to survive in the market and competition .

It all goes back to the consumer , not every thing u see in the advertisements could exactly be the same as u see .
or example the soup U see boilng in the TV looks always as if it tastes good , but U might try it once and it might not suit U.This why I say it all goes back to the consumer .
Another example is a laptop which looks very nice in a newspaper advertisement , but once seeing it with ur eyes it looks smaller than the picture and not the right quality .
There are lot of types of advertisements .
One type is acompany whose looking for long term bussiness not willing to get out of the market easily , so they try to keep there advertisement the closest to reality as much as possible .
Another type is a company that wants to sell the product a couple of times and build the company on the support they will offer with the product , and these companies need to have nice advertising a little bit , than reality so the consumer can buy from the first pass .
They companies are mainly found in the market and they are meduim run companies .
Another type of company is a company who wants to sell its product for 1 time and leave with the profits , so this type of company has to pay alot in a very fansy way of advertising method so the consumer can buy once only .

Finally what i can say is people now a days are more and more educated than old days , so most of the advertising should match up peoples thinking and they should be the closest to reality and the best looking to consumers .
