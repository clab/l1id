Travelling is one of most exciting things to do on a holiday .
When I have the time , I like to travell alot .
I have visited India , Egipt , and Morocco .
There are some difficulties that you might incounter during a vacation .
For that reasoun i think that its best to be in a group or to have a toure guide .

First , you may have difficulties finding the right place that you want to be in .
For example , you might want to visit a cetain mall or a mounten but you can not find where it is .
More often , you may get lost in the new country .
A toure guide will organize your trip and make your vacation more enjoyable .

Second , you may have difficulties with a forigne language or culture .
For example , a cetain sign in one culture may be offinsive in an other culture .
Also , a certain word in one culture maybe offinsive in an other .
Having a torue guide will avoid you thies proplems and will help you with the language and the culture .

Third , you maybe defraud by other people in a new country or someone may steal your things .
For example , I went two years ago to Morocco .
While i was there someone tried to steal my bag and passport .
Luckly he failed to do so .
Beeing in a group and having a toure guide will be most benefical in that case .
The toure guide will avoid places where you might get hurt in , Also , will make sure that you stay in the most comfetable places .

In conclusion , i think that having a tour guide is very important .
First , a toure guide will help to go wherever you want in the most comfetable ways .
Second , a tour guide will help you deal with the new culture and language .
Third , a tour guide will keep you save in any case .
