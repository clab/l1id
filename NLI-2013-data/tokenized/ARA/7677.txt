Travelin With a Tour Guide

Although traveling with a tour guide is interesting , but traveling alone is more fun because of many reasons such as , a tour guide is more expensive , the commitment with the tour guide , and speaking the country language is enough to travel .

Traveling with a tour guide is more expensive .
Nowadays , if people want to travel , they can find all the information about the place that they will go to in the internet or book guides .
It is cheaper and they can discover the places by themselves .

There is no commitment by traveling without a tour guide .
I had a Europe trip last summer and i travelled without a tour guide .
I went there with my friends and we used the book guides it was really helpful and fun rather than traveling with a tour guide .
Because the tour guide have specific times that people have to follow , they are not quite interesting .

Speaking the country language is enough .
My native language is Arabic , and i like to visit Arabic Countries such as , Egypt , United Emirates , and Lebanon .
I always visiting a travel agent before i went to these countries and he gave me guides about the good places in these counitries , so i did not need a tour guide .

On the other hand , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is interesing .
People can learn more about the countries and the places if they have a tour guide .
The tour guides can show the toursit all the historical places that they want to see , and they can explain the places for the tourist .
They can save tourist time because they know the places , so they show the tourist many places in short amount of time .

In conclusion , the best way to travel is different between each person .
Many people prefer to travel by themselves , and discover the places and live the adventure without a tour guide .
This kind of tourist want to be free , so they can go any place at any time without commitment .
