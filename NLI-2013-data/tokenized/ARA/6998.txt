This world we live in has always managed to find its way of a change such as what we have today : the common usage of cars every where .
To be honest i would never suspect that there will be a fewer number of cars ever , because the world isnt made to help people find another mean of transportation .
unless mankind succesfully achieves the prospect of spaceships or in other words floating cars , then there will be absoloutly no dought that i will be thinking differently .

What im saying is that it will take a much longer period of time for mankind to move on and give up on the cars we use , probably allot more than a hundred years if not more .

Ofcourse im hoping that a new type of transportation mean would be achieved because cars can be such a bother , for example car accidents and parkings and most importantly car oil or fuel .
Our worlds preservations are dying and its resorces are vanishing into thin air , and why do you think that is , just because we want to drive our cars .

Im sure its mankinds need for survival but that doesnt make it any less harmful towards nature .
In twenty years we will have lots of new ideas and inventions thats for sure but we are going to face an absoloutly big problem with the anormous number of cars being used and produced , the way i see it is that if we go on like this we might not manage to last for long .

I think that the cars industry is at its peak these days i mean how much better can cars get to be they already managed to create built in facilities in cars , some people can live comfortably in a car .

Cars are an amazing invention but it can be a double edged weapon if the number encreases through the next two decades .
