Media in our middle east region and a round the world always speaking about a very hot topic which is come from time to time , this topic is `` the role of young people in supporting their communities '' , I think i am disagree with most of the statement which told that young people nowadays do not give the time to help their communities and i have tow resons for disagree with this statement .

first , the young people in every community has alot of energy , kowledge and skills that can be utillized by goverments in order to support it is endless development , and their are alot of examples from history and modern age that give a really strong evidence that when the young people give the chance from their communities to play a leadership role in every aspect , the usually reflect this trust by doing the writh job .

Secound , some communities try to avoid giving the young people the chance to helping their communities because they do n't have a confidents on them , they always try to depend on the experianced poeple , and this is usually come from misunderstanding and miscommunication between the new generation of young people and the old generation which is representive by experianced people .

finally , I think icommunities should give their `` Young people '' the chance to demonstrate their ability to build those sociaties , then it is going to be one of those communities great invesment on the real gold which the '' human resources '' factor , and which will have it high impact on the nation development .
