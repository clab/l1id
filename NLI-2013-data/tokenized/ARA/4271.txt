Many people belive than younger generation are different from the older one and they dos n't posses the same morals and manners as the elders have .
Or they may be less responsible or less cooperative with other members of society .

I do n't know from where this idea came from .
I belive that every generatin has a bright side and a dark one .
It is not fair to generalize an idea wether is bad or good over large number group of population , becuase simply we not the same .

I believe that people are differnet and vary from person to another regardless the age or the time or the place they belong to .
Each generation has its own life conditions and atmosphere that could have a great impact on people behavior , like weather , finacial status , education , civelization , cultural development , believes and society customs .
What works with one generation doe n't mean that it works with another .

I do n't see any valuable mean of that statment .
There are still mush of goodness in people , people stil tell this time helping each other , providing services to commmunity without asking for rewards .

There are many feeding poor hunger people on the other side of the world .
The are some still have th working volenteerly with human organization to save others and to give hand who really need help .
Me my self with other school collegues participate in a volenteer job in Red Crecent organization in Palestine .
We were working as a medical Laboratory technologists in a very poor pemetive laboratory at the hospiatal .
We had worked as a team to help poor and severly injured patients in any pssible way we got to help them .
We were collecting samples from them try to diagnose their health problem to make them feel soon healthier .
