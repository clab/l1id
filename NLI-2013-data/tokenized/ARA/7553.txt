The issue of whether we should travel in a group or alone has been widly debated spcially after the events that happened around the world .
Some people like to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
Other people like to travel alone and without a tour gide .
Both approaches have advantages and disadvatages .
Although , tour guide gives more and easy information about the places , socities , people , and the history of the country that we visite , I would rather traviling alone and without tour guide .

Some people may argue that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
It is more easy to descover ; so this argument goes , the places and avoide any trubles .
However , traveling is an enjoment that icloudes discovering new things and knowing different people and get in touch with different culturals .
Therefore , if I travel in a group led by a tour guide , I will be controlled by the guide 's directions and I wolud not be able to act and get in touch with others by my own way .

Moreover , travel alone or with a good friend not with a group that I do not know provides me with a uniqe experience .
For example , three years ago I traveled to the United Arab Emirates with my best friend , Jack , .
Eventhough non of us use to live or being there before , we had a very good time and experience .
We rent a care from Abu Dhabi , the capital city , and we almost went every where in the country just by using the mabs and asking people in streets .

In conclussion , I believe that traveling alone and without been attached to any group gives the most wonderful experience in the life .
