i do agree with this statement .
people who take the risks are the ones who are successful .
for exmaple , if we look into our everyday lives , we can see that most millionares and billionares are the people who have actually tried something in thier lives and the people with normal wages are the people who are working for them .
The difference between the Employer and the Employee .
Not all these successful people begin successful or even have a gift that they are born with ...
in some cases that is .
Most of those people are born just like you and me , and just have vague ideas of particular suff excatly like everyone else .
The only problem is that they have the courage to actually take a shot and see if thier idea works unlike everyone else who walks around saying that i had an idea or i though of that !

If no one actually took the shot of doing something and showing the whole wide world what he was thinking about most inventions in our time now would not have existed and we would be where our ancestors were before thousands ands thousands of yeas ago , right back to the times of cavemen using tools made out of wood and rocks .
so imagine this , no cell phones , no tv 's , no cars , no washing machines , no driers , no ovens no nothing !
yes you probably envy those `` successful '' people and wish that was you or you just pray to god that he would lose all his money in a way and eventually become a `` normal '' paid citizen just like you are but as a matter of fact if it wasnt for his risk on showing his idea your necessaties or goods that you buy for liesure would not have been provided for you .

We are all basically the same , but these special people who come up everytime and time again are the successful people .
Now i know for a fact that i might not be one of them but you can always hope for things to happen for you .
Try your best at taking risks as you never know you might end up on the `` successful '' list .
Theres no use of living your whole life without taking a risk ...
whats the fun of life then .
