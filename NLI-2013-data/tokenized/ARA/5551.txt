Advertisements

Today advertisements used as a cmplemantery of any product .
So people use advertisements to make the product much more than the reallity .
The main reason behind that is to atttact consumers and push them to buy these products and make as much money as possible .

The baisc objective for advertisements is to explain for the customers how is the product and what are the benifits that customer would gain by obtaining this product .
But unfortunitly today this concept is used unethically .
Because most of the advertismets shows the product in a way that is perfect and has endless benifits and in reallity non of these benifits can be found in this product .
For instance onec I saw an advertisment regarding a device that promotes the wireless conections so you can enjoy the interent access widely .
However I found that there is now promotion for the wirless connection and as of I did not add any enhancement to the internet access .
So by doing this advertisers are misusing the advertising and make poeple to buy things that they do not need and this is unethical .

There are many advertisments that adds lots of features to the product while in reallity these featres are not avaliablel in the product .
for exmple there are many computer systems advertised on the Internet and TVs that saves the computer from viruses and spys and in reallity they do not save the computers from the viruses nor protect the computer from the spy ware .

In fact by these fake advertisments shopes and producers will be affected in the long run .
Since they would lose thier reputation .
Because when the customers find the conteradiction between the advertisments and the products they bought the would never buy these products again .
For example I will not buy the wireless device again .

So , people should be careful while advertising they should show thw customers the trouth about thier product and explain the real benifts that the customers wouold gain from this product .
By this way customer rights are saved and shops and producerd would gain the trust of thier consumers .
