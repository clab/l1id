Cars have been a topic of concern to all of us .
Who does n't own a car nowadays in the modern world .
They serve as a means of transportation , they 're fun to collect , ride and even take care of .
So will they be there for us in the future ?

Everyone dreams in at least one stage of his life being that of a kid , teenager or adut to own a car or drive a car .
It seems that cars are more of a culture than a just a vechile .
Personally , I 've been asked several times about my favourite car .
In contrast , more people are tending to use cars .
It 's a fast method of transportation , faster than conventional methods like bikes .
It is also personal which differentiates it from public transportation .
It comes in all sizes , colors and shapes and models , so it 's fun to collect and ride .
All these factors combined may make it difficult for people to accept the idea of not using cars and heading to other methods of transportation .

On the other end , There are also some factors that may have some influence on decreasing the number of cars .
More attention is being placed on the effects of cars , especially when we mention all the pollution that it produces , be it aucostic or environmental and safety issues .
Some cities ( one of them in turkey ) which I visited have rules against using cars .
It 's a small village of course but it 's really wonderful to live in a noise free , non-polluted environment where the only noise you can hear is horse carraiges , walking people and bikes .
Today , lots of environmental restrictions have been placed on car companies to address pollution and help develop `` clean cars '' , one example is in California where they have strict rules agianst pollution .
Safety is also a main concern and different measures are being applied to help develop `` safe cars '' like the deployment of safety pillows , ABS systems and Anti-slip systems .

In my opinion , the only way that cars are going to be reduced in number is the invention of some new vehicle that can replace cars ( small jets , like the ones viewed in the Jetson cartoon which I saw once . )
I think that the number of cars will remain on in a steady increase as newer models are produced that minimize the cons of such automobiles which include the reduction of pollution emitted and that that address safety issues of the driver and pedastrians .
