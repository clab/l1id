I agree with the statement '' the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide .
Before someone travels to a place about which he does n't know anything , he has to have an organized plan for his trip .
If he did n't have a plan , he would miss a lot of things .
The best way to have a guranteed and accomodative plan is to let the tour guide do it for many reasons .

First of all , the tour guide is a specialist and and know about the place more than the ordinary person .
The tour guide wo n't miss any place that is worth of visiting .
The ordinary person might not have the ability to know all the nice places that have to be visited .

The second reason is that the tour guide saves the time and the effort that the person would spend looking for the tourism places .
This will make him use every hour and day of his travel without missing any in thinking where to go and in sitting plans .

Moreover , travelling in groups is a llot of fun .
It is better than travelling a lone .
The travel time becomes shorter by making friendships with the other people at the trip .
When people travels in groups , they have nice memories with each other more than if they travel a lone .

Group travel with a tour guide leader also reduces the possibility of getting lost , robbed or involved in a danger .
The tour guide would be trained to solve such matters while the individual might get in troubles and does n't know how to deal with the people in that country .

The language also an important issue .
If the person did n't know to speak the language of the country to where he is travelling , he would have many troubles and difficulties communicating with the people there , but if he travelled with a group and with a tour guide , they would help him to communicate and also learn from them .
