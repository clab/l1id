I agree that young pepole nowadays do not give their communites the required time in order to help them in a sufficient way , ther are many reasons that support my point of view , and I will discuss them here .

first of all , young people nowadays tend to spend their time in unuseful activites without being care of the importance of their behaviours , they want to spend their free time speaking with their friends about unimportant things , such as a television series , consequently , they will not find enough time to help poor people or to improve agood idea in order to serve the local people in their community , such as , cleaning the streets and planting trees .

Second , young pepole prefer investing their time doing their special works and requirement , rather than participating in a common activity that will benifit the others .
they see that their time is owned for them only .

Third , each one of them want to be the best , so he/she try not to help the others and not to enhance any thing around him like the education in his/her community .
he/she like to get the best chnces , oppurtinities and to deprive the others from them .

In conclusion , I agree that youngs restrect their time on themselves and not to benifit their communities .
