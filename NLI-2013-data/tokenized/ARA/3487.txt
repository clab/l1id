on my opinion , I agree with following statment , becose saverel thing .
firest , young people nowadays didnt give enough time to helping their communities , satch as , during smumer they do any thing to help pepole speshelly the old pepole , invirement , clean ocen , or drage pepole .
so the young must be do some thing to help us .

in the thierd world their is allot of station to work in. second , the goverment in third world dont allowd to young pepole make any thing it fred of them .
in fact the realty hard to children , womans , and old men , not the young people .
so the last thing l went to writte it .
it about respenspltey of govrement to allwed for this young to reserve anther pepole with out many .
joust for the gad , hapienes , or homens .
do some thing for anther pepole will do thing for you in anther pleas and time .
