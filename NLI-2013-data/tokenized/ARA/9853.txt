Take the risk !
It is an one of the rules in guiding the way to Success .
It has always been that successful people have been noted as Risk-takers when they face a critical cross in the lives .
They try new things instead of doing only things that they already know .

Trying new things will not always lead into loses or disappointments .
On the contrary , it sometimes lead to new paths , and great brand new results .
It is in fact the way behind most of the discoveries and inventions of the human race .

For example , Christopher Colombus was so persistent in running after his dream of sailing into the east through the Altantic ocean , and not through Africa to the Indian ocean .
After he got his nessecary funding , he took the risk of shipping into the Atlantic ocean , though many people thought that earth was flat , and then eventually , he and his ships will fall down to to the bottom of Hell .
But , his out-of-the-box thought led him to discover the Americas .

In fact , he tried sailing to the east , and he reached a land that he thought was India , but it was not .
His discovery has changed the whole world and humanity .
Moreover , it proved that the earth is not flat , but rounded shape .

In conclusion , we have seen that successful people did not do what they already know to do well , but they take risks that led them to the glory of success .
