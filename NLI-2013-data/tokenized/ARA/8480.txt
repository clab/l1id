Students all around have to obtain learning facilities .
but it varies from a person to another the way they should obtain this information .
I agree that it is more important for a student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts due to alot of main points that support my decision .
and it is supported with futher explaination throught out my essay .

For students to learn the facts they are provided with .
It is very easy for them to forget the information later on .
The students do have a rate of acceptability for information , if he/she cannot be able to understand the ideas these facts are based on , they simply are forgotten by time .
Another point to discuss is the amount of pleasure takin in when the student is recieving this information .
it is very dull and boring for a person to sit and accept alot of ideas into his head and simply just memorise them .
it is more fun to understand the concept , discuss it and then understand it so that it would not become temporary .

Student should be recieving information in an orderly manner .
for example a physics class , It start off wid introducing the topic and then orienting the students to the type of information in this course so they are able to understand the ideas and concepts faster .
Rather than giving then the formulas and letting them memorise these facts and try to solve on their own .
It is very convenient for a student to understand first and then try to work the rest out by himself .
The last and main point is , that understanding the information enhances the students self confidence .
For example , if the student is asked about a specific topic he could easily recall it and explain it from his understanding rather than reciting what he learned before .

I agree that it is more important for a student to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts because as i mentioned before it is easier , it is no temporary and mainly it is enhances self confidence .
