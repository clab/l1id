Helping communities is avery good work .
every sigle person can help his communities by diffrent ways .
Young people have the energy , health and the ideas , so they can use all these for thinking in smart ways for helping thier communities .
In my country there is a large number of young people a round 60 % .
Thy are busy in there self , thy dont spend time to help the society that they live in .
I think to solve this problem , it needs to put a plan .
By encouriging the students in the schools and the universities to valenter to help the communitie , by visiting the hospitals , the houses for the old people and every way where can they help .

And important thing , that we never plaim them or trying to fee that they are gelty .
