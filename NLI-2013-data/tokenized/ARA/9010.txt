It 's surely important to the students to undertand ideas and concepts and maybe it could be more simple to explain to their in that fashion , especially when it 's for exemple an math course and you consider that it 's either not important , or is not their level yet .
But if you see this problem like that , you will be obliged to work in it case by case , so in a general view a think that some person consider in many case that with only the concept or the idea the person understand well the problem without to learn the facts .
What it 's surely wrong , because you can be sure that he did the experience , so he know the facts .
Maybe he do n't know why or when , but he did it .
And you can check it with simple problems of the life for exemple , so if you consider that you know it because it 's simple , you wrong , all can be resume by ower experiences or facts of experiences of another one .
And maybe the stronger proof that I can done , it 's when you are in a somewhat difficult ideas and concepts , you are obliged to take in count the facts to undertstand the idea , because you ca n't did it whithout .
And logiquely we understand that the experience play a great part in ower logic and comprehension , and you ca n't that understand you are ogliged to observe , work in it , or do an effort to obtain the facts
