I agree that students must understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts When the student understand idea about any lesson , suppose it is pharmacology , that kind of medical science is hard to be learned by facts .
The student when understands pharmacology and the concepts in medical terms , can use what he learned as a fact in his practice life .
The student have to love before understand , and by meaning love , its a childhood love to specific study or work to do , when he grow up .
After that he is going to understand the ideas of what he love , let us say the he loves football , so that is the begining , than he must understand the ideas and rules of football , before going to the fact that he maybe a great player .

So first love something , whatever it is , game , study , job , anything in the world , than understand very good the ideas and concepts of what we love , than we may face or learn the facts of what we love .

MAybe a lot of people agree with learning facts before understanding it , is it helpfull ?
maybe yes , it may reach the chooser of this fact to the top , or make him depressed all his longlife , so it is a chance or opportunity to some people to do it , if they want to learn facts before understanding , they may do it but the consequences are not known .

Actually understanding concepts of pharmacy to me , made me love it more than anything else , but when i finish the studying and began to learning fatcs that im working in a field that is full with non honor people , and people using it as a business for money only not for health and money , if i had knewed or learned these facts before i understand pharmacy and medical concepts , i definetly would not choose to understand ideas and concepts of a great science and a very important science in human health and life .
