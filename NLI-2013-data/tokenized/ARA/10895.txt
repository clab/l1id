A famous man once said , `` from experience , comes skill ...
yet experience comes from risk . ''
This means that to obtain skill one needs experience , and to obtain experience one needs to take a risk .
Therefore To be successful one needs to learn how to take risks .

When a child goes to school , they are taught the essentials that they are going to need in their life ; reading , writing , listening and leadership .
When this child moves on to high school they are taught specifically what they need to learn to fullfill their ambitions .
When a child graduates from school they use their previous knowledge to get a work place and a consistant job ...
then what ?

The person has got this far , yet are they truly successful ?
are they truly at their full potential ?
the answer is no !
one will never get raised or moved up in the corporate ladder if they are only doing what they are told .
This is because everyone else is doing exactly what they are told too .
To make ones self stand out they must be able to take risks and put yourself on the line .
Show the employer that you are willing to do anything for the cause and you will get moved .
However if you stay put and dont take risks then you will not move anywhere and stay at the same level as everyone else that does n't take a risk .

A prime example in history is that of Galileo .
He took a risk by defying the whole scientific system of his time and saying that the world was round and that the universe was heliocentric ( sun in the middle ) .
Of course he was laughed at and not taken seriously , yet now students write about him in formal essays such as this one .
This man proved the whole world wrong simply by taking a risk .

There is no man or woman in a history book that is there because they did the ordinary , they are all there because they took some sort of risk .
To get far you will have to do things you already know , yet to be truly successful you will have to take risks .
