Cars are one of the most useful and important inventions .
There are millions and millions of cars in each country nowadays , but for the continuous incresing in the number of people living on earth and technology reasons I think that there will be less cars to use in the world in twenty years .

The first reason is that the number of people living in the plant is increasing every day .
I read an article once that said that over 100000 babies are born each day , but only less than half of that number of people die each day .
It will surely be very cowded by 2026 and much more people will be living on earth than now .
Houses will be built and more buildings will exist .
Parking lots will always be full and there will never be enough space to drive a car on the street .

The second reason is that in twenty years cars may not be as useful as they are now .
Little , cheap airplanes might be invented and on the roof of each house there might be space to park it .
On top of each buiding there might be a parking lot on the roof for planes to land .
Cities might all be connected with underground trains and no cars would be needed .

It is amazing how everything is changing in a short time .
100 years ago there were no cars at all and we cannot imagine how peolpe used to live , and in a short term of time there might be a new invention and people would imagine how `` we '' used to live !
