Most advertisements makes products seem much better than they realy are .
I totaly agree with this statement , most of advertisements give the consumers the advantages that they can get by using the products , and they try to avoid mentioning the disadvantages or the misuse or side-effects .

To give a life example of that statments , i will give an example from my personal field which is pharmacy .
Patrients or Consumers in other words like most of medical companies prefer to address them , see the advertisements on TV , or newspapper .
and easily get convenced with the mediaction because of the following .

First , they use easy langauge and something most of us suffering from like pain , insomnia and syptoms of allergy , Second , they keep repeating the advertisement over and over agian .
even some people get convenced that they have problem in sleeping although they do n't and how the medication is effective and safe .
I know one of my patient , that she forced her physicain to call me at the pharmacy to give me a phone - prescription for sleeping pills that she previously saw on TV .
Although , she was not suffering from any sleeping problems just she liked the advertisement and the music on it and the colour of the sleeping pill ( it was nice shiny pink colour by the way ) and i say forced him becuase some could say '' he has the right to refuse .
he is a doctor '' . yes , that is correct .
but she mentioned that she will go to every single doctor other than him to prescripe the medication for her in case he will refuse to do so .
and simply he does not want to lose bussiness .

Third , The side-effects of the medication are wrtten in small letters in the end of the advertisements or mentioned real fast that , the customers can not follow what was exactly said and the most important thing as i mentioned earlier .
it has to be in the end of the advertisement , so no one can pay attention .

We can use the example that i just gave about the medications and the advertisement and thier ways on every single aspects and fields on adverisement bussiness .
To conclude and summarize , I agree with the statement saying that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
for the previously mentioned reasons .
