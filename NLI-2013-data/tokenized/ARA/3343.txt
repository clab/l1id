although there is alittle time for young people , because of the high amount of reponsiblities , works , and maybe we can say schools ( if they were not graduated ) any one can order his time and hime self to get the benefits by doing alot of thing in ashort time like studying , working , and helpeng their communitien or famillies , but with out ordering time the person will lose the ability of working well , the person will not have time that he cannot do any more works .

Ordering time is the best way to relax and to have time for every thing .
so , the person will do alot of things like finishing his work , then having time to study , after that he will have the time to see his parents , relatives , and friends and ofcourse he will be able of doing any thing with them , as what i had observed and saw from my friend .
he was ordring his time will .
so , he done alot of work that i was unable to finish , he was going to his secondry school , then after finishing his classes , he was going to work with his father , after that he was taking care of his brothers , at last he able to set with his parents and help his communities .
as aresult of ordering his time .

On the other hand , with out ordering time the person will lose time and he may lose alot of work , like what was happened to one of my friends , he was wasting his time , for that he wasnot able to see and help his communities .
as aresult from having no time at all .
he was going to his school in the morning , then when he comes back he was going into his bed , then he was wakingup from bed in the midnight .
so , his life was not organized .

in my opinion i think that young people will have alot of time if they organized themselfs well .
as aresult of that i advise every one to order his time forthat he will have abetter life and he will help his or her communities .
