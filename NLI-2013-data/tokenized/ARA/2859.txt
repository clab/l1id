where are you going grandpa ?
shopping , golfing or maybe to a cruise on a yacht .
That is what i usually get when i am really bored of studing or tired of endless working hours while my grandfather or even my father are getting ready to go on some sort of selfpleasing activity .
I believe old people enjoy life more than youth or even teenagers do with all the study and work hours or the restrictions forced by parents .
It is so hard for a young family member to enjoy life as much as elders do .

As a begining , old people dont have any kind of study , midterms or finals to care about .
They dont have to spend hours studing , going to school , attending classes or even buying books .
They have alot of free time they can spend in any selfpleasing activity that brings happiness and joy to them .

In addition to that most of old people do not have a job or a career to care about .
Most of them are either business owners or unemployed at all which is evern better they have nothing to distract them from having fun .
Not like young people who spends between forty and fifty hours each week at work .
They have much more time to enjoy it .

Also , financial wise young people have alot of bills and payments .
After school fees , rent and maybe car morgage their is not enough money left to spend for fun or enjoyment .
Most of the time elder people dont have these kind of concerns Finaly , the limitations and restrictions forced by the family on their kids donot leave much space for fun .
you are not supposed to go their or you are not allowed to be out that late , thats usually what a young member of the family gonna endup getting .
Not liek elder ones with total freedom .

For all the spare time they have and the avilability of money or abscence of limitaions there is no dought older people enjoy life much more than youn ones do \
