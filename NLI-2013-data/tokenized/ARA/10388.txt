As people climb the ladder of success their ideas tend to change from dynamic and innovative to static and conservative .
I believe that succesful poeple focus and doing what they already know how to do rather than exploring or trying out new things and taking risks .

Reaching a level of success whether in bussiness or in life requires time and hard work , and upon reaching success risk would be to huge of a price .
For example , a bussiness man would prefer to `` keep-it-safe '' and insure his position rather than jeopardizing his whole career over a simple mistake .
The same goes for trying out new things , because successful poeple are who they are due to the priciples and polices that they have followed ; and for them to abandon such polices which lead them to success would be highly unlikely .
Thus the latter would prefer to follow a path of conformity instead of radical change .

Another important factor that renders successful poeple to aproach new things would be their mentality ( as in how the think ) in which they tend to rely on their past experiences as a measure for thier actions , while on the other hand fresh minds tend to graps new ideas faster and better thus striving to try out new things and build new experiences .
A typical example for a dynamic mind would be a fresh university graduate which is eager to learn and follow the path of success .

The ladder of success changes people in many ways , as they take the first step people are willing to take risks and try out new things ; but as their journey progresses they develope a new mentality which is built on past innovative , dynamic , and fruitfull experiences thus paving the way for a more conservative and limited mentality .
