i agree to have to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to speciallize in one specific subject becase learining many subjects gives you many succeful carrers and have a better futer while having only one subject you will be bored learing one subject and just have the same subject every day while others can mix up and enjoy having many subjects learining one subject is more easer and you can finish it faster but the bad thing is that you can find a faster job becase there will be others that they will have much highr degrees and they will have much highr rates and faster then the one who studied one subjectstuding many subjects creat many friends any other classes and they can help you in many different ways exampel some student in the biology class will help me in my homework or my project and in other class also im going to have other friends who are going to help me in my homework or presintation but studing with the same class dosent allow you to creat many friends studing many subjects alows you to ask many teachers about many sort of things example if you need a certain and specifc questions you need to ask the teacher who is specific in this subject but if your studing one subject its diffucelt to ask other teacher about a question you want to ask I prefer to study many subject becase im going to creat my own futer and have many freinds from other nationalitys this is my propose in life .
