will some times i do some times i dont .
And it depends on where is the persones from .
1 : The young people : the young people can do alot of sports with out giting taird .
they can do alot of things drive cars anything .
Will where iam from being young is more fun than being old .
U can do what evre u want u go to the beach aftter go to partes drive cool cars like BMW , LAMBERGENE , PORCH , CORVAT and more so here alot of the young people enjoy life more than the old people .

2 : The old people : will the old people like from age 40-50 have nice cars like : BENTLY , RR , MAYBACH and more ...
some of them do some sports go out have alot of money and things but from age 60 and so on they just sit in the house watch tv or do something in the house if he wants to go some where it will be to his frinds place or go to a restront or something so its boring .
Also where iam from the dads do evre thing to there sons like let them get married buy them cars evre thing and the son is like between 20-25 years old so he is so young and have so many good things .

The point iam trying to say is that the young people have much more fun than the older people where i come from .
but lets say another country for example ( LONDON ) : There i see the old people have more fun than the young ones not all but in genral u dont see a young one with a cool car like a BMW or so and u dont see a young one in a fanse restrant u only see old people going to fanse restrants , cool cars , and things so i say in a contry like that the old people have more fun than the young ones .
