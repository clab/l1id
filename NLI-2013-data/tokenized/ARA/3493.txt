Young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their cmmunities .
As we knowk , the develpment of the world in diffirent waysw is getting increasing more and more .
This , will effect the time .
Let 's take the internet as an example , a range of 4 to 6 hours is being spent ; and when you add this to the time that is spent on the education and sleeping we will see mostly no time to help the communities .
Parents can helpe by teaching them the importance of our communities and we must focus on how can we develope them .

Keep in mind that young people should be a developer for the communities not only a consumer .
These words have to be touhgt in depth to them and sure we will see a good generation that help not only our communities but also our proparaties that exist everywhere .

Finally , the enviroment where the young people raised in is important with the nature of thier parents .
