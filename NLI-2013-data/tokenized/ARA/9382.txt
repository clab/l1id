As the years pass by , many universities , schools and other institutions are trying to teach the future generations and provide them with the wide variety of sciences which make them ready for the future challenges .

The question that always rises in these institutions is whether it is more important for the students to understand the ideas and concepts or to learn the hard facts .

In my personal opinion , i think it is more important for the students to understand the main concepts of the subjects than to learn facts .

As for a student to learn a fact , all he has to do is to memorise it .
Memorising something without understanding it will lead to forgetting this fact as soon as _or shortly after _ the stimulus for memorising it is over .

Facts are only memorised and stored in the long term memory if they are constantly used in everyday life .
For example when a medical student has to memorise all different types of drugs .
If this student was n't asked about these drugs in every morning rounds , where he had to revise them everytime he made a mistake , he would otherwise forget them .

On the other hand , understanding the subject makes it easier to remember .
For example when the same medical student has to memorise some information about the physiology of the human body .
he can understand it once , and answer any questions related to this topic years after he had studied it .

This is why i prefer understanding the topic over learning the facts .
As the facts are easily lost over the years and what remains is what we understand of that particular subject .

Understanding the ideas and concepts requires far more work and processing by the student than only memorising the facts .
So it is always up to the student at the end to choose between understanding and memorising .
