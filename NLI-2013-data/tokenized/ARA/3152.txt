well to start with I utterly disagree with such statement because I believe that a man 's life resembles the different semesters of the year , in each lies beauty and happiness as well as problems and solutions .

younger people are more motivated to start thier journey in life , they feel stronger and more motivated to prove themselves , they have different kinds of activities and interest .
they are in the spring semester of their llives , where they are still green and growing fast .
they have a vast majority of choices and a load of decisions to make .

while older people are more relaxed , they are in the autum semester of thier lives , they made thier minds about the most crucial things in life , they took desicions and they are handling life more maturely , they are less motivated , but more aware .

what am trying to do is to shed more light on the mentality and the status of people at different stages of thier lives although it doesnt effect or interact with how much they enjoy their life .

But , in my opinion , what does effect the level of happiness , pleasure or enjoyment in life differs from one individual to another , it is totally related to ones perception of life and his prioreties and goals .
how much did i achieved till now ?
what I want from life ?
what I need in life ?
do i have it ?
we ask ourselves these questions all the time .

So , does young people enjoy life more that older people ? !
Not really .
To sum up must say that people enjoy life regerdless of thier age .
Thus what does make the difference is not the age , it is the individual personality and its look towards life , its achievments and the level of sucess and failure .
