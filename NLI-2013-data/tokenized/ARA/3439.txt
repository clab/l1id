Well , my openion about this subject is that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
And its not just about time that they dont have , its that they dont have the `` will '' , as they say `` if there is a `` will '' there is a `` must '''' .
Nowadays young people that are between 15-25 their minds are only settled on playing as a major idea , then studying as a second , and ofcourse beign a center of attraction in any king of subject .
In soccer for example , at our school student especially ages between 15 and 18 , they do their best just to achive there goal of eighther being the centre of attraction , or that he hates the other team or a player in the other team .

And some student like to be the `` The Fashion Boy '' , that he wears every new brand that has come down , eigther its nice or bad , `` ITS FASHION '' , also as old men the say `` tailors do not make men '' .

Well lets say 10 % of these young people alittle bit of time to help their communities by working hard and studying in order to achive a goal .

To put a goal in your life , in the future of your own , your your family , is the main idea of life .
Putting a goal in your life will lead you to the best , and whatever right you do , you will have confidence in your self , and what you do now will reflect the life of your family ( kids and wife ) , as my father always say : The more you do , the more you get .

Well ill talk about my self and goals in that limited life in just a few words , my goal im this life is to be the best architect in the world ( well thats what i say , atleast in town ) , And thats my last year in school , and im trying my best to get hight marks inorder to go to the university that i want , and have a nice and happy life .
