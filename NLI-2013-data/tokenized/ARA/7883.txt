In my opinion it is much better to travel in group led by a tourguide .
because the guide is knowlegble about the airea we visit , we save money and time , and we we get more information about the country we visit .

first , the guide is the best person who khnow the place we like to visit .
he knows the trafics and the geography of the region .
so there no chance that the visitor may get lost or go the wrong ways .
however , the guide could do better job than the map .

secondly , being led by a guide is a smart way to save money and time .
we can imagine how much money the person would spend if he needs several taxis and buses to get the region we want to see .
but traveling in group with a tour guide hepls to reduce the mailage because the tour guide may know the best ways to get the point we have the plan to see in a short time and short trafic .
in addition traveling in group would reduce the transportation charges .

thirdly , the tour guide is the best person who know about the history of his country .
in this way it more benifitial to get more information about the country we visit .
