I belive the young people enjoy life more than older people , because Young people always thinks that there are in the begining of there life and they have a long life in the future .
On the other hand we have the older people who thinks that there life will end soon .

Another reason that I think why young people enjoy life more than older people is that they do not have the experience of life , so everything they do is interstinting and new to them .
But for older people they went into a lot of situations and problems , so they gain a lot of experience and when thaey go threw it again , they will think it is boaring and old .

Young people are always active and looking for some new and enojoyable adventures .
Older people do not like to chanege there situations and want to keep the same old stuff .

Whenever the person is young and healthy he has more ability to enjoy what he is doing , and whenever he start getting old he start losing these abilities .
Young peole always look and search for thare fun , so they can enjoy there life before getting old .
When you ask an old person about his long life he will always mention the enjoyable times that he had when he was younger , and he will love to start doing it from the begining .
Young people are easier to have fun and enjoy life than older people .

At the end I belive that young people is easier to make them enjoy life than older peole
