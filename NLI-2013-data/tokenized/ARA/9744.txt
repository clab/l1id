in my oponion and my life experinces i agree with this satmant the people who is successful always try to do anew things that is not done befor and looking forward to found and descover new things , for example a professor in universty who is succesed in his reseach always try to find a new ideas for rearch and develpment , wher the researcher try do new experment he may affect him self for a kind of risk a becouse he do something new and investegate some thing that 's no one do befor .

successful person may investegate a new things that cause allow the secince to go on and reach a new level of technolgy and advaice all this can be done by the person who try to find some thing new and he do n't acre about the risks

on the other hand the tradional person who alwys do and repete the use the known methdo to do things will be never add anything to sicene and technology and they stel need other to learn the the new method to do thing

sueccful person should alwys try to find somthig new in and investegate and method to do thing becouse this enable the this person to do the same this in more than one way and this give him self confiedt , rather than the tradional person who just repet somthin known

at the end any socal need succeful people to take this soical forward not trantional people , but they must take kare when they do a new thing nd discover new method .
