Overall I would disagree with this statement , I believe that travelling on an independent basis is more rewarding even if it is more challenging .
I usually like to do my homework beforehand about places I want to visit and plan it myself to a certain extent .
I am very much interested in the history of places I am visiting as well as the local culture of the inhabitants , therefore I prefer a travel formula that maximises my interacion with these local residents .
This planning and interaction with people will enrich the trip many folds versus going with a group led by a tour guide where the information one would receive is prepared and digested and then presented to the traveller .
I have travelled to southern Spain many years ago , I had planned my trip to a certain extent only and I discovered many locations that were not pointed in tourist pamphlets , just by walking down the streets and talking to people .
This is what I call the surprise effect of trips , see the unexpected by going places not necessarily frequented heavily by tourists , this allows me to interact in a more personal way with local residents of areas I am visiting and have a better feel of the life of these people .

Travelling indepently gives me more control over my time , I can manage it the way that works better for me , I can stay longer in a place if I deem necessary , or I can just pack up and leave to `` greener pastures '' if I get bored in a particular location .

Also there is the financial aspect of it , I find it more cost effective to travel on your own than with a tour guide .
I can choose to settle in less expensive hotels and have my own agenda as far as meals are concerned during my trip .

Of course going on a loner basis may pose some challenges and maybe some risks in certain situations but overall it is a much more interesting and rewarding approach .
