At the beginning advertisments started with shoing what the product really has in it and that did not work with people who watching it .
So from my point of view I will say I agree with what the statement meaning and what it is pointing at .
So companies started to do advertisements with false information .
In my point of view the reason is or the reasons are that many products were invented and they have the same quality so people do not care about what the product has and what is it look like ?
because there are many of them with the same idea .
So advertisements started to be more cool than talking about the product and let 's talk about the sports cars for example .
They always show you in the advertisement that those two young people can hit on the most beautiful girl in college because they have the cooliest car in the entire university which is unusual to happen in schools around except some special times and another example of that is the coffee advertisements when they show smoe handsome boys with beautiful girls sitting togather in Starbucks or whatever it is , talking and laughing while drinking that specific kind of coffee or in that specific coffee shop and they look cool so people when they see them they feel really good of doing that thinking of doing this we 'll make them cool or whatever .
Anyway , advertisements are not suppose to be real .
It it all about showing the bad things as good enough to get sold from stores or used in shops and malls as much as it could .
And talking about this subject advertisements are costing a lot of money these days and it will be more and more expensive everytime the ad will be long and has along story and a new one but if some one asked me about being in this section my answer would be `` Yes '' .
