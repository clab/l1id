Traveling is a good way to change the routen in our life and also a good things to learn many cultures .
I traveled by many different ways .
Thus , as I like to travel and I have a lot of experince how to trivel .
I preiver that I travel in a group led by a tour guide because by this way I can get much benifet from the trip such as : visit the famous places , save time and enjoy in the trip .

First of all , the main purpose for visiting a new country or city that I want to see the famous places .
For exaple , Last year I visited paris .
I really like this trip because I visit the most important places in paris in short time .
Without the tour guide maybe I coud not visited them .
In addition , the tour guide explain every thing to me that I did not know such as the history of the Effel tour .

In addition to visit the famous place , travel with a group led by tour guide is a good way to schadule the trip .
In fact when the trip schaduled that is going to save enough time to visit more places .

Finally , to enjoy in your trip that need help from athor to find a nice hotel and a comfortable transportation .
This things only you can find them when you travel with a group led .
A tour guide prepares every things before you leave your home until you finish the trip .
Indeed , that is going to be a nice trip that you never forge in your life .

In conclusion , I like to make a good trip that I can visit many places , save time and money and enjoy when I travel .
In short , these things I can find when I travel with a group led by a tour guide
