In fact , i totalt 100 % agree with that statement .
while you are traviling with your friends , ithink that you must chose a leadar for that trip for many sevril resons : -
1 - the trip will be orginized .
2 - there will be much more fun .
3 - there will be no fighting to where to go to .
these are some of so many resons .

however , i think that the leader should be fun and seriose at the same time , becuse that helps to see many places in the new town or city that the group is visiting .

Last but not least , i sujest to all the people whome want to visit a new country or a new trip , that they should chose a leader to help the trip to went very well , and that is my opinion .
