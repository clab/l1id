iam absoultely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do and iam sure that this is true because i find my self happier when i was younger than this moment for the following factors .

firs of all , when i was young i never thought about the toughness of the future and what i should and i should not do .
for example when i was younger i was like to play with lego but now my look from the people eyes will be so different than past that they would criticise me and maybe they would insult me by doing that .

moreover , it was less responsibility that my goal was only paying and playing but now i have to think about my foot steps and the result of my step .
forexample , i have to decide which university i will enroll and which feild i have to go and how to make a privilaged life with great fortune .

what is more , i can see the world by simple eyes when i was young .
forexample when i see the enemy and the invasion in my country or neighbored country i say that i can solve the problem and be like superman but this time i afraid to either think about that thing .

the range of entairtanment when i was young more than now .
forexample i was visiting my friend and watch tv and playing electronic games like playstation but now i tell my self i must not to waste my time by these silly things and think about such as the project that my teacher wants from me .

to sum up my essay i think that the statement is difinetly true that young people will enjoy life more than older people do but i have to admit that being mature and man who is dependable has agreat constructive points in my life such as getting the freedom .
