I totally agree with this aspect , maybe it could be Unfair for companies that provide consumers with high quality products .
but if most of these plants are seeking high prophit making then sometimes they wo n't be aware that their marketing policies are un - efficient .
or un rational .

It does n't make sense whan we blame the companies marketing policies perse ' specially in a wide market crowded with competing companies and firms marketing the same product .
therefor , ureasonable means for marketing a poducts will start to emerge and some times does'nt work for the adnantage of the company .
wich will derive a company to spend a fortune on an advertisement just to convince the consumer to buy the project .

What is common among advertisement that some of prior comanies adopted the Idea of using a celebrety as face for markiting a project .
through the media and the advancement in proadcasting ticnology this type of advertisement tend to amazingly succeed and cover up the prducts faliur or to gain more prophit
