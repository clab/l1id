i agree that it is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts for many reasons .

first , when they are understanding what they told , it is easy for them to keep it in thier mind and to memorised it .

secondlly , they can compare and contrast between things easily .

also , they can pass what ever they have learnd to others easily .

morover , they can create some new things with practice with time .

when they understand what they learnd it can help them to pass the next years of studdy without serious problems and diffeculties .

in summary , it is a major thing to a student to understand ideas and concepts discussed at classes to his/her own bebefit and to get higher grades .
and to succses at thier work fields .
