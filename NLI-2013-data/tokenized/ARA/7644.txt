I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Being in a group and visiting a new city that I do n't know much about with a tour guide will assure me that I will not leave this city that I am visiting for the first time without missing out on any of the important features .
For example , all the historical areas in the place , landmarks , important musiums , and famous art galleries or even nice restaurants .
The tour guide will also be very informative and educating .
They will be able to tell us about the history of each piece of art work that is found in a the famous art galleries and answer any question that might rise in my head or that I am curious about wich will make the trip more beneficial .

Additionally , Being led by a tour guide will help me in managing my time since all tour guides willl have a set or a planned schedule from the begining of the trip and until the last day in order for the visitors to get the most of their trip .
Along with that , the feeling of being part of a group will eliminate lazyness from some individuals as they will feel obligated to attend the tour everyday .
Another benefit to having a tour guide is minimizing the chance of getting lost espicially if it 's a new city that I am not familiar with .
I have heard about many stories of people getting lost in new cities that they are visiting for the first time while trying to get back to their hotels .

Lastly , being with a tour guide will help me save financially since I will have a designated bus with a driver that will aid me in traveling for one site to another without having to worry about the cost of renting taxies for every trip .
