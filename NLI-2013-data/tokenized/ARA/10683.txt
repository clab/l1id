some people try new things and take risks , and the others would rather only doing what they already know how to do , in fact there a lot of people who like adventure because they will get the benefit behaind it , while the others prefer to fallow the rotain ant doing what are they used to do , however , in my own opinion I beleive that successful people who try new things and facing the risk because of several reasons ;

First : no one could ever find him or her self without trying new things which is would be helpful to figure out what what are they intrested in , and if they have a talent or not , in fact every one should know what the thing that he or she be successful in it ,

second : there is no doubt that people suppose to learn for their mistakes in this life .
therefore they should try a lot of things as long as they reach their goals , and no matter how many trouble that we confronted , because the point is how much did we learn from our mistakes .

theard : being brave and try new things would support people confident and self steem , conequently , they would oncrees thair oportunity for being success .
beside that they would beleive in what are they as long as they trust them selves .

finally : facing the risk and adventure is the only way to find your self , indeed , without no one could ever know that his or her prefrence in this life , it wouls create a lot of opurtunity for people and wouldhelpful .
