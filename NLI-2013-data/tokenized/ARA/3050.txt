Everyone in this life wants to live more so I think that we should enjoy our time in living our life .
So I agree that young people enjoy their life than older people .

We know that when we are young we enjoy our time in playing , studing and doing alot of thinges we cannot doing now .
There are several reasons of that , one reason that , when we were child we had the freedom in doing any things we need , also we had the power to live happy and interesting lifestyle , we could be lated for along hours .

Moreover , we had the health and the willing to reach to what we need , we could go for playing , singing with our friends , but when we come older we connot do this things because we have the new responsibility in our life such as , our children and the care which they need to become like thier parents .

also , our power in enjoying our time became weak and we connot have the ability in working and enjoying , so we should let our children to have this intertainment and let them live their life , because when we are in their age we did alot of thinges which reminds me now .
So you should live your life by having some of exicting and enjoyment .

All in all , we cannot stop the time , and we should convince in our distiny and fait , we must imagine our selves as we can try to give our age his right in having the rest in the end of our life , and this will not prevent us to try to complete our lives in thinking about the history which we had lived from the young .
