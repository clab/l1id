Successful people do not have to be the ones who `` try new things and take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well '' .
People can convey other characteristics to be successful .

A successful person can be a person who is specialized in only one field .
Some fields are so deep and if a person spends a lot of time on that particular field can be an expert in it and masters it better than anybody else .
Bill Gates is a great example .
He specialized in computer programming and has made Microsoft the greatest and largest company in the world .
As Microsoft being his only concentration he was able to expand it and as a result he has become successful in that field .

Studying and learning about new things rather than trying them could be a good idea for a successful person .
It is true that a person should try things for better experience , but sometimes trying can be dangerous without thorough studying of the topic .
For example , trying to make an explosion which then explodes before expecting it to do so will definitely not make the person successful after his/her death in that accident .
Therefore , risks in such a case would not be a good idea to success .

Good communication skills along with good knowledge background and ability to choose correct desicions can help in the success of a person .
A successful person should be able to convey the message correctly , persuade .
Otherwise , if the person is not able to communicate with the world and cannot get his/her ideas to the world , no one would be able to know about any them .
They would pass by unnoticed .

Successful people do not have to be the ones who take risks .
It is not a necessity to being successful , however , it might be needed in some situations .
