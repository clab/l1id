This statement is true and false at the same time .
First of all , young people are interested in their own life and how to make it better for them .
For instance , a high school graduate will focus on attending college and afterwards taking a job and make a family .
He wo n't care about a social problems in his society and will say : `` I must focus on my own life .
I do n't have time for these things '' .

Second , In most of young people , they tend to have fun instead of working very hard .
To illustrate , A high-school student who get a summer holiday will think primarily about how to make it enjoyable .
He thinks about travelling abroad or going to beach .
He wo n't usually think about giving some of his allowance to a charity organization .

But , However , it does n't apply for each individual person or community .
Nowadays , a lot of youths support charity organization .
For example , In Saudi Arabia , a lot of youths support the charity organizations with money .
Thus , satisfying the demands of poor families in Saudi Arabia .
Another example is , in Ramadan ( The season of fasting for Saudis ) , there are a lot of youths providing dates and water to the drivers in the traffic signs in order to break their fast .

In conclusion , generally speaking , this statement is true although it cannot be applied on each individual young person .
