When people plane travel some of them prefer to travel in agroup lrd by a tout guide , while some of them prefer to travel idividually .
In my opinion the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide .

First when you travel in a group led by a tour guide , you will not take the risk and the tour guide will help in lot of things .
of course the tour guide will be an expert person knowing his or her job very well .
So there will clear day by day program .
The tour guide will know the area , which to be visited , very well .
He or she know where the histrical places in the area , the parks , the resturants , and all the important places around the area .
Even the tour guide know where are the goverment offices and hospital in case of any emergency .
All this will let the traveler to relax and enjoy his time and not to concentrate on the details of the trip and avoid the hassle .

Second when you travel in a group led by a tour guide it will be golden opportunity to know different people from different places and this may led to make friendship and as there is tour guide there is more time for this kind of relationship .
Even these frindship can continue after the trip through the e.mails and the phones conversations .
These kind of trip some times cuold be a chance for some people to find their life partner .

Last by travelling in a group always you will find some people with you durring the bad times and durring the good times and it will be a chance to help people as been help by other peop

Upon all the above poins travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel in my opinon
