Some people tend to say and believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites .

In my personnal point of view , it is a false statement , because nowadays we see more and more young envolved in the public concerns , and many new associations established by and for youngs created .

and I have a personnal experience as a young women working with several associations that are mainly composed by youngs , and we try to do social work by helping poor children in their studies , by tuitoring them , collecting funds to buy schoolbags , books , copybooks for them , we have even convinced a rich club ` ROTARY Club ' to sponsorise a whole day in the swimming pool for 200 kids .

and I know many other associations doing really great work especially by youth , not only in my country but all over the world .

In another hand they may be some youngs who are not interested in helping their communities , and who just foccus on entertaining them selve , but it does not mean that it is a generalized situation , and I think that it has been the case in all the eras : they have always been aware young who face the problem their communities are having and who try to solve them , and other youngs who just do not care .

Finally , I think that what leaded to this misunderstanding , is the gap that appear between the generations , because every previous generation tend to idealise its youth and is not satisfied with the new generation behavior , just because it is not on their way , while the adults should understand that time changes and so mentalities , and they should try to help youngs to find out how to help their communities by their own way , not the way they want them to act .
