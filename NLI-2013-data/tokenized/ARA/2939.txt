Life is a gift from god and one has to enjoy it .
However , life enjoyment differs from one to another depending on budgets .
Besides it differs from young and old peolpe .
In this essay , I am going to show that young people enjoy life more than old ones because of health and age diffrences .

Young peple enjoy life more than older people , since yong peple are more healthier than old ones .
As a matter of fact , young people are vivid ; that is to say , they are full of life ; they , indeed , can travel long distances enjoying the beauty of the land scape without any complaint .
Nevertheless , old people cannot travel such distances they easily get tired .
Adding to that , young people can do other activities , such as going to the disco , swimming or hiking .
Olders , on the contrary , prefer sleeping or taking a nap rather than amusing themselves .

Old people do not enjoy their life like young people because of age .
Some old people think that during their youghts they enjoyed their time and believes that the remaining of their life should be devoted to their children .
Therefore , their main concern is to see their children 's improvement from childhood to adulthood .
Thus , old people think that their role is to serve their children at the expense of their enjoyment .

In summary , I think that old people , specially parents are great , as they devote their time for their childern rather thanenjoying their time like young people .
