Every year , companies around the globe spend millions of dollars advertising their products to the general public .
Advertisments can be found everywhere from banners on the street to interuptions of your favorite soap operas .

When advertising their products , companies tend to advertise their products through the use of celebrities and models sporting their products .
Everything is played out in a best case scenario .
In reality , none of the advertised products live up to their expectations .

For example , a shampoo commercial for Herbal Essences would show a beautiful girl with a great smile and naturally straight hair .
The public fails to see that the company is using `` sex '' to advertise their commercial .
In other scenarios , a Coca Cola commercial on TV would show a man and his best friends drinking the cold beverage and having a great time .
This misleads many customers to thinking that Coca Cola brings people together allowing them to have a great time that will put permanent smiles on their faces .

Imagine a world where commercials would advertise everything as it really was .
Not surprisingly , companies would go bankrupt .
Looking at the situation from an individual 's point of view that swims , none of the shampoo commercials ever live up to their expectation .
Frizzled hair and split ends are a permanent physical feature .

Crest extra whitening toothpaste is advertised by people with beautiful smiles and recently whitened teeth , right out of the dentist 's office .
No toothpaste has ever given the general public smiles as white as the ones seen on advertisments .

Recently , a Ford commercial has been showing on TV where a couple had just bought a new F-150 and because of its immense size , they mentioned that their bachelor party would be celebrated in that car .
Many companies reach out to their customers through humor , but that never thoroughly describes the true features of their product .

All in all , commercials are misleading and if everything was as perfect as it proved to be on TV , then everyone would be living a perfect world .
There is always a catch to everything .
