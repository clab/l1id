I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , because one subject is n't enough information .
With all the broad knowledge of many academic subjects we are studying , it 's been experimented that we only use 1 % of our brain .

We should know about everything going on around us , if we specialize on one specific subject it will affect our future , the technologies , and we 'd be missing on alot .
God gave as a brain for a reason .

For example if you choose to concentrate on Physics , you ca n't study phyics without taking Algebra .
You could study many academic subjects but concentrate on ur favorite subject more , this way you wont be missing on anything .

Imagine a world with no doctors , engineers or business .
Disease 's would spread because their wont be any cures for them .
People would live in the streets , and there wo n't be any street except a sandy dirty place .
People would fight over anything they find because it does n't belong to anyone , and there 's no grocery store or any shops .
Therefore alot of people will commite suicide , because there wont be anything to do .

Studying many academic subjects is n't alot , you have 12 years of studying in school that is more than enough .
Then you graduate and go to University , you will still study there but less hours .
You would be majored in any of you 're favoured topics and the rest would only help finishing you 're credits and wasting time so you would n't get bored .

Me myself I 'm a very lazy person and I would preffer if we do n't study academic subjects , but if you think about it for a few seconds and imagine how you 're life would be you will imaditely change you mind , because there wo n't be anything to complain on and life would be useless .
