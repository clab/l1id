Everyone in this world can enjoy his life in his own ways .
people are different in expressing thier enjoying of life .
How we can ejoy this life and be happy ?
Everyone knows that life is not easy and it needs lots of work to be successful person in it .
There are two groups of people who can enjoy this life such as , The young people and the older pepole .

First , yong peple can ejoy life in different ways .
For example , they can do many things in this life without any responsibility for what they are doing because they know that the resposibility are carried for thier parents .
Also , they can do a lot of things that the older people ca n't do as a result of health .
Young people can do a lot of activities on one day , but the older peolpe ca n't do that .
So the young people are the right people to enjoy this life .

Secound , older poeple can , t enjoy this life like the young people .
There are different reasons for that .
The firt reason , is that the are responsible for eveything they do .
Also , the reason of health ca n't help them to do a lot of activities on one day .
The logic provides these points in a very clear way .
Old people had already taken their time to enjoy this life when they were young .
So they have to give the chance for the other generation to enjoy his own life .

Finally , in my opinion , i agree that young people are the right peolpe to enjoy tis life .
That is because the older people had already taken thier own chance .
Also , i disagree that the older peolple must relax after they have finished thier work in the whole life because they are the people who must have other works .
Such as , teaching thier children the right tings to do and to have the resposibiltiy of what thier young children do .

In conclusion , this life is for all the peolpe to enjoy , but the right people or the people who have the chance to enjoy it more are the young people .
We must all enjoy this life in the duration of time when we are young .
