Evry one of us dreams of enjoying his life during all his living period untill his last day .
But I personaly think that young people enjoy life more tha old people .

Fisrt young people have less responsiblities toward the familiy , so they have much more liberty to do what they want and to go wherever they perefer .
They could enjoy their life by traveling or taking risk in some adventure , doing dangerous things or crazy things , while old people have their families and their responsibilities to take into account .

Young people also could go to some entertainment places with their mates such us pubs and diskotecs where there is so much noise that the old people could n't bear .
There is also some nice places that are open exclusively for young people , old people are note permited to enter them .

An other point to be mentioned it is the health issue , young people are generaly healthiest that old people , and this make them able to enjoy many things in life for example , lasting at night , playing some amazing sports like cars speed or jumping in mountains .
They could also afford working hard and having an extra Job to gain more money that help them to entertain them selves .
They could also travel to any place without reservation because they are in good health so they could bear long trips , they do n't fear that the whether would be hot or cold , they could bear it anyway because they are still young and they have strong health .

So I think young people enjoy life more than old people .
