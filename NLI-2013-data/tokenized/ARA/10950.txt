Discovery does'nt come from following instructions , it comes from going beyond those instructions and taking risks .
For people to be successful they shoud take risks and reach a new point that no one had ever reached .
Taking risks needs strength and confidence , otherwise the goal will not be reached .
The first reason why being successful needs trying new things is that it will open him to new chances and discoveries in life .
