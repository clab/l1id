I agree the best way to travel is in a group led by atour guide for many reason .
First , tavel with atour guide can save your time .
So , you can know the whole the place you visit such as city or island or any general place with short time , because you have a tour guide can answer your question any time .
Second reason , atour guide has a good expert for what you should to visit or what you should not or not intrestting for you .
Another resone , travel with groub can make the trip more fun and more usefule .
Every one can meet with a new man or woman .
so that can be helpful to know detals about him or her .
sometimes , we know a new culter when we travel in agroub .
I think travel with groub is the best way to make the trip more fun .
