Knowledge is the base of what we have .
It is the thing that remain with us all over the years .
Knowledge is what make a person special from others .
Some people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadimic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
This broad knowledge can help you anytime and you will not have to depend on others in every single thing out of your specialize subject and it will make you a well-known person who has an experience in everything you want to learn about .

Others think that being specialize in one specific subject is better than have board knowledge because it can help to be better in your subject .
It allow you to be the best and the person who can depend on in that subject .

I agree with people who think it is better to have broad knowledge and I prefer to have it rather than a person with a limit knowledge .
For examble , when two persons go to a company and ask for a job one with a board knowledge and the other whith a limit knowledge I think they will choose the first person because he can be more helpfull .
I am a person who believe in benig special in all the subject you love so I will agree with the first arguement for sure .
