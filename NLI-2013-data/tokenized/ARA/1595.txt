Thats a really really good subject , but acctully i have to say that i agree with specializing in one thing , Beacuse if some one did then when he well give 100 % to making his catagory the best and making his job the best .
Like if we had a cardiac doctor if you asked him he well tell you that he is trying to be the best and to invent a new methods to fix the heart .
so , At the end of the road if he was ambesiuos he can do it .
all am saying that its better to specialize in on subject .
one , its better to improve that subject .
two , it well be better for him not to be puzzled .
and three , it well make him the best in that subject .
however , i think the its good to have a broad knowledge but while foucsing on one major .
like some one is an engeneering but at the same time he can creat other bussnis away from his major , like he could work at the stocks or open a store to sell any thing .
but , there is some thing verey importanat .
that this other work well not effect his major work beacuse in this way he will be a loser in both subjects .
anyway my point is that both of them is good .
but , for some people that is good for others the other one is better .
and as the old sayin `` defers in opinun will not destroy the case '' .but i said mine and thank you for this verey good subject and thatsall i have to say .
