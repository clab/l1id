Most people are used to do many acts and things every day without looking at these things , and some time people may enforce to do many things that are unfamiliar for them .
some people feel that it is a good idea to do new things in order to add experiences for their lives .
On the other hand , others think that thay do n't have a lot of time to practice a new things .
However , there are stronger reasons to support the fact that it is important beatiful themes to learn about you do n't know .

New things learn us a lot lessons and experiences to face many problems in future .
Education system 's many lessons are organized to learn us how to deal with many facts around us .
Such as self-control , self-motivation , enthusiasm , and many skills like that are detected and learned by doing new things , thus exposing us to varieties of situations build for us these skills .

Most successful people around world having in common some characters and interests , but the most feature liked among them is that they always put themselfes in difficuly situations in order to attain their goals .
For example , I took the toefl exam and I got a bad Score in it .
If I re-gain taking it and study on the same materials withe same mannar , I will get the same score .

The problem is that many opponents of practicing new things are themselves unware of advantages of looking for a new expertise .
Moreover , they onely focus on the theory that I used the same thing in order to at save sides , What they fail to say , is that I they did the same thing several times , you will got the same result .

In conclusion , many people are afraid of experiencing a new behavior for several reasons .
But I support the fact that we have to incourge people to make a different in Word 's life .
