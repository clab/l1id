Advertisements
Advertisements are very important field .
I agree with the statement said that most advertisements make product seem much better than really are for alot of reasons like the advertisement is commercial aspect , second reason because of money & lastly they want to widespread the product that they advertised .

The advertisements is a commercial aspect they want more persons to buy their product inspite of the quality of this product if it is good or not so sometimes u see the advertisment in Television or read it in newspaper u feels it is so good but when u buy it it appear that it has n't the same quality that u read or see it .

morover the company wants to earn as much money as possible from their product so they advertise it and put alot of budget for it 's advertisement because they know that if the advertisement contains more pictures , colors so the people will buy it more .

finally when we used the advertisements we expected to spread of it to wide range areas so that all over the country will see it & hear about it so the product in the advertisement appear better than it 's originally was .

but not all the advertisement make product appear better than they really are some of the advertisements are true about their product & their product are really as one day I see an advertisement in television about one type of shampoo i think that it is not really good but when i bought it and use it i found it much better than the advertisement mention .

In conclusion I think that now adays that the product of advertisement is much better than it is really are not only because the advertisments recently become commercial aspect but also because of the money & they want to spread their product but there is some exception because there is some products appear to be the same as in the advertisements wirhout exagurated .
