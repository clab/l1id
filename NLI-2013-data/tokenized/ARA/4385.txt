Most of young peoples nowadays , for some reasons like selfesh manner and the entertainment which is available 24 hours , dont really give enough time in order to help their communities .

First , with the availability of the T.V. twenty four hours a day it might be uncommon that a boy or a girl may think of helping his or her community .
T.V. programs , either good or bad ones , attract young peoples , regardless of the movies , which takes the first place of attracting the youngs in most countries .
This attraction may cause a little careless in theirselves toward their community .

Further more , the attitude plays a huge part in this particular situation .
It depends actually on the parents who should plant the love toward the society inside a boy 's heart ; for example , when you teach a child from his childhood how to love his country , it will be obvios that he will grow up up with a quantity of love will be indirectly translated into a care toward his country when he grow up , which means giving some time to fix some mistakes and help some people .

In addition , the socity could lead a person to work and help his country and community and may not ; for example , if a person lives in a generous , freindly , and ready to work together society , he would propably become helpful to his society sooner or later .
The contrast is true , when the people in a particular society do n't care about each other then we should'n expect a guy show up and say he want to help .

In conclusion with the avilablity of the entertainments any time at any place , movies which increases every day and the attitude of the person himself , the time for helping the community becomes rare .
all these abstracted issues have directly or indirectly leads the young boys far a way from helping and lood after thier community , which is a petty .
