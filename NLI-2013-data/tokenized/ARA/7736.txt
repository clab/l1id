i totally agree with the statement espically these dayes in denguras places .
we have a proverb which says '' travel with a guide better than travel with your wife '' . a guide knows where he is going and he knows every thing bad and good in the city .
that is his job .
if you go to affrica or some countries you need to be with a group and a ture guide because they have alot of cultures .
this person will take you to places you will nevrer go to it by your self or even by a person who lived at the same area because the guide knows how can schedual your time and how can mak the trip to be perfest .
i can give you example happend to me i went to china with my father for a bussniss and he knows some chines tooke us in a trip .
it was wonderful .
i went there again but this time i went alone in 2005 .
i tooke a guide to show me the rigon it was different because i went with a profitional guy .
the other reson ther is alot of cauntries do not speak your language or english too as yamen and alot of area from africa .
it is hard to talke with them and you can not connect with them to know some information .
that happened to me in china the firest time when i went with my father the guy who was with us .
he can bearly speak english so i did not get alot information from him but when i went with the profitional guy i knew alot about history and cultuer of china .
finally i want to say if you travel , you shoud take a guide and to be with a group to share you information togather and make frinds from different countries .
in conclosion , groups or guides will help you to know alot about the country .
