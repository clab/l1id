I agree with this statement , because mainly facts that are learned without understanding disappear from memory much faster than understood ideas do .
Also if a student understands an idea he or she can always relate other things to that same idea that was previously understood , whereas learning a fact without understanding limits thinking skills .

learning facts in my opinion may have a lot of negative effects on students , because on an exam a student will not be able to recall what was memorized unless the information was understood .
When students memorize facts they are not stimulating the logic part of their brain .
Not stimulating half of the brain will have a negative effect on the student .

If a student is taking a biology course .
in biology , students must memorize a large amount of words , and from experience it is just easier if the student is able to split the word into it 's combining forms , with an understanding of the meaning of each combining form .
This way the student knows what each part of the word means , and is then able to remember the word , because the meaning of the word now makes sense .

I strongly believe that althought it is much more important to understant ideas , rather than just learning facts , it is still very important that the ideas a student understands are also memorized , or encoded into the memory , for him or her to be able to recall the ideas when needed .
in some cases things can not be understood , say for example if a student wants to remember the room where his or her test will be taking place ; in this case the student must learn the room number with out understanding it .
