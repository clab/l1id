Cars have made such a difference in our lives .
they have made transportation easy and doing the rritual things like visiting out parents or a family member easy , going to the doctor now is easier then it was in the olden days .

i dont belive that there will be less cars in the next twenty years , if anything there will be a surplus of cars maybe the tchnology will effect the cars but there will be an increase in the usage of cars .

Cars might be in a different structure to keep up with the technology and might have new gadgets but the illimination of cars it quit hard for the past century god bless henry fords heart we have depened on cars and as long as i have been alive cars was the only mean of daily transpotration and to me the safest transportation .

Also another point i would like to make is that when a generation more like a century gets used to using cars it would be quite difficult in illiminating this source of pleasure and vital everydays use .

A car is what brought me to this test center to give the TOFEL exam and without it i couldnt imagin any other sourse of transportation that i would be able to use on a daily basis .

Generally speaking transportation is extremlly vital and we can not live without it .
cars will be around for a long time until we invent a new way of trnasportaion and may i add safer way for example zooming us through laser or zapping us the to the exact position we would ti be found in .
and i belive that it will be a while befor we rach such a stage in technology .
CARS ARE VITAL AND WILL BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME
