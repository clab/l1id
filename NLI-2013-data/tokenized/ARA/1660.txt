Academic education is based on specific subjects that one can choose in order to persue their studies in something that interests them .
During one 's years in school , some subjects are recommanded - or i may say imposed .
Sometimes one find oneself studying for a subject that does not interest one at all .
and so one makes sure not to take such a course in college .

every student wants to go to college in order to be `` free '' and to do the subjects that they enjoy the most .
it is usually something that they are pationate of .
well at least it should be , concidering they will make a career out of it .
i doubt that anyone would study for something that they find boring .

however , having a good knowledge is necessary. a knowledgeable person is someone who is smart and open to any information he/she can get .
it is of course someone curious .
for that matter , i can agree to this statement .
having a good culture can open a lot doors to success .

it is also a good mean to be satisfied with one 's consciens .
this may be a very philosifical matter but it can be concidered .
for instance , a housewife , who has 4 children-of different ages - is the source of answers for her children .
whenever one of them have a question - it can be for anything from school to social life - they will come to their mother .
for them the mother is the source of reason .
but what if the mother was illeterate or has very little knowledge , who will they go to for advise ?
who is the person that they can trust to tell tehm the whole truth ?
in that case , the answer is no one .

so , in my opinion , i think that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject if it comes to cultural knowledge - for example the housewives-but if it comes to a 18-year-old who is enterring college to prepare his future , i think that a specific subject is better because then he/she would be concentrating on thing that they will make in the right way unlike those who ruchs into things and end up not finishing them .
like they always say : it 's the quality not the quatity '' .
