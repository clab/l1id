There are many ways to learn and to exapand students minds today .
Whether it is teaching them facts or taking the time to make them understand the ideas and concepts .

Firstly , in the case of teaching students the facts , for the students and the teachers themselves it is quite a boring task .
There would be no interaction and communication between the teacher and their students .
Students will become less interested and may not participate in class , choose not to attend or decide to misbehave , making the teaher 's job much , much more difficult raising the pressure and stress of the teacher to make sure that the students walk out of the class room knowning the facts .

On the other hand , teaching the students to understand the idea and concepts make the students more confident and confortable in the future when they come to study the certain subject or to take an exam on the topic .
Moreover , it makes the subject more enjoyable to learn as the teacher and the studnts exchange ideas and thoughts to unravel the concepts of the topic .
In addition , it also helps the teacher to become closer to his or hers students , to get to know them , understand their way of thinking , to understand themselves where the students weak points lye , and how in the future help their students to improve in their acadamics .

Overall , in my opinion , i believe that students should have the best of both arguments , the facts and the understanding of ideas , for the following reasons ; Using the facts make sure that we have accurate information , to use whether its in an essay or in aswering questions in an exam or simply in a disscussion .
Side along with that , i believe having talks and debates on topics help the student to feel for the subject more and more and make them feel more involved .
A very good example , is in a history class , where the proffessor talks about a certain piece of history like World War Two .
You must have accurate data such as times and dates and chronological orders of events .
Aswell as disscussing the thoughts and emotions of the leaders of the war and the people of the countries that were involved in the war at the time .
Another example is in english litrature , that i personally take myself .
One of William Shakesphere 's play Macbeth , there is plenty of space to debate and discuss , such as his concience throughout the play as he kills the king .
If i could not share any of my opinions or thoughts i would feel so bored and not as emphusiastic as i am about the play now .

Finally , i go back once more , i believe that knowning the facts is much important as understanding them aswell .
