The importance of understanding concepts

Learning facts is an important part in an educational system , but what counts most is understanding the concepts and ideas .

First , if a student gets to understand how a certain system works , he would be able to understand the effect it has and be able to assimilate the informatioon faster .
If he memorized it as a fact without understanding the concept , he is probably going to forget it the next day .
I take myself as an example , I am a pharamacy student , and in my field there are lots of facts , as example , a drug leads to a certain effecs , but understanding the mecanism by which this drug works in the body and why it leads to this specific effect makes it easier for me to learn it and later use it .

Another point in favor of understanding concepts is that by doing so , the student will be able to develop his logical and analytical thinking which wil allow him later to applicate what he learned in another field or problem .
For instance , understanding why the earth gravite around the sun is more important than the fact itself , because understanding this concept enables the student to apply it to the whole astronomy field including the understanding of eclipse and seasons changes .

Finally , when learning facts , students tend to accumulate information and stick to them , whereas trying to understand an idea leads them to do their own research on the subject , to have their own judgment and approach .
They tend to broaden their mind and increase their curiosity .

I think that learning facts is important depending on the field of study because there are things that ca n't be explained or are beyond students understanding , but what is the most important is to understand the concepts whenever it 's possible because by doing so , a student manage to develop his way of thinking and to apply the concept to another field .
