Nowadays , it is common that young people are always away from , responsibility , self management , self motivation and beeing a caretaker .
some people believe that it is a phase for them and after it they will recognize what is the right thing .
i believe that young people are not helping to thier communities because of many reasons .

First , they are not well grown up by their families , it is the perents problem , there was no touch between perents and their childeren , in another word we can say careless problem .
the previous situatuation will deffinetly lead to unsatisfied person who will not care of any thing other than him self .

Second , bad friends , it is serious problem , and i experienced this situation , believe me it is a natural thing that young people are always want to know , try and see new things .
it is the nature of the humen , but this intrest need to be directed in the right way but unfortunetlly the same can be directed by some people whom not civilized .

Third , The free time , fullfilling the time with useful and benificial things like Sports , Studying and working job are important to young people , it builds their feeling of responsibility , enhanse their feeling of ownership and improve their personality .

In conclusion , if the young people are well raised up , good friend selected for them and spending free in useful and productive works , i'am sure that they will be really helpful to their community , but so far every body see that the above are not happenning .
