Enjoing life

` `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''
In my openion i think it 's not true that young people enjoy life more than older people .
Happiness does n't come by age it comes by satesfaction

You may find a young man who can do every thing he wants but at the end he is not happy .
Or you may also find a young man who he is not happy because he does n't have the aportunity to get maried and to creat a familly .
Enjoing life is not about doing things that will make you feel younger .
You may find an old person who he enjoys eech second he spends in this world by seeing his grandchildren .
It depend through the persons intrest .
For example my father is an old man who have grandchildren but he is enjoing his life by spending time with his family and taking care of his house .
His happiness when he sees his children and espescialy me because i am the youngest getting high grades in school .
This is what happiness mean .
