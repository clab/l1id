Some people says that the world will change in the closing future , in diffrent ways , and for many diffrent reasons .
Poeple will behave in a diffrent way , and 80 % they will need morethings that that the poeple need now , becuase life changes and needs changes with life too .

An imporant issue to talk about is the increasig or discreasing of cars in the future .
People in the past times used the animals as a way of transport , to travel from place to a plcae , like camels , horses , and donkeys .
Later on : they used vehicles to set in and move they legs while they are setting .
the last discovery was the cars which are in our time , which made a thoery in transportion of technology .

Nowadays people use cars always to go for thier jobs , or to go for thier collage , to travel and to deilever things .
Also poeple now are increasing that 's mean that people need more cars to do thier every day jobs .
The father want to get for his job early , the childrens needs a car or a bus to get to thier school at the time , the mother want to stuff for her house .
All this everyday jobs needs cars as a way of tranportion .

Although some people does n't like to use cars , because cars are the main reason for the pollution in the world , becuase of the smoke that the car get rid of and makes the air dirty , which make it diffculy for us to breath , and which made alot of poeple cause from dangrous diseases .
In many studies scientests discover that most of the poeple who had cancer , they had it because of the pollution in the air .
As a result they are looking for a way to make cars gewer in the future , and use healthy ways to transport .

I disagree that the cars will be fewer in twenty years .
In my point of view ; the cars amount will increase the double in twenty years , becuase people will increase and they need cars for they everyday jobs .
