The issue at hand is whether understanding ideas and concepts is important for students rather than learning facts .
This is an important issue because the essense of education is not `` whats '' only but also `` how '' .
In my opinion , I believe that students need to understand how things happen rather than only learning facts about these things .
This is because of different things .

First of all , some students are not satisfied about just learning and memorizing .
Thus when the professor explains how certain things happened , the information will be stuck in the students head and they will have no future problems for memrizing some facts .
for instance , when it comes to engines , it is not likely to know only what engines are but how they work .
this will help in fixing both the results and the facts in the student 's mind .

Moreover , when it comes to real life , students will eventually start practicing what they learned in academy .
Some students will maybe forget some facts but just when they remeber how the professor explained this subject or how it works they will be able to work accurately in their real life .
Thus , understanding ideas helps the students to accuretly apply what they learned .

Furthermore , some facts could n't be learned unless understandable .
This is the fact of many physical theories .
For instance , professors can spend a lot of time explaining what current is .
But students need not know facts about currents but they need to know how it works to know where its field of application is .

As a result , it is important for students to understand ideas rather than learning facts .
This is because this will help them in their academic , future career and the fields of application
