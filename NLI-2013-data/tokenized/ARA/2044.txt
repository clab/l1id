To answer this quastion lets foces in each one of them and then see wether the young people enjoy life more than older people do or not .

The young kids should play and have fun .
basicly because they should leave their age .
as the sceince aprove that childrens games improve their experince in life and activate their brains in a very importent way .
in the same time , childrens have no responsebalties to worry about , so they have alot of free time .
let 's not forget that their bodies are young and they are full with eneragy in a way that make it hard for them to get tierd .
also , most of the childrens have no medical problems .
in another word they are healthy .

in contrast the older people have no time for that .
in nowaday the normal adult person have an avrage of two jobs , because of the economical issue .
so working for an avrage of 60 hours in a week will give the person no time for any kind of fun or even time to rest .
in another word , adult people have a lot of responsebalties .
another exaple of what make an adult person life busy is social networking .
every one have people he know and he should maintain his networking .
another responsebalty witch will make him busy is the relationship or family .

so as i present at essay , the young people are having more fun basicly because that their age style look like .
