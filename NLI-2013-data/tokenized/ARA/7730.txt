Traveling around the world and discovering new places you never seen before is the most pleasure thing to do for a lot of people .

For me when i decied to travel i will prefer to plugging in with a group which led by an experince tour guide rather than traviling alone for many resones .

First , when you visit a new place definitly you do not know what the famoues places to go and visit .
So , the tour guide will provide you with a varioues places and recommand you with the best of them .
For example , last year i traveled with my husband to California and we did not join a tour group led by a guide , we waste our time just for searching for places to go .
While other visiters save thier time by joining a tour group with a tour guide and visit many places than we did .

Second , joining a tour group will give you the chance to know information telling by the tour guide that you did not know them before about the places you visiting them .
For example , last month my parents went to Eygipt and they decided to join a tour group and when they came back from their journy they told us a lot of information that we did not know about the pyramids .
All these information were told to them by the tour guide .

Third , a tour guide save your time and make it more enjoyable by taking you to the most famoues places and the most intersting one too .
By this you do not have to go to every places and look for the intersting one .
For example , when i went to London for the first time with my sister we went to every where just to find a good place to enjoy our time there and when we found the nice one we were exotic and we could not really enjoy our time then but if we were with a tour guide this will never happen .

So , for the three reasons i disscussed above i will never travel without a group led by a tour guide .
And i wish to travel soon with a good tour guide and have good vocation ,
