The only problem of inventors , is to make life more easy and to make persons enjoy their life .
To do that they are taking risks .
Well there are persons who said that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I agree with those who said that because with taking risks successful people are making in game our environment with using toxic and radioactif products .
I think that taking riskis is not a good thing because with taking risks we do n't know what is the result of what we have done and we do n't know if and when we will take the result of what we have done .

i thik that we must not take risks with trying new things in each thing that can affect other people 's life .
because life is very precious and we must not make in danger with taking risks .

taking risks is not good in teaching speaking with other people or in treating them .
I think that risks are difficult to assum and to correct because we dont know what will happaend after taking them .

well I was speakink about risks in our life and i said that risks are not good because they affect our environment we dont know how an can have bad result that we can escape them with working without taking risks .

but i think that risks should be taken in some things to make one 's life more intresting we must take risks in sport we must do things that we did not try before .
we must try to take risks in things that we are sure that they will not have bad effec in our life .
finally i think that risks are in some things really very dangerous and in other no so they must not be taking in the dangerous way but we can take them sometimes when it no
