The subject at hand is wheather young people enjoy life more that old people or not .
this is a very important subject becaus that question has been between people for a long time .
I , personally , agree with the statement totally .
I belive that young people enjoys life more that older ones because of the health issue , the responsiblity and the experience in life .

First , Young people are more likely to have a good health than older people .
the activities that the youngth are able to practice are more than what older people are able to .
for example , most old people have joint disease which limit their movement consequantly , hiking skating and many other activities that are enjoyable to alot of people are prohibited .
For this reason I believe that young people will enjoy their life more .

Secondly , Most young people do n't have alot to responsiblities to worry about .
They might not have childreen to fear for their future .
and they might not have a sick spouse to take care of .
on the other hand , it is more common for older people to have thoses responsiblities which hold them from enjoying life and doing fun stuff .

Finally , and it might be the most important point is the way the society look at older people versuse young ones .
Mistakes are usually acceptable from yonger people more than from the old .
in another word , young people will be able to immerse themselves in adventure , which means having more fun , whithout being cared about the result .
whearas , old people should think many times before getting into any adventure because the society is watching out what mistakes they might do .
for example , a young student might think about sneaking to his father can and drive it without having a license .
this experience might bring him/her alot of happininess and fun althought he / she might get caught by a police man but this young man is ready for the the adventure and he does n't care about the sequances .
yet , an old widow in a country like mine , for example , might not be able to get married because of she will be afried of what the society might say about her getting married at that age .

Therefore , i belive that more adventure and more freedom and less caring about what others might say will give younge people more joy in lif .

In all , Life is limited for a few years that a person can live .
Therefore , young people should enjoy their life as much as they can before getting older and having health problems , more responsibilities and a society opinion to worry about .
