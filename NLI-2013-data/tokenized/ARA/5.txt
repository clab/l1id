I would disagree with the following statement for several reasons .
First of all , it is important to have an understanding on a variety of subjects beacuse specializing in one thing only can limit your perspective in life , and it can cause you to view the world around you with a narrow mind .
However it is important to acknowledge and recognize that in order for you to fully appreciate something you must specialize in it and understand it in its depth and profoundness .

For example , if you take a look at an ordinary school , you have different teachers for every subject .
Your calculus teacher is different than your literature teacher .
Each teacher must specialize in a specific subject in order to convey suffiecient and proper information to the students .
However , that does n't mean that the teacher is narrow-minded and has a limited perspective in life because to specialize in one subject does n't hinder you or stop you from exploring other subjects .
I plan to continue my studies in the area of engineering which specifically specializes in math and science , this does n't mean that I will stop reading novels , history text books , and writing .
In fact I will have more time to explore these things and enjoy them because I am no longer obliged to do them .

In order for a person to be successful in life they must be well-rounded .
However if someone had merely a broad knowledge of all subjects and not specialized in any , then that person cannot do extremely well in one area .
What good will it do if the engineer building your house is not specialized in math but has a broad knowledge of it ?
This will definitely cause some promblems .
In order for society to function people have to specialize in different things .
If we take a look at the ancient civilizations of Rome and Greece , we find that even then there was the merchant , the priest , the philosopher , and the general in the army .
What made those civilizations distinctive from their contemporaries was a result of their varieties .
In those empires not everyone was a farmer or a nomad but different people had different specialites .
Because of the engineers buildings such as the Colloseum were built and because of the philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato , new philosophical theories were explored .
This led to the successes of these two empires and their ability to surpass thier neighboring empires and become world powers .
If everyone merely had a broad knowledge of things , then what would differentiate the engineer from the philosopher .
How will people be unique ?
How will they pursue what they are good at ?
This is why it is better to have people specialize in one subject because it will make them understand it better and it will also add to the diversity of our world .
