Knowlegde in our modern days is underrated .
In fact , people do no not appreciate the fact that education has developed in order to provide students with several subjects to accompany the throughout their journey .
How is it possible for someone to turn down the chance of taking many academic subjects and just pick one ?

In my opinion , I think that it is definitely better to have broad knowledge of several academic subjects that to just pick one .
When students are offered the choice of picking several academic subjects , they should that oppurtunity by hand .
Graduating in multiple subjects certainly makes a person more intellectual in society .
If someone can only speak of one subject in society then he would be considered as a poorly intellectual person .
Specializing in different and many academic subjects surely increases your knowledge of your surroundings and opens the doors to different horizons .

It really is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects since it enlightens a person and gives him a general idea of many topics to talk about .
It is considered as a step to a more developed world where people are more open to important subjects .

As an example of my argument , I would like to talk about my own experience in this subject .
As a kid , my parents enrolled me in a tri-lingual school that offers english , french and arabic as primary languages .
During the first years of my education , I thought that that was a stupid mistake .
Growing up , I realized that I had lots of oppurtunities ahead .
I had the ability of speaking three different languages which could definitely broaden my horizons .
This is just a simple example of how specializing in many subjects can let you work your way up !!

Finally , a broader knowlege of many subjects takes nothing but a little hard work and effort .
Not only does it provide general information of many topics but it also gives an outstanding chance to have a successful life .
One specified subject can never be enough in a world that provides so much for us .
