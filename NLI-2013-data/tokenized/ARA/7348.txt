Now days it is easy to travel to any country and do not get lost .
Drictions these days are more clear than it used to be in the old days , or let 's say it is not as confusing as it was in the old days .

you can travel to any where in this world by yourself or with anybody you know without having to have a tour guide to help you see your way .
sometimes it is more fun to go by yourself and try to explore the country you are in , if you get lost you will find your way out , may be after a long time or after having a hard time , but the fun thing is to have the adventure of getting lost , and the adventure of telling the story afterwards .
Getting lost will sometimes help you to know more about the country , I am not trying to say that traveling in to a country without a tour guide will be good advanture by getting lost but , it is fun in one way or another .

Having a tour is sometimes a great idea in my opinion .
The tour guide will guide you and show you the best places in the country you traveled to , such as the hestoric places , ancient cites , churchs , houses , resturants , and hotels .
All this will come with great explenation about the past and the present of every place .
Traveling with a group is fun too , you can meet new people from diffirrent places around the world and it is a great idea to make friends over seas and to know more about thier culters and traditions .

I believe it will be more fun if you travel alone or with some one you know and spend time together exploring the country you traveld to , besides it will be expensive to get a tour guied .
The tour guide may not understands the languge you speaking and you may not understand him , some times you will have some diffecaulties trying to get the gourp together to start your tour , some people are not ready or busy doing something and other problems that may occur too .

If i ever want to travel I will chose to travel with out a tour guide .
