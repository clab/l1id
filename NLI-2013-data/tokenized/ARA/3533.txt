I disagree with that statement .
Nowadays , a lot of highschool students look for summer jobs as soon as their academic year ends .
Those jobs consist of helping out in various stores in a shopping mall , performing simple tasks in a clinic , or catering in a restaurant , or hosting an event and there are lots more .

It also depends on the what type of young people the statement is referring to .
If it is referring to spoiled , rich teenagers then i would understand , since all they have been taught to do is to just request whatever they wish for without earning it .
Although , there are several other cases which young people are normal students who recieve average amount of pocket money every month given by their parents .
At a certain point , those young people soon realise that the pocket money most of the times will not be enough to get what they need or want .
That is when they start working and looking for jobs even at a hospital for the elderly .
Most of the job vacancies out there are being occupied by young teenagers , and they are actually more enthuisiastic than older people when they go through their job .

Most of my classmates in college always volunteer to help out with charity work .
The amount of students who actually showed up to donate and help out with organising was so shocking that the older members were extremely impressed .

In my point of view , younger people are far more creative at organising an event especially for younger people 's interests .
For instance , when it comes to organising a music concert in order to collect the money for donation , it is always done best by a young person in his or her late teens , since they know what type of music and who the younger generation likes to listen to nowadays .
That way the concert will turn out to be successful and they could earn a good amount of money for charity .
