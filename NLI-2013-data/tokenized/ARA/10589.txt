How successful are you ?
Have you ever felt that you are successful enough that you do n't need to try other things and become successful in other things you did not try before .
Well , you are not really a successful if you think what you succeeded in is enough .

Successful people are those who worked hard to accomplimish and achieve their goals .
As a matter of fact , you wo n't become successful unless you work hard for what you want to achieve .
You can become successful if you really worked hard for what you want .

Successful people tend to try new things other than the ones they already succeeded in , because as successfuls , they truly believe that they have to keep working hard to achieve more goals and have various careers where they succeeded in , even if they had to pay their own risk on the trials of becoming successful in more careers .
Successful 's ambitions do not stop at a particular point , they always have ambitions and they always want to achieve more no matter how much risk this will cause them .
They believe that to success , you have to try , risk and work hard , and they work based on that theory .
Moreoever , if successful people tried new things and they failed , they would n't be discouraged and they would try the same thing again and again , until they succeed .
It is a matter of challange .
Successful people always like to take challanges and achieve their goals in any case , and they do not accept failure .
They might fail , but they wo n't lose hope .
They keep their hopes as high as they were and try again on the same thing , until they success and become successful in another thing .

All in all , I personally think that since successful people are optimistic , hard working , smart , and like challenging , they will always want to try new things and take risks rather than just convincing themselves that what they have succeeded in is enough .
They would do more things than what they already know how to do well , and I believe that they will success one time even if they failed several times .
