Different way thinking

Schools and universities have different ways in teaching their student .
We have thousands of schools all over the world , and they have different ways in teaching .

We have a problem which is that their are two ways inorder for a student to study .
Either he understands ideas and concepts or he just learn facts as it .
Learning facts is the study in which a student just learns the facts as it is without knowing the origin of it .
I think that this isnt a goodway .
long ago we have theories done by scientists from different countries .
Every scientist does hie experiment and comes out with a hypothesis and considers it a theory .
In our present life some people just learn these facts without understanding it .
We have many problems and wrong issues that people come out with and we cant just trust it and move according to it .
We should study the origin of these theories and try to prove it wrong .
According to us fact is something that is found as it is and we should all work with it .

On the otherhand , we have the way of understanding ideas which i think that it is much better than learning facts .
A student should not just know this or that idea , he must understand it well in order to use it .
For example in my native school which is said to be one of the best schools in LEBANON , follows the first way of teaching which is understanding ideas .
Understanding ideas is a way that helps the persons brain to be more opened and refreshes his mind .

According to my opinion , i think that we must understand ideas first in a good manner .
We should not learn facts as they are but try to understand from where did this fact come from and study it well .
