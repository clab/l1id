When I was a students , I met with different kinds of students .
Some of them like to give some of their time in order to help their communities , and some students do not .
However , I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities and this is because of many reasons .

First of all , they depend mostly on the their superior to accomplish their own work .
For example , in nursing profession , you will notice that joniors depend on seniors to acheive their own work .
Another point , the developement of highly advanced techniques and machines , such as internet , computers and so on , make these young people to depend on these equipments and to decrease focusing to help their communities .
Moreover , they do n't take any responsibilies for any works they are doing and this is because of fully depending on the others so if they are not taking responsibilities for their work , how they will help their communities .

Another one is that less guidances that should be given by the other expert people .
For example , some senior nurses tend to see mistakes while the jonior nurses give health education but they will keep quite without correcting her mistakes .
In addition , less expert teachers are available nowadays to direct these student to the proper direction and to encourage them to give some of their time to help their communities .
Finally , the family plays a major role in keeping this feature in their children .

At the end , taking all of these reasons in consideration will help to have people who care about giving part of their own time to help their communities and to build stronge community that can face any problems .
