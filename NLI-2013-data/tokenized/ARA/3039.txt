I quite agree with the idea which says that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people are more active .
They enjoy going out with friends and touring different places all over the world .
They like to go sight seeing and accompanying persons of the other sex , so a young man enjoys going out with a young woman .
They love doing that .
They are eager to get married , to have babies and to make a family and to spend life watching those little children growing up .
Young people have too many future projects and plans .
They have their own aims , hopes and goals which they wish to accomplish one day in the future .
They work day and nightto accomplish them .
They enjoy the times seeing them while they are being accomplished one after the other .
They can have too many plans for their future and career .
They have another piont of view towards it .
They see it in a different way .
To them , it is full of entertainment , love , hopes and plans .
It is beauty , nature , smiles and laughs .
It is business and winnings .

Meanwhile , older people know that their aims , goals and hopes are too short in time because they have acvcomplished them or parts of them .
They have already had families and children .
They have fewer ( or no ) future plans for a career .
Some of them have got bored with the toture that life has caused .
Some others may be crippled or facing some kind of diseases .
They have become less activethan young people .
In addition , some of the older people 's children may have left them face life and its difficulties and tortures without any aid .
In some civilized countries , those old people are being taken care in special houses or institutions .
They are being taken care of by their own children and grand children in many other countries .
Those who are being taken care of enjoy life more than those who are left without any aid or help but they do not enjoy it as much as young people .

Finally , I conclude that young people really anjoy life more than older people .
they see it from another point of view .
