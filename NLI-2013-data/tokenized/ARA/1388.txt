Knowledge is like a big pot that any one can take and scope from .
living in a world full of informations oblige me to have informations from diffrent aspects or subjects .
Iam with the statment that says `` It is beeter to have broad knowledge of many acadimic subjects than to specialise in one specific subject . ''

Having a broad knowledge of a certain topic or subjet is good when iam sitting with my colleges discussing certain issue or idea .
This mean s i can paricipate effectivly in the disscusion or even in a debate in my majoring beacuse i have alot of informations and details cthat i can use to cnvince the other parts , this is very good for me .

I ca n't imagine my self sitting with agroup of people talking a bout certain idea that i have no idea a bout .
This means iam going to be speechless , staying at home is much better for me than being in this situation .
Because i dont want that happen to me i prefer studing diffrent many subjects .
Iam personaly did this with my studying .
My major in BA is Methods of Teaching English as a forgien languge and in my Master i decided to tke some thing that is broader than it .
I sudied cucrriclum design and teaching methodology .
Although it still the same dealing with education topic , bust still i got more idea than choosing to study methogology in English a lone .
Now iam planning to study in Phd Measrement
