It has become quiet a common proverb that `` if you want to identify a leading nation , you may start by identifying its cultivated population '' .
In other words , knowledge is a key issue for the advancement of individuals and the evolution of nations .
Some people believe that knowledge may be restricted to a specific topic , while other people think that knowledge should cover a broader spectrum of information .

The first group of people say that specialization is an essential criteria of the 21st century 's success .
Being knowledgeable in a specifc area secures a solid platform for a well-founded advancement .
An additional reason is that specialization provides an in-depth focus into relevant researches , and considerably eliminates the risk of getting into an uncessary waste of time and human resources , not to mention the financial ones .
A research done by the Faculty of Science at Saint Andrews University in 2005 states that individuals with a specialized academic background have an additional leverage of assisting in research laboratories than other people with a more generic knowledge base .

The other group of people believe that an academic portfolio rich of wide and diversified topics is an essential tool for advancement .
They point out to the fact that most of the professional platforms are offering nowadays the sufficient training and orientation for their recruits to be specialized in one area .
Therefore , the candidate must be equipped with a broader knowledge to be able to sustain in his daily life and be up to the many facets of his day : for instance , would you wish to be in teh shoes of a specialized mathematician pioneer in his field , but however unable to interact in a social gathering when the issue of global heating is brought up ?

Personally , I think that I cannot align myself completely with either group .
I have my reservations on both positions .
While it is important to be a specialist in one 's field , this idea does not contradict the importance of keeping abreast of a variety of topics .
Grasping more knowledge can never have a drawback ; besides , professional bodies are offering a gret relief concentrating themselves on the specialization of their recruits .
The more we know , the better we lead nations .
