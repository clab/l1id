Ever since I have been introduced to the learning system in our country , I have been always faced with two approaches while learning : The American approach versus the French approach to deliver knowledge .
Whereas the French system encourages the assimilation of ideas and concepts for a specific topic , the American way tends to deal with the more practical side of that topic .
But the question is : Which one is the best ?
Here lies the `` chicken first or egg first problem '' .

Some believes that the best way of teaching a student about a subject is by introducing him/her and explaining to him/her the theory behind that subject .
This way , the student knowledge about the subject is enlarged and then he/she might be able to predict facts emerging out of it .
As an example , if I want to teach someone about how an engine is turned on , I would introduce him/her to the mechanical theories and concepts behind it .

While this approach is followed by many , others believe that exposing the students to facts has far more impact than teaching the ideas and concepts .
In other words , by being exposed to facts , students will gain the advantage of interaction and most probably will be simulated , leading him/her to understand the ideas and theories behind the subject in a more efficient .
In other words , if we are to come back to that engine example mentioned above , instead of explaining the theory behind how an egine is to be turned on , the way to run the engine can be presented to the students in a way to experience and being exposed to that subject , thus assimilating much of the theories behind the idea .

I emphasize the importance of learning facts over understanding ideas and concepts .
I can still remember the effect 's power that a fact will leave on students , at least on me when I was back at the university .
I was more excited and felt more involved than when listening to abstract concepts and ideas .
