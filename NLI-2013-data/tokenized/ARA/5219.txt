I disagree that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are many reasons to explain my opinion of disagreement that the most advertisemnet make products seem much better than the really one .
one reason is users and the other reason is showing the products to people .
As we know the advertisement is used to show the product to the people .

The first reason is users .
as we know that the users are the most important part of many companies .
Most of the companies in the world work to find a good way to keep people or user to buy the products by advertisement and they try to provide good products every year .
For example , if I have a company , I will provide good products to the people , and I will advertise my products in good way as it is .
The advertisement will show my products to more and more people .
So , most advertisement make products seem the real one .

Other reason is that the advertisement is used to show the products as it is without adding anything that makes the production seem much better than they really are .
In addition , the advertisement is good way for people to have good products in homes .
Fore example , the advertisement will show the advantage and disadvantage of the product .
If it has disadvantage , the advertisement will show its disadvantage , because if the advertisement does not show the advantage and disadvantage , the company that makes the advertisement will lose its users and people .

finally , I disagree that the most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .
the above two reasons explains my opinion about advertisement .
Users are imprtants for the many companies and the advertisement is used to show the products to people .
