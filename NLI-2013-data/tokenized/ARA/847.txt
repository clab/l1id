It is known that as human beings we are set apart and distinguished from other species by the variety of knowledge we gain in our life-cycle .
Thus , in relation to the previous statement , I personally believe that it is better for an individual to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specialzing on one only .

Initially , gaining knowledge from a variety of topics benefits the person himself as he will be able to relate more aspects of his life to more areas of knowledge which range from mathematics to the arts .
This technique of learning and attending to many subjects is being currently used in many high schools and universities .
For example , if a student wanted to major in airplane engineering , he would have to take courses such as physics , chemistry , mathematics and such sciences .
In return , he would have a complete idea and understanding of carrying out his prospective aim which is to become an airplane engineer .

People are also subjected to many situations in which they have to bring together all the knowledge they have gained through their personal or educational experiences .
It is in specific moments such as these where a person is tested to acknowledge many academic subjects .
The applicable standards of the betterment of having a broader knowledge only furthermore justifies the importance of it and the great disadvantages of specializing and concentrating on one subject .

Not is the notion of having increased knowledge from many academics only benefitial for a human 's individuality , but it is also useful in tying links and filling in the blanks .
As demonstrated in the first example , a person will know more about the subject he is interested in if he can link to it through other aspects .
I can come to prove this from my own personal experience .
As a Theatre Arts fenatic student , I have been able to improve my acting skills through another subject I take - Psychology .
In that class , I have learned the behavioral aspects of a human 's mind and have been able to justify them using biological and environmental indicies .
Thus , when it comes to analzying scripts and playing different roles , I can become a better actor by associating the character to psychological terms which are totally true and realistic .

In conclusion , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better for the individuality of the gainer , his career and helps him/her in tight situations where they are subjected to random questions that could revolve around any ideas or theories .
Its ' advantages also exceed those of the belief of specializing in one subject which makes it a better suggestion .
Moreover , having more knowledge truly brings out humanity and drives them to their full potential and benefiting the world .
