I disagree with this statement because when i travel alone , i will just care about my self .
But if i travel with a group , i will take care of all of them .
inadditon , traneling alone is saver , cheeper and more interesting than with a group .
first , it is saver because when people travel alone , they will focus in the road that they are driving on .
For example , once i traveled from city to an other city by a car and alone at night .
while i was driving my car , i saw a big camel on my way .
i thought that i would die but i passed this animal because i was focussing and also lucky .
second , it is cheeper because people who travel alone , they will need less food and less drink than others , For example , when i travel with my friends to somewhere , we stop to eat in restaurant but when i travel alone i just eat anything from any store
