`` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''
Being someone who plans to concentrate the rest of his academic studies in mainly finance it is claer which side I am taking .

Through a broad knowledge one gets a better view on life and experiences it from many different aspects .
Through this type of studying one is educated , even if it is just a little , about various different topics .
He gets more open minded and can therefore for example contribute with his opinion in many conversations for example .
His or her intellectual ability and academic knowledge grow much wider and one understands more about every-day things in different fields .

Although in studying a specified subject one will lack much knowledge in many aspects and fields , he can on the other hand excell in his or her specific subject .
In a additon to the previous point many jobs in our evermore advancing career world require specialists .
In the end it is specialists who make great new remarkable discoveries and move the world a step ahead .

This is why i believe , taking into account the great competition which dominates the world we now live in one needs to be specialized in a certain field .
One can gain more knowledge in his or her field through internships for example .

In my opinion if a person really seeks knowledge he or she will definitely find a way to it .
One does no-t need to study it .
one can always educate him - or herself through books for example during his or her freetime .
