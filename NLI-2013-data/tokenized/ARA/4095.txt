I basicly think that young people have enough time to helping their communities .
It should be understood that the young are the major sector of the community .
If the community , for example , offered schooling and public services to the young , then the young would respond and cooperate with their community .
They take part in public ceremonies , social campaigns and many other assisting services .
This , of course , would create a mode of trust , confidence and cooperation between the young and the community .

Generally , the young people are of highly percentage of students and less of workers .
In other words , most of them are literate and they recognize the need of their community for them .
I really appreciate the young who have a mutual integriation between their efforts and the community 's .
They form a one body where they find each others ' needs , and it helps solve their problems and to share the same experience under the same medium .

One may wonder where is the young people 's time running out if they do n't give enough time to helping their communities .
In fact , I do n't find any excuse to secure those who pretend that they have no enough time to be dedicated to their community .
Actually , living in a community is not a tragedy of the commons .
Benefits must be common among all the young as well as the old .

Finally , the young people are the core of all communities , and the communities should serve them and give them the most opprtunities available to develop their skills and potentials .
In this way , I think , the other side - the young people - will take care of their community and share its experience cooperatively .
This woluld make the young give much of their time to helping their communities .
