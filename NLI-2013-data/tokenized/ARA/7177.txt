Means of transpors have taken a major part in our lives in the past and the mean time as well .
Cars have been the most popular way of transport in the past twenty years but I don not think that this case will continue in the next twenty years because the prices of cars are high and people now prefer to use the puplic means of transporting .

Puplic means of transport is the future of transporting .
by using puplic means of transport the traffic jam will reduce alot and and you will not to wait for hours to go to your job .
In additon , it will be safer for the envirment because air polluation will decrease .
Also , it will be usefull for anybody to take a bus to their work our shool inseted of buying a car .
It will cost them less money and they will get to their jobs on time .

Buying a car is an expensive thing .
we will have to save money in order to get it and it can cost you your entire savings .
also , when you get the car will have to pay for the insurance company and you should check the car state once a month .
In brief , cars require alot of care and mony .

In conclusion , i believe that cars will not be the same in quantity in the next twenty years becuse of the increase in cars prices and the emarge of puplic means of transporting .
