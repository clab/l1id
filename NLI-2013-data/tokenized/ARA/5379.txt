Yes I do agree with this statement .
In my point of view when a person invents something new which is not available in the market .
He tries to include everything that he could do .
This is a good thing .
But when the time comes for advertising this product .
The person tries to advertise it in such a way that he could get profits as fast as he can .
Lets talk about a shop who deals in mobile phones .

When a person opens a new mobile phone shop he tries to give the customers promotions that the other shops do not give .
Like to give a mobile phone headset , a car charger , a mobile phone carry case , some applications , games that he can be downloaded from the computer into the mobile phones .
When a customer look at this kind of an advertisment he gets really excited .
He goes to that shop and asks for that item that he saw it in the advertisment .
Then the shop keeper shows him , he does not like the item .
Why ?
Because most of the shops advertise the promotional items as original ones .
But they find them that they are not original .
This makes a lot of problem when a shop keeper is selling a product of someone else .
I would like to share an example that I experienced before a year or two .
There is a trademark who is really popular among the ladies .
It sells readymade clothes for women .
And his logo is also very popular .
A shop owner copied this logo on a material that does not cost the half price of the material the orignal shop is selling and he advertised it in variuos magizenes and newspapers .
People started buying from him not also keeping in mind that it 's the same kind of material .
So this kind of advertisment can loose alot of money on just silly things .
In my opinion people should not do these kinds of things at all .
