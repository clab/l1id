As we know , there are two methots to study .
The first one is to have broad knowledge od many academic sibkects .
The second one is to specialize in one specific subject , one has his own tast in studing , so let us talk about this subject

For me .
is depend on my own time , If I has big amout of time , I will choose the seconed method .
becase if study in this way of cours , I will gante so much , I also will have alot of information the book I study .
then i will be able to unsderstant all what the teacher will teach us .

On the other hand , If i do n't have much time i will start my studing by the first way , which is all my acadimic subjects not in deply .
Becase this method will help to have some information abuut what my teaters will give us in my classs .

But if you ask my about my opinon , I will tell you that nobody can be fourcied to follow one way , But as I say before , that I feel that the bes way is the second one .
Becouse it will give you s confidous first , in your self and than you will be able to anser any qustion that anyboy wll askes you .
also your teachers will be so happy about your level .

I hope all peoplt
