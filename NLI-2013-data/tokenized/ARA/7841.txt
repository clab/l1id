yes i agree because it will be more fun and e can to go to places to gather and it 's also will be cheaper than if you go alone .

if you go alone it will be boring and may be some if who is with you knows a good places and funny to visit them .

it 's also you can meet a new friends and have fun with them

like if you goo with your frieds and with thwm friends you will meet them friednsa and have a good time with them its not hard to make a new friends this is a good way to meet a good friends .

for exaple you can go to the travel agent and tell who is work there that you need to go to some places with a group tnd you choose the place for exaple Florida you can go to the universal studio there and see how they can do all this movies and go to the beach there and see anew places especialy for someone that international and he is not from the same place or not rom the same country like me i went to the travel agent and i told them that i want to go to orlando with a groub and when i went tere i met alot from other contry and they have different customs than what we have i think it is agood idea to go with a groub and have fun eith them .

you can also go out side you country and see anew culture and take the good things from them and if you like what they doing and them culture you can do same as what are they do

this is my oponion and i like to travel with agroub and have fun .
