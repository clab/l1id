the education field has deeply changed in the past recent years new technologies have brought so many improvement in information access .
students now can have access to a huge amount of information in a very easy way i believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas than to learn facts understanding concepts involves thinking which allows the student to be creative and adaptative to the the environment that is changing rapidly while learning a fact could be mistake inducing since the fact learned would be no longer true once the student understands a concept he will be free to use in various situations also when you understand something you are more likely to keep it in mind than something you have learned and that you may forget to finish i like to emphasize that when the student understands he doesn t need to learn .
