I personally agree that people have to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , this beliefe emerged from what I have noticed and experinced in this world such as the information revolution , which made the information easy , fast , and available without extra time and mony , its becoming essential to have an idea about many academic subject rather than only yours .

There are so many reasons to agree on the said statement , but will try to summerize some of it .
The whole world has become a small village and what ever happened on the extreme north will be known to those in the extreme south in jsut a second .
In certain occasions a person might face lot of incedences in which he/she will be either a part of a discussion about his/her specific background at the job location , or in social gathering with familly and friends .
On the other hand sometime and in our dynamic lives we all face in certain occasions a place where they discuss about new academic subject like for example the prices of energy sources and the availability of the oil and gas alternatives , for how long they will continue dominating the energy sources , therefore if you are a medical doctoer you should have some knowledge about it since also this subject affect our life .
Being an engineer today , you must get a degree in business adminstartion in order to compete in the market .
Pharmisits who are working in the distribution part of pharmositcal companies have to have a degree or solid experinece in buisness namely sales and marketing .

Nobody can deny how important is the wide knowledge at this time .
Schools has taken mojor steps to expand the knowledge of thier students and make them ready for the coming sophosticated future in which things are moving very quickly .
This is a very important reason for parents for example to widen thier knowledge to be prepared to answer thier children questions .

One thing to emphasize , is that its not neccesary to have always a double major to be in line with the new developments , but it very important that we all know how to use internet for example and to know which refernce we have to use in order to either answer a question out of our special subject or participate in a discussion that might take place either at the office or elswhere .
