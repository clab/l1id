No one can deny that cars are so essential in the modern life .
It is considered one of the main inventions of the twentieth century .
We can find cars in almost every place we go to .

The importance of the cars increases with the enormous increase in poplulation as a greater number of people are more likely to use cars .
Thus , one cannot immagine that the number of the cars is going to decrease .
This cannot occur neither in the near future nor in the far future .
And the reason is obvious , the increasing need to cars .
What are those needs , one might ask ?
I may tell him , do n't you need it in your own travel from place to place ?
Is n't it needed for the transportation of goods and trades ?
It is also important for other purposes .
For example , when we have a long vacation and we plan to travel to a distant place , will we go there walking ?
Is n't the car , our own car or even a puplic bus , important then ?
I think we cannot dispense with cars in all fields of our life .

Oh , how many uses there are for cars !!
You cannot count .
But hey , we should stop at this point and ask , is n't this increasing need for cars going to make problems ?
To be frank , many problems are expected .
There will be more traffic problems .
The noise rates will reach its maximum values .
And the big lasting problem , the pollution .
It is expected that the air would be polluted so much .
But who knows , there might be some new invensions that help solve that problem .
Elctrically-driven cars might prevail .
Also , cars driven by solar energy may also be available on a large scale .
In conclusion , the increasing need to cars supports the claim that the number of the cars is going to increase very much in the following years .
But at the same time , finding good solutions to the different problems in cars nowadays is also needed .
