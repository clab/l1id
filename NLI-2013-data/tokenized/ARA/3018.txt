Enjoying life and profiting of life are very important .
enjoying life for me does n't depend on a specific age but it depends on willing , circumstances , money , health and a lot of other things .

If we take the point of willing or looking forward to enjoy life , we will get variable situations and variable results .
For example there are young people who are full of freshness but they don ' have the willing of enjoying life and i am one of those .
Iam 28-years-old , i am thinking all the time about problems especially my problems and my ambition without paying attention that i am losing a lot of time in stress and calculations with no results and in the same time i am not enjoying at all my life .

In the same time i am astonished from my grand father who is 82-years-old and he is enjoying every single moment of his life .
Sometimes , the circumstances of the life does n't allow us to profit from life .
For example i know some people who cannot enjoy their lives due to a unique reason which is : ( work ) , the word seems so simple and we can ask ourselves how can work can block like this the sense of enjoying life ?
it 's so simple when you work between 9 and 12 hours per day you ca n't really enjoy because you do not have time and your brain became formated only to work .
I think that there are a lot of young healthy people who cannot enjoy their life due to their work .

In the same time there are other young and old people who have the priority of enjoying life without thinking in work .
Other points that can influence our sense of enjoying life is money .
some people , enjoying life for them is depending essentially on money , because for them they cannot enjoy without travelling , without buying luxurious cars and houses and this part of people is including young and old people so it does n't depend on age .

The last and the most important point for me is : Health .
A person who is sick or with bad health conditions , cannot have a good quality of life and as a rsult of this he cannot enjoy life even if he has the willing and money .

On the contrary of a person in a good health can enjoy his life easily with little bit of money and willing .
to summarize-up for me enjoying life does n't have an age but we can say it has a soal .
