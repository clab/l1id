I think first that both the younger and older people both enjoy their lives but I think that older people enjoy thier life more .
I am convinced with that for several reasons .
One important reason is that in order to enjoy your life you should feel secure and relax .
I think older people feel more secure because they have already featured their lives .
Another reason of why old people enjoy their lives more is their financial status as generally the old people are richer than younger ones which helps them going on trips or performing a lot of activities .

I think that the older people will not have as much commitments as the younger people have as in young age the person is always in stress looking towards building a successfull future , this of course takes a lot of his time as he has to study many courses and prepare himself for entering the professional life .
After that the young people become busy with thier new jobs they try to progress in their carreers and make money .
They after that become concerned with building their own families by marriage and having babies .
They remain always like this living in stress trying to accomplish many tasks and reach many goals until they reach to a relatively comfortable life .

At this time only the begin thinking about enjoying their lives and spending a good time performing activities .
Taking myself as an example I think I am not enjoying my life uptill the moment because I am always struggling to have a good life I wish for myself and my small family .
I have always to study additional courses , I spend my money in this courses but I think this is mandatory to earn a degree as well as to increase my experience so that I get better job with higher salary .

But if I look to my parents I find that they enjoy their lives now , they go regularly to trips , they attend live performances and they enjoy practicing their hobbies as drawing and reading .

But of course I think that if I had a lot of money and a good job while I am young this will be the best option as I can enjoy travelling , playing soccer matches and practicing some risky activities as climbing mountains and diving .

But I believe that man ca n't get all what he wants at the same time , so I am building my future now and I wish I can enjoy my life at a later period .
