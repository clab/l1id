The young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping

Life became very hard and very quickly that what make people very busy in their life , because they need always to be actives than they are can control the situition .

The first reason make the young people do not give enough time to helping , because they are spend most time at working , so this reason make them ca n't control time very easy , because when they are get back home they are spended very long an work day and they try to get any chance to get good rest .

The second reason make young people do not help , because they are try to establish thier life and make thier futuer better , also they are speand alot of time for something make them spend their time more enjoy , so that make them too far to help another people .

Finally , because the young people still not adoult enough that make thier way to thinking deffirent like they are alwys thinking how to get more enjoy or more fun time , for example they are prefer going to play games more than they thinking to help another people , and they are like to looking about their partnar in this life to get marreged and creat thier own life .

In conclousion , all these reasons , like working , life very hard and quick , the young people prefer more than like to help , so I am agree with the statement Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping .
