I agree in this following statement .
In twenty yeas no body knows what will happen to us .
Maybe there will not be any cars or may be there will be more cas than we have right now in our time .
There are many stuff in the world that has not been discovered yet .
And no body nows about them .
In my point of view there will be many discoverings will happen that maybe more than the three fourths of the worls wo n't believe that this is discovered .
i would like to be there in that time and also whants to do stuff that i never dreamed of doing with these new discovered stuff .
I suppose that instead of cars , in twenty years there will be cars that could fly .
If that happens i would like to live and see that before i die and also like to try it also .
