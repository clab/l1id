Taking risks is an important part of life .
It involves trying new methods , living in new environments , and learning new experiences .
In my opinion , I certainely believe that to be successful , you always have to challenge yourself with new things to promote your abilities .

When you are routinely doing an activity , you become an expert at it after some time , and you gain no further knowledge about it .
Take for example , a teacher who has been teaching the same seventh grade math curriculum for ten years .
At the start of his work he will be enthusiastic , thriving on new ways to teach , and trying to do his best in class to convey the concept .
In a couple of years time , he might develop new and innovative ways to pass the concept to his students , but after he reaches that , he will have no further motive to enhance because he will have reached a peak .
His teaching methods might even decline .

Consider this same teacher moving to a new school , that teaches math in different ways , or even teaching other levels other than seventh graders .
His new experiences will broaden his knowledge and prospective about the subject , and will make him a more experienced teacher .

Although moving to the new school requires him to take a risk , because he was already known to be good at his old school in the particular grade he taught , moving opened a new and challenging field for him .
It allowed him to learn new approaches , deal with different age groups , and add to his overall teaching experience .
He can be a more successful teacher because he dealt with different areas of his work instead of doing the same thing over and over again .

To be a successful person , you should never let the fear of losing stand in your way .
Always take risks , and seek new opportunities to help you grow and develop in your work environment or community .
