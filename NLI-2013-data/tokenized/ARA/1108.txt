I agree with the statement , which said it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to sepcialized in one specific subject .
Having a varity of knowledge is much better than studying one major .
As a student i have made a plan to apply this rule or what stated .
This plan are based on what i think and my personal openin .

My theiory , is people and specailly student have to study what majors they liked .
As a student , i am trying to study Arts and Designs but in the same way i would like studying economic and bussiness .
Studying Art , is the first step for my plan .
After i take my master in Arts , i will heading in studying bussiness .
these are not my main goals to a chieve .
my main goal is builting and running a company which specailized in cartoons so by studig these tow majors , i 'll be able to have some sense of art , in addition , i can run my own bussiness .

I think if every person should study what he likes , he will be satisfied in two ways .
one way , he will be pleased that he is parcticing what he likes and he will not feel bored , which is the major cause of lack at work .
Moreover , he will not give in something that he do n't like as if he in something that he acutally love doing it .
seconed way of satisfaction , that what i observed that people who are doing what they love are succeccfull .

The main thing i recommend people who are inttending to study more than one major is to study what they love .
Because not all of people have the potentail to study a diffirent majors .
In the moment i consider myself a person who hane all the potentail to study a veraiies major .
