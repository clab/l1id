Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree with this statement because evereyone now only care of hisself and do not think of others , others is represent their communities .

Everyone have a community to live in , but do not give it enough time to helping .
What is your community ?
Your community is representing you .
If you do not give you community a time to help you are even do not help yourself .
You must think of the time that you give your community because if you help your community , you community will develope so you will develope and you will think better to have a very good and connected community .

Why young people do not give their community enought time to helping .
I think that they do not think of this or this thing even do not come to their mind .
For example my cousion he work very hand to get a very high salary and to have a very comfortable life and to get his family happy of what he done but he did not think that he can get his community time to help .
maybe if he think they will help and this is why do not young people give their communities time they want someone to tell them because they only think of what they have and what they will have and ignore their communities .

Communities is the more important thing or the first thing in young people life than other thing because you are growing and stating your life with helping from you community and you must try to give a time to helping your communities .

In my conclusion , i thing that we must remind a young people and try to help them and give them solutions that will help them inorder to help them to help their community .
