Students around the world have different methods of learning , it highly depends on the subject in hand .
Some subjects depend more on learning facts , other subjects are more towards understanding the ideas .
I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , and I think that this statement should be applied to all subjects .

As a start , by understanding the ideas and concepts , students will end up understanding the subject in hand , not just learning it by heart .
Understanding the ideas and concepts will make it much easier for them to learn the details by heart .
For instance , in Biology , if you understand the exact route of blood from the heart to the organs , you will find it easier to later on learn the names of the organs that the blood passes through .
Moreover , some subjects such as Mathematics , need clear understanding of the concepts so that you could apply them to the questions .
After understanding the concepts , you can learn the rules , and then apply them .
In addition , it is more easy to forget a subject that you simply learnt , but not quiet understood .
In my junior high school years , my worst subject ever was History .
I used to learn the facts , write them up in the final exam , leave the exam room already forgetting everything I had just wrote down .
That is because I never bothered actually understanding the course .
Thus by understanding a course , you can remember it for a long time , and apply it in another courses afterwards .
Finally , you can understand more about a course by reading more knowledge than required about it .
It might not be in the syllabus of the course , but it will help the student to expand his mind more and learn more than required about it , this would make the course seem more interesting .

To sum up , by understanding the ideas and concepts rather than simply learning facts , it would be easier to learn and apply , it would be more interesting and you 'll end up remembering the course for a long time .
Therefore , I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
