There is a growth in population .
Year by year , the estimated number of people on earth is multiplying .
With this pupluation outburst , more cars will have to be present to meet the needs of the people .
Also , people are getting lazier each year and they will need a form of transportation to move them around .
For those reasons , I think that in twenty years there will be many more cars in use than there are today .

It has been mentioned in more than one official estimate that there is an uncontrollable population growth in the world .
In under-developed countries such as the South Asian countries , for example India and Pakistan , a normal family consists of six to eight children .
In gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar or Bahrain , a family is considered big only if the number of children exceeds six .
Now multiply those number with the numbers of families in each country and calculate how many people will be present in the world in twenty years .
Imagine how life would be if fewer cars were used .
How will people move from one location to another ?

Some argue that there are laws these days preventing families from having too many babies .
For instance , the Chinese law that states that no family should have more than one child .
Even with those laws , one cannot stop the rapid growth in population .
Another arguement proposed is that women these days are choosing not to marry for they have more job opportunities and can live independantly .
New estimates show that the number of women is larger the number of men so even if 25 % of the women in the world decide not to marry , there will still be 75 % who are willing to settle down with a husband and have as many children as he wants .
Population growth will continue to be a problem and more cars will have to be produces to satisfy the people .

Unfortunately , each generation produced is lazier than the generation before it .
By the time we reach the year 2026 ( keeping in mind that the year now is 2006 ) , the level of laziness will reach its peak .
This is really sad but it is a fact that we must leard to deal with .
People at that time in the future would n't want to move around on foot , or bicycles or any other form of transportation that would tire them .
The only way to solve this problem is by having more cars to satisfy the needs of the generation will come .
As my mother would always say , `` What a lazy generation ! ''
If that is what she keeps on saying about the present generation , imagine how it would be twenty years from now .

It has been said that because of the population growth , there must be fewer cars .
Imagine life with so many cars !
Pollution will certainly be a problem , the streets will be much more crowded and people will have problems reaching their destinations in time for important meetings or deadlines .
As much as I am aware of this problem we have to shine light on another important point .
Men are very lazy .
They would n't want to walk to reach their goal or ride the bike .
Unless a new method for transportation is invented that will not tire out the new generation , more cars will have to be present by that time .

Population growths and the laziness of new generations are two main factors that will increase the number of cars that will roam the streets in the future .
I am fully aware of the problems that will occur because of this but one cannot live in denial all of his life .
We need more cars .
How else are we going to move around ?
Unless a new solution is proposed for transporting comfortably from one place to another , cars will continue to multiply in number as people do .
