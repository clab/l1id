Many people prefer to travel in groups led by a tour guide , and other people prefer to travel individually .
There are many advanatges for both methods that I have to take in consideration when I plan to travel and especially when I plan to make a touristic tour to a certain country .

On one hand when I travel with a group led by a tour guide , I am limited with the place indicated by the tour guide .
However , if I travel individually I can make my own plans and I can go any where I want to visit .
Moreover , I am not only limited with the places but also with the time that the tour guide indicate to stay in one place .
If I travel individually , I can spend more time in one place that I like more than other place .
On the other hand , travelling with a group led by a tour guide will be more organized .
Therefore , regarding the schedule of the trip , the tour guide will make a plan in order to visit the maximum number of places in the country .
However , If I am alone , I might miss some important places to visit .

Also , the tour guide might provide me lot of information about any touristic site , while I can not get these information from any other sources during the trip .
In the meantime , during a trip with a group .
I might take advantage of making some relationships and making some friends .
Furthermore , it will be a good opportunity to interact with people from different nationalities and different cultures .
So I will be able to practice my languages with them and we might go out and have fun together during the free time .

However , If I travel alone , it will be a good chance to relax and have some silent moments with myself .
Sometimes , I need calm after long period of working hard .
For example , I will choose to spend some times on the beach , looking at the sea and enjoy the sound of the waves and the weather , this is a relieve for my stress .

Giving the advantages of boyh methods , I belive that when I go for a trip , I should organize the time in such a way that during some days I have to join a group with a tour guide and some days I will need to stay alone .
Therefore , I will get double benefit from my trip : Relaxing and expanding my knowledge about the country I visit .
