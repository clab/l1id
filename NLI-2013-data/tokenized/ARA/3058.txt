The cycle of life is amazing .
A human is born weak and than gets to the zenith of his strength at one point than goes back to being weak as he approaches the end of his life .
yet ask yourself this ?
When does a person enjoy life the most ?
In my humble opinion enjoying life means to have health , time in your life and the passion to learn which is what most old people lack .
That is why young people enjoy life more than old people do .

In order to enjoy life you need to have a great health .
Most young people that .
They are strong and often do not suffer from many diseases as old people do .
Young people can jump scream and dance whenever they are happy .
They are able to respond to their exitement through physical actions .
However if an old person gets exited it 's more likely for him to get a heart attack .
It is very rare to see an old person able to jump up and down when exited .

It 's said that life is like a toilet paper .
The sooner it gets to the end the faster it rolls .
Often do we hear old people talking about death as if it became a new friend they are ready to be escorted with as they leave the ballroom of life .
Old people put the idea that they do not have any more time in their hands wich makes them think there is nothing to be happy about .
When I ask my grandma `` Come up the stairs with me so we can watch the sunset '' she would answer '' No my dear , it 's too late for me to do that .
It 's your time now .
You go by yourself and enjoy it while you can . ''
.
My grandma just missed out the fun of gazing into the sunset because she thought that the stairs would kill her .
Young people dont worry about time .
As far as they are concerned they should enjoy life while they still can !

To me learning is one of the most excitting activities I enjoy .
And when i say learning I mean learning from life .
Like having the suspence and wondering what will happen next .
Or Where your life is going to take you .
Experiencing that the knowledge you know today is different from the knowledge you know tomorrow .
Old people will miss out on that excitting feeling because when they think about their future , atomatically a picture of a grave loads up in their mind .
They say they have nothing to learn because they are in the final statges of life .
Therefore they lack the passion to learn .
If you do n't have the will to learn than you will not learn .

In conclusion , this does n't mean that all old people are miserable .
It 's really how the individual defines the phrase `` enjoying life '' .
To me if you do not have health , time and passion for learning i do n't believe you will be able to enjoy life .
