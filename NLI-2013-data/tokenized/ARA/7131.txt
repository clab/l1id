In twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .
that was in my openian .
I have some reasens for that .

The first reason , before more than twenty years ago there are cars and dont find other to transfer our from one place to other in the same city .
So the cars become mare and more from the bast .

In fact , there are other equpmet to transfer our from one plase to other in other city , for example there are trains , planes and subways , that was faster from cars but still the cars are the importnat .

In other hand to supose my openion the goverment make more fasilities for the rode and more safety , for exampel , I prefer the travel by car because it is com fortable for me , i can find the resturants in the rode and rest areas .
so i stop to take relax in the time that i feel tired , but when i travel on the plane or tain i can not stop to take relax .
There are othor reason , when i travel by car i see the diferent viwes and i learn my children about it , and we can viset more cities on the rode before i reach the place that i want .

In sumary the cars are the most spesilaties for the families , we can not fewer cars untile find the other have all advantages .
