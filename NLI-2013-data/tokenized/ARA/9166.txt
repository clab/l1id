I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
This is so because of many reasons .

To start with , I think that facts origenate ( come originally ) from ideas and concepts .
This can be clearly shown in the physics field , for example .
When a person wants to prove something for somebody , through an expirement , he has to build his whole expirement on one or more idea or concept and then go on with the expirement to prove a specific fact .
From this point we can understand that ideas and concepts are more important than facts .

Moreover , through focusing on ideas and concepts the , student will develop a self thinking method based on reasoning .
This is basically done by schools and universities .
When these institutions are focusing on developing and improving the student 's ability to learn new facts and concepts , it is growing and feeding the student 's imagination to think in a different angle of view and thus discovering nem things .

But on the other hand , when schools and universities are just ( spoon feeding ) the student with ready made facts they are killing the imagination part of his thinking .
After that the student will grow up and continue in his education just depending on ready facts which are in his text books .
