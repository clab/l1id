Yes , i strongly agree with this statement .
Many companies use this technique in-order to increase their selling quantities and so higher profits .
Advertisements in their nature purposes to be so , as they should appeal to the people in the most attractive manner , specially when the advertisment deals with products associated with teenagers .
Advertisments can be false either when it atempts to use inaccurate and exaggerated information or when it states facts about a product that are in-fact not true .
Almost any country has laws and punishments concerning about such issues .

I can easily give supports and examples from our daily exposure to such advertisements , for example : the Orbit Channel advertisements ; the one related to the chemical hair remover `` Epil Stop '' .
The advertisement says that the solution removes the hair from its roots and in few minutes .
We bought the product for my mom , and she tried it , but it appeared that the solution is unable to remove the hair from its roots , however , it just wipes the hair at the surface level .
Another example is the advertisement for milk , protein products , or energy drink .
As the person in the advertisement shows a specially supernatural powers immediatly after drinking it , like winning in a running race , flying , or being able to get good grades .
Another example is advertisments for certain cars , like the one for Chevorlete , when the driver of the car stops immediatly to avoid killing an animal , while in a very short ( phyisically impossible ) stopping distance .

Advertisements are always exaggerated in way or another ; thats the nature and the philosophy of the advertisement .
But exaggerations should be limited .
Sometimes such exaggerations might be constructive , as in the case of the milk advertisment , as it encourage kids to drink more milk .
However , it might be in some cases disadvantageous , as it would be a waste of money , as in the case of the hair remover .
