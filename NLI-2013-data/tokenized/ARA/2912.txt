young people think that they can enjoy their life more than the older ones , but in my opinion I think older people can enjoy their life even more if they want to .
Sometimes you see a 100 old man or a women that can talks like a 20 years old man .
This is related to the feelings and to the minds .
For example , if a 20 years old man always nagging about his life and always complaining about life and problems and never stops a moment to think and ask himself : is life really worth it ??
am I really sick or thats just in my mind ?
he will always feel sick if thats what was in his mind .
Accepting your life as it is is a treature and most people these days do n't have it !

there is a question that how can the older men enjoy their lives ?
to answer this question we should ask ourselfs first What are the pleasures in life ??
I mean it depends on each person .
some people think of parties and calaberating all day long .
Others find pleasures in their food .
what can he eat on the next meal ?

traveling is a pleasure for some people .
They travel all around the world to discover more places and meet new people .
others just find their pleasures sitting home watching TV all day .
so , back to our question : what can be the pleasure of an old man ?
you ca n't say really it depends on his personality , but maybe in my opinion he just love to sit home with his family doing many stuff that we see it as silly stuff but its really maters for him , like drinking tea with his son and discussing some things .

finally , you can be young in your heart no matter what your age is .
