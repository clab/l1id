Typically , it is a common misconception that young people would enjoy life more than older people do .
It is infact true that younger people have more potential to enjoy life , although it is the sad truth that some do not .
Some of the more older people in the world probably enjoy life much more than younger people .
I believe that with the right mindset , enjoying life is not a matter of age .

Younger people have more capable bodies to play sports or do very difficult activities , such as mountain climbing .
A child at the age of five would not have many worries with almost no responsability .
They would continue running around , thinking of nothing but their next desire .
A teenager would exhibit realizations of responsability .
They would have to keep up with their grades , and their social life , etc .
Although , a teenager still does not have a goal set for their life .
Some have a theory that they have the so-called `` teen angst '' in which they rebel against many different situations and/or persons in their life .
This is an example of how a younger person may not enjoy life more than an older person does .
An older person should be wise enough to do the right thing and act the right way .
Another example could be if a person was put into a very bad situation .
For instance , if the teenager or child was living in the more disease prone areas of Africa .
They probably would not be having so much fun , especially with the political instability and the little amount of food around .

An older person , on the other hand , usually has a foot in the direction they would want to follow .
They would not have the ability to , for instance play ninty minutes of soccer in one of the major clubs of the world , although they could still enjoy such past-times as golf .

An older person would probably have had the resources set around himself/herself to be in some way succesfull .
It is up to them whether they want to follow that path or any other .

In conclusion , it is only ourselves limiting the enjoyment of life .
It is true , with some situations , there really is not much you could do , although we have to make the best of what we have .
So once again , it is not true that young people enjoy life more than older people .
