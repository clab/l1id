Undertanding ideas

In my view , it is important for students to undertand ideas and concepts than its for them to learn facts .
Also I think it is much easyier than learnings facts and more acceptable .

For example , if he has a Biology class and the teacher is trying to explaine the lesson , the students will understanding hardly if the tf the teacher is explaining as a fact , but if the teacher explained it as an idea or a concept it will be easy like a peice of cake .

Second , you have nothing to do with facts because in this century no one wants to lesson facts most of them prefare to know the something as an idea .
I think also they will memorise it and remember it quickly more than facts .

Another example , if you want to go to a campus and some of your friends aked you a question about a lesson , attitude , anything else you will not be able to answer him a good answer unless if you know it as an idea or a concept .
I think also that the doctors studyed that understanding ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts and the doctors approved that by making experience on the poaple so he made groupe who undertand facts and another on

Finally , I would like to advice all of poeple to undertand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts because it is easyier and more comfortable to all of us .
