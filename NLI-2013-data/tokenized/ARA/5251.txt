Advertising ... bliss or Curse

How many times did you a buy a product expecting it to be of high quality and usage , only to be disaapointed later as you discover its limited functionality and below average quality ?
I am sure some may agree with me that this scenario occurs often , and soon leads to people arguing whether advertisments make products seem better than they really are .
Though I can relate with those who argue that it is the buyer 's responsibility to verify the exact specifications and functionalities of an item before purchase , yet i belive that in our days most advertisments DO `` beautify '' products to seem better than they are .

If we consider the hypothetical or rather normative purpose of an Advertisement , it would be to show a potemtial customer the existing functionalies of a product and convincing him/her to purcahse that item .
But with Capitalism taking control of the world , definitions have started to change , and the business world has adapted to new masks keeping revenure - rather than Business Integrity-as the ultimate purpose .
Hence Advertising became about doing and Saying anything and everything to sell that item , regardless if that item is worth selling in the first place .

If we take examples from the world , we can look at the historic and famous Cigarette ads , which usually try to promote smokers as `` beautiful , adventerous , cool ...
etc '' , yet not until recently , failing to inform smokers of the health risks , and high cancerous rates .

Another example would be plastic surgury ads that try to convince those who are running after the illusion of youth , that the usage of this creme or that mask , or those injections will actually turn back the cycle of time .
Again failing to tell patients that its all a matter of 5-7 years ( the maximum ) till any `` fake '' effect disappears , leaing them with possible health hazrds .

Lets take insurance companies for another example .
Such companies tend to `` sell '' their promises for safety and wellcare guarantees , yet failing in most of the cases to warn the clients from all those `` Exceptions or situations '' where `` they just dont cover ! ''
.

Even war has a been a commodity that Advertisements has successfully over-rated and made it shine .
The war on Iraq was advertised as a legitimate procedure to fight terrorism , and liberating the Iraqis ..
and ...
and .. !
Alot of innocent decent people fell for these `` Shiny '' words , but look at what really happended .
The American Economy has suffered greatly from it , half a million iraqis have been killed in 3 years , more terrorists have emerged !

Business should be eithical , sell what you have , or else dont !
