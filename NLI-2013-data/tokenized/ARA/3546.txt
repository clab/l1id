Young People And The Community

I think that I would have to agree with this statement , according to nowdays young people dont help or participate enough in thier own communities , and I mainly think that this is because of the world today and its busy busy life .

Becasue nowdays a lot of young people ca n't even afford to loose time on playing or engaging in any kind of fun activities , Because they barely can make it from home to college and from college to thier part time work ( if they have one ) and then going home again to do thier chors and finish studying and doing thier homeworks , which takes a lot fo them dropping them beat on the bed at the end of the day .

But then again this does not apply on every young person , some people chose not participate in thier own communities because they dont think that the community itself is not doing a good job maintaining things at hand , and so they dont want to interfere with the bumpy roads ahead .

But also there is a quite fair amount of young people with plenty of free time who would love to help thier communities to prosper and to feel good about them selves as indivisuals in doing so , and not to forget that working pro bono for the community means no money , and not mnay people who would want to waste thier time and not get paid in the end , so sticking to thier jobs is the better answer fo their time .

So in conclusion , I do agree with the statment that young people dont give enough time to help thier own communities , but in the same time I dissagree that should help the community and give thier time and efforts away on the count of their futures , but this doesnt emply on those young people who dont think and give much time about thier future or their community because they should , after all our community is what we have and what we stand for .
