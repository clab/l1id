I am agree if we do not use cars in twenty years , but how ?
that is a question .
and also if we do not a petrol for the car .
Some country make car without using petrol ' how ?
this car use the x ray of the sun , that will not use a petrol so it will not be polution in the air and we keep the envairoment clear .

Also there another solution we can use a car without petrol how ?
In Germany in BMW designed car by using water or Haydrogeen .
I saw this car , it 's very nice but expensive car no problem I Will not buy one , this car need spcial station for fill the fule .
but also save envairomental from polution .

Also some student make a car by using the air .
