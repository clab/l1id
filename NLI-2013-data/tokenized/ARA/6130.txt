I disagree with the following statment , `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
If we are just try take a glance to the increasing shift of the technology all over the world , then we have to believe that the number of the cars will accodringly increase reaching the top of the peak .
The reasons which contribute with this huge cars incline are many , such as the great advance develobment in the technology , and the remarkable extinst of the population who lived on the earth at the same world .

There is an advance technology exisit not only every day but every moments these days , and the people try to provide the customer with best product .
If we comapare to number of the models of the cars before twenty years and now , we will see the remarkable difference .
the same way if we try to comare today 's models with twenty years from now , we will diffenitlly be shocked by the statistic .

Moreover to this advance technology , the number of the population which are n't only exceed the estimated limit by our minds , but we can feel it indirectly through the noiseness , crowdness , and the number of the people who died from these car accident .
Lets say that this is the tax of the technology that we want to lived in .

In other words , the number of the cars will raise , years after years , and this increasment will be out of our control .
Because of the technology and the population growth , the cars after twenty years will be more not fewer that today .
If i get the change to own my own car i will never hesiste to do so .
At leats i can get red of the driver , depend on myself , and do all of my requirments by myself .
no one will do them better than me .
