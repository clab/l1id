At these days , the education is a big world and vast sea .
There are many skills and alote of excersis that to help the students to learn and to get the highest degrees in their live .
There are some arguments and there are several opinions talk about what the better ways for the students in the education , understand or memorize .
Some of these arguments said that the understand ideas is more important for the students .
I agree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts because that make them better .

And I have some reasons supports my opinion , these I discoverd its when I was students and now when I am working at the school in my country , Kuwait .

First of all , when the students are staying in the class and they are just listning for the teacher they will not learn any thing , in fact they will forget every thing after few days .
For example , when I was in high school , tha mathmatics teacher always gave us the questions with the answers and he never let us to thinking about the questions and the result always had bad because it the test we woul face new questions and we did n't know how we can firgure out its .
On the other hand , the biology teacher was teach us the main idea and we hade to discover and search about the information in the internet , on the books , newspaper , for instance .
So , if we understand good we will be better .

Socond , now I am working at middle school .
and I feel that when I give my students some ideas and I push them to work and to search and discover new things the result would be good .
but if I give them evry thing and they couldn ' understand the result of course would be bad .

All on all , when we teach our students how they can understand the ideas and if we help them to understand these ideas that will be help our students to learn tha facts and will improve them skills in the education .
