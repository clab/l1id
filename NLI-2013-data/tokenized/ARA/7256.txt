To have a good travel it is better to travel in agroup led by a tour guide because of many things .
First of all , whene you travel with a group of people you will have mor fun than when you travel alone .
You will not be boured and there is no way to be sad if you travel with a group .
There will be entertainment and fun activities all the way .
Second thing is when got sick there will be somone take care of you and help you .
whene you have any problems in your travel there will be somone to share with and aske for help .
The Third is traveling with a groub led by a tour gude will make the travel more orgnized and will make less problems .
For example , if you traveled with agroup and there is no tour guide and a probleme happened each person will give his own opinion with out listining to the other members and they may not agree with each other , but when there is a tour guide it will be easy to fix the problem .
He will control and give the final answer .

On the other hand , when you travel alone , there wont be fun or entertainment in your way becaus you are alon .
You will get boured very easly becaus there is no one to take with .
If you traveled alon and got sick there is nobody around you to help you .
Also , if you had a problem you wont recive any help because you are alon .

Finally , I would say that tarveleing alon is not good thing .
We shold try to have our friends or family with us .
