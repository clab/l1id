Many people have different way to travel , some people travel individually , some prefere to travel as a couple , others like to travel in a group led by a tour guide. in my opinioin I prefere to travel in a group led by a tour guide for the following reason :

first , travelling in a group is better , more secure and more organised .
When you travel in a group you do not have to worry about an thing , you pay the trip cost , you will have the trip schudle in advance , so you can organise your time .
Also lling in a group wil give you a chance to travell with your friends and you can make a lot of new friends .

second , the organization and security of your trip , suppose your trip is going to Egypt , from the begging your tour guide will be with you , stating from booking the hotel , and will organizes your trip to see e most attractive places in Egypt , such as The Pyramides , The Nile River , Sephenx The Egyptian Museum and many differnent places in the country you will visit .

third , travelling in a group led by a tour guide has many avantages ..
If we come to security , the tour guide will be responsible for your safety .
if you got sick he wll help you to get treatment if you lost your mony or your luggage he wll help ou to get them back .

lastly , travelling in a group will help you to be in touch with different people from different countries and fom different backgrounds .
where you can make a lot of new frienships which can be benificial to you in the future .

In cinclusio , travelling in a group led by a tour guide is better than traveiling as an individual for the reason I menthoined above , which include organization security ami
