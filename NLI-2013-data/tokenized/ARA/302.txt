This topic has a two way answer .
Mankind has alway 's been known to thrive above any species .
Man has always been the dominating factor in this life .
When a man is successful , he could have anything he wants .
Some people are afraid when it comes to taking risk 's , because it might jeapordise their current financial position .
Some successful people like to try new thing 's because it would be an adventure , it would be fun and it might just ` work ' .
A person should only take the risk if he feels that he is one hundred percent sure that its fool proof , by saying this word i am contradicting the word ` risk ' , which is why a person can never be too careful .

Although taking a risk may seem breath-taking , it sometimes is devestative , one small risk could send a person down in flame 's , sending him to the abyss if he is not too careful .

If i were a successful person i would like to experiment , take my chances , live life while im still alive , embrace failure as i would success .
Although disagreeing with the statement would sound more reasonable , I 'd like to agree with it , a time will come when a person is going to have to take a risk , be it a big one or a small one .
