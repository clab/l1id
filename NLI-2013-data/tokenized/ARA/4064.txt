some people said that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to help thier communities , in my opinion i think young people are more helpful for the community , and they are trying hard to sitisfy the community , but the community never belive in the young people , becuase thay still young and they do n't have enough expirence in life , but i think if you give the young people their chanse to show you what they can do , no one help the young people to improve their selfies and got more expireance .

there is alot of young people who are waiting for a job to help the community , they are a good people they look for the better thing for their community but no one give them the chanse to do it .

in my opinion the goverment and the high athority people should trasit the young people and try to help them in ther life , if these guys did n't help them who will , that 's why we all sould trasit the young people , and they are the future of the country , the will countrol the country some day , that 's why we should teach theme how they have to do this job , and it should be in the right way .

at the end i just want to say that young people diserve more than that , and they are the future of our country , so we have to belive in them , and try to help them , and lead them to the right way , to countrol the country in the best way , and the country will rais up couse of them , so we have to trasit thes young people .
