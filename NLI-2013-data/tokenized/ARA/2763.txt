well , i dont think so because old people tend to be more setteldown than young ones .
because the youngs one have to start their why from the beging for example they have to make money to live and buy a house and find a partner so they can buld up a family .
all this is a really hassel .
while aldey people have found thir life and worked har and by that time offcourse they have made alot off many to buy a nice hosue , and they maybe dont have find work , espacially it is not essy to find job these days , and everything is expensive not like it use to be for the older people , also the real estate has gown up which made it difficult for youn ones to buy a house this is also was advantages for older people .

older people use to have more kids , inorder to build up their family while youn ones cant have many there days , because not everone can offored to raise their kids .

partner , it becomes so difficult to find a nice husband or wife to live with for the rest of your lives , older people already naws who is going to stay with for the rest of his or her life , young ones do not seems to take it easy or be more understandable these days .

well , eveything seems to be the oppisate for both of old and young , but its a fact and we have to excapt it .
because at the end this is our way of living , and it might chasnge to the better or to worse .

in conclousin , i belive in evry old or young heart thir would still be a nice memory
