In my point of view `` the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
I came from Iraq and in Iraq as well as in many of other countries the wrong gudiance is the main problem I think that it is the govermants job to guide the youth for the best way to serve their community when the youg man found no attention from any one in the community in his or her problems the young person seem to run away from their life towards any place that give them that attention other that place was the street or a bad friend or any thing .

In thas case the community not just lose the person afford to build a good society but also gain a crime maybe .
and I donot want to plaim the socity for that but there is also the parents role to rise there children in the correct way to introduce a good person for the community and there is also the TV role which is a major role in the whole process and of course there is the person his or her self role every body can work to build the community the resposiblity is common between the all I have mentioned .

Now I may suggest some ways to solve the problem may be giving the new couples a course in who to brought thrir children .
and the educational system should be renew in a way to keep up with the new tecnology and the internet should be used in correct ways .
In the end I would like to see more actions take in this direction because real the youg people are the most important thing we have to rebuild our community in a desant way that the country could be respact
