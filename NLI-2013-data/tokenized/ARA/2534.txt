People face an overwhelmig number of challenges and difficulties during their lives .
And there is no specific times for the occurance of good or bad moments .
Each one is living his own and unique life , some people enjoy their childhood while the others do n't .
Therefore , we can never agree or disagree that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .

While the fact that young people are usually less responsible than older ones cannot be denied , we should never forget that some young people witness the death of his parents at early age , and find himself deprived from the care and the love of his parents .
Then , how can we claim that these young people are enjoying their lives ?

Therefore , we should independently rely on each person 's life and observe the moments of joy and sadness in order to assert whether he enjoys his life as a young more than as an old .

Besides , many people believe that a person feels much happier when he gets older because he has always waited for the moment he becomes independant from his parents and ready to strive his own path in life .
Who does n't like to be independant ?
to have his own home ?
and later on , to get married and have his own new family ?

Being hapy in life is relative .
It solely depends on the person himself .
But what matters is that we enjoy every moment of our life and benefit from the experiences and challenges we face
