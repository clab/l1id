I agree and in the same time I disagree with this statement .
It defers frome each side point of view .

Let us supposed I 'm a young guy I will agree .
Because young people can play alot of sports like football , basketball , swimming , gouging , and body bilding , but eldary people can n't .
Also thay can do dangirus sports like bongy jumbing .
And can travel for along time with out taking medisin like eldary ones .
However young people can gather with friend at late time enjoying them selfs and can sleep late unlike eldary people .

And if we look at it from old people view thay will say we can arrange our time and play sports like table tennes , cheese , monopoly and we can enjoy our time by watching T.V. vissiting friends .
They do n't need phisical motion to enjoy life .

Finaly am with youn
