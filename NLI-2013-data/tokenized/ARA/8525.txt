Less mistakes are the second reason to understand the ideas and concepts .
Less mistakes are important to have a great job to learn the fact because the fact means that the lack of mistakes .

If you have a device to improve , you should understand alll parts of this device to have less mistakes .
If you do not understand the ideas and concepts , you can not improve this device .
Also , if you improve the device without understanding the ideas and the concepts , you will have many mistakes that can be wrong for the student .

Mistakes should be less by understaning the concepts and ideas .
