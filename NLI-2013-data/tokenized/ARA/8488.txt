i partially agree with the following statment , inorder for student to understand an ideas and concepts they need to learn facts before that to get there own ideas and learn what is wrong and wright by living the scene or acting it .
any person can understand an idea if its there own idea sharing ideas that came from a fact would be extremly helpful .
i 'm a student and my opinion in how a student can get to know things and understand easily is by facts and real life stories somthing that has happened to someone or something .
If we compare a person which is highly experienced with a person that is not experienced but got taught that experience who would get more ideas and get good in it ?
obviously they lived it and felt it .
on the other hand , if ideas come from students own knoweledge it would be a great idea if they would discuss it for them to exchange and share ideas amongest eachother and may be very exciting wheras , learning facts from old histrorian books that is 100 years old would be extremly not intresting and the student would find it difficult to understand and conctrepate with others about it , more importantly facts and ideas about facts are realstic students would beleive it straight away because they may have herd it from friends or family .
ideas and concepts are not limited i can sit in a room and give many ideas as i can and give concepts all day long because an ideas is based on how a student think and what possile matter can be done so its with no limits wheras facts is somthing real and may be limited because as they say fiction cause on and on cause you create things by your imagination while the facts is based upon a real thing that a brain would believe and end of story .
furthermore , i would like to all this is important to all of us because its increasing our knowledge level but thought of something that nobody ever thought of is nearly impossible .
