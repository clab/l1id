My neighbour family had a car for all the family .
when I was visiting them last time I saw three cars in thier garage !
I really surprised and I think after twenty years they will 8 cars .
I belive that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .
I think that because of two main reasons : economic and population .

First , I think that we will have more cars for economic reason because the world is becoming a idustrial world and all of people have a higher salary than before so they will spend more money in buying cars .
As many rich stars do if they have mony , simpley they buy new cars .
It is kind of luxsuries .
Many people belive that if u have money , you have to buy a car .
Because of the money that people will have and becoming bussniss people they must have a modern and more cars than the people had .
Also , the cars factories will try to satistfy the consumers and they will produce more cars than any time .

Second , because of increasing in population , many people will need cars to do thier daily jobs and thier works .
As a result of this increasing , people try to satistfy themselves and thier family so they will buy more and more cars .
I noticed that my uncle family have five cars because their family is growing and if we imagine what will happen after twenty years , we can clearly relase that there will be more cars in the future .

If many people are trying to have a higher level for salary and the population number will growing I think we will have more cars than the number of people and the name for the next age will be `` car-person age '' .
