Progress and development in a general way was made by hardworking people who specialize themselves in a specific subject .
One question could be ask weither it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

In my opinion every one should have a minimum of knowledge in many academic subjects but sooner or later we have to choose a specific subject otherwise progress will stop or grow very slowly .

For example what would had happened if no one had studied biology specifically ?
Medecin would n't have evolved and diseases and viruses would have spread without vacccins or medecins to stop them .
We could give similar examples for transports that are progressing rapidly since the invention of the wheel people worked very hard to invent new ways of transportation ( the bycicle then the car then the plane ... )
if every one had a broad knowloedge of many academic subjects mankind would have very slightly evolved from the stoneage .
All the study 's , the researches helped the world not only in a scientifical way but even in a economical way , study 's of businesses have helped the businesses owners to know how to manage effectively their company 's on a large scale this would help a whole country 's economy and will then help the fight against poverty .

It is essential for a healthy world to understand and study specific subjects that could help us in oure lives but this does n't mean that the person that is specialised in a subject should be completely ignorant of all exept this specific subject ; like i said before we should all have a minimum of general knowledge of many academic subjects but for the sake of progress we should specialize ourselves in a specific subject .
