It 's all about the way of learning , every teacher can learn his students but not everyone can put get understandable students could imagine what did he speak about .
Learning using facts are so important cause they are easier to be understood than ideas & concepts , because it 's more realistic for any human to understand facts that happened or seen , in chemistry lecture , students take some information about cheimcal reactions , it 's effects , colors obtained , vapors & so on ..
but they will never understand what the professor means until they went to the laboratory , & do the experiment so they can see the ideas & concepts of their professor , then it 'll be easier to understand what did they took it is a fact for them , on the other hand , ideas & concepts took less time from the teacher to learn but maybe take more time from the student to memorize , it 's away from his thinking , it 'll be a kind of what called `` brain filling '' which make the students tired & easily forget it .

But not all the studies could be related with facts or we have facts with it , so ideas & concepts will be the major for those studies , in astronomy it 's hard to see everything about those away planets or stars from the earth but the ideas & concepts could work to explain things it 's maybe impossible to have facts about but it 'll not be as clear as facts but it 'll do the work .

As a chemist I think than studies related to facts could be easier to understood & harder to be forgitten in contrast with the studies depend on the ideas & concepts
