In my point of view , young teenagers and even young adults do not offer the potential they have in service of their communities .
A lot more could be done by these youngster to improve the living enviornment that they occupy .
For example volunteering at nursery homes and participating in groups concerned with the protection of the enviornemtn from pollution and other harmful factors is some of that could be for the community .
Even the smplest of cotributions could make the biggest of differences .
I f each individual takes responsibleity for their part of the job , an amazing difference will immediately arouse .
The change does n't have to be made regarding a really important aspect in the community as someone shoould always take care of the simplest things first and then move up the ladder .
However , as nobody participates even in the simplest of activities , the changes that need to be done will only accumulate over time resulting in harm for the community .

To engage one 's self in a variety of useful activities will benefit the community in two ways , both directly and indirectly .
Directly is to contribute the efforts in service needed at the community .
Moreover , to be personally active most of the time , an individual learns to be productinve and useful with the time that they have .
In return these activities actually teach these youngsters time mamgement and productivity .
This in istelf greatly benfits the community as these youngsters will be the future adults with great skills that could be helpful and useful to their community .
These activities teach important working skills that the community is need of in an indirect manner .

In conclusion , once again I believe that young people these days do n't give enough time helping their cmmunities .
However , if this is done great resuls will emerge .
