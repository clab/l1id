I agree with the statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
Regardless of the field that a student is enrolled in , the main purpose behind the academic experience is for students to learn .
Learning comes through understanding logically the laws and concepts associated with any topic .
The difference between an idea and a fact is that ideas have to be explained , illustrated and understood .
Facts on the other hand have to be accepted because regardless of a person 's opinion , a fact is a real solid statement .
However , helping the student understand ideas and laws will make the acceptance and endoulgment of facts a much easier process .
For example , when learning about human existance , it is a common well acknowledged fact that death is the end of any human .
To help accept this fact , students learn from spirtual , religious and philisophical teachings the different explinations of creation , the reason behind life , the purpose of existance and the concept of after life .
Once a student truly understands these ideas and concepts and develops an explenation that meets his vision in life , it becomes much easier for him to accept the different facts related to human existance .
Nonetheless , stating that the understanding ideas is more important than learning facts in not to take away from the importance of learning different facts .
It is simply an arrangement of priorities .

A developed understanding of ideas and concepts will help in accepting facts , and once those facts are accepted individuals start to develope opinions related to those facts .
That is why it is highly important to learn different facts since it increases the student 's level of knowledge and awarness about the studied topic and helps in shaping his individuality be developing his personal opinions .
