Advertisemnts have been known as the sole source for people to know about products ; therefore , many people tend to believe all what they hear in media means .
Many advertisment companies promote thier products perfectly and fictionally than they really are ; therefore , I agree with this statement .
My points of veiw is that those companies wants to increase thier profits and to compete othe competetors .

First , Many advertisment companies make products much better than they really are in order to increase their profits .
Greediness plays a part in this problem .
As the people get monery this guality terrifingly increase along with it .
They try to use every means to increase thier profits at the end of the years .
What those people do is exploiting people needs of a cheap products by decresing the quality and the costs of thier products , and to crow all this , they promote their products in media .
As a resulte , people rush to the supermarkets after hearing the ad without thinking .
Last years , for example , I saw an ad about shampoo that make the hair nicer .
I was so surprised with its price and did not noticed that it was bad for the hair .
As I used that shapoo , my hair started to fall down and had to rush to my doctor to help me in this .

In addtion to the increase of thier profits , Some advertisment companies make products much better than they really are in order to compete other companies .
In this vicious world of business , any means whether it is legil or not is valid .
Those companies ' aim is competeing others even if that means exploiting people needs .
What they want is be the pioneer and first in everythings .
As a resultes , they add many untrue information about thier products in order to convince the buyer to purchase from them and not from other companies .
When you open a T.V. you will see what I mean .
Ads are all over the channels .
Thouthands od them about a particluar products that it is hard to choose from .
those ads provide information that do not make any sense or are not persuasive .
I saw a an ad about a car , saying that when you ride in it you will feel that you are flying .
So I went to thatcar shop and tried it , thier seats were like a stone .
Then I knew that thier advertisemnet was fake and untrue .

Gaining more profits and competing other companies are reasons which allowed many companies to exploit people need for better and cheaper products .
Govermants should enforece or emphizis their roles in this byy stricts those advertisments and pass an regulation that punish any company which try to mislead people .
For the above reasons , I agree that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
