Life is fun as long as we are young !

In most family contexts , children until the age of 18 do n't have heavy responsabilities .
All they questioned about is school , health care and family help .
In the other hand , parents ( older people ) undergo all the family 's responsability .
Ensuring feeding , clouthing , housing and so on , they do n't have at most times any mood for fun .

Childhood is the period where kids have to learn , to grow saffely and particularly to enjoy life .
They do n't have to care about any of the life difficulties such as bringing food to the family , housing and security .
Instead , they are aload to play as much as they want , to get gifts from all the relatives and to learn what they enjoy the most besidse abligatory school .
This time period gives to children the opprtunity to be free from all life problems , so thats how they enjoy most of life moments .

Assuming that the older people discussed are parents , they are the personnes who have to give the youngers the opportunity to have fun .
Being at work all day long , most parents see their jobs as a responsability and not as a source of fun .
Even if they can enjoy spending time with there colleags , there only one purpose is to be paied so that they can affoard to make joy at home .
In addition to all that , a grown up person start to have a citizen obligations .
Olde people have to vote , to participate in the country activities and particularly stop having the right to make big mistakes .

All in all , young people do have time to enjoy life more than older people for the most important reason , the lack of responsability thye have .
At the time whene they start thinking about there feeling and purposes in life , they start to have less time to have fun especially once they make their families .
