Knowledge is something that people have to have in order to have any academic career .
Whether or not it is for one subject , knowledge is vital in order to make people aware and ready to make any career developments .

In my oppinion , I think that specialising in one certain area , would mean that people can focus on one subject only , and that would provide more time for people to spend improving that subject and therfore makes him an expert .

However , it can be a dangerous way to head to , because there are some issues that needs to be thought of .
For example , in the future people may think that the career path that they have chosen is not what they want to contniue doing , that would mean that they will have to start over again , and study everything from the start .
This can be very frustrating and overwhelming because it would mean that they would have to put a ` pause ' in their lives for the moment to try focus on other subjects .

Having a variety of academic subjects gives a person a wider range of jobs and even a better qualification because it means that a person has studied more than one subject and is capable of handling responsibilities .

In the end , every one should think of their lives and if studying more than one subject will mean that they will not be capable of handling many things at once then they should focus on one subject without regrets , but if I was to make a choice , I would prefer to have more than one academic subject to study because it would open more doors in the future and would make me feel proud of what I have achieved and I would have many job offers to chose from and I would also benifit from that because I would choose the carrer that most suites me .
