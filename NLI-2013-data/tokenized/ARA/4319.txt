I personally diagree with the statement that says that young people do not give enough time to their communities .
I disagree with it because it is a very general statment and it is a typical stereotype and categorizing of young people .
In addition to that the statment is a non credible statement because it is abviouly based on personal opinion rather than on facts , since it is not supported by statistics or any menaingfull numbers .

The statment carries alot of hidden meaning or even insults to young people because it pictures them as selfish people who does n't care about their community .
Not only that but it also indirectly indicates that young people are irresponsible people who do not positively contribut in their communities , and are not active/usefull members of their own community .

In addition to that , the statment that has been made against young people is a very general statment , since not all young people do not give enough time to their communities .
There are some young people who are addicted to charity work , and who dedicates a lot of their time in helping improve their community and in helping others .
Thus we ca n't generalize .

I also disagree with such a statement because i personally think that it is a weak statment becaue it is not supported by any kind of eveidence such as a survey , statistics , or any meaning full numbers .
To me this statement is just like throwing accusasions on others .

such statments are not acceptable to me not only because i disagree witth this particular statment but because if i accepted such stereotypes it means that i might as well accept other stereotypes .
And by doing that i 'll be encouraging stereotypes that might be more serious or even dangerous and that might seriouly affcet our society , community , or even the way or even the quality of our living .
