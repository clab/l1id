In life knowledge nowadays is one of the most important aspects in life that can lead you to a bright future and a successful life and can make you posses a high degree status in the country you are living in.knowledge or learning is never limited in other words the more you learn the easier and faster you achieve your goals and lead yourself to a brighter pathway of life !

For a person to be successful he has to have a high potential and the wanting to learn more and try new things and take risks .
doing mistakes does not mean that you are not successful in life but means that you are recieving more information and new kinds of experiences that may be helpful to you in mant ways !
successful poeple are also the poeple who learn from their mistakes .

Lets say if a person graduated from college and has an efficient amount of information to apply for a job and he is working right now , this person will discover that he needs to develop himself or herself more to actually coop with the outside world that is developing economically and technically at a very high rate that a person can not stay on the same level of information and wil feel that they are in need to try new things and recieve new kinds of information .

In my opinion i think every person should have the ability of wanting to know more and to keep in mind that the only way of succeeding and have a bright future is to learn more and educate yourself more by travelling and by reading a wide range of books of all kinds of topics .
In this way you will get to learn more about what is going on around you and will introduce you to the various kinds of cultures and ways of life which will lead you to knowing new poeple of different tradition and culture .
