In my perspective , I believe that the number of cars will be reduced in twenty years from today .

At first , the petrolleum crisis will affect directly on the production of cars .
because it has been estimated that the world will run out of petrolleum in twenty years from now .
That 's why the world have to find another source of energy instead .
Recently , the scientist have invented a car which run on the Hydrogenic Energy .
However , it 's not as efficient as the petrolleum , also they found it more expensive than the petrolleum .

Secondly , the environmental crisis that the cars made from its exhausts .
the environmental associations will not be satisfied about what 's happening .
They will force cars manufactures to reduce there production of cars in reason of what environmental threats caused by cars exhausts .

Furthermore , I think that the Mechanical energy will be the most common after twenty years from now .
It 's not that worthy for ordinary people , and it will be common used instead of cars .

Thus , that 's why I am totally agree with the statement that says : `` In Twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ''
