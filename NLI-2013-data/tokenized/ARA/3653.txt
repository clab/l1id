In fact , there are great changes of our life nowadays , and the style of life is very fast than before .
Most of the young people are busy about their future in this type of life and have not enough time to help their communities because they care about themselves only and sometimes because of the lack of their schedulest of young people are struggling to reach to high positions in their career and to increase their salaries .
Concerning their dreams to reach to high position in the job , the person exerts his best effort by any ways to achieve his goal to be for example , the manager of the company , so he seeks for himself not for his community .
Second thing , young peoples are caring about is to gain money as much as they can to be a rich man in ashort time , that can be through more than one job to save more money or by travelling abroad to gain more money , so the main aim of the young people is themselves only high position and much money , and their communities are not in their minds .

In addition to the previous reason , the young people have not enough time to serve their communities is the inability of the young people to arrange their times through a schedule or by following the concept of priority .
Regarding the schedule , If the person put aschedule everyday about the duties , he will do , I think he can find enough time to help his community through helping the poor people , give some training lessons to children .
Second thing , which is very important to the young people is to put in their minds the priority to give some time for his community by many ways to hel the community to solve its problems .
The young peoples , besides their dreams , they should give sometime to their community .

In summary , the young peoples have not enough time to help their communities due to their interesting only about their dreams to high rank and more money , and otherthing , they have not the ability to arrange the time and their societies ias away from their minds .
