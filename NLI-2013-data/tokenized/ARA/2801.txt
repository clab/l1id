It is commonly known that young people do enjoy life more than older people do .
That is , in other words , age can sometimes be a hinderance towards living life to its fullest , and of course enjoying it to very far extents and dimensions .
Nevertheless , i personnaly do not support and agree with this statement simply because modern soceity lifestyle is not tied to age , old people do have more experience in life than younger people , and the spirit never gets old even the body does .

As a matter of fact , modern societies and modern lifestyles do not impose any age considerations as far as their activities are concerned .
That is to say , old people can always do what is done by young people without being under the spotlight and focus , and no one finds it strange and odd when he finds them doing such avtivities .
As an example , an old person can go and have a concert with his girl friend or wife till down without being someone exceptional .
So , our open soceity leaves all the doors opened in the face of all persons , whatever their age is .

Secondly , I do think that old people 's experiences in life does back them up in enjoying their life ti its fullest in the sense that it allows them to have a good knowledge of how life can be lived and enjoyed more than young people .
The difference between young and old people would be quite obvious if a comparison on how both parts enjoy their holidays is to be made .

Thirdly , I do believe that human bodies do get old under the influence of time passage .
But , what I think is impossible is that their spirits get old too .
To be more specefic and concise , an old 's person body usually and most of the time carries inside it a spirit that is not old .
The point I want to emphasize here is that human spirits never ever get old .

Last and by no means least ,
