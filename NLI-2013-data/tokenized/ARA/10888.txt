The world is in permanent change and evolution therefore we should follow this evoluion in order to improve our life and knowledge .
So there are some people who try new things and take risks rather than keeping the old methods even if they know very well how to use it .

Personally i like to be different from the others , so i use all the time new techniques and methods .
This new way to do is very important because it could be a source of success .
To illustrate more what i am saying i have an example ; last year i had my training at a small company exactly in the financial departement .
What i discovered during my presence , at that firm , is that the financial staff does not use the technology in order to improve the quality of the work .
They do not have a computer , imagine a company now in 2000s years and it does not have a computer .
This causes a lot of problems to the company especially in analysing the daily situation of the company .
so what i did is that i talked to my boss in order to buy some computers because they will improve the work and he will need less people .
after a very long discussion he accepted to buy just one computer at the begining in order to test what i said .
after one week he told me that his staff is very satisfied and they have now more time to do other important things rather then calculating some small operations .

but if you decide to work with news things you should accept to take risks but i think that is a very logical result .
because you will use new methods and maybe new procedures that are not all the time good .
so to solve this problem , i think that rsiks represent a part of our life especially if you decided to try things differently .
but you should remember that when you take a lot risks you will win more .
to illustrate that , i will tell you an example based especially on my life as a would a bussiness woman .
when i invest more money at any project automatically i think about the risk that i run .
because it will be as hudge as the imprtance of the money i invetsed .

so to sum up i want to say that i agree with the statement simply because new methods and risks are a part of my professionnel life .
