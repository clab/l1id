I agree with this statment , becuase noadays young people are occupied or distract by other thing for example vidoe games .
dating girls , the internet , movies , concerts the list goes on and on .

Young people today are not that interested in thier communities all they are interested in is fun stuff thing that are not complicated or stressing , they think becuase they are young they have the rest of their lives to worry about the commuinty , yong people like the fact that they should n't care about their community when they are young .

Thier perents are the blame becuase they are most of the time telling them that stuff in the commuinty doesnot concern them .
firstly young people these days think it is okay not to care about their community and that they shouldnot be more involved becuase they are not mature enough or have n't experieced life long enough , or the fact that their opiniuon is not vaild becuase they are not old enough .

Secondly their perents should engourage them to be more involved and not to pay alot of that attention to movies or girls , that attention should be directed in a more useful way that they should use all the knowledge they have to help and improve thier community .

Their perents send them to school to learn and get a good education for them to leaders and help and improve countries and commuinties .
they should n't waste that on thing that are not useful or helpful in any way .

finally i would like to encourage the young people of today to study hard and be more involved with your community and use all the knowlgde they got and put it to good use and help their commuinty .
