Speacializing in one specific subject , is much more effective than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
In the early years there were n't lots of scientists and doctors .
If i was at that time i would have chosen to have a broad knowledge opposing to have one specific subject to spealize in .

yet , these days education is improving and there is competion between people .
Therefore , i would rather speacialize in one area inorder to ` shine ' and be known for my uniqeness in this area .

In the past years there would be one doctor whom you went to , it didnt matter what you were feeling , whether it was a pain in your stomache or or a problem with your eye sight you still went to ` the doctor ' .
Nowadays , doctors are more an more speacialized .
Even pediatritions are now more speacilized where each doctor is concerned about one part of the human body .

Furthermore , have a look at teachers .
in primay school we usually had a class teacher which taught us all subjects .
English , Math , Science and the rest of the subjects .
yet , when we moved to high school we started realizing that teachers were to a greater sense more speacalized , we had a teacher for each subject .
Not only that but take Science as an example , not only did we have a teacher for science , but we had a different teacher for Physics , Biology and Chemistry .

Moving on to university we start choosing our major .
Take buisness for example .
You speacilize in major and you find the different smaller topic in buisness , which shows you how speacilized it is .
What i am trying to prove here , is that this decsion is already made , no one is able to take lots of subjects and not speaclize in one major .
You only have the opportuinty to choose one major , and sometimes you are able to choose a double major , since some subjects are related to each other , like business and accounting .

By speacilizing in one subject , you find it easier to find a job after university , and when you start working its motivating and self - fullfilling to feel that you know your major well , and this makes you like your job and appreciate it .
This is why it is very important to choose your major carefully , since this will be the subject you will speacilize in and live with .
It is possible to change your career but i feel its a shame to waste all these years of studying and start from the beginning
