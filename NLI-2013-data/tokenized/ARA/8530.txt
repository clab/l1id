I agree at It is more important for students to understand ideas and cocepts than it is for them to learn facts .
First , when stundents understand the ideas and concepts , I think they then learn the facts easily .
the undersatnd ideas and the concepts help students learn informations about the many subjects and acccept good education form information the have .

Second .
I think understand ieads and concepts make the student are opened mind to acccept new ieads or researshs may come in the future .
and I thin also the important to student to understnad ideas and concepts to encourage them to look for more information n the future .

Third , understand ideas and the concepts let student accept and disscus any issue may they would face them and dealing with any new ideas by carefull and responsibility also understand ideas and concepts make the eager for make their ideas and their concepts Forth , I think the understand ideas and concepts give confident for students for themselves because they have a lot of ideas and concepts about various thins and the maybe help them to going in the life and make their own working .
