I agree with the statement that says , most advertisements make products seemmuch better than they really are .
For several reasons this statement is true .
For example , advertisements show only the good part of a product , and their only concern is to sell the product to the consumer no matter what suits him .

Advertisements only show how the product is great and wounderfull , and they even show it in a way that makes it look different .
Let us take a children 's gum or a lolypop for instance , in advertisments you can see two or more children grabing one of those sweets , and when they try it , their appearance and the whole world changes around them and all of it becomes like a sweet dream .
Now , what kind of messege would an advertisement give to a child ?
The answer is clear when you just take a look at a child in sweets section in any super market .
Those children who will try the dreamy product will feel that they wear tricked , simply because they will remain in their same spot with a normal taest .

Advetisements do care only about gitting bought regardless of wheather they suits the buyer or not .
Let us take clothes for instance , in advertisements you can see people from different ages wearing tha same styile and the same colors and the same fit .
Now , what would such an advertiement make people think is alright ?
The answer is also clear from what you can see in the streets of poeple wearing things that are not appropriate for thier ages .

In conclusion , I agree that most advertismen
