I think each age has its plasure times and memories .
during the childhood , teens years , young people & old

During childhood you have the chance to do anything and no one will say why ?
they will say he is trying to learn , let him try it so he will know what is it like drink a hot cup of tea he will cray becouse he did not know its hot , what is hot ?
so next time he will avoid it and when he cray his Mom and Dad will run to him and huge him .
He will have all the interisting .
He will buy toys , games and tudybears .
He will sleep with his mother and father .

Teens and yong people usully have the most good times they enjoy the most becose they will start to under stand everything , try everything if they have the corige ( brave heart ) for the bunji jumping , scopa diving , have alots of frineds , join a collage , drive the cars , lots and lots of enteristing things which old people can do it but not like young people .
old people spicelly when they retier they like to go in a croze or in a trip around the world , but the acttivities that they will had are not the same of the youngs .
Young people have cornucopia of fun , experiens , friends .
the butiy being old is to see your son or dughetr having a buby , to see his smill , to see your old wife/husben beside you smileing to you graping your hand .

I think young people have a wild life but when they become old they have lots of love .
The most important is to know how to live each period correctly .

Enjoy each second becose ya each second you will lose are aint gonna come back .
good bless every one
