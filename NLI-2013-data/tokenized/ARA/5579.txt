Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
in fact , all over the world use this process .
Here in my native country Lebanon , they show the product as a super thing and in fact , it is much less than it appears .

first of all , i see wherever i go advertisements that make the products very good , and when i go to buy or see it , i find all the time that it is fake .
The owner of the product always exagerates in the advertisements to attract the people .
For example , i bought once a bike on the internet , the bike looked very nice and big and when they delivered it to me i found that it is a small and ugly bike .
From every experience , i learn something till i found in the end that u cannot trust any advertisement and u have to see the product in front of you before you buy it .

Furthermore , the product owners have to compete with each others , because there are a lot of factories that offer the same product .
Also , the advertisement for the products have to look good to attract the eye .
For example , once i saw different advertisements for the same product and one of them was really good and attractive , so i decided to go to the shop that made this advertisement and buy from it .
Therefore the advertisement have to be good and the products should look much better than they really are to attract the buyer like they attracted me .

In conclusion , the marketing for the product is very important , and the advertisement should be attractive .
Therefore , the products seem much better than they really are .
In addition to that , the buyer have to be mature enough to differentiate between products to buy the right thing .
