Although trying new things , and doing what the man already know are uselful ways in dealing with different situations in life .
But trying new things is a wiser choice i go with , because it opens new windows and gives a new solutions , trying new things and taking the risk in some situations can also make a big difference in the decision taker 's life , furthermore , taking the risk and trying a new thing is important when the man stuck facing a new problem he never had been through before .

Opening a new windows while trying to find a solution is such a relife from pains caused by prolonged thinking , because taking the pain away clears the mind .
When someone stops at a point in his life that needs a real brave decision he cant just look behind to search for an old situation or advice , it can make a difference .

While people consider taking new decisions a risk , i consider it as the opportunity that never came to anybody else and it is some times gives more that the man expects .

On the other hand , doing what the man used to do , or doing what the comunity likes to do is to some extent safe , also its considered the area of experience , the things that u know how to do well .

If no one of us tried to take the risk once in his life there would be no steps taken forward , everyone will remain in the same place after a year or ten years .

Therefore , i agree when they say that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , because taking risks opens a new windows , find a new solutions , gives a new experience , and changes the man 's life .
