i agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , but there are a lot of people do not like to go with group because of they like to have their time alone .
for me i agree to travel with alot of people , it will be fun .
and the best things i like when i travel with a group are if need any help the will help you , you will make friends and you will have fun .

first , if you need any help you will get it because who are travel with you and you like a big family .
if you lost your money , got sick and if you want to chating with someone , will find what you want and will get what you , they will not live you alone because you one of them .

second , making friends is the best thing in travel withh a group .
it verey easy to make friends in the tripe .
if you a nice person and friendly .
and you will learn a lot of thing from them such as their culture , some of the way they used , or something important in the life you do not any idea about it .

third , having fun , of coures you will have a lot of fun with your group .
you play with them and listen to their stories , and something like that .

finally , having a trip with a group is really fun and every one has to try to travel with a group .
