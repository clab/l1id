Let me tell you somthinges about successful people who most of them are rich .
But we have the wrong idea about them because we think that they are looking for poor people from up to down while most of them are just ordinary people .
They do the same thinges that we do they eat in normal restruents , wear normal clothes , drive an middle class car , that what I had seen two weekes ago in the T.V with proffessor willium who said that `` presption defferent from reality '' .
Some people asked do successful people try new thinges ?
or they taking the risks rather than doning doning things normally ?

The blief that successful people are what we think that they are not modist and use poor people for their benfits without thinking about their life or their family realy most of time is wrong as I mentioned in the first paragraph about `` wrong preciptions '' .
Also , most of those people think that successful people do not take the risks or do the thinges in different way .
While , successful people said that they are like to take the risks to make their life so exciting and give it the flaver of dangerous which what they say keeps them work for the best .
Morover , they said that they always likes doning thinges in adifferent way so that they discover new tinges even if it is effected on their life carrer by making their life upside down .
However , some of them prefer to do not take the risks and walk on a lighted way rather than dark way that maybe they would face pumbes in their way destroy them or sent them to emergancy .

Allover , there are different kind of successful people in their thinking .
One of them who chose the easy way and others who chose the dark way because it excited them .
Well , my openion is that life without dark way have no excited places but who chose way have to know the keys of it not waiting for the next pump .
