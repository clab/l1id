In my opinion , in the near future less cars will be used compared to what is used today .
Several reasons can contribute to having this opinion .
I think the technological advances that are going on in othe transportation vehicles will decrease the number of cars being used .
For example .
Trains in Japan and Germany are becoming very fast and I think in the futute they will compensate for the time it takes to reach to the train stations .

Goverments will announce new laws prohibiting a single person to use a car .
Already in certain cities , only cars with more than one passenger are allowed to use the fastest lane .
This , to encourage people to travel in groups .
The reasonable development of such laws is that statement mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph .

Home will be the center of all activities is another reason I would like to mention .
Nowadays , many people work at home .
All the needed entertainment can become available at home .
Morever , food , from restaurants and grocery shops , is being delivered up to your door .

Car models are becoming very similar in appearance and options .
A very good example is the Honda Accord and Hyundi Sonata , it is hard to differentiate between them form outside .
At the end , this will lead to only one company selling cars .
Cars will have less appeal to rich people and they will stop buying cars and start buying hovercraft vehicles or any other transporation devices .

In conclusion , cars will become dispensible as less cars will be in use .
Hopefully , instant travel , which we read about in science fiction novels , will be invented in the next twenty years .
