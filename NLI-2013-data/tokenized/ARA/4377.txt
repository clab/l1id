Do you know that 82 % of the young people nowdays do not share and help their communities .
This belongs to many reasons : They do not have a time for that , they have some dreams and projects that they want to do , and they must have a time for themselves to have fun or have a rest .

First , young people specially the students do not have atime for this works .
They have homeworks to do and quis to prepare .
Also they must work to earn some cash that will help themto live .

Second , they have some dreams that they must work for it or project that they trying to finish it .

In addision , they must have their own time to have fun or visit friends or joining parties with family , specially on the weekends , the only time that they can help community on them .

In conclude , take note that most of the teenagers prefer to have their time alone with out sharing it with any else .
Most of them do not prefer to help others and I think this up to them .
Surly helping people specially the who needs to help is a good thing but I am sure that there is many blocks that well not help them to do this great porpoese .
