Young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I would agree with this statement .
When you go to big city you would see this , that everyone mindess his own business .
The poor guidness youth have these days will keep them away from there community .

Where you live always explains alot about who you are .
People from the city tend to have a stuck up attuide and minding there own business .
Say your from a city and someone has a flat tire next to your house .
There will be a very little chance that he might come and help you .
Which will be the oppoiste in a little town where people are more connected togther .

Finding a good leader or teacher to guide young people is hard thing these days .
Who will get them on the right track .
Who will tell them thats wrong and thats right .
Also teach them how to respect others and how to respect life .
If you look closley to youth in cities you would no notice that most of them have no respect for older people .
Also a very high number of them are on drugs and alchole .
Which plays a big role in keeping them away from there communites .

In conclusion , todays ways of living has a big impact on young people way of thinking and being in touch with people .
Also the dark road of drugs and alchole have another reason way young people stay away .
