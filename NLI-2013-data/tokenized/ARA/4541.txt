First of all .
I agree with `` most advertisements make products seem much better than thy really are. '' because If I have company then I make some advertisments for some products .
And I show them in the TV for the people , also I show them in the streets , but I shwo them in a bad way .
I mean they were seem bad or ugly .
Then nobady going to by anything from my commpny .
they going to put ex on it ( all the people goning to heat it ) .

Any way any one wants to make an advertisements have to show them seem gret way .
To attreact people to that kind of product wich mide the advertisements for it .

Here is the example for two people mide two advertisments for two diffrent kinds of bayby milk .
The first ont showed the bayby milk with darty stuff and with sick child .
Also the pearson showed that advertisment with bad music .
The second one showed the bayby milk with clean stuff and with cutte bayby .
Also with nice music .
Now here is the bottom line .
The people who wictched the two advertisements , wich kind of milk they are going to buy ? .
Difnlay the second one , because it has really great stuff and really great way to ahwo the bayby milk .

That even in other products .
itis depend how the product showing .
and wht the gifts come with it .
Also if it has good offer or not .
I mean it is depend how is the product shwoing .

That was my opinion if I agree or disagree with `` most advertisments make products seem much better than the really are . ''
And igreed with that .
