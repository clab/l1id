I Agree , it is a general trend nowadays , that many young people leave their own countries in order to find new opportunities .
Young generation tend to spend time on computers or finding new things around their living palces as well as getting more educatoion is seemed more important for them thatn inlvolving in helping family or even spending few times with communities .

We have other problems facing young people that is drugs and being victims of sex and other time wasted activites , where all end up in not using the wright time to develop their selves and to help the people around them .

On the other hand , we find that young people are having sort of unstable lives due to some family problems such parents divorce or family break-up .

Another thing , which can explain why young people not doing so is that communities are not repsenting one structure they lack things like real values , communitites nowadays are calling for political engagement and racism issues and not promoting for reall values and building societies around them .

Young people often complain about the military tasks given the governments to do at their early lives , where this service is not considered as a communial or social service performed certain youn people .

There is a lack of educating the young people about the value they may have to serve the communities and have the best of services towards them , it is very important at shcool level to educated young generations to know the importance of communities services and its impacts withing the society and even the outcomes of it on their families to have better life and understand the communial work where it can get results on the country .

If we follow all these steps to bring back young people on track , we certainly have achieved our objectives and we would see many young people working in their communities and be an example to others and their children how they worked and served their communities , so all the socity will praise them for their great achievment
