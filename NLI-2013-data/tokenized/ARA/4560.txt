Making advertisements is important to sell products .
Most advertisements make products mutch better than they really are .
I strongly agree with this and it is true for many reasons .

One reason is it is better idea to sell their products easlly .
If they do not do that , they wo n't find customers as they want .
For example , when Coka Cola company wants to make an advertisment , they try to show for the audiuness that Coka Cola is the best drink in the world by making the advertisment like fantesy .
In addition , some companies try to bring an famous actor or actress to attract the audiuness .
However , they make some of the advertisments sexy .
For example , when shampoo product company want to make advertisment , they bring usually a sexy girl with sexy design and long soft hair .
Why ?
Becasue when the do that , some audiuness belive that when they use this shampoo , they will be like the girl .
They thought becasue of the shampoo , the girl is sexy and has a nice hair .
Forthermore , let 's look at resturants ' advertisment espically fast food .
McDonaldes company makes their advertisment with that clown to attract the children .
However , they make the show fast as their fast mail to tell the customers that our mail is the fastes mails in the world .

Another reason is without better advertisments means no customers .
If they do not do nice and parefect ads they wo n't see coustomers which cause problems in that company .
For example , there is a new resurant and no body knows that resturent .
How the people will now without ads ?

In closing , ads are important for the products which bring a lot of customers .
Company without ads , can not be company .
So the way of attract the audiuness is the ads .
