The scince world has no limits .
Every day we explore some new things in this world .
The human mind and the ability to imagin and to creat have no limits .
So that I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts , because of several reason like , they may add some new ideas to it , they may explore that the ftacts that we have are wrong , they can leran more about the subject if look by theirself .

First , when the student understnad the idea he may add some new ideas to it .
Adding new information can come only if the student start to think in the problem the without knowing that there were some people before him thought about it .
If the student did not know about the facts , he maybe invent some new ideas that can be write .

Second , the student can shows that the facts that we have now are wrong .
Many times in the past some beginners people shows that the facts that they had were wrong .
The facts that we have now were made by a humanes and every humane can do some mistakes .
The people who made this fact were in some parts of their lives students like us now , so there is no differents betwen us and the people who made taht facts .

Third , if the student start to leran about the subject by his own , he will learn much better more than just leran the facts .
Ignoring the facts can be very helpful for the student because he will start to think using his mind not the facts .
Using the facts is killing the ability to creat a new facts , because the student is going to use the facts without think if they were right or not .

Finally , according to I wrote above , I belive that understanding the ideas is more important for the student than it is for them fo learn facts .
It is really helpful for the student because I tried it once and it really wroks .
