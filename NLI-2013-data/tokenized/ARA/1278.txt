I think that to have one specfic specialize is better than have many academic subjects .
One specialize is more good , because the person will focus on one specialize , but the which will have many his effort will divided and not consantrated well .

People who is having one major specialize are more creative in his job or major , he will give all his time to develope his career , however he can have time to learn more new things , especially we are living in a hurry sciety which every day the science discovering more and more things to help people , so the people who having main major they oportunity to be be familiar with this new sceince whih related to his major , otherwise the person who have different specialize he cannot hang over all this progress .

During our education in universities we were studying all materials like phisecs math biology chemistry and other , even person need to graduate an engineer he should study economics history etc.but in the end he should study the main material for his specialized , also it is good to have knowledge from every thing this also helpful after education in society that if you have been in any society you can share your opinion with the other .
to conclude in practice life and work should have only one specefic
