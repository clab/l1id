Some people look at the period as a period of self assessment and a way for exploration of what life is truely about .
They think of this period as a journey of finding one 's inner peace and getting tuned with mother nature and the universe as a whole .
It 's pretty much a rest after a long path of building one 's self .
On the other hand they see youth as the time of hard work and achievements .
The true time of knowing who you truely are .

Old people enjoy life more than young people because they have the time .
It 's well known that when you are young you do n't have the chance to get all the fun because there is always school , university , or even the deadline of a work delivery .
You could have some fun but it is always restricted to the time that is not in the hands of the young .
Old people donot have the duties of the young so they tend to search for the things they dreamt as youth to do one day .

Another issue is the money .
After a long time of building and working to achieve the best , what could be more rewarding than lying on the beach with no concerns what so ever .
This could only be possible if someone had the financial ability to do so .
In one 's fresh years that is not possible unless supported by the parents which is not likely to be done but it 's possible for the seniors who struggled earlier to do so .

Looking from the other prespective , youmg people may enjoy their life more because the simply have the energy for it .
Old people may have the time and the money but they may suffer some illnesses that prohibit them from enjoying their life .

`` Old or young it 's all about the spirit '' , that is what the famous British novelist Tomas Jakob said .
when you have the youth spirit in you , you could always have the best of life .
Believing that life is worth living is the key of living and enjoying life .
