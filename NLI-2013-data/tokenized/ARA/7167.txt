Transportation nowadays is one of life 's fundemental necessities .
There are different types of it , such trasnprtation on land , sea and air .
Technology , in this matter , is highly important and plays a big role in the usage of cars in the comming years .
It is a big part of its improvement and development .

As years pass by , the poupulation grows further .
Therefore , this results of a growing automobiles usage in our daily life .
Cosidiring this fact , in my point of view , the use of cars is going to increace day after another .
Cars are one the most used ways of transportation .
And it happens that it is the least expensive as well .
Alot of people look at it as the easiest way to travel and move around with .

On the other hand , some people think that the technology is going to develop and the use of cars is going to decreace in the upcoming years .
This might be true .
In the many years to come , other kinds of transportation might be invented .
They could be more convient to use than the kinds we already have now .

People have different hobbies and interests .
Some of those people find that collecting cars , for example , is something interesting and fun to do .
So if it happens that sometimes in the future , in twenty years from now to be more precise , will be fewer cars in use than there are today , there will be some people that will not let go of them that easily .
Because in their oppinion cars are still the best way to move here and there .

In conclusion , twenty years from now is a short period of time , car industery is not going to simply fade away nor vanish .
It is going to stay for a bit longer time than people expect .
