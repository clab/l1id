I disagree because traviling with a group led by a tour guide is a

bad idea for my thinking .

First when someone is travilng with a group led by a tour guide , it

makes him or her being controlled , so he or she ca n't have the ability to move freelly .
For example , if someone needs to go to the

restroom , every one should wite for that person until he or she

finishes .
And also if someone does n't like the place or has been to

the place that group are going to , he or she should go with the group .

The second reason is that travilng with a group could be

unhealthy in someone 's health .
When someone travels with a group ,

he or she may have healthy problems that could transfear to

someone in the group .
For example , if someone has Inflo , it can

transfear ( go ) to someone in the group easlly .

The third reason that when someone is traviling with a group the

travel based on a plan .
When a group travels , it has a ready plan .
So , when

someone wants to change his mind about a place , he ca n't change

the plan he should go with the plan or leave the group after paying

some money .
For example , if someone changes his mind about

visitng a musume with the group , he ca n't change the plan from

visiting the musume to visit the zoo .
So he should go with the group

by rhe plan or leave the group after paying some money .

All in all , as you see , traviling with a group is a bad idea because

of the ability of moving , the health and changing the mind .
I think

when someone wants to travel , he or she should go by themselvs .
