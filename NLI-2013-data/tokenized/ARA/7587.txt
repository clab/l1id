The issue of whether or not to travel in a group led by a tour guide is controversial .
Some people think that a guide is important to lead them to the most popular places .
Others believe they can travel by themselves without the help of a guide .
In fact , I agree that people do n't really need to travel in groups led by tour guides due to two basic reasons .

Cearly , traveling in a group led by a tour guide impose many restrictions .
Everybody need to be prompt .
In case of an emergency or lateness , people might lose one whole day becasue the guide wo n't be waiting for them .
They need to manage themselves usually staying in the hotel watching television .
This might cause alot of inconvenience , such as getting bored .
Instead , people traveling without being restricted by a group , can take their time to do what they want .
For example , they will take the needed time to sleep and rest .
Furthermore , they would have the option of changing their destination whenever they want .
For intance , if they planned on going to Disney Land then knew about another place , they wo n't hesitate a minute to change their plan .

Truely , the tour guide will have greater knowledge about the most tourist visited places .
This does n't mean that people traveling alone do n't know where they 're going .
There are many resources available to people , where they know the wonderful places in a specific country .
For instance , people can surfe the internet or visit agencies .
These places provide almost all what is needed to know .

Evidently , people traveling in groups face many problems that leads to vacation ruining .
On the other hand , traveling alone does n't mean being lost .
Yet , It means having more relaxation , time and opinions .
