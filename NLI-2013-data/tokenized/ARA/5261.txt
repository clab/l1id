The author is arguing that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I agree with the author point of view .
The number of advertisements has increased .
While watching a TV show , a person will have an interupting advertisement period in the TV .
In addition , most newspapers have specified a number of pages for products advertisements .
This huge number of advertisement has affected our thinking about different products .

Companies spends millions of dollars to create convincing advertisements .
This spending is considered part of the marketing stratigies .
It is well believed that the more advertisement there is for a product , the more it is sold .
The millions of dollars that are spent on advertisement is considered only a small amount of money in big companies such as Pizza Hut .

However , these companies do not care if they have to lie in presenting accurate information about their products .
Because of the colored and well designed advertisements , consumer will be confused about the real quality of the product .

Because of advertisements , some products have become more expensive regardless of their quality .
For example , Toshiba labtop is a well known brand .
Through out the years , Toshiba has proved that they have good quality laptops .
Overtime , toshiba laptops has become expensive .
Moreover , people around the world have got an idea stick in their mind that toshiba laptops are the best .
However , being a computer specialist , I have noticed that toshiba computers quality has declined .
Few weeks ago Toshiba company had to withdraw laptop batteries from the market for a specific toshiba laptop .
Poeple who are not interested in reading Information Technology news will not know about the battery withdrawal .
They will remain in believing that Toshiba laptop is always the best .

About nine months ago , I was convinced because of an advertisment that Assets air conditionars are of good quality .
The company that is advertisement for this brand is well known in my country Oman .
After buying two Assets air conditioners , I found out that these conditionars are not as was advertised for .
I could n't stand having them for one months .
I had to purchase new air conditionars .

People spend a lot of money because of the misleading advertisements .
They do not bother searching more about the product before buying it .
It is maybe not worth it to search the internet before buying a can of beans , but it worths a lot to search before buying an expensive products such as a car .
