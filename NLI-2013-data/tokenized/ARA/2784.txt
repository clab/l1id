I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do because young people do many things that old people cauld not do .
when you are young you have nothing to take care of .
your body is athletic and flexible you could do what ever you want you can play any kind of sports you want .
specaily when you grow most people wish they could go back young and be in school .
when you go to school the memory will start from school all the bad stuff you did in school .
nowadays i did things that my parents when they were my age dreaming to do for example nowadays we have mobile phones and we have airplains that can take you any where in the world that why we are feeling the earth is becoming smaller and there is no responsipleties your parents would take care of every thing .

when you are old first thing you will look ugly with all of that wrinkels in your face and body and you will start doing surgerys to look younger becaus eyou cannot face it that you are being old .
when you are old you need to have job unless you are rich and when you are old i feel you could not have fun because you are old .
you will also have many responsiplities because you would have a family and have children to take care of .
nowadays i feel it is not secure to trust people i do not know what will happen to my children if i had children because to many backstappers and many people lies .

My wish is that i will not be old i know it will not going to happen but curious i feel sick if i became old and no one want to be old ask .
I allways hear from old people wish they will be young back again .
