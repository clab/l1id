I certainly hope this statment would be true , as I wish to agree with it .
But unfortuantly , I do n't agree , as reality implies opposite fact .
As i grew up , i have been noticing people changing their cars every now and then , i usually did n't care , but when it was time for me to get a car , i felt how important it is to ride a car that comfort me and get me to any where i wish to go .
And i realized why people were so interested to changtheir cars .

It 's either they did n't like their car model anymore , or maybe they just want to get the latest car .
However , being this tramendous change in car manufactering world wide affects all people , in terms of age or genders .
Now not only men interested in cars , but also women .

Even though most of the well famous car manufactering coorporations are trying to suit what is the best comfart car for a women , in terms of color , mirrors on both the front sits , where the driver located .

Also , certain type of cars were introduced for a small or a big family .
Nonetheless , the types of cars introduced , there are so many and uncountable .
Alot of different car industries are growing so fast due to the competition between them to produce most high technical and comfortable car with less maintanence , with ofcourse , the shape it has of modern looks and colors .

Many people are very impressed with the very high technology applied in cars nowadays , from the car 's shape till the car 's performence .
And lets never forget that cars now serves us in many of ways .
Any family ca n't live without a car , and thats a reality everyone should admit , as in case if you do n't have a car instead you can take another tarnsporting mean .
Which at the end is a car , going anywhere , to your work place or for visting someone or even travelling near or far still requires a car .

Car 's serves us in many ways , that makes me doubt that in twenty years will be fewer , even if telecommuting took place instead of going to yout place , and replacing cars with any other mean of transportation like for example airoplanes , it will be so diffecult to adopt to such a diffecult mean .
Cars just makes life easier in terms of tarnsporting .

Finally lets just thank those industries who are trying to manufacter cars moving with electricty rather than petrolum that affects the enviroment negatively , and wish to demostrate instead of what we are using now .
