I am agree with the statement that sucessful people try new things and take a risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because if you do not do mistakes you will never learn .

People should try and learn new things even if they do not like to do it .
Some people do not like to do something strange at least in their eyes because they do not have any experience about it .
Otherwise , how they could write and read if they do not try .
Everything will become hard and impossible if you do not try several times to get it correctly .
My experience with that when i was in high school , i was so outsider and i do not want to lear a new things especially learing kind of sports as an example .
When i decide to play tinnes , i failed several times in that time and then i gave up .
After I graduated from high school i became a nimble when i play this sport before it was my boring sport .
Then , i tought people in the club how to play this sports .

Learning a new things let people avoid their previous mistakes that they had already did in the past .
When people attempt to do a new things , it will be hard and boring at the first time but it is not impossible .
Albeit , human discovered lots of thing like space , ice ages , and they also make lots of industrial things like cars , machines , and ...
etc and became popular because of that , so , why not you .
Keep something in the mind that lots of experements that the scientiests did , they already had mistakes with it but they tried it again and again .
eventully , they got accuret because they did not gave up or they said it is difficult .

People should pay attention to what is going on around them in this world .
Lots of famous people did mistakes but they are successful .
They are successful because they made a mistake and they also learned from the mistake .
When i was in high school , i did not get a good grade .
So , i was so sad because i could not be successful man in my school .
Then , i decided to learned from my mistakes and correct them in the next semester of school .
