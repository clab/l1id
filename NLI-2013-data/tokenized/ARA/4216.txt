In some communities , society have main projects of helping others by having help centers and certain committees to focus on specific needs of the society and try to offer the required help in that field using young people as employees or volunteers .

But those young people do n't have to be part of those establishments to help their communities .
They could do this by helping themselves first in educating themselves and having energy to fulfill their goals which takes them to helping their communities also indirectly .
But these days young people do n't have enough time to do that .

Reasons are because they are engaged in other stuff which keeps them busy not to help .
Unfortunately most young people do think that the end of their studying journey is to get a job and in turn to earn money .
Even if they would not just go for this process a minority may consider thefts and turn into criminals only because of their lust for money .
Some young people are engaed so much in their jobs to an extent that they would not find time for their families .
On the other hand , Some are really having a job only because it is a must have thing which should be accomplished may be under pressure of family and every morning they drag their feet into work forcefully .
May be if they had an option they would have been quitting jobs and staying at home amusing themselves and having pleasure .

If young people out there thought right , considering their jobs , they would have alot to get in advantage to themselves , their families and communities .
