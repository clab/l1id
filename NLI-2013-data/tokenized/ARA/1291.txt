To become a more experienced a erudite person , one would have to have broad knowledge of many academics rather than just one .
I strongly agree with the following statement : `` It s beter to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than t specialize in one specific subject '' .
For instance , a ballerina would be a more respectful and better artist if she only knew so much about physics .
Dancing has so much to do wth physics .
In order to be able to lift herself in the air and rotate her body at a certain speed she would need to have had taken courses in physics .
Being more knowledgeable in so many accademics would increase her chances of success .

I 'd have to say that a broader knowledge of many academics would be very similar to biology .
In order to understand the human body you need to learn more about all the organisms instead of just focusing on one , and how they are linked to each other , also how they would benefit the system .
That is why when one is studying biology in college , he or she would have to study for a certain amout of years about biology in general to find out how things link themselves and how they function all together .

If this statement were incorrect then why would schools offer a variety in courses ?
They might do so to prepare a student for life but in specializing in one specific subject they would have to be more ignorant of what is going on around him/her .

It is essential that many gain a broader knowledge of many academic subjects thant to specialize in one specific subject because that much variety would lead to a better understand in other subjects .
Everything is linked together in space and in our society .
If we were to specialize in one spefic domain we would have to leave out a great amount of interesting and intriguing information that would be very helpful in certan situations .

Considering the example of the ballerina .
If she were to walk on the streets alone and suddenly she just fell and injured herself .
And if no one were here to assist her then she would have to do it herself .
In order to do so she would have had taken classes in health care or any courses that are similar to biology .
If she does not cure her wounds then she would ruin her future .
Professional ballerinas are very concered about their health and their well being .

`` It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one sepecific subject '' because of how the word is linked together .
They all the sensations are in the foot .
To heal a person one would have to press on a certain location on a foot to stop the pain .
