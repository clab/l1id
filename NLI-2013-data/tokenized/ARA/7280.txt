Traveling is the best way the discover many places and areas around the world , and as you may know everyone should know the place there he or she lives in .

They are many people like to travel , but they are those like to travel alone and others in a group .
its depends on the traveler .
Since a long lime I like to travel in a group for many reasons .

First , getting together with may friends make to trip enjoyable with many things , such as discussion on different topics , giving ideas about the place where we are going to , ...
Second , I feel good to take a meal in a group , I remember one day I traveled with my school friends to discover one of the most place in Morroco .
It was to Atlas montains .
I remembed when we got to eat togther in a great enviroment .

Third , more important thing is to have a led , an expert for a your tour , that 's the only way to have several informations in your mind during the trip , wich remains the sourse of information .

Finally , you will no know the importance of traveling in a group untill you enjoy it with sort of things that I mentiend above .
that is one of the best things in life .
Think about it !
