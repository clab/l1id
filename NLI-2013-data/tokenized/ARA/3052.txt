I agree to some extent that old people may enjoy their life better than young ones .
Mainly probably they have achieved important portion of success and dreams they have been eager to procure .
Or simply because they are financially independent .
They earn money and they support other members of their family .
They may be also the source of advice and wisdom due to their experience in life .
All these things may be true but I am sure as far as I know and have experienced that young people enjoy life fully .
They benefit from every aspect of pleasure that it has First yong people enjoy great deal of freedom which was not available to them in the past .
The freedom of wearing the fashionable clothes that they liked .
The freedom of being late at night as well as having aboy friend or a girl friend .
In Arab countries for instance the previous generation did not enjoyed that .
And now merely in few cuntries in the middle East or North Africa where people can enjoy having partners .

Second , young people enjoy their life through the new facilities available like cinea , theatre , night clubs , traveling abroad and studying in foreign countries .
Now we spend our holiday in very exotic areas in the world just we precise our destination and everything will be done easily .

The chance of studying abroad is very possible and feasible today .
I am 27 years old now and I visited England and I intend to visit America whereas my father for example has not leaved even for a neughboring country .
So really young enjoy their life
