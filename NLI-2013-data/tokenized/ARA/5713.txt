Marketers usually tend to make advertisments for their products in order to achieve certain organiztional goals .
Theys use various kinds of advertisement methods such as tabloides , TV commercials , and much more .
Although these advertisements are important I think that they are mostly exagorated compared to the products .

First of all , we have to keep in mind that these advertisements represent the a method to attract customers and make them buy this product .
In other words , the marketers job is to obtain the profit rarther than satisfying the customer 's needs .
Second , alot of advertisments like tabloides exagorate when showing their advertisemts .
For example , the fast food chains usually use bigger images in their tabloides compared to the real size of the meals .
This way they attract customers and give them a wrong idea .
andt is known that the advertisement usually works on the mental part .
Also , detergents like cleaning detergents , shampoo 's , toothpastes and others .
Usually focus on special aspects while they are actually of same features since a cleaning detergent is a cleaning detergent .

Nowadays , marketers are not making advertisements to show features , but in fact it is nothing more than a battle with the competitor in order to win the customer therefore , they 'll do any means neccessory in order to gain the customer , and I believe people nowadays are aware of these things and should n't take it seriously most of the times .

In conclusion , People should n't believe all the advertisents they sea in th road or on TV because it 's not true everytime
