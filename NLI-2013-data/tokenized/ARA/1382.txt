To have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is to learn many things in different fields of study .
To specialize in one specific subject is to look at one thing from one point of view .
In my opinion , it is better to have both of them as a part of your academical development , and they are both equally important .

What truly happens in every person 's academical development is that this person goes through different equally important stages .
In the first stages of a childs life , this child learns how to speak , and then he or she learns how to write .
This is general information that everyone should start with in the begining of their academic life .

Then comes school , whatever , or wherever this person gets their education is all called school ; Although , there are some differences that occur on the level of that education .
In school , people are taught all the essentials of life , and a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , including different sciences , mathematics , arts , music , and languages .
These are the foundations each and every one of us need in our life .
As the school education comes to an end , different people start to specialize in different subjects of their interests .

Later on in life , we are approached by university ; by we , i am reffering to the people who are looking at pursuing further education .
University is where we are supposed to narrow our choices down , and choose specific fields of study .
That is when it is proper for a person to specialize in one specific subject ; in other words , major in something they are attracted to .
In the end they are going to have to live with what they choose for the rest of their lives , and that is why they have to choose something they truly love .

In conclusion , to have a broad knowledge on an academic subject , or to specialize in another are all equally important .
You have to get a broad education first , and then narrow it down to what comforts you most .
It is like , watching the rain fall , and then waiting for the rainbow to appear .
From the first word a child learns at home to the last book this person reads , each and every stage in that persons life is important .
