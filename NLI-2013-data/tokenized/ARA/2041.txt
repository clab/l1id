Indeed I disagree that young people enjoy their life more than old people because I believe that old people have more time to enjoy themselves , have less responsibilities and have a good life experience and resources which they can use to enjoy themselves .

Old people usually have much time for enjoyement .
They are almost retired after they finished their work time and so they will concentrate on enjoying theirselves through travelling abroad or did their own favorite hobbies like reading , painting , etc ...

Other important thing which enable elderly to enjoy their life is the fact that they are free .
They have no much responsibilities to do .
They are already retired from work so they will not care about their boss or their duties .
Their kid are independent now so they will not worry about them .
All these factors give old people time and chance to enjoy themselves and not anything else .

The life experience and knowledge usually old people gained from their long enrollement in work , reading and dealing with people will surely offer them the capability to enjoy their time .
They know most places which worths visiting .
They know how to choose their friends and peers , and they can deal with any problem might face them .
In addition to that old people might collect much more money than young did , so they can use their money in enjoyment .

In conclusion , I believe that old people can enjoy their life much better than young people do , this is because old people have more time and money , got better experience , and lastly they are free from responsibilities which the younge people have .
