Different generations have different views of life and each person has his own way to enjoy his life .
I believe that life could be enjoyable by everyone who wants to enjoy it .
It is not necessary that a young person enjoys his life more than an old one .

It is commonly known that youngsters have the enthusiasm to lead a happy life , free from dependence on some social mores that they see in some cases as a resriction over their wants .
And it is also commonly known that old people are very `` self-contained '' ; they lack the enthusiasm and the effervesence that youngsters have .
In my opinion , those views are fuzzy because I personally know many old people who know well how to enjoy their life , and my grandfather is the best example .
When looking at his face , one can see that he is full of life like a kid .
also , when examining his behavior , one can infer that he is more tended to enjoy his life regardless of his age for instance , he travels several times a year to every corner of the world trying to explore different places , different cultures , and different people this is why he have numerous friends of diffrent ages and different genders from several countries .
Conversely , I have a good example of a young person who has no concern in enjoying life , he is my neighbor , he views that he is `` born to die '' . with holding such philosophy , he has no special interests or means of distractions and entertainment , he does not have any pleasure when doing things .

To recapitulate , I believe the fact of enjoying life does not merely depend on a specific generation or on one 's age , but rather on one 's will and one 's wants to benefit as much as possible from his life .
hence , enjoying one 's life is mostly a matter of perspective from which we perceive things .
