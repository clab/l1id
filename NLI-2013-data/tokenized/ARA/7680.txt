Some people think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour giude while others do not .
They have their own reasons to choose what they think is the best for them .
Personally , I agree with the poeple who are saying that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because this kind of traveling has many advantages .

First of all , a group led by a tour guide will have more fun and enjoynment than a group that is not led by a tour guide .
A tour guide will save the tourists ' time and make every possible effort to make sure that the tourists are enjoying their tours .

Also , at our guide is very fimiliar with the historical places because the tour guide is from the place to which the tourists are traveling .
During the tour , the tourists will revieve some information that are given the tour guide about the historical places .
However , people who are traveling without a tour guide will find it difficult to find the places in which they want to be .
In a group which is led by a tour guide , one will find an opportunity to know the other tourists who are in the same tour .
It is obvious to us that we will get more benefits when we choose a group tour .

We can see how importance is the tour guide for the tourists during their tours .
Following a tour guide , the tourists will benefit from every moment in their tours .
In fact , there are many advantages from being in a group led by a tour guide while there are no disadvantages from being in a group led by a tour guide .
