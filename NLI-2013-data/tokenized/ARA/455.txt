I agree with this statment `` it is better to have board knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject . ''

People should try to have board khowledge of many academic knowledge , its better for them they get to know lots of things and have lots of thing to disscus and talk with people about and try to educate them by the thing they know about .

People can read books to increase their academic knowledge or use the internet .
there are lots of different ways they can go to lectiers and learn things that helps them .
My brother is a pilote i can talk with him all day long and not get board of him he has lots of information and things that interste me and helps me with my life .
I go to him when i need his help in my homeworks he knows every thing because he loves reading and surfing in the net .

he allways tells me about his experiance .
He talks to me about his mistake that he had done when he was in my age .
I am really prode that i have a brother with lots of board knowledge of many acdamic subjects .

People with academic knowlege have lots of things that they can talk about or teach people with their academic knewledge .
these people are useful to our community .

people with specialized subject they are boaring they will talk about one thing they just talk about the thing they are familiar with .
you can not disscuss things that interest you .
you will be inforced to listen to them every time you try to talk with them .
People who are specialized in one specific subject they have to be come teachers and teach the people who are intersted in their subject .
