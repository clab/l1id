First of all i would like to approve my opinion on this statement .
This is just what i would like to talk about , people who take risks and try new stuff tend to get more successful in their life , on the other hand people who tend to be close minded and only do what they know and in the same way over and over again , this would improve them at all .

When people try new things they discover new information , they allow themselves to think differently , to act differently , not only would it help himself , it would also have great changes on the country .
This type of behaiviour is what we call a part of leadership .

When people do what they already know how to do well and keep on doing it over and over again , that would not help them at all , because they are doing the same pattern , without interacting with new features and by that they are n't learning .

In case of Newton , we would n't have known today how to measure forces and gravitational fields if it was n't for his discoveries and his dessive state of mind .
In other words if Newton have n't tried and experemented the stuff in different ways , he would n't have done what he did .

Scientists are trying really hard these days to find a cure to canser and they are trying new stuff and things and taking risks , in order to do the best they can to get to the cure ASAP .

In my point point of view i would take risks and try new things to get to the best state of knowledge i can get to .
I am working so hard at the moment , trying new stuff and hoping to become a great man someday , hopefully soon .

My advise to you all is to experience new things and tryout stuff u never imagined your self doing it .
You never know what might be the thing that you would end up with .
