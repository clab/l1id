To be realistic i guess it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
But that does not mean if u get older you can no longer enjoy life , but instead your ability to enjoy life decreases .

To be more specific your physical ability decreases as you get older putting u in more risk of getting sick thus spending more time at the hospital and seeing the doctor and i do not think any one enjoys that .
Moreover young people are more fit than older people thus are preferable to do things old people can not do , like going skydiving going to places u have never been ther before like going to space , not having to follow a certain diet in other words eat whatever you want , things old people can not do for health and physical reasons .
More , young people in a society are allowed to go clubing , go on dates , flirt with the opposite sex , dress whatever you want ...
While as for an adult doing what i mentiond is bad for your image in the society ...
So by being an adult their are a lot of things you can not experience in life for different reasons .

But as i mentioned being an adult does not mean u can no longer enjoy life .
you can still do in a different way for instance , as an adult you can enjoy life and have fun through spending time with your children and their children and by watching your child grow and raise him to become a successfull individual in the society he is living in , also by having a quite and peacful time enjoying a certain lovely view in nature such as watching the sun go down with your wife .

But in my opinion now the activities young people do allows you to enjoy life have a taste of it more than the activities you do as an adult well at least thats what i think now maybe in the future when i get old and live life as an aduld i might change my mind but for now ill enjoy life in my way .
