Young people these days are attracted by the modern facilities. , like chating with their friends on the internet , going to shoping malls , going to international parks like , desney land or sea world .
they spend most of their time on things that do not benefit them .
they never realizi how much precious time they lose .

scientists have indicated that an American teenager spends four hours a day chating with his friendes .
which is considered a horrible situation .
chating on the the internet attracts not only teenagersbut also young adults .
It destroys the communication between people .
It creates a passive society .
chating on the internet is like monstor or a spider with wibs that dragges poeple .
it bring hatery among pwople .

Going out with frinds to shopping malls is a bad habit in saudi Arabia .
there is no benefits touring a mall and sulking around

So no wonder why young adults do not give enough time to help their communitis .
