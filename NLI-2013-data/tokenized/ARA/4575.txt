Well , my over all preceptions about advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I disagree with this statement for several reasons .
Firstly , i think that many advertising companies advertise for the matter of money not more .
Secondly , I know that many products do not deserve a very big advertising through a personal experience .

Many famous companies advertise for their products to attract people to buy it or to love it in some ways .
what i mean that is advertising companies looks for a something which all people love it and tries to put it in the advertisement .
As we know pepsi is one of the most companies that advertises for its product .
And all people know that pepsi is very harmfull after if we drink it for a long time .
Well people didnt say that .
Scientists said that and due to many experiments on pepsi .
People also can discover by them selves that pepsi is not good .
A very simple test , bring a broken teeth and put it in a pepsi cup .
You will soon discover after a couple of hours that their is no teeth .

In addition to my first example which proves to people that pepsi is very harmfull and they always advertise for it on tv .
I would like to talk on another example which is junk food .
I watch tv for around 4 to 6 hours each day and i can see alot of advertising for Macdonalds and Burgerking .
If a normal person sees these advertisement , he thinks that jumk food is good , while its also very bad .
Junk food may lead to cancer disease and block in heart artries .
Its full of harmfull oil which is used several times .
Some people are also overwaited from junk food .
All doctors advices to stay away of junk food .

In fact advertsement people are professional and they know how to affect people through these advertisements .
And as far as i know and I think its not fair and also its not legal to try to cheat on people .
I take this as a cheating method because when they are advertising you think its a good product and it suits you .
