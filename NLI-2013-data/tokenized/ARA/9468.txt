I agree with the statement because most of the the subjects you have to understnad ideas and to learn facts but some you gust need to understand the ideas of the subject .

Most of the students understand the ideas and most the gust learn the fact for my popenion it 's better to understnad the ideas t 's easyer and it 's more helpfull .
Some subjects need to be understood and some need to know the facts like math you need to understand the rule and know how to use it and in Biology you need to know to need to know the fact and then understand the way let 's say they way of people living .

Most of the people understand they ways liek when you work you gust need to know the way of the work for a person who works as at a company and he 's a programmer he just need to do the programmes got they company like that you gust understand the way you should do it .

There is always they way that people use there ways of knowing the thing for me it 's better to understand what you should do and not to learn the fact , let 's say i have a physics class i have understand the rules and i have to know how to use them but most important is that you use the way that is most easyer for you .
