Yes I agree , Traveling with a guide can help a person find and discover places in an easy way .
First of all , a travel guide is a person who is working for helping tourest , so he is an expert .
For example , if a person went to a place or a country for the first time in my life , and he says that he will discover it all by him self , it will take him at least one to two months to discover all the intresting places in this country , but if a person is planing to have a tour guide .
It wont take him more than 15 days to discover the places .
Secand of all , its not easy to understand an information that person might have it from a place , because some stories has alot of diffrent virgen , so a new tourest wont find that easy because a person dont now what virgen should he beleive .
For that , a tourest need to have a tour guide , so that he would help understand the stories .
Finally , a tour guide is so important for a person who is traveling so that can injoy his trip .
