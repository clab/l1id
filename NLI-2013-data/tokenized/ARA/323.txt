Iam going to writing about the specifis peaple whom love to try a new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

In my opinen , i agree with this people becouse many reson .
first , this people love to do this they are likey becouse they gave themself the chance to be better and to know more and more about every things they know it .
also , i think this people never felling pooring becouse all the time they have same things to do it and enjoy .
i think when you doing same things new and it is going write you fell great .

Second , this people help the economic in thier country and ther is a big example for that china all the time the people from china doing anew things in the computer .
another example , united states now the power country in all the world , they doing that by the people have a good things and by the people how to make every things good .
also the english langauge how is come the first language in all the world by the book , work and every poor things in english

Third , if you gave yourself the time to think about same thing new and same thing noy usually you will not just help your country but you also help yourself to know more and more about things you can do it and done .
also , one day maybe what you think about in miunte be the most important things in the life , the people remmber you by this work after you die your name will be there

In conclusion , i think it really important to things about new things and you have to be faster becouse the one how come first always better and remmber you can be a really good person with a really good things .
any one can doing areally good thing if the things one munite maybe not a big things maybe it is small but i believe you can to do it just start to think .
