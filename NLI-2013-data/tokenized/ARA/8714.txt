Facts are the core of life .
With out facts you can not draw conclusions , build a hypothesis , or even dream of a different course .
You can say that a fact is the basis where ideas and concepts emerge .

Lets take organic chemistry for example .
A mighty complex subject that many students , the ones who are dreaming of medical school , pharmacy school and the like stand hand tied to understand what is a really easy subejct in its core .
Only if you know the facts .
To undrestand what that means you have to know few basic facts about the carbon , the hydrogen , the nitrogen , and the oxygen atoms .
For example the number of bonds each must posses in order to be stable .
Carbon needs four bonds , hydrogen needs one , nitrogen three , and oxygen two .
Another fact is that each atom will always search for its stable state , and chemists call that , the less energy state .

Knowing what we know about bonds and atoms we can explain organic chemistry in a new light .
Its the strive for the atoms that make the molecules we have arround us in the air , the ground the sea and so forth to stay stable with the least energy possible .
And from that we can introduce the idea of atomic orbitals and the concepts that has been used by scientist to show how these orbitals strive to make the atom stable and functional , in other words survive .
And using the concepts of atomic orbital we can draw an extended concept for the molecular orbitalsfrom the concept of the molecular orbitals we can take it further to understand the way the molecules react with each other to form new molecules and so forth .

From the facts you can project hypotheses and ideas that can be proven right or wrong as time goes on .
But there is one thing that you can not change and thats the fact .
The water color will stay colorless , the fish will still swim in the sea not the land , and the carbon atom will have four bonds till the end of times , and that is a fact .
