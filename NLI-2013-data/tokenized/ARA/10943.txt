The statement `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' is very true in my opininion .
First , if this sentence is taken and placed in a political context , many examples appear that illustrate the truthfulness of the sentence .
For example , the late president Sadat of Egypt introduced a new economic program to the country called `` infitah '' in Arabic and which means `` to be open '' in English .
This program was new to the country because it involved open trade with any country in the world , unlike the old system which was a socialist or a closed trade system .
That system had many critics at the time it was adopted but Sadat took the risk and implemented the program which turned to be a great economic success for the country .

Second , the statement is true when looking at it from a business point of view .
For example , Bill Gates , the owner of Microsoft , tried a lot of new things and invented a lot of software that turned out to be very successful although there were great risks for its failure at the begininning .
Moreover , the word `` innovation '' is used by many businesses nowadays to illustrate thier belief in new things and anything new must have great risks at first .
Major companies have entire departments directed for research and development , also called `` R & D , '' and they spend huge amounts of money to fund these departments .
Therefore , the business enviroment believes that new things lead the way for profit and thus success .

In conclusion , i totally agree with the statement because it could be applied in any context and found to be true .
Being innovative in any aspect , whether in politics , economics , or business , will deffinetly lead to success but with great risks involved .
