Some people believe young people enjoy life more than older people do and others are not .
I think I 'm person who believes young people enjoy life more than older people do for many reasons .

First , young people can work harder than old people .
Young people can work any time and any place .
Young people have more chance to work in differet places because most of the job needs young peole because they can do well but old people most of the time can not .
As an example , I know two persons , one of them young and the other old .
When they try to find a job the young man find a job easilly but the old man did not find a job .

Second , the young people can play many sports .
Young people can play foot ball , basket ball and and different things .
Young people have more vigor than old people , they can run and walk easier than old people .
When you see the most sport games , you will see players which are young people .

Finally , young people can travle any place .
Young people can travel to cold places or hot places because their health help them but old people are not .
I know some young people travle many places and they enjoy and I know others old people can not travel to many places .

Young people really enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people can work hard , play many things and travle any place .
I think most of old people want their young back .
