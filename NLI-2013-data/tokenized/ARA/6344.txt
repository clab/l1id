One day i woke up i heard my dad fighting with my mom for who takes the car and goes to work and the other to go by a cap , from that reason my dad bought to my mom a car so I disagree that will be fewer cars in the coming twenty years .
Cars is one of the most important thing that people cant live without , without cars people wont be able to go to work or live their life the way they want .
Cars is the main thing that is making life easier these days .
There are many reasons why number of cars will not decrease for the coming years .

One of the most important reason is that cars is the object that help someone go to work and get what the family needs .
First of all , people use cars to go work and do their jobs and get everythin that the family needs also it allows them to do many things they like .

Also one of the most important reasons is that the car helps from moving from place to another .
Many people needs car for going from their house for example to visit their family .
After that cars are made for moving from place to place wheither its far or near .

Finally , these days number of cars increased because amny students are graduating from schools and they close the age of 18 and they apply for the license to have a car .
All people like to drive and mostly teenager .
These days who turns to the age of 18 applies for the license test and later on they get a car .

In conclusion , i dont think that number of cars will decrease no matter what and through the examples i mentioned cars rate will keep on increasing for the coming days and years .
