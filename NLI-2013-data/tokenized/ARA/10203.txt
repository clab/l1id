To gain a successful life is a very dificult step to take and trying new things and taking a risk is a harsh step to go down .
If someone is successful in something then he should keep attached to it and doesnt risk for trying something new and loosing all his great knowledge .

success is everywhere and it requires a lot of competition so if anyone is'nt willing to be very strongly related to what he knows the most and risks his success someone else might take his place even if he is'nt better .
Being successful is also being smart and wise .
If you are not wise then you might destroy what you built for taking a risk that you might fail .

My cousin , who graduated from one of the best canadian universities , was employed at on of the most popular and famous pharmicies in canada and he was payed applicaple wages which made him have a comfortable life .
Although my cousin was very smart he was n't that wise , he surprisingly decided to leave the pharmacy 's work and find another work in a drug company .
When he submited the information the company needed they did'nt accept him and ofcourse the pharmicy found a new employee to take his place .
Although my cousin had a great successful life and was a promoted employee he lost every thing just for taking a small risk .

If someone is already successful why not continuing in his major instead of taking a risk that might not be gainful ?
Greed is sometimes what makes successful people fall behind , whenever they have something they look for more and this is what makes some people fall in the harsh circumstances of a such a change .

losing all what you built is a great lose so not taking such a risk is a better decision .
