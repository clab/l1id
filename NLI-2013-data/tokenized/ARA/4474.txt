Advertisement is the motor for each company , it is like a front screen for its product .
But sometimes companies may lie and give wrong information about the producuct .
When you turn on a television , the first thing you see is advertisement .
Befor every events , the thing that influence you is advertisement .
But do we know what is it ?
how true is this information ?

Each company try to have the best product , get more money , but they do not want to spend dollars to reach that goal .
When a product is not well know or customers do not like it , the company change that by advertisement specially an attractive one that can influence customers and push them to buy it .

Nowadays , most of people do not trust them .
Because you can see an advertisement for a product saying that it can help you to sleep , but when you try it it does not change nothing .
Just lies .
So more people lost their confidence on publicity , and prefer to stay with one product that they are sure is efficient and will never change it .
i had my own experience with it .
Few months ago , i saw an advertisement for a new kind of food , saying is so delicious , new combination , and a lot of others good things .
I was so influenced , that pushed me to try it .
But unfortuntly , i was disapointed .
it tastes horrible .

When a company make advertisement , they always show the good side and never what is wrond with the product .
This method was helpfull few years ago when people thougth that everything they saw was true .
But not any more , people try to be sure what they are buying , and ask about it befor getting it .

Sometimes , people get influenced by what they are watching .
Companies make new ideas such as always get a funny advertisement about care , have sexy girls in man 's product , and children for candies and food .
They also focus on special generation commontly kids because of theire innocence .

However , companies make to influence people , the truth is the best way to do it .
As long there are liers , there is correct person .
