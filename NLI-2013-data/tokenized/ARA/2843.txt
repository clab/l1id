I totally agree with this statement .
It 's an interesting question because there are a huge number of different opinions about this subject , it 's an actual debate between young and old people .
I think that young people enjoy life more than old people because of three reasons .

First , the most important thing is that young people are in a better health than old people .
Thus , they are able to do a lot of activities , in a lot of domaines .
They can for example do extreme and risky sports like motobikering , snowboard in mountains or jumping from a plane !

In addition they can go for long trips , specially to do bivouacs or others types of trips wich demands to be in a good physical condition .
It 's a big inconvenient for old people because they do n't have the same capacities .

The second reason is that young people demonstrate more interest to some aspects of life , specially the different ways to have fun .
Young people are always looking for a way to enjoy all what they do like activities , sports or simply studies .
They have also the chance to have a lot of time in front of them , I mean the future .
So they can make projects for their life about all the aspects of a life .
They can do studies and change definitely to do other types of studies .
It 's more difficult for older people because they do n't have the chance to could change the orientation and the type of their life because they have a lot of engagements ans responsabilities .

Finally , young people enjoy life more because they have the oportunity to discover the world for the first time , by doing mistakes for example .
Consequently they can enjoy a lot of experiences by studying , traveling in different ways and specially meet people around the world .
This example is significative specially in affective relation ships because they are not yet engaged in a mariage , so they can enjoy their time with a lot of different relationships to discover the right person they want to be with .

To summarize , young people enjoy life more than old people because they have all the time to live new experiences and feel new sent
