Many people have diffrent ideas about whether they have to chose the risk or a normal life .
I agree with people who take the risk to successful by trying new things .
To be a succssful person intends to take the risk for several reasons .

First of all , a successful perons has more ability to discover thing than the other .
He or she will be able to develope her or himself in many thing .
For example , to be a good singer you have to try to go in front of people and let them lestian to your songes .
I called that as risk because not all people would support you but they will give you thier oppinon whether you get the level where you are ablr to start .

The second a succssful people have to take many chances whether they get a benfit even thought they make mistake .
No argument about whcih learning any thing comes with make mistake .
trying to do thing and you faild does n't mean you lost somthing .
It means you get more information about what have you been doing .
For example , one day I was trying to fix my laptop suddenly I broke the keyboard .
So I learned that i have to pay more attintion with these machains beacuse it is a flexible .

Third , we are not be able to survive if ther is no one take the risk .
most people are rely on the others so they wo n't do anu thing .
However , if people will have done that we woild gotten any technical thing as whay we are using now adays .
these thing comes out if taking its risks .
For example , findig the oil under the ground was a drastik decition had been made by the united England back in many years .
they work hard to find all vaulbe things that help us to live our life .

In conclustion , to be a successful persone has its own risk but it helps for many things .
we are not be be able to accomblish in our klife if did n't take these riskes .
