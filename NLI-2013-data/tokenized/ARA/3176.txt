In my opinion i think there are savrel reasons .
First of all , young people have less responsblities than older people .
For example many young people are not married which allow them to do things that it may be hard for a person who is married .
I am for example not married , which is easy for me if want to visit my freind i could stay in his place and dont wary about anything ; however , if i am married and want to visit my freind i could stay in his place but not for long time it would be diffrent and some what harder .

Moreover , young people are healthier than older people which can be a big factor of enjoying life .
Many people would agree that a healthy person can do much more than a perosn who is health is not so good .
For example , not older people would have the phisical stringh to clime a mountain , yet many young people would have the phisical stringht to clime a mountain .

Furthermore , nowdays many young people go to school and colloges which give them a chance to meet different people and to gain great experinces which is very enjoyable for many young people .
I know that i do enjoy going to school even though it could be very challaning sometimes .
And that could be another reason why young people enjoy life mroe than older people .
