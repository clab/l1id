Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I agree with this statement because of many reasons .
The most important reason that differenciate young people from the old is wisdom .
Old people are wise , patient , more experienced , more conservative and want to do the right thing .
Young people are reckless , hasty , quick in making desicions , unpatient but are wanted from society .
Society nowadays idealizes the young and ignore the old .
Every attractive or sexy actor/actress is either young or tries to look young .
Lets face it a model is only famouse when she is young , when she is above fifty nobody would even remmember her name .
The media plays a big role in this , where every product advertised is by the appearance of either a young girl or a guy .
Never the less this is not the only reason , young people are able to injoy life because they have health , no responsibilities and a wild imagination .
For example , a twenty year old guy can go dancing , clubbing , drinking alcohol , driving fast and all of the other stuff that young people do , things which a fifty year old would never consider doing .

Old people have kids and have many responsibilities which take a lot of their time like taking care of the house , buying groceries , doing social visits , things that will never come to mind for a young person .
In addition to that old people are not as healthy as young people , which can deprive them of certain activities like sports , they have to watch their cholesterol , not eat shugar and all of the other constraints on their food consumption , while young people eat what ever they want and dont even think about these problems .
Young people are generally single and date other young single people and diversify often , While old people are stuck with their old partner and remmember the time when they were young .

In conclusion , I can say that every person can enjoy life in his way at any stage of life he is in .
Maybe what seems as fun to a twenty year old is not as fun to a forty yearold and vise versa .
So I can say that every stage in life has its joyfull moments even old age , although I always say `` enjoy life while you are still young '' .
