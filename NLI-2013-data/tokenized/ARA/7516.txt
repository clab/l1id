Once I traveled to the Egypt in a group , I spent most of the time waiting the others , it was a disasture .
And A after that trip I decided I will never travel with a group again .
In my openin traveling with my family alone is the most exiting idea for many reasons ; econmic , fun and control reason .

First , the econmic reason to travel alone is the most important one .
When you travel with a group you have to pay for things you really do n't enjoy .
Once , I planned a trip with a group , they all decided to have a lunch in a luxary place that I could n't pay for it because it was so expencivefor me .
If you want to take Ia trip you should concerned about your finance .

Second , having fun is also important .
If you take a trip with a group you should concerned about the time .
Sometimes you may enjoy certin place and you want to spend more time on it while ther is another one in the group who does n't like so you will have to choose .
In my trip to Egypt I liked to spend the night watching the old places while other liked watching the belly dancers , so I decided to be alone to enjoy best .
