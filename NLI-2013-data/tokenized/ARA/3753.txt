`` Each finger is diffrent from the other '' , a say by a well known peot .
I would n't disagree and give u a fact that I 'm sure is not right , and defending people from my own age by saying that they do help their communities .
But though , they 're alot of childeren that are participating and helping communties , eventhough lots are not but those kids that are should be hounred because what they 're doing is not a small thin g at all .
Helping others in their age , with lots of pressure is not an easy thing that they can handle , thats why lots of parents do not allow their children in applying for activties or communities .

Parents are consiered about the level of they 're children in studies , and thats one of the main reasons , why kids do not cosider peoples problems and try to help , its because they are not thought to love each other at home , they are not tought to love doing nice thins for others and help the needies although most od the religons around ofthe world consists on helping the person that does not have enough to care of him self , whether it was something in the person or it is a need of money , .

Helping communities start with small things around us , and I'mn that they are alot of kids that are helping by small things that they dont even bother to count vecause they might think its silly .

In conclusion I don n't fully agree with the statment but wish from parents and people whom call their selfs adults to make our younger children and next generations of kids to be cosidered and loving to others and to know thats there no diiference between a wealthy and a poor or a white or black except by heart because as we grow our heart splits aound our beauty in our face and moves .
