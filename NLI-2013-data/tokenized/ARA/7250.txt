I agree that is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
That make me more comfortable for two reasons such as the leder can mange the group and save the money .
That what i am going to write about .

Frist of all , managing a group is not easy as what people think a bout it .
It is hard to mange yourself baside if you mange yourself and the all people in the group .
It is important becuase may you have any problem who can solve in that time is the leder .

Second , if you have your money you can put it with the leder becuase he is the one who has the reasponsbilty for that .
That make you not worry about your money during the trip .

In oppinets of , people who disgree .
They think , they can do it by themself .
Morefore , they can not becuase they will fight and it will not be a good trap to remmber .
That was my opinion may it is true may not .

Finally , we have been read saverl couses that make a leder is important for any group you want to travel with .
In order to , make sure your group has a good manage and your money in a save place .
