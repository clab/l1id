to lerne any pice of informashon u have to have som facts and logic so you can bleve in it becous if uyou dont bleve in somthig ther is noway u will ever recognis it or to use it but ther is tipe of puopel having afact is the most important thing fore them to understand any tipe of infor or daita hawever i think they are wrong .

I agree becos understanding is the most paworfull thing u can have in acadimec ways but if i can and i think that i can to make a very simple companishon between thos tow things in a vere god example ones i was i the beyology lap and the tetsher was taking about some cainds of animals and he hade a very good and intresting facts some of my frinds got the ideya but me ...
never so i told the tetcher tell me more so he sad i thik u are the tipe that shoud understand by vigwall lactour so he grab the laptop an he showd me wat was he saying by viduo taping and i got it i rele did so wat i am tring to say that in my apinun understanding and knowing a facts and to have a good concepts is vere vere inportant to be to gither i have o work hard on that i know its cainda hard but life is tuff all in all i think i cant havet all but i will do my best .
