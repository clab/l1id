I really agrea with the point that says most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
In fact tey have to do that to attract the customers .
As a customer , we have the choice to buy the item or not .
As i said most of the time the usually products looks much better than the are .

Every comany or shop does that .
It is just part of their business .
The more they sell means the more they are successfull in their work , and in their business .
These kind of adertisements became normal and common in these days , even though there are a few copanies say the right things about their products as they seem .

Anyway , since we know that issue , and we are so familier with it , we should buy what is good for us .
As we know each comany has its own plan to attract the customer .
In these days they even try to call you , and introduse their items to you .
You would see alot of advertisements on internet , in newspapers , in magazines .

Sometimes you might even laugh , when you see something is free .
That thing happened to me , when i was going to buy a cell phone , which has a sticker on it says free .
I was suprised , then i asked the seller he said it is not free , you just pay monthly or weekly as you like .

We see strange things that has to do with markting , because everyone wants to be the best .
Since that they try to do anything to show their items as they want .
In my openion they have the right to make products seems much better than the really are .
