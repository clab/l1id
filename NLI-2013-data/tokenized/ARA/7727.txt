Traveling from one place to another is a good experiemce for everyone 's life .
I think traveling by your own or with a group of people you know is more fun because , firstly , you will have the chance to go wherever you want .
Second , it will teach you how to discover new places .
Thirdly , it a good way to learn how to read maps and to be dependent .
I completely disagree that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide .

To go wherever you would like is better than to be stucked with a group of people who are following a touring guide .
for example , in every country there are some places which are nicer than the othersm .
The tourist guide choose some of them to visit and leave the others that he or she feels are not interested to visit .
However , the places which are left might be nicer in other people 's opinion .
So being traveling alone will guarantee a good chance for you to visit what you would like .

Being afraid to be lost is the main reason for those who choose to travel with a tour guide .
In my openion it is more enjoyable to be able to find and discover new places by your own .
Despite the fact that you might get lost sometimes , the beauty comes at the end of the trip in finding what like .

Traveling alone forces you to learn how to read maps and to be on your own in the middle of no where .
For example , studying the map before traveling is a good way of specifying where to go and what the best shortcuts are .
It teaches how self-confidence and being more mature .
Relying on others is not going to help you when those people are not around to risk you .

Finally , traveling alone with some people you like is better than joining a group of people and being attached with them where the tour guide take them .
To travel alone will increase the chances of going to the places that you like and the pleasure of discovering new one .
It will teach you how to read map
