Not all that glitters is gold .
A very general statement yet very true .
A statement that should be hung in every company 's marketing and advertising departments , because I think that most of the dvertisments polish up their products .

Evidence to that are the policies that some companies in the United states have concerning the `` refundable , no question asked '' policy .
For example , the famous department store found all across the U.S called Target operates under this policy , giving its customers a three month time span for returning and getting a refund for a purchased product .
Had the product been fairly advertised consumers would be returning less products as they would only purchase a product that they are sure of .

I once watched a five minute advertisment on one of the advertising channels concering a certain product for the complexion .
In the commercial they showed several before and after pictures of people who claimed to have used this product .
It was very clear to me , as it would have been to any computer user , that so much of the picres shown of the after had been altered on the computer .
With the new advancemnets of technology and high developments in the computer manufacture industries something like that can be easily done .
The product was over estimated in price and quality .
I can say that with confidence , for my friend fell for the smell of fake roses and bought the product , the next day she satyed home because she had a horrible rash all over her face .

So it is not surprising that I strongly agree the fact that most advertisments are over done and do not reflect the true value of the product .
As I said earlier , the advertising and marketing departments should be more truthful .
