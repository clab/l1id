Knowledge Subjects
Knowledge is a very good and commplacate thing at the same time .
I'ts a good thing to heve and share a knowledge but the idea is do you prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject ? .
In my opinion having a knowledge specialize in one specific subject is better .
I disagree with the idea having a broad of knowledge because alot of reasons .
My mind will not able to understand and save all the knowledge thats will be taken by many academic , but if it were one specific subject I will .
For examples taking a knowledge about a history as a one subject it 's not easy as having a knowledge about history and art and math it will be vnot easy .
Picking up a specific subject that you love and you want to learn it its much easy and fun for u to learn alot of knowledge either you love or not , one subject you will enjoy it and you wont be bored of it .
For example I love histroy so if I have aknowledge of it I 'll be able to love it and get exaited and enterist about it .
Of my point of viem learning or taking a knowledge from different places is a bad idea it will make you transport from place to another .
For example if I go to learn in a 3 academic it will waist my time and I 'll get board too fast !
thats why I prefer the knowlege from one place and one subject either .
At the end if you want to take a lot of enjoyable , meaningfull and entersting knowledge you should go for one specialize specific subject to keep the joeyfull and beautyful moments by having the knowledge , it is the best way .
