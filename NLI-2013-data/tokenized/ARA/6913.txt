Everyone in the world wishes to have a car .
So will the cars be less after twenty years from now ? .
Well in my opinion I do n't think that the number of cars will be less .
Because people need cars to travel , to work , visit there family or friends , use it as a home if it was a van and it is cheap compear to the other transports .
So I dissagree for several reasons :

Firstly no one in the world has the ability to o to there work using there legs every morning in there life .
Because if that happens everyone will be tired at work and suffuring of legs pain .
and that means people will preser to stay at home .
Another reason is that as a buisness person for sure cars will be there best way to let the way of the buisness go well .
For example when I was in the city of my country .
The main thing to travel is to use a car rather than walking .
And if the roud is closed just for one hour that means that the buisness will stop or atleast the market will be low .

Second comes that cars nowdays are at everywhere in the world .
So how it will be fewer than it is now ? .
I do n't think that it will be easy to distroy the cars and find a place to burry them under the earth .
However , most of the people need cars ( vans ) to use them as their home .
that will be a travel home .
They can take their home when ever they need to do that .

At the end as an ower of as car I hardly beleive that cars will not be fewer in future unless there is a another wirld to throw all the cars in is .
