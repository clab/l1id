Since Ford started to produce cars in great numbers , in the early days of the 20th century , the rising did n't stop and we are facing today a major problem of mass car construction that can lead to a catastrophy .
Where would we be in twenty years ?
The answer to this question must be definetly for a decrease of cars number and this idea could be supported with two main arguments .

Firstly , a positive development is that the transportation systems are spreading in all the major cities , wether it is called subway , tube , train or metro .
this evolution comes in favor of a popular mutation : people are leaving their cars for a better choice : public transportation .
This means is faster and cheaper than cars .
and we see that its development can encourage people not to buy cars .

Secondly and the most important idea is the dangerous consequences of the astonishing large number of cars .
the rise of the use of cars is causing infinite traffic jams , risks of car crashes that cost human lives , plus the air pollution caused by the high amount of carbon rejected by the engines .
These factors do not encourage car production growth , but on the contrary , the use of public means of transportation which are secure , less polluting and save time for their users .

But finally , admitting that there will be fewer cars in twenty years , we must notice that these future cars will contain a considerable improvement .
In twenty years , cars will be less polluting , more comfortable , and cheaper because of the advance in technology and mass production .

in conclusion , if we try to make a comparison between private means of transportation - cars - , and public means , we can definetly see the difference in security , time economy and pollution , and the choice of the public means is a better one .
For this reason , focus on the improvement of public transportation should be made in order to make it more comfortable and energy saving .
