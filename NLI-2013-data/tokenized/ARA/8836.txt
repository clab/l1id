I dissagree with the statement that say `` it is more imprtant for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' becasue of many reasons .

First of all , they will learn more about the facts becase it is real and they will believe it so it would help them more and more .
In addittion the ideas will not help them becasue they can forget them quickly and it could be wrong .

Second , it would help them it their lifes and give them more experinse and lesons .
Such as if anyone of the students had strange question maybe he had learn from that facts alot of information that would help him to solvie it .

Third , they will learn about new things that they have not know about it .
Moreover it would get to the other generation .
So that facts would be inhertants for all genetation and all of them can get what they want to know about .
Also that information that they get from the facts would make them more serious with this life .
In addition it would make people who were sleep to wake up and go to worke because facts have many ture and strange information .

In the end I see that the facts much better that the ideas because the ideas might be wrong and it will efect our society .
So , learn facts is much betters becase all the people and sientise kwon about it .
