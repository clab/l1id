Each person has his own way of traveling .
some people like traveling alone and others like to travel with a group .
It depends on the person 's personality .
But for both cases , a tour guide is needed specially if someone is traveling to a country for the first time .
In my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

Being in a group while traveling is so important .
It is helpful and beneficial in many aspects .
One of these aspects , is to help get red of boar .
No doubt that loleness causes boaring to everyone .
So being in a group would solve this problem .
Another benefit is that peaple useually feel strang in other countreis because they miss their families , friends and people .
being in a group obviously helps reduce this feeling .
Finally , the last benefit of being in a group , is that you can find help from people you know if you needed help .
you can share your broblems with them instead of others that you do n't know in the forign country .

No doubt that the tour guide is very important and neccessary .
He can provide tourists with information they need about the forign country such as laws , rules and way of life in that country .
Moreover , he knows most of the places and how to get to them .
So for instance , if a traveler is looking for a restaurant , hotel or any other place , a tourist guide would be helpful .

In conclusion , it is advisable to be in a group led by a tour guide while traveling .
They can be really helpful and useful .
Also they can cause the trip to be more enjoyable and easier .
