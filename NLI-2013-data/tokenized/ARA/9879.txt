I totally agree with this statement , cause i think its really the best way to discribe a successful person .

I will start by mentioning why i think thats true , lets say some bussiness man thinks of starting a new business , and the man who is really considered a good example in my opinion is BILL GATES .
He started the microsoft while it really was a very risky and new investment to the world who really didnt know anything about operating systems and so on , so intorducing this new operating system by Bill Gates in MICROSOFT was really risky and a new thing , but Bill Gates took this risk and now he is the richest man on earth .

Well ofcourse we cant just say that taking a risk and doing new things is enough for a successful person , this person needs to keep tracking his business and have this kind of enthusiazm of being better and better .

Lets say Bill Gates just started his bussiness with microsoft with the first windows ( operating system ) and then he just took a rest and didnt think of what he could do next or what he could do more to make his work keep going , that would totally led the company to a break down as there is lots of other companies who are working on the same firm .

All i want to say is , if someone is just happy for what he got and know , and dont try to search for better results , that would end him as a unsuccessful person sooner or later .

May be a person is so successful now and he is taking risks and doing new things , and for some reason this person just stopped caring or thought that is enough for now , in my opinion in our new world this (( i think thats enough for now )) thinking would not work anymore , cause life is changing so fast and people keep asking for more new and better things all the time so we have to keep runnig in the right track .

My opinion may took the bussiness side of the statment but i really think our world now is really just living by business and managment and the more you are successful in this fields the more you are successful in your life , as life is all about how to learn new things and risk to accept the new challanges that encounter through your life everyday .
