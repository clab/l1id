my first words will be ( with no depet the success does not come just like that it depance on your skills and on how can you risk offcurse i agree that successful people have to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well for an example lets take the sport any sport and lets say football or socer and because i play socer i know that the player or keeper must not stayed or depandence on one skill he have to train hardlley and every day to improve his skills even if there was some rescue espacelly for the goal keeper because he have to learn how to jump for the ball with no fritend to get heart or hit by anther player and this only one example and it is aprooved that any one has to get him self in risk just like i sayed in the begin and any one has to get in his mind that his name will be mention as agreat man one day and for anther example lets take the police work espaclley the officer because he didnt hot the stars for nothing he chasets the cemanels and fights the crime only for his family and country and he is wisting no time on setting behaind his office he always train hard to keep his fet on and try to get haier palce and i think those to exampels are enough for you and me to make sure that are the seccessful people not only have but must to try and learn new things and risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well to be on of the greatest men who lived in this country and died on it )
