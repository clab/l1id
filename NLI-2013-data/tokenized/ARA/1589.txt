In this world , it is better to have a lot of Knowledge especially in acedmeic subjects for example taking more than one subject or concentarting on more than one subject in school for your next years in the university .

I agree in taking more than one academic subject for many reasons .
One of the reasons is that when you take more than one academic subject you will have more knowledge and more ideas and these ofcourse would let you be accepted by many companies and so you will have a better future for you , when you marry and when you get kids , if take one subject you will have less ideas and less knowledge and so less experinece and so you will be less accepted by companies and so will not have that good future .
Second reason is that when you take more than one subject you can enter many courses in the university and ofcourse you will be able to study what you want so having more and more knowledge and information .
When taking one subject you would not be able to study a wide range of subjects and so you waould face aproblem is that you would face aproblem when appllying to wok and so you would affect your future .

Third reason of why having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize on one subject is that most subjects and materials are related to each other and so when you concentrate on one subject only leaving alot of subjects that you did not take say in schools for example you would face a big problem in university or in college is that you will see that most subjects relay on each other even if it was a small percent and so would face problems in what are you studying and so you would have a big probabilty to fail in what you are studying which makes your future and life affected especially if you fail , but if you took alot of subjects this will help you in your university and so you will not fail and your future can be saved , and even if u you fail , you still have alot of knowledge and so you can do your own small bussiness which would save your life and future .

There are many reasons but they need alot of explination , both have their advantages and disagvantage but for me i agree on studying more than one academic subject and so this would make me feel safe and comfortable .
