Young hearts Young people enjoy lige more than oldrer people do !!! .
Most people think and act in that way , if you are young you are fine , you are healthy , you are happy .
let us go through this ideas in foccus .

If you are ( 12-22 ) years old from the begging of the day until the noon time you will be eather in the school or in the collage or university , if you are lucky , setting with books and sharing times with luctures when you reach home you well be exhusted enough to go for you nap time _ as most of student do_ .
By the evening time you shoud stady and finish your home works .
At the same time it might be your parrent planned to take you to visit your grand mather or to goin them to familly party and as you know living home after 1000 `` Oclock is prohibited , for that your sleeping time came .
Today like yesterday the same rotinune stady sleeping , and every thing in scheqadule otherwise you will be impolite and not obaying the family roles .

In the other hand if you are older enough to carry on your own responsibilities and you become above 30 years old you can enjoy you life after working time with your own lemitating and rules ; sleeping , reading , chating , driving , going for parties with freinds or with your own family , playing your favoiurate game ...
ect .

Finnaly from my small experince in life and as Im seeing my sesters and freinds life before and after we grow - up elder people enjoying their life may be less but more funny enjouable according to their well , time , interest , and needs with wide space of freedom and good points of what is good for them and what is not .

Lastly they can also engoy planning and making their children and family more happeir and enjoyable life .
