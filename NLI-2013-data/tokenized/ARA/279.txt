Well , I disagree with the statement that says `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
The reason for that , is I think facts are the basic of ideas .
So , how can an idae or a concept come before the fact .
Consquantally , the we leran the basic which is the fact , then we propose an idea .
So , if a students recivied an idea or a concept without having the solid basics , he wil not be able to make his decision about it .
Therefor , he will not have the apportinuty to discouss the concept .
Clearly , the logical way to learn is facts then concepts .
So , we teach students the basics and the facts , and gradually try to involve some ideas and concepts into their material .
In this way , they will learn how accepet all the opinions and then make their own decision .
Also , they will try to interfere from the facts then try to propose their explaination and support it with evidences .
An example for my choise if Geology calss .
If we taught a student that caves are formed in a certain way , he will memorize it without conventition .
In other hand if we taught him about caves from different areas .
They are an extent area but if he got some information about kinds of caves and how it formed , he will be convinted about what he learns .
