In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use thene ther are today .
Some people agree with thes statment and some do n't .
There are many advanteges and disadvanteges for it .

The advanteges of having cars or not are many such as the air polution will be less because many people will use bicks .
The second thing is people will not need to pay for gas every week .

The weather in my country is very hot so we must use cars espsialy is summer and that is a disadvanteges of not having cars .

At the end my opinion is that I disagree with this statment because the weather is to hot in my country and no one can walk or us a bick is such a hot weather .
