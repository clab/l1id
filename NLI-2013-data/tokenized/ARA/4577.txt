I agree with this statement which says `` must advertisement make products seem better than really are . ''
For example when I are go to a sopermarct store I usully look at a Known brids .
It seem better but when I start to use it I reallize that the old one is much better .
Here in the USA every day you can see a new advertisement .
like `` Gigou '' the enshorance company .
I have an experince with this company in my last accident .
I told them I want to get cash instade of fixing me my car but they rifuse .
Than after tow monthes the took about same stution in thier ad .
I did n't keep my mouth shout .
When I have return they told me no we ca n't give the money to you .
frome that time I hated to see ads in TV .
second reasone I thik it 's the ads job to make products seem better so the consumer change his idea and use this product .
after that they made more and more money .
that explan why I gree with that statment .
