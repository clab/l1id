Some people are interested in success in life .
They have thier ways to reach the degree of success .
some try usual ways to look for the success and some try to create different ways to do so .
Obviously , people who come up with new ideas and ways to achieve thier goals and objectives are successful .
That is why i agree that successful people tend to create and establish new methods for thier plans with taking risks while applying them for many reasons .

First , the nature of success requires experiencing and trying new different approeches to achieve tasks or duties in general .
for example , someone could open a new business by following the other people 's thoughts and plans , but the successful person always tries to find a creative idea instead of doing what the mainstream of people does .

Second , doing things by using the similar and usual manners will not lead to unusual results and successful people are n't usual ones .
That is why they are distuingished in terms of acmpolishing all the stages of any thing , including planning , perfomingand finishing stages in unusual creative manners

to sum it up , trying new things and taking risks lead to success .
Without them , the success will not be suffi
