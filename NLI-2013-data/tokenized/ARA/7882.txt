Offcorse i agree to travel by groups led by a tour guide , it will be better and nice .
Many travel agenceys have tripes or journeys with groups , the tour guide can recognize and know the places that he can take you to it .
Example , when i was in Germany exactly at Munich bavarian city i was going with agroup to turn at all places , at morning we stay at one place together with all of the group untill the tour guide comes , we have a contract with a bus company to go any place in munich , so that day we had gone to aplace called garmish international park , it is located at twenty miles from munich city at the center of huge mountains .
It was very nice place , the tour guide was telling us about the place and about the casttle their , offertunality we had knew many things by the tour guide .
ISo iagree the tour guide because he know many places at can speak their language .
