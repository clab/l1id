many people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specializw in one specific subject while other people do n't .
i 'm one of the people who prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
i have two reasons for that .

first , studying many academic subjects is better , because learning more subjects make your knowledge biger .
for example if you were talking with your friends you can understan what they are talking about .

also , studying many academic subjects it takes all your time .
if you are studying many subjects then you will not get bored .
for example , one day i took an english lesson for five hours , so i got bored .

studying many academic subjects will give u more knowledge and it is going to west your time in an important things .
