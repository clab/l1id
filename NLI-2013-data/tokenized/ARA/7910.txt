I like to travel with my father more than by myself .
I always travel in summer with my fimaly .
my father , mother , and bigger sister usuley go to different countery each year .
Traveling with my father much better for us because , he is the tour guide .

frist of all , travel with a tour guide will makes the travel short and essy , since the tour guide has an experience in his plase .
He will make my vecation more enjoynabl .

Scond reason is that , the tour guide will choose a good plase for me better than I do .
One time when I went to new city I asked for a good plase to go and how I can go there .
In this time I lost the way .
So it saves time to go with a tour guide who will take me there in a short time .
and i do not need to think of time .

Fainally , first think I could teach my son in travel is to find a good tour guide .
To save his time and show him more plases in one trip .
Which would be better to have a oneperson who can help me to travel and enjoy my time without thinking of how and from where I have to go to that plase .
