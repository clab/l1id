Im strongly disagree with the statement as i iknow old pepople and young people the can enjoy in deferent way according to their age and their ability .
There are many things old people can enjoy doing for example going to cinemas or going to park with families .
I THINK some old people they did not agree to go out or they are unable to do so but if we are encourange them to do that they will .
in addition the children should treat there parents in a polite way so that they can enjoy their remaining life even though they are old that is not an excuise to deal with them in a bad way or to keep them away from comunity .
furthermore some people may not be very good with there parents thats why the old people may refuse to enteract with others and the prefere to be aione rether than going out and enjoy thersself In some country the goverment provid a special places for the old people to leave especialy for those who do not have the place to leave and it may contain alots of functions that created for them to take off there worried and boring that is a good thing and also there is a special places that builed and designed for the old and disabbled people to move easily .
in conclusion i think every one right to enjoy there lifes and its not setele
