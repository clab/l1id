Are you the kind of person who wants to know every thing about a thing or a thing about every thing ? .
In our life many people have to decide in between having broad knowledge of many subjects and specializing in one subject .
In my openion i believe that having broad knowledge is better than specializing in one specific subject .
However , there are advantages and disadvantages .

First of all , by having broad knowledge of many academic subjects you will be a well round-educated person and have alot of skills that you can use in your daily life .
having many subjects makes a person well round-educated one who is able to understand alot of things that face him in his life .
For example , if a person had a psycology course he would understand the acts of his teenage children .
Moreover , by taking many academic subjects you might have some skills that help you in certain situations .
For example , my cousin used his french when he took his mother to a hospital to recieve a medical attention in france .
So , taking many academic subjects is a good choise if a person want to be a well round-educated one and to have skills that might be useful in his daily life .

Furthermore , because of its waste of time and distraction , having a many many academic subjects might be considerd as a disadvantafe .
These subjects make a person spend a lot of time on them because ther are many of them and he must gives them the same attention .
Also , they distract the person from foucesing on his own major subject which he uses in his future job and let him spend his time on subjects that he do not need in his job .
So , a personn should think before In conclusion , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects has its own advantages and disadvantages , but since the advantages have more weight than the disadvantages , I think that having vroad knowledge of many academic subjects is the best choice to make .
