Advertisments is one of the best way to interact and interfere with the audience .
There are many ways of advertisements and there are also different rules and views .
In order to attract the people , customers in other word , the advertisment should be such a great and attractive show that makes the customer very forward to get and buy the products .
This is why most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
There are two opposite opinion in this issue .
One opinion is the advertisement should not be that great and much better than it is in real .
The other opinion the advertisement s should be as much as it could be in real .

In my point of view , if the advertisement were not much better than it is in real life no one will buy the products .
If I decide to sell a products the first thing I should do before produce it is to have a big advertisements .
Although it might be unfair for the costumers , it is a way to sell a products and succes .
In additon , advertising is not easy as it is seems to some people .

Advertising needs a creative smart people to creat a good advertisments .
On the other hand , advertisement has both positive and negative side it may drive you to success and it may throw you to the ground , so sometimes it is very risky .
For example , there is many mistake that makes factories loose alot of money because of a misusing of advertisment such Nike .
The only technique that attract people is the advertisment and most people search for a products because not only it 's quality but also it 's advertisment .

In short , advertisments is the only method that interact with people and costumers and it should have something really interesting on it .
No one will buy a product if the advertisments shows the real thing about it it would be very boring and repel people from getting it .
