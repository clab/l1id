Taking risks could be good for some people , and could be the worst thing that they do for some people .
It relies on faith .

taking risks may be good for some pepole because many people thinks that where there is a risk there are a lot of opportunity .
These people love to take a risk , and like to challenge with these risky things .
Also if you get lucky when you take risks you will open a new door for yourself , and you may be successful , and feel happy .
However , If you try somthing new , and you could not success you will feel mope , and everything in your life will distroyed .
In addition , when you take risk you will be stressed .
So keep away from taking risks , and do not try to do new thing that you do not know ho to do it .

On the other hand , doing what you already know how to do well is better than take a risk in life becuase when you take a risk you may lose every thing that you take a risk for .
Furthermore when you take a risk you may not success , and turn your previous successful to nothing , so people will forget your successful .
But you do what you know how to do well you will success , and feel happy .
So keep doing what you doing is better than take risks for reasons that you do't know if it will success or not .

In conclustion , It depends on lucky , and nobody want to fauil .
I think the effect of unsuccsseful is something that nobody can load .
and becuase of these reasons I do not agree with the statement that say `` successful people try new things , and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
