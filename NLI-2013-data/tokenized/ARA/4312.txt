I agree that the younge people have not help their communities .
There are many resons why young people dont particpate in community .
I will count them in this essay .

That thier parents give them .

Sconde they dont participate becasue of the educatin , at school there is not enough encourgment to do this kind of work which is giving to the community .
Also they are not touaght to give to communities and not just to take from it .
Moreover most the time they work as induvisals even when they work as group the work is dont mostly by one or two members only .
And all the members of the groups will be giving crdit for the work that one or two student have done .

Fainaly the young popoel dont give much to cummunites because of the life style that most of the poeple around the world have , which is the urban life style .
The urban life style cares about the indivisual family as four or five members like father , mother and the children .
But in the rural there is the big family which is the community that they live in and this creates the community spiret amonge the young people theand it will it grows with them as they grow older and they will pass it to thier children and so on .

in conclison , the young pople dose not paticipate in the community because of lack of time , education they get in school and because of the urban life s
