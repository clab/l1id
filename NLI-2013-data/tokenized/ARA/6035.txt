I do not agree with that statement , because in twenty years there will be more cars than now because of the people they will be more number than now .
For example if there is small family and they have only one car later after the sun or douater they will be adult should they have another car because they need to go to the university or the collage to study if it is far from the house .
Anyware if the people in the world they will increase the car must be to increase , and with dilatation of the building and in the distanse all of the people need the cars .
the cars it is very important in our life .
It is notlogicaly that we have all these streets and roods just to use there for twenty years .
Some countries did not develop enough to use cars proberly .
Therefore with the modern world the will be more and better injection .
