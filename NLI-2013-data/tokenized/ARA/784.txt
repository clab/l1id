I agree that a person who wants to be succesfull in his life must have a broad knowlegde of a vast majority of academic subject .
First of all when a person is in the process of having a coversation with any one he will have an idea of what to talk about during there discussion .
For example if you were taking to your dad 's freind who is a doctor that is specialised in the heart it would be useful to have some background of how the heart functions and its stucture .
It could also prove useful as genaral knowledge during day to day activities .
For example if you were asked to buy a certain product at a supermarket you would need to know how to determine whether this particular product is benefcial or not .
This could be achieved if the basic knowledge of business studies is available to you .
It could also help in your scocial life by allowing be to become more closer towards you .
This means that you would be able to gain and select form a larger range of people to become your friends .
Being specailised on certain area sometimes promotes bordem due to every day repetion of tasks .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects also has some disadvantages to it .
Firstly it promotes unspecialisation in people since they only have minmal knowledge in a certain subject .
It also resricts a person from having a job were he is good at and is specialised at .
It also makes a person seem unprofessional since he has no real skill to give to the working world and society itself therefore he/she has no contribution .
Also people who are specialised most of the time obtain a higher salary than people who are not professional or specialised .
