In the past , knowledge was not valued and spread as it is nowadays .
The people counted on their working capacities to ensure their food and necessities .
In our time , it is becoming , more and more , a necessity to be well educated , otherwise your opportunities to get a respectful job are very limited .
Manytimes , we appreciate those specialized people who can cover all the surounding criteria in a certain subject more then the people who have diversified their knowledge .

Both broad knowledge and specific subject knowledge are in need in our society and each one is characterized by a different set of benefits .
Specialization in one specific subject is a must in the research centers , in the universities and in the research development departments of the big companies .
Those persons are characterized by a very different and accurate knowledge in some fields which can lead to minimize errors and could lead to some creativity of new products or research methodologies .
Generally speaking , those people can find jobs much easily in the developped countries like the U.S , Canada , France ...

For example , if i will be able to get a PhD , most probably i will not return back to my native country since the opportunity to work for such qualified persons are very limited .
So before deciding if i will apply to this i should accept the next decision , which is to continue my life abroad .

Although specialization seems to be very good , many job opportunities in the developping and under developped countries can not hire such persons .
For them , such persons are considered as overqualified employees and they do not need their additional knowledge that they have gathered through their specialization .

They are mostly seeking in persons who can do many jobs in the same time .
So at this level , a person who has a broad knowledge of many academic subjects would most probably welcomed since he will be able to work on different and this exactly will satisfy the needs of the managers .
I give the example when i was working for the first time after i have my undergraduate studies as agricultural enginner : The manager accepted me , but not a master degree student because he is not ready to pay a little bit more for his knowledge ; he did n't need his qualifications .
Later i figured out that the manager hired me not just because i am an agricultural engineer but because i have great computer skills and because i have got some extra courses in marketing .
So my diversified knowledge permitted to me to get the job , while the other person , who has a master degree in agriculture was not accepted .

As a conclusion , both of the two concepts is valued ; we have always to weigh the benefits of each , clarify our needs and goals , and then to choose between specializing in one specific subject or trying to get a much broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
