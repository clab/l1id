Although students in the same class take same courses under identical circumstances in terms of instructor , teaching aids and experience , and assigned textbooks , two groups of students may arise after that course .
During and after the course , some students will focus on understanding ideas and concepts , while others will be content of accepting absolute facts undoubtly .
I belong to the first type of students , and hence I strongly agree with the statement .

When you take a course , whether it is at university or school , with intention in your mind to just receive passively new facts then to ga back home , then allow me to tell you that you are missing the point !
Students who want the instructor to merely plug in data and information into their brains in class , with no deep and profound interest in the topic , are on their way to become dummy as machines .
They will never raise relevant questions in lectures nor participate actively in any class discussion .
This , in effect , will lead them to the what so-called cramming .
Exam crammers may enjoy good results , in some situations , for a while , but they will regret it in the soon future .
I believe that learning is about understanding new material , questioning results and facts , knowing how things work or why they are the way they are , then moving to your own conclusions and evaluation .

On the other hand , if your purpose of taking any course is to comprehend it to the most , then you are on the right track .
Students who dive into this deeper level of understanding will excell , not only in academic life , but also in the professional one .
Thorough examination of the topic you are studying will get you beyond mathematical equations , if you are studying technology , or beyond clusters of words and paragraphs if you deal with literature .
Information will make much more sense to your mind , and you will feel the real power of knowledge when you study in order to understand , not just to pass the next exam .

In conclusion , understanding the underlying concepts and definitions behind any learning topic is more solid and lasting than going through facts quickly .
The benefits are promising and will become more evident in the students future .
