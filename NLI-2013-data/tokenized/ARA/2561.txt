In my opinion young people enjoy life more than old people do for many reasons .
A young person can do a lot of thing because he is physically halthy , can do a lot that old 's can not do and because he is young and no one will look at what is he donig .

A lot of people think that old people are enjoy the life more than young because they think they have experiance in life .
They think that this experiance will make them happy because they no what to do to be a happy person .
This may not be a good idea because even if old people have an experiance they will not be able to use this experiance .
They become old and harmfull .
They will not be able to do every thing .

As a young person I can do a lot of things .
there are many hapits to do in the daily life .
A young person can go running , play football , drive a race care and play a young people new electronic games .
This will be hard to old person to do or it may be do n't fit to an old person to do like electronic games .

For most young people they like to do hard or dangeruce activities .
Driving a race car in a real race can be very dangeruce for an old person he may get a hard attack .
Other thing that is young people can make a plannes for the fucure , they have the time that olds do n't have .

Finally , a young person can enjoy life more than old can do .
He have the ability , the advantege and the time .
For all old people they must have taken a young period and enjoy it .
So that it is time for the new generation .
