In modern statistic , 90 % of the public prefer to study specific knowledge .
In my openion , to suporte this , it is better to have specialize and specific knowedge for several reasons .
You will be able to organize your think , focus on specific details and increase the opportunity to offer a jub for every body .

First of all , if a student took chemestry as a his own major he is not going to be buildired between the other materials such as Physics , history etc .
So , his think will be related to Chemestry and he is going to be successful with his major .

Secondley , the student want to success in his major by giving his concentration to the material he studies .
As we can see , the student will be capable in his major .
If he took Music as a major beside Chemestry , he is going to struggle with these different sciences .

These days , everybody want a specific job .
So , if we give everybody the broad knowledge , all of them become qualified at the same rate which means lacking the chances to have a perfect job .
On the other hand , if we have students who are specialists in different knowledge , the oppourtunity to hav of , course , a job will increase
