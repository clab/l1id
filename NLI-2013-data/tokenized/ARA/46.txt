i disagree with this statement .
At the biggening if a person have a broad knowledge of many academic than he will know many things but the problem is that he can not do or work in a spesific topic .
that person will have only vague idias about many topic , and that mean that he can not do a spesifique thing .
In the other hand if a person is more specialized in one specific subject it will be better for him .
that person who is specialized in one topic will know all the sides of his subject , and will be a profesinal on that subject so he can work on that specific subject and be good .
her is an exampel of to brother the first know his working in a very big company and the seconde one is still looking .
how he become like that ?
The answear is that the first one was working hard on his specific subject and gotte his degree after a normal time of work and the seconde one was not sure of what he wanted and and keept changing topic each year .
will that lead him to no work , rach time he try to get a job he is not very informed on the topic .
i dont say that it bad to know many subject , no it good to have a general idia on many subject , but in order to secssed in life you will need to to be specialized in one specific subject .
this is my personal view there are people who will agree with me and other who want and i respect their point of view .
people are very worried about there futter so it better to be specialized in one specific suject , and after if you have time learn more .
in conclusion i say that to be specialized in one topic is better than to have broad knowledfe of many academic subjects .
