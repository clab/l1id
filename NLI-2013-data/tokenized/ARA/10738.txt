Successful people make it to where they are today because they try to make a change and they tried to do something with there lives .
I agree that successful people do have the right to try new things and to take risks because by the time they are done they have learnt alot more and gained alot more experience than any other person has .

People who are successful normally do take a risk because they take advantage of what they have sometimes and do n't realise what they have untill they lose it .
everybody knows what they do well , everybody has the chance in life to figure out what it is they do well and when ever they do figure it out , there not happy .

Everybody loves to take a step further into life that 's why we take risks and try new things .
If a person never tried taking a risk he or she would never make it anywhere in life because they would be stuck in the the same world they started off with .
Life is all about risks .
For example a successful business person has a company but wants to make more money and his only way of making more money is by selling it should he take the risk of that or not ? .
By taking that risk he can either make alot of money and start an even bigger company or lose the company but still have money to start a new company but not as big as the first one , this is where you start to think about making a Loss or Profit .

It is never a crime to take a risk , really if it is , then you are actually doing yourself a favour because not only are you helping yourself but your making your life alot easier .
it 's never too late to try .
