Advertisement is the most effective and powerful way of communication .
Companys and corporates spends big a mount of assts on advertisments to make sure that people will buy their products .
In my opinion , advertisements make products seems much better than they really are .

In order to convence costomers of buying certain products , comanys have to convince them that this product is effective in doing whatever it is suppose to do and that what they see is what they get .
Company 's will have to make that product looks like it serves its porpuse and more , regardless of being honest or dishonest .
An adversitment will exaggurate the quality and the effectiveness of a product in order to be convensing .
For example , Some products like hair shampoos have a woman with a long silky hair that emplays that your hair will look like this if you use that shampoo .
This is misleading becuase a shampoo will not make your hair long silky and shiny as shown in advertisment .
Therefore the adversitment in this case is not doing what it is suppose to do .

Most of dvertisements are dishonest and misleading .
When people see and advertisment and decide to buy it , they expect to have what they have been promised to have .
For example , some airlines advertisement say fly with us we are always on time , while when you expect that promise , you end up being delayed 5 hours .
This dishonet misleading adversitment leads to resentment and the company looses its credibility .

Adversitments are not always what they seem to be .
Comanys and corporate will do anything to mak their products look better than they really are in order to get as many customers as possible .
The most effective way is to communicate thier products to the costomers through adversitments .
Adversitments work on a consious and a subconsious level , therefore people should use their critical thinking when looking at an adversitment becaus what they see is not usually what they get .
