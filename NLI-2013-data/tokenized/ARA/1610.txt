According to Carl Marx : '' A person older than you in one minute is a hundred time wiser '' .
Nowadays learning is a priority in every civilised man 's life .
No one could live in th 21st century without having a minimum of khowlege .
To be a succesfull and wise person your khowlege should be widespread in severlas fields and deep in one of these domain .

In this modern way of living , working in any field oblige you to be knowledeable in many domains .
For example a person that is managing a juice industry should khow about plant managing , mechanical engeneering ( to fixe the machines ) , finance , marketing ...
That shows hoe knowlege has no limites and every one of us should seek for learning as much as he can .
A broad khowlege increases the number of fields we can work in .
That 's the only way we could developp our potential and increase our chances to succed in this challeging and competing woking fields .

On the other hand if a person is not specialised in a specific subject she ca n't be a leader in any working domain .
every one of us should have not only a broad khnolege , but also a deep study in a certain field .
For exmple this same plant manager should show to the employees that he is superior than them in a certain field like marketing .
That knowlege will help him to find new advertising tricks that will increase the sales .
In the marketing part of this industry he will be a leader and will be respected by every won .

In summary , both broad khowlege and specialisation are important .
The first provides a bigger choice of working fields and the second gives us the oppurtinity to be a leader in a certain domain .
