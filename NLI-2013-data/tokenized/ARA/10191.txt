I agree with the idea that success is mostly acheived when people venture into new terrotories and explore things that they may not know so well .
Usually trying new things or venturing into uncharted territory results in outcomes that can be extremely good or bad for an indiviudual .
When pharmaceutical companies invest in new drugs , or inventions they are well aware that they might lose the money that they have invested .
However , they are also aware of the fact that the risks have to be taken by someone in order for success to happen .

People who take risks often try new things whilst being aware of and for the most part having experienced great losses .
However , what makes a person succeed is the ability of this person to handle the new and risky .
Without the risks that many took in science and in experimentation , many of the simple diseases known to us now would be fatal .

If people stuck to what they knew and everyone contiued doing the same thing .
Then the world would be a stagnant place where not much will change .
People who take risks and change what it is that is known to them allow new areas to be explored , therefore , becoming experts in things that were previously new .

We currently live an evolving world , where new discoveries and inventions are made on a daily basis .
In order for a person to live in this world they have to prove their ability to contribute to it .
In many ecomonies jobs are scarce and people struggle to feed themselves and their families .
People who want to be outstanding or who want to deliver more to this world find themselves having to think outside of the box , and assume more personal risk .

Success may vary for each individual .
What remains the same is the fact that in order to excel in something a person has to expand of that which is known to him or her .
Expansion cannot be achieved if people limited themselves to what they felt they new .
It is when one tries something new that they might realize new abilities and strengths within themselves .
