To success in this life , we have to do all what is possible and sometimes even the impossible .

I agree that successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because the evolution of our life requires this .

To be a succeful person you should be tenace and lucky .
Suppose you are tenace , you work with patience and perseverance furthermore you need luck to success but luck is under control .

To success you need time and favorable conditions , our life becomes more and more rapide and the evolution of humankind will not wait until you arrive to your goal , therefore to go with the prevailing movement you are obliged to take som risks and to try new things .

In fact many systems and many methods were , for thier inventors , just a try or a risk at the beguinig , now they are accurate and subect of reference .
Their owners were couragous .

In other words , you should be couragous and ready to the all consequences of this act .

However its not easy to take a risk or try a new thing , you have no idea about what will happen and the consequences may be dangerous , but as I said before you hjave to try and take risk if you want success .
