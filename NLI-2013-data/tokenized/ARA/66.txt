I personally agree that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects would be a good idea .
Students will be familiarized about broad knowledge of many academic subjects to increase his chances of getting a job after graduation or maybe during his studies .
Also , it might enable him after graduation to handle different tasks , which will eventually help him to be promoted faster and get higher performance evaluation .
Moreover , knowing many academic subjects will help all of us to create our own business upon graduation .

I graduated from the King Fahd University in Saudi Arabia back in year 2000 with a BS degree in the electrical field .
I took a broad knowledge of many academic subjects including power , control , communication , and from other fields .
It took me only one week to join Saudi Aramco company , which is considered one of the largest Oil producers in the world .
When I joined the comany , my management evaluated my qualifications .
They discovered that I have braod knowledge of many technical subjects .
My management nominated me to work in several investigation committess since I knew many technical subjects .
Also , I have been assigned to perform my technical studies in the power , control and communciations fields .
Recenly , I have been nominated to work in one of the largest projects that Saudi Aramco will construct , which is Manafia Project .
This project is considerd a mega-project and it will start in year 2007 .
This assignment is one of the challenge assessments that I might face .
However , it is considered a golden chance .

I presenting my story to demonstarate how broad knowledge of technical subject might create golden chances for us .
Therefore , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to be specalized in one specific field .
