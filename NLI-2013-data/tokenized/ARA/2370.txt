Who can ever fogot when he was achild , We had to be older people .
If we had achance to choose i think most of people will choose to back to be a child again .
Because i was anoty girl i 'd like to be a chiled for arest of my ife and as ay .

Iam actually with that opinion that young people enjoy lif emore tha older people , Physically young people have more energy to spend , more activity to doing all the moves , Not just setting and look like old people , Add to that the sens of discovering and all that questions in them mindes .
For example when you go to the garden and take aclose look to the people around you , You can see old and young people but whats the differents between them , Genarally you will see young people running , playing .
walking , and shouting .
In the ather side you will see old peope settng , relaxing , and looking around .

If we look deepy for our sociaties we will findout that every boody agree with that opinion some where inside him , usually `` How old are you ? '' this is the first question you hear it when you apply to any job , Suppose you are amanegar of any company and you want to hire an employ who you will choose old or young man ? .

Thats why iam wit that opinion try to enjoy your life when you are young , Believe me the day that go will never come back again . , Dont waste your time with sadness and anger try to love all the people around you try to give your best to make the athers happy , time is like the sore if you didnot cut it cut you .
