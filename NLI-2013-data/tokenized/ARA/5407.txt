No body can deny that advertisements are very usefull and important for us nowadays because it helps us to know about the new products and which are good and which are bad .
Some advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .

In fact , I disagree with that the advertisment cheat the customers and tell them that products are usefull and they are not for many reasons .
Fist , this advertisment make me spend my money in wronge way instead of tell me he truth and help me buy appropriate things .
If I am poor man and see by the TV or radio that products are usefull , I will buy it and if it is not good I waste my money and can not buy what is usefull for me .
In addition to that , this kind of advertisment effect the good products because when the customer see the bad product is better than good productm , he will buy the bad products and do not buy the good product , so the company will be lose their money although its product is the best .
Furthermore , they will encourge bad company to produce the bad products because they know that if they advertise for their products well , they will not lose any thing but they will collect a lot of money which leads to encourge people to cheat and be dishonest in their society .
Moreover , when the people know the truth about this company of advertisemnt , they wil lose their credability with people and will not trust them any more .
In UAE there is company which do this for some products because the company of this products give it a lot of money but when the people know the truth they told the authority and they close this company .

Finally in my opinion , the companies of advertisement should tell the people the truth and work to help them not to cheat them and then they will have alot of money for sure because all people kmow that this company work for people and know their credability .
