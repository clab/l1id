Some people beleive that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Others beleive that older people enjoy life more than young people .
I beleve that young people enjoy life more than older people , I have some points suggests my opinion .

First , young people have healthier bodies than older people and this helps young people to reveal the world by traveling every year to a new country with a new adventures while older people do not have the ability to travel too much so they prefer staying at home .

Second , somebody may say that older people can do whatever they want their sequence days because they are retired from their works so they are not busy .
But still young people beside working and getting tired they can go outside every day like shopping going restaurants enjoy playing many sports like tennis , soccer , and basketball .
Young people 's life is so interesting while the older people are so bored

Third , young people have the ability to read more and to reveal new knowlege , while most of the older people must wear glasses and sometimes they get confused to read the words and to see them clear .
Also the older people are more angry and nervous while the young people are not .

Sadly , every individual will grow and rise till the death , I mean that the young people will reach the level of eldness , so I advise the young people to enjoy their life before getting older .
