Knowledge is one of the most important things a person can gain throughout his lifetime experience .
It can be considered as the tool to be used throughout his life in order to prove himself as an effective person in his soceity and surrounding .

Some people believe that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject , and others believe the opposite .
I personally agree with this statement since having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can further strengthen the person 's personality and broaden his horizons .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can help the person improve his thinking skills and his creative vision .
I strongly believe that all areas of knowledge complete each other , so if a person knows about Math , Science , History , Art , Music , Language and other areas of knowledge , he will be able to view life and its different situations in a better way than a person who is narrow minded by only one specific subject .

Although some people may think that speicalizing in one specific subject can be better , since the person get to have a closer look at the subject and get hold of every single detail of it and become an expert in it , i believe that in order to become a better person and improve different dimensions of one 's personality , the person should experience different situations and different ways of knowledge that will all help in the building of one 's thoughts and beliefs .

When thinking of that subject , I actually realise how effectively the International Baccalaureat Dimploma program has helped me gain a vast and broad knowledge of many academic subjects and areas of knowledge , which have surely helped me build my personality and become a better critical thinker and a well rownded person .

Finally , I belive that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is very important , but not to forget the fact that if one has a certain area of knowledge he/she is interested in , there is no problem in learning more about it and going into its details as long as a broad knowledge of the various areas of knowledge and issues is present at the same time .
