Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , I disagree with this statement for the following reasons :

Every age differs from the one before it and everyone should know that every age has its own unique way in thinking , learning and solving problems so what we did and doing to our communitiy now is different than our olders did to there at there age so they will think that we as a young people are giving nothing to our communitiy because it is different than what they did when they were at our age .

New technologies is spreading all over the world in a super fast ways that is helping the community to improve and to facilitate life and with the help of young people these technologies will be spreading and improving even faster with there new ideas cause as usual new ideas and revoloution ideas gets created from a young person , just like when an owner of an old factory refuses to use the computrized inventory system and stick to the old one that is maybe effictive but not as efficiant as the new system is .

No one can forget the great things our older people did and achived to make our life more easy .
but younger people will help in their communitiy because it is a must and life will stop if they didnt , and as usual when young peolpe grow up they will repeat the same statement that younger people are not helping their communities because thats the circle of life .
