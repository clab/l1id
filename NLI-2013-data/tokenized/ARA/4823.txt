I agree with the follwing statement that said `` most adertisment make products seem much better than they really are .
Most of these advertisement decorates the producs and make it the best product , even when it is not true .
Bcause it will give penifit for the company that makes the adevetisment and the company that has the products

In our life , when we watch TV , we see alot of advertisment that how they gain alot of money .
For example , In arabian shows especially in ramadhan ( that special months in arabian celander that people fasting during that month ) you see alot of shows that attract people so the company for advertisment takes this chance to insert their advertising durin these shows .
As a result of thic concept , they can gain alot of money .

Second , most new products when they want to be noticable or famous they tent to the advrtisment to succeede the product .
not only to succeede the product , some company that find that people do not intersted in their product use advetising for that product , they tend to this way to be do not losing their products .

In conlousion , this statment `` most advertisment make prouducts seem much better than they really are '' is true .
that alot of people use advertisment to be foumous and every one know it and also all people love the money and like to gain alot of money .
usaully my parent told me that the money and being foumous are the decoration of our life .
