To start with , nowadays theres alot for people to do in there life starting form jobs , adventuers and alot of other stuff that people can enjoy , but it always depends on the type of person and type of thing , it smetimes involves some or alot of risk , some times its dangour and sometimes its financial resources that matters , watever the thing is theres a part of people that are willing to do it and try it as a new thing in there life and some people and too much afraid .

An advantge of trying new things in life is that any person will gain experiance form anything new thing he will try , because u xcan always learn from ur experiances no matter how large or small they are , theres always a lesson from the thing ur trying , it may be a hurtfull lesson or a happy one but God havent create anything with no lesson , this new thing u try may affect your personality or your life as a whole but it will always show u something in the long run , as an example taking a new job may be good for your finaicial resource and ur personality , but the risk takin that ur family may accomadate in the new city is big so some people may take it but others might be too afraid to do it .

One disadvantge of trying evrything is , some people may be crazy enough to do anything without qauntitative or qualitative study and they end up losing l0ts of thingts as a person or money or sometimes there life , as an example a guy may want to experiance the safari hunting and dragged his friend in it without studying the situation carefully , he may end up losin his friend by getting killed there .

In my opinion its always good to try new thing but with prior studyting from everyside , because as i see life its too short for people to hide in there houses and got scared from everything so u must always take the risk and must always deal with the consequences
