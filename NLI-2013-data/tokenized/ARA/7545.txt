Do you think that the best thing is to travel with a tour guide ?
thats agood question .
I one of the larg forest there was agrop of people with out a guide and they have been loste in the forest so all of theme dead when they lost .
FOR THAT agree with that thing because several reason .

The first reason , that he now the plase and the good plases .
the guide will let you se the best plases there .
For exsampl , in the city he will let you ee the famouse plases like musiums .
thats what will let heme very intreting .

Another reasone , that he will let you never be lost .
you will have fun without afraide of geting lost at all in the country .
If you be alon you must ask the poeple about the diriction , or the plases to have fun in it .
He will be help ful with that thing .
He will speek ith them and you can learn from him .

Last reason , that you will be without responseblity .
When you want to do any thing he know every thing and he will do it and you will not hink how to do it , or where to do this thing .

However , some poeple will say that if you travel alone you will have alot of fun .
They also say that you will know the way , and you will learn alot of things .
For example , you will learn the cultur of othere country , and you will learn who to speek .
Not only that you will find it exsited .

In conclusion , you can say that traveling with a guide is more better than traviling alone .
In my opinion the guide is the best thing in the travel to be spicifice .
These are some of the reason that you can have when you travel with a guide .
