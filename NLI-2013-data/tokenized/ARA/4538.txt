Actually I strongly agree with that most advertisements make produts seem much better that they really are .
which is really unfair for the consumer to be mislead to believe that this product they are advertising is great and can perform its action perfectly .
Simply they make you feel that you can never live without it ( even if you do n't really need it )
And they usually pray on children , teenagers and people that tend to believe everthing .

Advertisements usually use to techniques , first one , convincing you that this product ideal for you and that it perform its job with efficency , precice and with minimal effort from your side .
Like for example Swiffer Duster , they mentioned in the advertisement that it wipes all the dust completely in one strok specially on tight places , ofcourse much better than your usual old duster , and that it is stong enough to get the whole job done with minimal effort from your side that you would like to dust all day long .
While in reality , and I speak from my personal experiance , It dos n't really remove all the dust you have to pass it several time on the same area to ensure that it 's free from dust .
also id you used it in tight spaces the duster might attach its ends to each other making it hard to clean the area in question and the last proplem with tis duster that you need to use several dusting parts ( since the dusting parts are disposable ) to clean the whole house and not only one attachment as they inferd .

The second technique is that they try to show you that you ca n't live without it and that your life was really hard and need help before you know about this products , They do this by stating all all the benifits from using this product and completely egnore to state the defects of their product and even mislead you to believe that it does n't have any defects .
An example of this technique is advertising for durgs specially antidepressant drugs and sleeping aid drugs .
people might not even need this drugs but by hearing about them and their benefits all the time they start to think that they might really need them when thet do n't .

I wish their was more supervision on the advertisement so that they would send more accurate complete informations about their products and to decrease the amount of drug product advertisements by incresing the spectatue awarness .
