In the next twenty years there will not be a fewer cars in my opinion there will be more cars in the next twenty years and there is a reasons for that .

First reason is pepole in this world will increase and thats mean increasing in the cars they need to use , for example ; some cityes give the license driving on the age of sixteen as a result there will be a more cars in the street , Second reason is pepole needs cars so they can get there things and go to work and such thing like that .

For example I will talk about a family have a four persons how many cars they need ?
Propably not less the two cars and thats another reason why I think there will be more cars in the future , to slove the problem i think we should make a train , bus staions .

in the summary i thnk more pepole thats mean more cars and i thnk there will be a more cars in the next twenty years .
