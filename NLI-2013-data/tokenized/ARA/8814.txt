There is an Arabic saying that says `` understanding the the question is half of the answer '' .. i agree with this opinion because the main deffrints between humans and computer isthe mind .
any computer can memorize , any flass memory , memory card or any other electronic device can store informations .
On the other hand it can not understand these informations , but our human brain can understand them .
it is very importan to search for facts , because while searching you learn other things .
You read books , articles and web search , you will gain more and more .
when you learn a fact you are not doing any thing new .
You are just getting what others accomplished .
I am not saying facts are not important but we do not have to relay on them .
We have to understand look for more so we can then built new facts .

BILL GATES for example developed him self he thought and thought , and he understood ideas then he invested Microsoft .
he stared for nothing and reached the top by his brain ( thinking and understanding ) we wont gain any new if we did not understand whats going on .
If u memorize there will always be poeple above you .
Japanese developed themselves because they understood and thought .
While other third world countries are remaining the same because they do not think , they only get the informations from other poeple .

Before 100 years ago no one thoght that a human will walk on the top of the moon , but understanding the idea made us think and now days we have NASA .

U can learn facts sometimes but u have to understand them .
The deffrint between a smart student and an oddnary student is how he thinks and understands .
Physics does not depend on memorizing .
niether do Math .
they need understanding and they need thinking .
On the other hand learning hestory reqires to learn facts .
i prefer going for siencebecause its like a compatition .
you need to think and use your brain .
thats my opinion and again my choise is to understand ideas .
