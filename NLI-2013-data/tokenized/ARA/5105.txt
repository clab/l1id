Every business or company , local or multinational advertises .
The reason they advertise is to attract customers which is important for every business since the reason for starting a business is to make money and the money comes people who wish to buy what the business or company has to offer .

To attrack people or to bring the product that the business offers to their attention , businesses advertise .
Advertising can be in a newspaper or on television .
Whereever the company wishes to advertise they must be honest about their products or services .

Some company 's advertisements say the product can do things it can not do just to impress the people and to get them to buy their product .
For an example , a restaurant that advertises offering a certain type of food and when you visit the restaurant it turns of that that type of food is not on the menu .
Is this case this is illegal .
The government in this case must stop this type of advertising .

However , some advertisements use a technique to make their product more attractive .
They do not lie .
They use certain colours or camera angles to make their product look more interesting .
This makes the business successfull because it attracts customers and impresses buyers and at the same time they do not lie .
This is the art of advertising .

A good advertisement requires thinking and creativity and skill .
They should make a product look better than it really is .

I agree that some advertisments might make the products look better than they really are .
However , there is two ways it can do so , the right way or the wrong way .
