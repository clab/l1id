Advertisements has a lot of effects on our behaviour when it comes to choose certain products .

I have a lot oe reasons to believe that

first , like when we watch advertisements about chocolate and cigarettes , are they really telling us the truth about the chocolate , or the ciggarate of course not we only watch the adds that encourage us to buy them , we know chocolates behind a lot of healh troubles and over weight problems we faith now in the USA .
We also know that cigarates is nuber one killer but with advertisement that make them great we lured to buy Secondly , advertisements can make certain product very popular , which in realaty has a harmul effect on the human eing .
For example , we are bombarded every day with new and more sophicated cell phones in which some of them should be band because some researhes prove t this new cell phones emits some kind of radiations which in the long run can cause cancer ..
But still around and popular because the way the advertisements appeal to the customers and the way they butify certain products make it around for a long time Moreover , the advertisements during the time of election .
This advertisements can make you change your opnion about certain candidate , and you might choose him also he is not the right person but because of the advertisements and the way they change the truth and the realaty we end up taken the wrong decision .

All in all , I believe that advertisements can really create a product sound more than it deseves , advertisements cn
