Advertisments are helpful for all companies , it helps them market their product in a fascinating way that will convince others .
With all the help a one minute show advertisement is carring to a company , i agree that most advertisements make produts seem much better than they really are .

People who get amused with a certain advertisment that pop out on the television every couple of minutes , in my opinion these people are sick , because they get attracted to a certain product without even knowing what does this product consists of .
Companies try to win our attention with a silly advertisment to convince us , and i ca n't say they dont gain our attention .
Most advertisments make products look much better , and the prove is that when you buy the prcoduct you get shoked with the type of quality and the exaggerated advertisment done for it .
In my opinion all companies sell the same products without even caring wether the product is useful or not , befefitible or not .
Manegers may forget about their conciouns and work for the aim of money .

In conclusion , be wise and pay attention to what is going around you , because you might reach a certain point that you might lose yourself following dreams that does not even exist .
