From what I learned , knew and heard and told throughout this life .
It is much more importnat for a person or a student in this situation to understand idears and concepts than to learn facts .

To learn facts you have to understan the concepts and the idea of what you are learning .
Therefore as an example : a person can learn a fact from a book about the world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginig .

Every person have brains therefor , it should be used .
Logic and commen sence are all maters for understanding ideas and cocepts .
A person can memorize a book but that doent mean that the person understood it .

People should use their brains to understand things .
For example : Newtons laws of motion , `` for every action there is a reaction '' .
A person doesnt need to learn this method and no its facts , but a person can use his brain and a littel bit of commen sence and understand the idea rather than searching for its facts .

However learning facts is important for a person to do , but not as important as understandin the ideas and learning the concepts .
Facts are important for example when a person rights a paper , he or she needs facts to prove what they are saying .
while a person can teach something if he didnt understand the ideas of what he is teaching even if he facts about what he teaches that is not good enough .

As I said before a person needs his brain , logic , and commen sence .
Therfore understanding ideas and learning concepts are much important than learning facts .
