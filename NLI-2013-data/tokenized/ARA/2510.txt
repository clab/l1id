I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Both young people and old people can enjoy the life , but young people can enjoy life more than the old one .

Everyone start his life as a child , then he gradually start the young people life .
Most of young people miss thier childhood life .
They are sure that they can not enjoy life as they were doing in their childhood .
When they are young they have more responsibality in life .
However , at this time , as normal , they have more power and more ability to do works .
They have the power and improved mind that can help them to do more and more fun .
For example , they can do car racing , mountains climbing , sky diving ...
and much more which other ages people can not do .

Old people are more likely like children .
At that age they need help aproximatly as the child need .
They became more depandent again .
they can not do as much work as they can before .
They no more have the power they were had , nor in their childhood not in their young days .
They may have fun , but they get tired more quick and need more time to rest .

Enjoying life needs power , endurance , indepandent , strenght , activity and much things that older people do not have or have but in less level than young people have .

For more clearifying , when we take dance as an example , can old people dance as good as young people ?
or can they enjoy sex as young people do ?
can they laugh as young people do ?
can they do advantures as young people do ?
and keep going !

In conclusion , I think that young people can enjoy life more than old people .
Because of what I said before and also because young people can be more excited and more active than old people .
