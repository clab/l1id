I 'm studying mathematics and computer science and I found it very much related fields of studying .
I 've some knowledge of mathematics and computer science because mathematics is the basis to computer science .

I think knowing ( studying ) deep about one or two related majors is better then having a shallow knowledge about a vatiaty of bounch of majors .
That is because of several reasons I can mention some of them like Any one know that the development in sciences is never ever stops and having new things each day .
So in order to a person to increase his knowledge in the majors he is interested in will required from him to have an incrrideble abilities because as a human Beings it is impossible to have a constant knowledge that can be retrieved and reviewed in our brain .
That was one point another is due to our average age which will not let us to have a very good knowledge about cuple of sciences keeping in mind that when you want to finish your undergraduate study you spend about 22 to years of your age and if you want to complete your graduate study you need an extra 6 years which will be then 28 years of your life after that you need to show your ability in what you studied which required from your years and years of research .
anther thing is that concentration is the most important factor in order to a person to be successful otherwise as a human being he will get lost and will not have a clear idea about what he is hopping to be .

As a society we are a number of persons and each one has to dump a certain gap in order to be a good society and to acheive our qoals as one society whcih follows in acheiving our goals as a one person in a society .
