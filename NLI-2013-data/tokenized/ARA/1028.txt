In the follwing essay I am going to write about the difference between the general and specific acadamic knowledge .
I am writting about this topic because pepole are conflicting a lot upon it .
To reach my opinion in this subject iam going to first clearfy the points that support my opinon .
then i will include a personal example from my own experiance .
Then i will demonstrate a more general examole to support my opinion .
At the end of my essay i will restate my opinion and summerize my findings .

I beleive it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
ell having a broad knowlede is much better than having specific knowledge because a broad kowledge is much more common than a specific one .
tj \ his is specially the case in durring the last stages of studies in school .
where some schools make the students choose ther feild of specialization in such an early stages which they are not yet ready to make the dission in their life at that time .
for that they specify the courses that they take under a specific feild and prevent them from taking subjects from other feilds .
this effects student alot in their future so it is much better for them to have general knoledege than specific one .

however , i have suffered this problem by my self where iam know a twelvth gread student specialized in the feild of medicne and from the last year i did n't take any physics or computer seince courses .
you may think that it is easier that way but trust me it is not where know i have chnged my mind from medince to graphic deigning and i am having huge problem in my application for collage and this is sttoping my way of developmant and i truly hope to have a solution for that probelm soon .

this is not the case for me only but there are many other people in the world that are having the same problems .
A graduate friend of my mother had actully studied in the collage a very specifed feild that could n't counter for her any good realated job but she is setting home with no job to do .
By that we can see clearly the effect of very specified knowledege can harm a person 's future .

i have reached the end of my essay where i can say again that i am totally against specific feild subject studies specially in last stage if school .
Noting that having a more a broad knowledege is more useful and let us always put in mind that a good leader hanve enogh knowledeg about every thing in life .
Also a broad knowlege would affect the future of a person more effectivly to make a person choose his future correctly and more effectivly ,
