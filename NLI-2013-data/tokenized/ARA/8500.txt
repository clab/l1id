I belive that it is much more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I feel that it is useless if students rely on memorizing facts only , this is because as life goes on , what sticks to our minds is what we understand and comprehend , and not what we siply memorize .

generally speaking , it is very difficault to memorize a fact without first understanding it .
Take the process of photosynthesis in plants as an example , I remember very well trying to memorize all the complicated steps and stages involved in this process without first understanding them , and what did i get ?
nothing .
It was a complete waste of time and energy .
Yet when i went back to my biology teacher , and after explaining it to me , i found it much easier to memorize and comprehend .
hence to me personally , undersatnding the ideas and concepts is a must-do before even thinking of starting to `` learn the facts ''

As we go through every experince in life , whether it is a learning experience , or just an every day experience , we make sure to understand what is going on around us , hence we try as hard as we can to get involved .
When we simply learn facts , we are not involved in the actual process of learning , and we cannot therefore enjoy that feeling of pride that a person gets when understanding a challenging task or peice of knowledge .
For exapmle , if a student memorises a mathemetical question , it would be a complete wate of energy and time , yet when that student truly understands that task , he/she will never forget it and will positively benifit from that true learning experience .

Even when we talk about the regular day-to-day tasks that one always goes through , we see , again , that it is a very important to understand a task before memorizing it .
Take the simple process of tying a shoe !
It is very important that the child knows the basic idea of that simple process and watch it several times analysing it , before actually learning those simple facts .

finally , we conclude that it both understanding the concepts and learning the facts are ways of learning that at many time cannot be separated .
I believe that understanding the ideas and concepts are still more important as they are the first step in the process of learning .
