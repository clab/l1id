A successful person is a person who succeeds in probably everything life throws at him .
Some people say that successful people are limited to doing what they already know how to do best .
As for me , I think a successful person is one who is not afraid to take risks and and try new things .

As mentioned above , a successful person is one who succeeds in life , and that ca n't be proved unless that person tries new things andtakes the risk , otherwise , if that person is afraid to take risks , then what 's the point of his success ?
Mean while some people say that a successful person is the one who does only what he does best .
There I strongly disagree , because for a person to be successful , he/she should take risks and try new things even if he/she fails at completing the challenge he/she is facing .
That person -- in my point of view -- is a successful person ; not the person who succeeds in every thing he does , but the one who takes new risks , face new challenges , try everything in life and face the concequences ; which may be tough but in the end they will be rewarding in every thinkable way .

On the other hand a failure would be the person who is afraid to try new things , afraid to take new risks , and afraid to face new challenges .
A failure is the person who thinks he is successful but is actually limited to things he/she thinks he/she does best .

In conclusion , poeople who succeed in life are niether afraid , nor meant to be afraid of taking risks and facing challenges and so on .
While those who fail are the ones who think that they are successful but do n't try new things and do n't take risks in life .
Those are the true failures .
