Some people believe that successful people sould try new things and take risks .
Others do n't .
Personally , I ca n't totally agree with both .
For one reason , successful people should face new things to be more skillful and adept .
Moreover , they ca n't have the same routine evryday .
On the other hand , they should focus on what they are good at to enhance and improve their ambitions and dreams .

For the second reason , I find it delightful and glamorous to take risks specially for successful people .
Because they have to be astute and wise and that will appeal by collecting data by having a new experince and a new risk .

For the third reason , sometimes they should'nt take damage risks .
For example , I once heared that their was a wise successful person who went to the tropical forests to take a new hazard .
Unfortunatly , he ended up dead .
So vividly , their are limits by having risks .
Moreover i think it is compulsory to know them .

For the forth reason , sometimes successful people should pursue their happiness .
Because I find it outstanding to congregate and gather by having new risks .
Plus it may lead you to your own ambition .
For example , I was out once with family and friends I was scared of sky diving but they forced me to play it and I intrestingly I 've liked it alot .
Moreover , I play ski diving evry month now .

Eventually , I think trying new things has an amaizing features amaizing .
However , successful people should focus on the things that they know how to do well too .
