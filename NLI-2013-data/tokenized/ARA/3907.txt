Nowadays young people are very busy with everything that is going on out there in the world .
Technology is one of the most important things that is making them busy , such as internet , video games , television and alot more .
It seems to be that they spend so mush time playing and using these things without knowing how much time they are wasting .
You see them play video games for hours , but do nothing for their communities .
There are so much to do and so much to give but ignorance is the problem .

Children must be tought in school how to help and give , but the first place to learn that is at home .
Parents does n't know the importance of teaching their children how to help with their communites .

Children should do charity work and they also should help poor people and people with physical and mental disabilities .
Parents should plant in them the beauty of giving , helping and caring .

also teenagers , they should learn that to .
now all they care about is what to wear and where to go and whats new in fashion .
i know they are teenagers and they should live their age but this doesnt hold them from helping their communities .

there are so many stuff to do for their communities especialy her in Saudi Arabia .
so i strongly agree with the statment .
i think that we should take this problem more serious because the way young people are now is not the way we want them to be n the future .
as a start i will talk to many people i know who can help me in this case and hopefully i will make a change in my community and i am sure that many children and young people will respond if we talk to them the rght way .
