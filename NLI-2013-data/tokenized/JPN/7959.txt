While some people who like traveling alone disagree with that opinion , but I totally agree with that opinion that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I have two reasons for this .
They are reliability and gurantee .

First , travel with tour guide has reliability for time and schedule .
When i go to travel alone , I sometimes miss a transportation what we need to get on or a park I want to visit is closed .
But if we go to travel with tour guide , we can not miss it and we can visit there .
I hate to worry about anything except from enjoying .
When I go to travel to see something I want , we do not know about when it is open or close even though I study before , it might be suddenly close .
we can not reach the purpose of that tour .

Second , I have certainly gurantee which is kind of insurance in travel with tour guide .
Though sometimes we have a sick such as headache and cold even though heart diseases , if we are with the tour guide , he takes us to the proper hospital or the place to rest .
That is a big useful in travel .
when also we have a possiblity to meet accidents such as car accident and something mine stolen , he will contact with local police and might get back .
In terrible situation such as a sick or accident , we can rely on the tour guide .
On the other hand , if we go to travel alone , we can not rely on anyone , so we should communicate with your stranger and negotiate .
That needs vast work and getting exhauseted .

In conclusion , when I go to travel , I am always together with my tour guide .
It is the most useful way for us to enjoy our travel .
Thus I would go to travel ina group led by a tour guide .
And I recommend you to go to travel with a tour guide for your most happiness .
