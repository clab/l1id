I agree with this statements .
Because to have many knowledge is useful .
It can be materials of chatting , and have interests for many things .
You can talks with many people in many categolies .
If you know a lot of things , you might to try many things .
For example , when you got fired your job , you could find another job which you have interest , maybe .
And a person , who have a knowledge of many kind of subjects , might help other people using his/her knowledge .
Anyway , I think to have a lot of knowlage is not to be waste .
I like the person who knows many things .
It 's interesting .
