I agree the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and conceps , though facts are essential to learn some subjects such as history .
In this following statement I would like to disucss the importance of understanding ideas and concepts .

Firstly when student understand ideas we can diversify through this ideas .
For example , students are wondering where the ideas come from and how they think about it .
After they undestand ideas and then when have a discussion class to diversify the ideas , they may start to think about it more carefully and desirably .
In this sence students can broaden their minds and views .
This process encourge them to learn more and may start to have an interest in a certain topic .
Thus , they like to learn at the end of it .
Understaing ideas are very valualbe for students to learn .

Secondly , I belive it is more practial to understand ideas than to learn just about facts .
After graduating school students have a job and work to do for their life .
Whatever occupation it is valualbe to understand ideas and concepts .
Becase in real world it demands the ability of analysis and evaluation resulting from undestanding ideas .
Ability of analysis and evaluation is the key to be successfull in the world such as resech programm for teachers or sales profit for company or organization related to some industry .
For example , we normally solve the problem the cause and effect to analyze exactly what happenes the accidents after undestanding ideas and concepts .
As a saleperon , I always need to some What I have stated so far is to proved that I agree the statement .
I agree with the statement in the above the reasons .
