I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reasons .

First of all , driving cars will spend more money than other public traffics because the price of car fuels , gasoline and gas oil , will be raising .
For example , I remember that in 2003 when I was in my first year at Showa-Shell-Sekiyu , a large oil company in Japan , gasoline price of Japanese market was less than one dallor .
However now , it is raised about one half dollars .
As the above example shows , driving cars will spend more money than other public traffics .

Second , people will be thinking about environment more deeply and make a new low that limited the number of cars .
For example when I was a eleventh grader at Okayama Joto High School , a public high shool in Japan , I was able to swim in the river next to my high school after school .
But now , the river has been very duty because the new road was made by the river and a lot of drivers throw away their garbage in the river .
At last , our city makes a new low of emitting from the gas oil cars .
If the number of cars had been increasing , the beautiful environment would have lost away .
As the above example demonstrates , people will be thinking about environment more deeply and make a new low that limited the number of cars .

In conclusion , I strongly agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
