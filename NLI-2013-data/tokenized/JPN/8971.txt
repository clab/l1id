I think that it is more important for the students to learn the ideas and the concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The reason of ideas and the concepts are more important is that learning a certain subject will be much easier to be understand by students .

Students have different ways that they learn .
Some of them learn from facts , but most of them learn from ideas and the concepts .
Most of the time the facts can be difficult to understand .
Teacher can teach the students the basic ideas and the concepts in order to understand easily and quickly .
For instance , the first few weeks in my government class my teacher taught by using facts , but most of the time , many facts were confusing to me .
Then , I asked my friend for help , but most of my frind that I asked were confused on many government systems .
After , I talked to my teacher on where I was confused on and the way he taught us .
I requested to him to change how he taught the class and he did the next day .
My teacher use the fundamentals of ideas and the concepts of the whole structure of government systems and laws .
I learned many valueable and interesting informations that I did not know .
Also , my teacher made this subject easy to understand and more entertaining so that all of his student can focus and get interested into this subject .

If my teacher did not use the fundamentals of ideas and the concepts , I would not understand the whole structure of government systems and the government systems and laws .
In conclusion , learn the ideas and the concepts is more important for the students than it is for them to learn facts .
From my eperience , using ideas and the concepts can , not just facts , improve learning skills .
Class taught with using ideas and concepts can be more understandable .
