I like traveling and I have traveled many times in my life .
From my experiences , although I understand the merits of traveling alone , I agree with the statement : The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Especially I do when the visiting place is unfamiliar to me and the period is within a week .
There are three reasons for that .

Firstly , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is much safer than traveling alone .
When the place is unfamiliar to you , it is very dangerous and troublesome .
If you traveling alone , you should take all the responsibility for what you do ; eat , walk aroud , buy tickets , get a loss , transfer .
However , the tour guide can solve almost all of the problems and sometimes the member of the group also can help you .
When I was traveling Europe last year in a group , I caught a cold and a member of the group gave me medicine at that time .

Secondly , traveling in a group is cheaper than traveling alone .
For example , the cost of transportation or entrance fee for museums are discounted in a group .

Thirdly , traveling in a group provide chances to get close each other in the group and that is a lot of fun .
But I have an experience that some people quarreled and battled in a group tour which I belonged to .
And I think that possible happens when the travel continues more than a week .
Therefore I added the premise that the travel ` within a week ' .

Accordingly , I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide especially when I visit unfamiliar place within a week .
