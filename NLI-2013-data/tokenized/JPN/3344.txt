I am 22 years old now , that means I should be included to the `` young people '' used in the statement .
That makes me think how my life is going .
I ask this question to myself .
And my answer is to agree with the statement .
I think young people , including me , do not or can not give enough time to helping their communities .
I will show my points in the following .

The question asks using `` young people nowadays '' in the statement , therefore , I should compare the young people in the old time with of them in nowadays particulary in the stiation of their families .
I study in the university 4 times a week and I work at the restrant in nearby 3 times a week constantly .
Moreover , I study English for the graduate school everyday .
That shows that I can not have enough time to helping my family because I am too busy to do it .
But tipically in Japan , women did not go to University to help their family and to learn how to be as a housewives .
The enviroment that both young poeple in old time and nowadays has changed .
It became giving chances to women to do what they want , on the other hand women became much more busy and lost enough time to help own families .

I think there should be enough time for young people to helping their communities , though it seems difficult for me .
To make it possible , not only young people but also all of the members of the communities have to help each other .
