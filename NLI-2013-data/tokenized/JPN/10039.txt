I agree somewhat and also disagree somewhat with the statement that successful peopletry new things rather than only doing waht they already know how to do well .
In the world , there are succesful peopIe who are succeeding beacause they are not trying new things , but also there are people whpo are succeeding because they did start something new .
I disagree because not every people who are sucessful has done new thing so they can become sucessful .
For example , there may be some company that has succeded in the past with the current boss .
If the current boss dies , his son may take in his position .
His son has been living with his father for years , and so he knows how and what to do in the company to keep the company sucessful .
I agree because of the unsucessful people that are trying to become succesful .
Unsucessful people will try more new things .
The unsucessful people will try more new things , because he wants to succeed .
If he keeps what he is doing now that is n't giving him success , he will come up with more new ideas that could lead hiom into a successful life .
Also , there are people who wants to start something new but they ca n't .
Like the son in the first example , he may want to start a new company , but he will not be able to , because he will have to start a new company while still keeping the current company succesful aswell .
If he makes the current company unsuccesful , he has caused thousands of workers to lose there job , causing them to find new jobs .
This makes the boss of a company think twice about starting a new business while currently having a successful company in progress .
Because he holds the lives of thousands of other workers , he can not just go off and start whatever he feels like starting .
That is why I think that not every successful person tries new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
