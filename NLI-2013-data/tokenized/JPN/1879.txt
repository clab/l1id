I agree with the statement that Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Although I agree with this , I think there is a difference of the meaning of `` enjoy '' between young people and older people .
At any time , we have a large generation gap between youngs and older people .
And I think nowadays that gap is increasing more and more .

I want to show the example of the conversation between my mother and I , when we were watching `` Gohst in the Sell '' , which is Japanese TV animation about the future world that people live with robots .
In the story , almost all people have a computer brain in thier head instead of real brain , and they can process the information or the data that they see through thier eyes , like a computer now we are using .
In that world `` ture human '' which are like us , are decreasing .
Even they have a real brain in thier head , which is just tiny part of it for living .
After watching this animation , I excited about the concept of the sotry .
For me the computer is a really familiar thing .
Everyday I use my computer for the assignments which are given by my high school teachers .
Also I stoarge my favorite pictures , musics , and movies in my computer .
So when I watch `` Gohst in the Sell '' I even thought that I want the computer brain in my head !
But my mother was defferent .
Firstly she could't understand any concepts about this story .
She could't understant why the computer brain in people 's brain , why they are not robots and so on .
Finally she said `` It is so boring . ''
In truth , there are lot of dificult words about computer system , and also confusing time passege was in the story .
But I really suprised at the fact that she did n't enjoy the story .
And I realised that what I enjoy is not always what my mother enjoys .

The meaning of `` enjoy '' is different between young people and older people .
However as I said above , these days , technology is everyday improving .
New things such as computers are sometimes difficult for older people .
But I know that there are many ways of enjoying life .
I understand that everyone enjoy thier own life very much .
