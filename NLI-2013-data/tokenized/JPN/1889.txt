Some people may believe that the younger , the more enjoyable thier life , and others may not .
Personally , I believe the older people can enjoy thier live more than younger people for the following reasons .

First , older people get more knowlegdes based on experience than young people according to the time of thier live .
Knowledge based on much experience helps our live fruitful one .
For example , when we go on a trip to unknown place , if we had experienced any trip to other palce , we could enjoy at the new place because of the knowledge for how to get with unknown place and people .

Secondly , older people usually have more friends than young people .
Friends make our life usefule one .
For instance , young people only have the friends at thier schoolage , while older people have not only friends of their schoolage , but also those who meet at the workplace or the place belonging after graduation .
Moreover , if we get marriage , we have more relative including relative in law .
As a result , we could get new friend among them .
Of course , young people also get marriage , but take an example for students of colledge or unievrsity , they are too busy fro studing to get marriage .
So , the rate of marriage among older people tend to become higher than that among younger people .
Consequently , older people have more friends and could enjoy their live .

According to the above mentions , I beleive that the older , the more enjoyable their life .
However , the older person tend to get health problem due to aging .
Thus , I would like to denote that the older and healthy people could more enjoy their live comparing with the ordinary young people
