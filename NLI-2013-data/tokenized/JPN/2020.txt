Do you want to enjoy your life ?
There is many ways of enjoying your life .
What I think of enjoying a life is to be fun , and proud of what you are doing at all time .
I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because what ever you do , the age does not matter , have more experiences , and they should understand the importance of enjoying their lifes .

Some people enjoy their life at all time , but the other does not enjoy it all the time .
Some even does not enjoy their life at all .
To enjoy your life , what can you do ?
For example , I would go shopping and hang out with my friends .
I believe that is what most of young people would do .
Talk with friends , doing what you want to do .
Although does this have to be young people ?
The answer is no .
Older people can also go shopping and hang out with their friends .
There is no such things that young people can do and the older can not .

Older people have more experience to many things .
Therefore they can always challenge themselves to do something harder .
This gives the guts to do and overcome what they had done before .
They also can do the things that they had done long ago and feel like they are young again .

As you get older , you begin to understand the importance of time more .
As young people just willing what they want to do , and ignoreing what they does not want to do , old people prefer to do what they can do .
Young people tends to forget the thankness of being able to do things that they are doing right now .
Although as you get old , you learn the importance of being able to `` do '' and be happy about it .
Older people enjoy their time so much more .

Feeling greatful of your life is not a easy thing to do .
Although there is no people that does not want to enjoy their life .
It is important to understand that you should be thankful to what you are doing and spend your time that makes no regrets in the future .
