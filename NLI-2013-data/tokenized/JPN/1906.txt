Personally I agree with the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .
There are three amin reasons for saying so .
First , becuase they are young , they are physicaly tough and healtheir than older people .
They can enjoy physical sports such as soccer , futball , etc .
On the other hand old people have less stamina and they will have to stop even if thy want to go on .
Their joints , bones and musles are weaker , causing injury .
This will stop them from most of the sports that they like and enjoyed when they were young .
So they wil think back to the days when they were young and feel that they would like to go back to that days .

Secondly , younger people have better looking than older people .
As we get old , our skin will be not smooth , there will be less hair , etc .
So they even enjoy thereselves , their own looking , but once they are old they will not be satified by their own look .
Their wife or husband will look hansome or beautiful when they are young .
This might not be true for everyone , but partners will look at each other and think he/she are not good looking as he/she was / This now-days leads to a devorse of couple .
The number couples devorsing when they get to middle ages is increasing .
That questions whether they married to each other becuase they loved the partner of loved the look of partner .

Finally , there will be more friends when people are young .
I might sound too realistic , but as people get old they pass away and there will be less people that you know of .
My grandparets are saying that in every class union , there will be less people .
Either they are physically unable to attend or they had passed away .
This is similar to the fact that there will be less friends , but also there will be less family members or relatives .
So they will feel lonely and left out when all the family members and close relatives are gone .

I might be able to come up with more reasons , but I will stop here .
It sounds just too sad to talk about it .
I will be old some day and I am getting older every year , although I am still young .

I heard from some people that they want to die before they get really old , becuase they can not `` live '' with the situation that they would be in when they are old .
I hope that this is not teh way I should be .
I hope I will be able to enjoy my life as much as I am enjoying now .
As long as God keeps me alive , I will thank Him and live my life following His words .
I think that not enjoying the life or even feel like want to die , is an act of cursing God .
I am a Christian , so I want to be able to thank God and enjoy anytime .
But I have to admit that I would enjoy better if I am young .
I really love sports , so I would really miss playing soccer , tennis , table tennis , badminton , etc .
Well I got a bit off the road but this is how I think about the topic .

So from these reasons , I agree that young people enjoy life more than older peopld do .
