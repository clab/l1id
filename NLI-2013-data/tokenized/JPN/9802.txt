I agree the statement successful people try new things and take risks rather than only donig what they already know how to do well .
Some people say successful people tend to be conservertive and not to change the environment because they do not want to lose the things they already have .
However , I do not agree these kind of opinion thorugh my own experiences meeting successful peeple and reading books about successful people .
For example , one of my father 's friends , who he was very successful as being CFO in the largest advertising company in Japan , started running the organic food restaurant for elder people after retireing his job .
Another example , some famous Japanese traditional dancing artist started her own international trading company which introduces Japanese traditional gadgets to the UK .
Though she had no experience and knowledge about business .

I think there are three common chacteristics in successful people .
First , they are always interested in and want to know the new information and intelligence he or she have never touched .
Second , they think one of the important objectives in their life is to meet and make friends with a lot of people as many as they can .
Third , they think progress and inovation is the only way they keep their success .
I think almost all the successful people I know hold these common characteristics and these points make successful people more powerful and attractive .
In concequence of this circulation , successful people want to find some new challenges even though they have to take risks .

Therefore , I think successful people may want to try new things and enter new environments to find new opportunites to make them more successful .
