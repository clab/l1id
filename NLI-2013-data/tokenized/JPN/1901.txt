Some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
However , where I live , older people are very healthy and acitive than they used to .
In my opinion , older people enjoy more life than younger people do .

The first reason of this is that because older people have more time and money than their couterparts , they can do a lot of activities they want to .
For example , my parents are both retired .
They have a lot of free time than I have .
In addition , they worked for more than 35 years , so they have a large amount of money they can spend .
That 's why they travel almost once a month across my country and they have already visited all the prefectuers in my country .
On the contrary , I have to work every day and I have less available time and money since I got a job last year .
I was not able to go somewhere even in summer vacation .

Another reason is that young people have more concerns about their futures , compared to the optimistic opinions showed by older people , which leads to the young people 's negative ideas about their lives in general .
One illustration that makes this clear is that most of the young people concerns about their pensions they will receive in the future .
Now that the aging society in my country is getting serious , young people may not receive enough money to live on after their retirement .
Therefore , most of them have to save money for their future lives and they can not afford to enjoy their present lives .

My consideration with respect to the available time and money as well as the negative ideas about future lives , I think that older people enjoy life more than younger people do .
