I disagree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Of course , I know the effects of advertisements .
For example , when we look for the productions which we need , we always use advertisements with the beautiful picture and handsome models .
According to these effect , those productions look like better , and we are moved on our lust .

But personaly , I think that these situations are changed nowadays , because we can check the information of products from the various news source .
I would like to explain by two examples .

Firstly , there are lots of advertisements in the world .
Also , these are not just by paper or pamphlet .
By using internet , we can search those products easily and find lies or difference which the publisher of advertisements declare .

Secondly , at present , we can compare with other products , because we can take a lot of information from many advertisements .
So , we do not buy the matter easily .
For example , yesterday , I needed the desk lamp to study my major hard , and at first , I read the information about the lamp which I can buy from internet , and at next I looked in the phamphlet to get day before yesterday , when I went to the shop .
Then I went to one mole near my accomodition , and bought it .
On this process , I checked and compared the product which I bought with other products again and again .
And I could take the information about the real product .

Therefore , I do not agree with that statement .
