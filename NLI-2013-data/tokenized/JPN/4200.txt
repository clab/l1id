I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
One particular example is what I am currently observing in my community .
I live in a residential area with my family which is close to Shinjuku , a sort of entertaining center of Tokyo .
A month ago , the plan to build a huge studio-type apartment complex next to my place was revealed .
This new apartment is mainly targeting to people without family who work and study in Shinjuku .
As the area is very close to the entertaining area , it is much assumed that many of those who work as hosts and hostesses at bars may live in the apartment .
Then , the big dispute occured and many people living in the community started to organize a movement to oppose to this plan .
They say that this apartment will greatly damage the living condition of the people in the community .
They meet regularly , prepare posters and friers and consult with local politicians and lawyers in order to figure out how to stop the plan .
However , none of the young people living there , including me , have not joined or even helped this community-wide opposition movement .
People who have been actively involved are those who are over 60s .
Given this personal experience , I wonder why young people nowadays are not eager to help their communities .
First , I think young people have less attachment to the communities they live in .
For example , I know I will live at a different place when I have a job somewhere else .
For young people , communities are not permanent , while for older people communities are where they live until they die .
Second , I believe that young people simply do not have enough time to help their communities .
They work long hours and have various commitments to other `` communities '' they belong to , such as work place , schools , virtual space on the internet and friends .
And they know that using their precious time on these `` communities '' can make their lives more exciting and interesting than they do so for their real communities .
To sum up , I agree with the statement and I also think this is not something that we can easily change .
