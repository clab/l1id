I agree with the statement .
I have two reason .
One reason is young people is always energetic and have excited thought of what they do and what they want to do in the future .
Young people have a lot of things that they have not done yet .
So they dream about the future evry day .
I dream about what i want to do in the future all the time .
I w And the other reason is that they have a lot of things that they should do in their youth .
For example , study .
Young peaple can lean fast than old people .
My parents and teachers always say `` study hard when you are still young ! ''
I think if we leaned a lot of thing in youth , we can live much better life in the future physical and mental .
I like to learn new things .
when I learn something new , I feel like I am getting smart and getting close to adults .

I think old people enjoy life too , but I think old people did most exciting things when they were young .
So they are now relaxing and having slow time with the partner watching the grand children growing and enjoying life .
