Most people consider that young people enjoy like more than older people do .
But I disagree with this idea from the reasons below .
Firstly , older people know what is their interesting from their long experiences .
When poeople are still young they are in the time to seek what they are really interested in .
On the contrary , oler people have already know because they probably have found their hobby , additionally they know enoughly how to enjoy them .
For example , to enjoy carigraphy deeply , it needs to much time to be familliar with it .

Secondly , older people have money that younger people .
In any countries , people earn plenty of money from their long laboring to sepnd their retired time without working .
For example , in Japan , many company aim at seniors and produce many goods and plans for older people 's hobbuy such as carigraphy , computer games , shogi | japanese chess ] .
Therefore , being different from their younger age when they earn to feed their child and let them enroll schools , they can use money for their own because they do not have duty to raise children .

Thirdly , older people have enough time to spend doing what they like .
Recently , in Japan , many older people enroll into some communities to enjoy with other seniors .
Although younger people do not have enough time because they have to work to live or feed their children all day long .

From these reasons , I disagree with the idea to consider that youn people enjoy life more than older people do .
