I agree that most advertisment makes the product much more better than they are .
Advertisment are the things that tries people to think that product are very valuabe and makes people to desire that product .
There are some reasons that advertisment shoulds be better than the actual products .

First , Advertisment has many variety .
It can shown on the TV commercials , and newspaper , magazines and radios .
Those advertisment should be used in a place that attracts peoples attention by catching thier eyes .
So there should be something which has impact or words that are very interesting .
For example , in TV commercials , they uses music togather and some musics are very simple and fun that can be easy to remember to whome wich has been heared it .
It is very important to been remembered to customers to develope the sales .
So writing the point you want to be remebered or the point that is the advatages of the product , they should emphasize it in best way .

Second , Advertisment is the biggest and easiest way to show the goodness of the product and builds up the images of the company too .
To have a good sales or , being popular , or expanding the scale of the company , they have to be mentioned by large amounts of population .
So to show the product better is the most important thing that you have to concern when you are making the advertisment .

Third , I have experienced many times that i thought advertisment has tricked me .
Somethimes there are advertisment that emphasizes too much and it very differes to the real product .
But in another way , it is not a lie and the point wich has been emphasized are true .
It it one of the way to sale things to people and it is not a crime .
Every company has their own way to win the war of the sales and honors .
Making the advertisment better is one of the way of making the company better .

From these points , Emphasized advertisment has no problem do ing so , and it is the way to intorduce the product .
There are many advertisment surrounded to our life and we often see them while we are living .
The customer can be easily find what we want in a small amount of time spending to search , and form the companies point of view , it is the part that has to effort to increase the sales amount .
Making a good , interesting advertisment is one of the salespoint that company and the product has to concern .
