Recently , in the company , people who are employed by company are basically given their tasks from sinor people .
I strongly believe that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .
The reason is that people can have much responsible for doing well and unless people think about , their skill will be in a wrong way .

First of all , if they do what they already know how to do well , people may not comtite each other .
In addition , people will be think same in working because of doing as well and they can not have laiable for keeping something .
However , due to trying new things or having risks , people may work hard in order to making money ad preserving something such as family .
Therefore , people who have responsible for anything can come up with good idea in order to success .

Secondly , if they do n't need to think about to make new idea , their knowleadge cannot be grown .
People who think about forever can bring up parmanentaly .
Since knowleadges are used , so they can know the new skill .
It can mean that people can be in a good way .
For example , basically , as people are getting older , their knowleadge decrease .
However , people who get a novle prize are increasing thier knowleadge baecause of thinkinhg .
We can say that person of getting novle prize is successful .
Although they are usually old , they can make an effort in order to invent new things and they take risks .
Therefore , they can live truthly to be successful .

As I mentioned , unless people take risks and try to do new things such as inventor , people cannot success .
If you do the old thing which is known already , your brain inferior to people who make an effort .
So if you want to be successful person , you have to be disadvantage .
