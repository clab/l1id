Although it is hard to admit , I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I support it because even though I have many friends , I know nobody who is or has been involved in activities in their communities .
There are , in my opinion , two main reasons for this .

One of the reasons is because young people , especially students , are busy with their school work or afterschool activities .
When I was in highschool , I got up at 7am , studied until 3pm , then practiced tennis ( because I was in tennis team ) until 6pm and got home at 7pm .
This I did for 6 days per week , and had only Sunday to rest .
All I wanted to do that day was stay home and relax , not be involved in activities for the community .

The same can also be said about university students , most of whom study , be involved in activities , and work at the same time .
There is , I think , just not enough time for young people to cast their attention to their communities .
That is one of the reasons for their not helping their communities .

The other reason is because young people are just not interested in their communities .
Their interest is in their friends , games , parties , hobbies : in other words , themselves .
They lack the voluntary spirit or the will to cooperate and help the region they live in .

When I was in university , I had a lot of friends .
They had high goals for their future , and studied a lot ; being serious , they were interested in economics and politics , reading lot of books too .
But even they were not involved in any activities for helping their community .

Young people , being much more energetic and active than elders , should be participating in helping their communities .
But for the reasons stated above , they are not .
Therefore , I support the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
