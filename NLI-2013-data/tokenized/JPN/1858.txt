I agree on this statement .
I think people loose stenght and other physical ability as they get older and also they loose free time to have fun .
Young people can enjoy there time without any matter of money or time .

I think that older people does not have time to enjoy life .
What they have in mind is the reponsibility of there family and the worry of of children , so they need to work work and work for their family .
If they stoped working no one will help your family nor your self .
This belief is a common sence to teenager .
We all believe that people working does not have the extra stenght to entertain their self .

On the contrary , teenager have both the srenght and time .
We use our time luxurious as it seems eternal .
We do not have to think of responsibility .
Therefore what we do in our dily life is to have fun everiday any minute , and do not think about the future .
We use our time only to entertain our selves .
Teenagers are free to do any thing .
Most of the teenager in Japan think to enjoy life .

Young people still have not seen the hardness of life because they still do not have the responsibility .
but I think that is not bad .
Young people can use that time freely to get mature .
The young age is filled with experiences and their experiences makes their life so enjoyabl
