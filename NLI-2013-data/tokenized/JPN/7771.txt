I do not agree `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a toure guide .
The reason is follows .
First , the day schedule is already decided .
That is , we do not have enough time to see freely , when we go to very large sightseeing place .
This is just my experience .
When I was 8years old , I went to Kyoto .
There very famous classicla Japanese cityand there are so many temples .
That time , I took a tour guide .
The schedule was so dense .
So tour guide allowed us just 30 minute for one place .
While the turip , time was too fast .
I could not recall where I went and see .
It was just like taking pictures about object without the emotion .
I want to say that to see what I need feely is best memorial things in my heart , because this is in my intention in my travel .

Second , group tour is difficult to have directive communication with people who live in the place .
To enjoy the travel , we need strong impression about city and people .
If we talk with the people who lives there , we aware about the place what we do not aware of seeing surface of the place-buildings or constructions .
For examples , when I went to Hawaii , I had a chance to talk with people who lives in Hawaii in park .
That day is the special festival for tem .
They told me why they were celebrating .
Moreover where is the best place to see the sunset .
This information is just know about people who live in there .
This is a good chance to see real life in there .
I am always enjoying communicate with the people llike above .
Moreover good accidents became good memory after travel .

Treavel is freely is best for me because of above reasons .
