I agree that students should understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .
I think understanding one specific thing such as : why the war was occured , how this problem resulted , why this music sounds this way , requires to understand backgraund of the thing , ideas , concept .
Ideas and concept lead you to understand why the facts were occured .

I think that understanding ideas , concepts , and facts are one thing to achive your learning skills .
Understanding facts are the easiest thing to do the out of all three .
For example , when you learn the history , teacher talkes about `` what is happened '' was the first thing which is the fact .
And after you know the fact , you would be interested why , how , when it happened .
When I learned Japanese Edo era in Japanese history class , the teacher taught us about Tokugawa shougunn , what he did in the big government plans and changes and I was so interested how he became a head of samurai , why him , how he relate with this big government plans etc .
I had a lot of questions .
It was hard to understand the ideas and concepts of why and how he govern the country .
I spend way more time to learn the ideas and concepts more than the facts .

Understanding facts in the first make you interested to know more about it .
I think that learning ideas and concept leads you to understand deeper of the thing , and relate you with the thing more than understanding ideas and concepts to lead you to the facts .
It is very important to relate all three , however , knowing and understanding ideas and concepts are more important to achive your learning .
