Altough some people believe that successful people try new things and take risk rather than only doing what thay already know how to do well .
But I disagree with the this statement .
There are two reasons : trying new thing is very risky way and First , it goes with out saying that , trying new thing is trenmendous severe to succeed on business nowadays .
in fact , on calfornia , new companies which are established for do the new business , have been going bankrupt that are increasing three quoter in row at steady rate .
because to run new business have tendency to failure rather than to adapt previous business style .
For example , american car produsing companies such as Ford and Craislar , was etatablised in america and they must be sutable costomer saticfaction , thier income are declining compire with japanese car produsing companies sach as TOYOTA and NISSAN .
because they have been negrect to reserch costomer satic
