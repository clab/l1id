When I was living in the United States , there was a short period of time , about a week or so , when I did n't have a car .
To go to a supermarket , I had to walk for an hour , and imagine how bad it was to come home with four 5kg-plastic bags in both hands .
I definitely needed a car in order to survive there .
Considering that cars are currently one of the major transportation tools among people in developed countries , I disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today because twenty years is just not enough time .

To replace the existence of cars with other means of transportation would take more than twenty years to accomplish .
It is said that the gas emitted by cars has a tremendously bad effect on the environment , a problem called `` global warming , '' and that countries are working to decrease the number of cars in use .
However , in order to accomplish this goal , there needs to be other ways people can transport , such as trains and metro .
It would be hard for any city governments to come up with a plan and to put that into action in twenty years .

Another thing that would be hard to change in twenty years is people 's habits .
When you have been using a car , for example , to drive to school everyday , you will find it hard to change the way you commute to other means , such as the train .
It is hard for someone to make a change in their lifestyles , and he or she would need a definite reason for doing so .
If the city made a law prohibiting the use of a car , this would sure drive the person to quit driving the car , but making that law in use would take more than twenty years .
Passing a law requires a lot of time .
Imagine the voices that would come about from the people when a plan to make this law arises .
Even if it does n't take a law to try to change people 's awareness , I cannot come up with another option .

For the reasons I mentioned above , I believe it is impossible to decrease the number of cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
To do so , there needs to be other ways people can tranport , which they could feel comfortable and convenient as cars .
Of course , there are places around the world , for example Tokyo , where subways have been well developed and people do n't need cars to get around .
However , from the experience I had in the United States , I would have to say that people there would n't like that .
