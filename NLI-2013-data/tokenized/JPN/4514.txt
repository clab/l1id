I agree with this sttement .
Most advertisements on magazines and TV are really atractive .
Every time I see them , they say to me '' I am tasty '' or '' You will look better if you wear this '' .
It is dificult for me to stop buy them .

For example , when I bouhgt a food which I had seen an advertisement on TV or magazines before , I usually think '' This is different from an advertisement .
They did not say tyuth ! ''
A real food is usually smaller .
Also the taste of it is not good .
Many cookies in advertizement are made fresh and savory and crispy .

Not only foods but also cloths , I offten disappoint the real cloths at a department store .
When I try them and look at a millar , I think `` This is not one which I saw on the magazine ! ''
It is true that every cloths looks very fine and gramarous when super models wear them .
And such a advertisements makes me think that I looks thin and have faburous style if I will wear them .

Some electlicity such as TVs and personal computers and cell phones in advertizements are different too .
Many of them are complicate and diffifult to use actually .
But an older man in TV advertizement uses a cell phone without memo or a woman uses microwave with only an index finger .
After she prssing a bottun , she do only waiting .
It is very useful and helpful .
