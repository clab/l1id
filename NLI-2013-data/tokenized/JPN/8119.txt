Learing a fact , we ( human ) are always curious about knowing a fact .
We whant know what happning , what was a result .
I disagree with the statement that student learning facts is more important than learning concepts and understand ideas .

First of all , the reason why I disagree with the statement is because I strongly believes that understanding ideas and concepts leads to develope students thinking skills .
Specifically , if a teacher teaches about the global warming , and say just a fact of it ( like `` Global warming is progressing now badly , and the earth 's temperature is increasing . ''
Then how student will take that teachers voice ?
Most student will understand that the global warming is happning , but they could not know what elements are causeing the global warming , because that teacher only did teach a fact ( global warming is happning ) and did not teach how and whyhappend ( ideas/concept of global warming ) .
Therefore due to a lack of key ideas and concept of global warming , students only knew about a fact and they do not understanding process ( ieas/concept ) of the global warming .
Only knowing the fact is a big problem , because if they do not have inside story ( ideas/concept ) and only knowing the fact .
Then they could not evaluate the issue from there , becuaes they do not have data to estimate the issue .
So , if they only knew about the fact , then they could not solve the global warming issues or other issues which happning on the earth .

From above reason , I disagree whith the statement that teaching student facts is more important than teaching ideas and concepts .
More over , teaching only fact is not ideal educational way .
To develop students thinking skills , educator must teach ideas and concepts of each issues to develop students thinking ability .
