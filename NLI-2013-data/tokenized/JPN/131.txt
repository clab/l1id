I think young people do not have to take more time for the community .
So I disagree with this .
There are 2 reasons why I disagree .
The first one is the increase number of the old people .
And the second one is working hard for the community without no money is not a good idea .

First , there are too many old people in this world .
That means there is not enough young people to help in the community , especially in Japan .
Almost 25 percent of the population in Japan is the old people .
So adults say the young people must help the community more often , but that will be too many job for the young people .
There will not be enough young people to do the job .
So I do not think making the young people work more for the community is not the best idea .

Second , working for the community without no money is not good for the young people .
There are many young people who do not have a job and having a hard time to live without their money .
So working without the payment from the country or from some company , it will not be a good time for the young people .
Because many young people want some job for their life .
So if old people need some help from the young people for the community , they should give them some payment .

Thus , because of the increase of the old people and no money to the young people for the work in the community , I think young people do not have to help for the community more often .
