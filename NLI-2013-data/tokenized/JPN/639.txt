I support this opinion that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
To learn one special subject sometime might lead to bright future , for example in terms of invention in science .
If someone who do n't devote oneself into one special subject , most of amazing invention was not created .
But in general we need to have broad knowledge .

One reason is focuing on one particular subject makes predjudes , and such kind of person cannot make flat decision in proper manner .
I 've learn a lot of things thoroughout learning for example Moral study , World history , Asian history , Japanese history , Math , Chemistry , Physics , Art , Art history , Japanese civil Low , Internatioal Low or what ever .

To learn broadly is important to realize `` truth '' between broad range of knoledge .
This is just a very simple example , but we can learn tons of things from the World history , for example , but if we do n't have any hi-leveled background in literature , we can not understand the way of thinking that we see on the text book of History .

Also , from leaning Moral study and Biology , somebody can find out heart of affection .

To learn many things would be very good opportunity to find our own tarent out .
Needless to say , if everybody can find out their own talent without seeng many things , but it is not realistic .
Some scientists found out their talent or their way to live in the future , but it is too rare case .

In general we human being should know a lot of things to reach their own principal .
This is not only for personal issue , but also for all people in the world .

So I agree this opinion .
