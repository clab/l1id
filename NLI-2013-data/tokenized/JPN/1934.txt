I disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
It is because I know that there are old people enjoy life more than young people in Japan , and old people think that the time is very important because they hane fewer time than young people .

However , not all of old people think that .
Who can enjoy life more than yong people ?
Firstly , the people is that they have always their purpose and they can always make an effort .
For example , he is 65 years old and retired his job , but he wanted to work .
Of coruse , he cannot be hired be any companies .
Therefore he desided to build his office .
He is very energish .
He achieved that .

Next , the people is that thery have positive thinking and mind like children .
In oter words , they can enjoy with yong people .
It is because they think children themselves , and they do not warry about their ages .
Therefore they play the TV game .
climbing trees , and a lot of sports .
For example , she is 75 years old , and lost her hasband and children .
She is a old lonley woman , but she can enjoy her life .
She began volanteer with high school students .
She has also childrens mind , so she could .

Recently , young people forget active enargy and lazy .
If young people want to enjoy life more than older peple , yong people act with the older people .
Never give up .
