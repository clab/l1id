I disagree with the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use that there are today in twenty years , because , basically , I think it stays the same as many people like to have their private cars .

Indeed , it is good to have public transportation means such as , trains and buses , as they reduces not only the traffic jam but also the pollutions .
And I believe , for such reason , there will be more high-advanced public transportation means in the future and I can easily assume that many people may think that it may reduces the number of cars on the roads .

However , at the same time , I believe that , even under such circumstances , many people still prefer to have their own private cars .
There are many people whose residents are not close to the stop-point of the public transportaion , especially in rural areas .
For instance , my uncle is living in a rural area of Japan where it takes fifty minutes to get to the closest train station .

And , there are many people who like driving itself .
Also , there are many people who really prefer to have private space even at the the time of commute .
For example , I have a friend who really likes to take cars .
I usually prefer to go for trip by trains because , in that way , I do not need to care how to get to the destination and where to go to the bathrooms .
However , this friend living in urban areas in Tokyo , always go for trip by car even if it takes longer time than going by trains .
He once told me that he prefer cars to trains and buses because it gives him more private time and he does not want anybody to bother while commuting .

I believe this is true to many other persons .
Many people think it is important to have private time .
I think it is true that , if you are busy communicating people , then you feel frustrated and in that situation , people need private time .

Given all those circumstances , I still believe that , so long as people are as busy as now , even twenty years after , the there will be same number or even more cars as it is now .
