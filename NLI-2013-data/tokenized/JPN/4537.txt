I agree that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
I sometimes buy the fashine magazine .
When I read it , I have seen many advertisments .
First of all , it is about the diet food .
Some people which tried it and sucsseeded the diet was intervewed .
Many of them said that `` to be on diet is easy because it helped very much '' .
Other people said `` It is very delicious .
I recommend it , so please try it once '' .
The advertisments have also the picture before the person who try to use the diet food and after the person who tried to do it .
I think I ca n't belive it .
To be on diet is very difficult .
I also think it is not good taste .
Few years ago , I attracted this advertisments , so I tried the diet food .
It is written `` If you eat this , you can lose 3kg for one months '' .
I trusted it , and I countine to do it , but I could n't lose my weight .
The diet food says it is delicious , but it is not delisious .
It taste the robber .

Second , it is the cell phone .
When I buy the cell phone , I see the advertisments .
It is reason why I can compare the many cell phones at once easilly .
A lot of advertisments shows how easy to use the cell phone .
It also says a lot of functions .

In conclusion , I think a lot of advertisments make their products looks better than ther really are .
