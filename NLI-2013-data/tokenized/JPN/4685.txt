Today , many advertisements are in the world .
Therefore , I agrree that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .
I have two reasons .
First , advertisements are cheaper than real products .
It is because they are not real .
In addition , they are easily to make them .
If I could not buy real product because of money , I could buy advertisements product .
In China and Korea have a lot of them .
Therefore , many visitor to Asia think that they can buy many of them with low costs .

Second , they look like similar to real product because they mimic real products .
For example , when I have a advertisement product , nobody notice .
Paticular , young people in Japan want real brand goods , but they are very expensive , so Japanese young people buy mimiced products .
They do not care about using them , and they thik only visual .
For these reasons , I think that it is good that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
