In my opinion , I support the idea to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are two reason why I support the idea .

First of all , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects to help us to think about things wide angle .
For example , if I have different opinion from my friend , and get fight from it , then I think it is very important to try to think in different angle .
In other words , to avoid to think my claim is always right .

Another reason why I support the claim is because it would help me to live in society with enjoying .
To have various knowledge may provide me to communicate with people easily .
Because I simply imagine that if I have various knowledge , then I wo n't have much tough time to concider what shoud I talk to people .
It will provide me many friends .

I do not think to specialize in one specific subject is bad .
Actually , I respect people who is professional about specific subject , because it is result of their concentraining and devote time to study about it .
That is great effort I think .

Howe , I think to have various knowledge means similar to be flexible person .
I would like to be flexible person .
What is flexible person for me is , to think about wide range , and can think about by standing other person 's position .
Then my world would be more expand and life will be more enjoyable .

Above all , I support the opinion to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than not .
