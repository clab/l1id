Since I came to the United Sttes , I 've been surprised how impact the US commercials .
sometimes they make me laugh and shocked .
Also , I 've doubted the exaggerated information .
In my view , there are a lot of advertisements that does have a lot of propaganda for the following reasons .

First of all , there are business competition in order to survive companies .
Because of a balance between demand and supply , companies have to make the catchy and striking advertisements for public .
The milk that I used to drink is the good example here .
I refered the milk because of containing the healthy organic gredients .
However , inspectors of the government just recently found out that there had been no organic materials in the milk .
There are a lot of kinds of milk , healthy one or cheaper one , local , or soy milk .
Most people decide what to buy by checking a package because they can not distinguishs the best one for them .
As a result , the packages are the all about the materials themselves .

Secondly , people have changed new tendency all the time .
Therefore , companies need to fix in order to adjust the changed the fashion .
For example , these days , people start to care about healthy food .
Companies pull the customers or comsumers in the companies ' businesses .
However , some companies can not change , so they put a fake information , such as 100 percent of nature .

As you can see , there are some reasones that business convey extra information to the buyer .
The goverment needs to check companies in order to protect safe and reliable advertisemants for the consumers .
