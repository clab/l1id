My best travel was the travel without a tour guide .
The travel is still good memory even it was long time ago and I will never forget it .
I believe that the best way to travel is a travel planed and made by myself from three reasons .

One reason is before the travel .
Before the travel , I need to decide where to go , where to stay , and what to do .
From that moment , the travel has already started .
It is enjoynable to find the best travel which fit to myself .
I also can find the cheapest travel by looking at the internet .
I like to spend more money in eating than staying the good hotel , so I can choose cheeper place to stay .
I can plan everything what I want .

The second reason is during the travel .
The destination is usually the place where I have never been , so I want to see many new things during the travel .
If I go abroad , one of my purpose to travel is to experience other cultures .
If I have an opportunity , I `` m willing to talk to the people living there even if I ca n't speak the language they use .
If the communication is successful , I feel happy .
Sometimes travelling without a tour guide is adventurous .
I may lose my way , however , I can go to the restaurant which I found accidentally .
I do n't know what my travel will be .
It is better to travel by myself sp that I can communicate with local people and enjoy the accident .

Furthermore , time is limited during the travel .
Within the limited time , I have to go and see all I want .
If the travel is led by a tour guide , I cannot stay the one place .
Even I do n't finish looking around , I have to leave there .
It 's better to travel without a tour guide because I can spend time where I want to .

In conclusion , travelling is fun because I can make plans which is best for me , experience the culture there , and spend my time .
Traveling by myself is more possible to have a wonderful trip .
