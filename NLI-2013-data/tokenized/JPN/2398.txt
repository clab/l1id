I know lots of older people enjoy life after retired their job or grew up their children because they can have time and money that young people have , so they can do anything they want .
However , I agree young people enjoy life more than older people do .
There are several reasons .

First of all , young people are helthy because they are young , so they can be active and cheerful than older people .
Helthy is very important to do anything .
It is easy to get sick or illness for older people that young people .
For example , my uncle who had his own bussiness got illness after retired his job .
When he was young he had lots of hobbies and he was enjoying his life .
Eeven though he was busy , he did make time to have fun because he was helthy and very active person .
However , since he got sick , it was hard time to live , even though he had lots of money and time .

Secondly , young people can have dream more that older people because they can have time to live .
Older people feel limited to live , but young people never think about their death because they think it would not happen soon .
It gives young people lots of dreams .
When people have a dream , they can enjoy the time to acheane it .

Therefore , for these reasons I agree young people enjoy life more than older perople do .
