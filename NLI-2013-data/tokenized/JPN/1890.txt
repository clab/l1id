Without questions , I agree witn this idea that young people enjoy their lives more than older people do .
I have two reasons for this opinion : energy and freedom .
First of all , I think that young people are able to exercise more harder then older people because they are young , so they have a lot of energy in general .
In my grandfather 's case , he said that he could run very fast and carry everything even the huge things when he was 21 years old .
Moreover , he played baseball everyday after school with his friends and never injured when he was junior high-school .
I guess he was a tough boy , but he never plays sports now .
Furthermore , he says that you should play sports when you are young because you will not be able to run faster end play some sports when you are 70 years old .

Secondly , I asserts that young people can fall in love with their classmates , school friends and so on easily .
In my case , I loved some girlfriends when I was a high-school student .
It was very enjoyable and very sweet memories for me .
However , the older people can not propose the people they love or like , I think .
It is because that older people have their husbands or wives in many cases .
Of course , if you are young and not married , you can make boyfriend or girlfriend freely .
While it may be true that not every young people can fall in love with someone , and older people tend to have much money than young people .
However , young people are given the freedom .
That 's why they may be find their love affairs and are given money by thier parents .
To be young means that to be free , I think .

In conclusion , I support the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
His/her energy and freedom enables him/her to enjoy life , I think .
