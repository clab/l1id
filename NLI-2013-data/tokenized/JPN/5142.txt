There are many impressive advertisements in every countries to make their products look nice .
However , I sometimes dissapoint its value when I buy , because it is really different from they are .
That 's the method of atracting people to buy their goods and that 's the only way that people know about the products .

In my oppinion , it is important to make goods look nice for sellers because they have to sell products as much as possible because they spend a lot of money for the advertisements .
For example , one company which sells goods cheaper than othere companies in Japan .
They do n't use big advertisements .
Their goods are worth of the price but it 's not atractive at all .
For getting customers and improving their quality , it is important to have a advertisements .
competition is good for customers , too .

It is difficult to know about products without any advertisements because that 's the only way to let people get across .
It has to be catchy and impressive .
If there are same kind of products at the same time , it 's difficult to decide which one to buy .
I think it is also an important ability to show the products nice for the companies .

In conclusion , for these reasons that I mentioned , I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
It 's neccesary for the modern society 's competition .
