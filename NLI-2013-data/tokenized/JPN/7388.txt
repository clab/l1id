I do not think it a good idea to take a group trip led by a tour guide .
I have to admit that there are some advantages of this stye of travelling .
There are no troublesome decision making , no worry about nasty troubles , and most importantly , it is cheap .
Actually , I used to make use of this when I was an university student .
But now I realized that a group trip is simply boring and is not worth paying even little money .
I will give two reason for my opinion .

Firstly , you cannot fully enjoy your travel , unless you explore the town by your self .
The good part of taking a trip lies in the point that you might come across strange and new things and people in a new environment .
You can find out an unknow part of yourself and some new perspectives on life itself .
If you take a group trip , however , you cannot appreciate this point , since you are always bound up by the tight schedule .

Secondly , you could easily end up buying loads of unattractive goods at the extraordinary high price , if you join a group tour .
As is well know , the reason why a group tour is cheap is that it has a strong connection with local shops .
When I went to Chine in a group tour , I was so annoyed by shop assistants desperately selling expensive goods with their fluent Japanese .
It definitely ruined the great part of my pleasure in the trip .

For these reasons , I hate taking a group trip led by a busy and materialistic tour guide .
Even if I had the chance to visit a primitive island where there are nobody who can help me , I would not chose a guiding tour .
