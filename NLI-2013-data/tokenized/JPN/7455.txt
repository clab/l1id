I think there are some people who wishs to travel in a group led by a tour guide , especially abroad .
But I do n't think it 's the best way to do .
I disagree with the statement ` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' .

There are two important points about this statement --- ` travelling in a group ' and ` led by a tour guide ' .
First , if we travel in a group , we ca n't see things and think in our mind quietly .
That also means we have to adjust the pace to walk or see things to other 's .

Second , if we are led by a tour guide , we have to listen to his or her guide all the time .
Even if some of their saying is already known by us , we have to put up with hearing it .

Moreover , if we take part in a group tour , places to go are chosen beforehand and unchangeable in most of the cases .

Certainly , we may feel much more secure if we travel in a group led by a tour guide .
We do n't have to worry if we feel bad or get deseases compared to the situation of travelling alone .
And we can meet unknown people of touring member .
Also we do n't have to find a place to eat because it is decieded from the first mostly .

But despite these points , I prefer traveling alone because we can go anywhere we want if we travel by ourselves .
And we can enjoy many places --- including some local areas which is not popular --- that the touring seems not to go to .
Moreover , if we do n't have a tour guide around us , we have to check the information of the destination beforehand and plan the whole process of the travel .
That makes us know much closer about that place , and enable us to have a strength to deal with things happening in unknown places .

Feeling secure and being comfortable are totally different .

These are the reasons that I perfer travelling alone .
So I disagree with the previous statement .
