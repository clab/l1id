I personally do n't agree that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .l have several reasons as follows .

First , the older also can enjoy their life .
Because , they have a lot of experience , knowledge and wisdom to whole their lives individually , IThey can have much time

Second , Most older people have more free time and money than younger people .
They can access everwhere and every time they like if they are fine .
In japan , many elderly enjoy to travel , walk mountains , pray KOTO , write HAIKU , you know , our traditional culture and so on .
For example , my grandparents love trevelling very much together .
From when they finish to grow up their child , my mother .
they enjoy to travel in Japan , china , korea and so on .
This summer , they visited New York and saw around town and enjoy to see musical in broadway .
They said to me so wonderful trip !
I think their freetime and many by working long time , and mental maturity can come ture that .

Third , now , more and more old people become to keep good health , and have long life expectancy .
So they can move active as like the younger .
Actually .
we can see that some elderly are active than some young people .
I Therefore , as I mentioned above , I definitely think that old people enjoy life as much as young people .
