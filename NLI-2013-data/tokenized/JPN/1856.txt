I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Now , to make the statement clearly , I define the age of each people .
I set the age of young people around 20 , and the age of older people around 60 .

I can not decide which people enjoy more because both of them has different kind of things to enjoy their life .
So , I would like to compare some points .
The ordinary differences between young people and older people are the phisical ability , the quantity of money , the variety of the experience and so on .
Now , I compare these things between young people and older people .

First , as to the phisical ability , young people has more ability than older people .
So , we can say that young people enjoy more than older people such as sports or dancing all night or other thing which needs energy .

second , as to money , most older people have more money than they were young .
So , older people can enjoy more than young people when doing something costs a lot .
For example , my parents enjoys their life with using more money than it used to be .
They go to the restrant often and eat delicious meat , and they go to concert or see the show .
These things are costs too much for the young people to enjoy often .

Third , the quality of experience is greatly differd between young people and older people .
Because Young people have not know various things in the society yet , they can experience new things everyday .
So they enjoy knowing new things , new people , new ways of thinking .
On the other hand , older people can live with their various experiences for their long life .
In the 60 years , they experienced various kinds of things which the young people have not expereinced yet .
So , they know more enjoyable things than young people .

Considering these points , I can not say that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Both people enjoys their own life with their own steps .
