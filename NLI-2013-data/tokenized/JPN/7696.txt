In Japan , where I live , there are many travelers around famous places such as Kyoto , Fukuoka , and Tokyo .
As the way of trip , some people feel that travel in a group with a tour guide is the best way .
However , in my opinion , I disagree that the best way is to travel in a group .
I prefer to travel individually .

More importantly , I can go to travel when I feel to want travel .
If I plan to go somewhere , immediately I can go everywhere and everytime .
However , if I go to travel in a group , it is necessary to arrange the time that members in a group can gather .
For example , last sunday I went to hotspring alone in Okutama , which is famous for hotspring location in Japan .
At that time , I could go there soon because I did not need to gather friends .

Additionally , individual travel has a lot of chance to touch local people .
When I travel individually .
I try to talk to local people for knowing the real situation that I can never know from reading a guide books .
When I went to the United States individually this January , I got wonderful experience thanks to talk to local people .
When I spoke to police in New York , I could enjoy to speak English and have fruitful talk with police .
If I went to New York in a group , I could not have such an experience .

Therefore , from these reasons I do not agree that the best way for trip is in a group led by a tour guide .
