No one wants be poor ; everyone wants to improve their own status , or quality of life .
That 's why people try to work hard on studying or exploring .
Then successful people tend to try new thing s and take risks because of three befits ; new opprotunities , highly outcomes , and freeness .

First of all , trying new things has a new opprotunities .
Because no one have done before , if people pursure the new things , they can be the first people of a particular field .
I-pod examplies this outcome .
Because creator of I-pod made I-pod the frist creative MP3 , I-pod became the simbol of MP3 , making many profits .
There are so many MP3 in music world , but I-pod is the first , making strong impressing to folks .

Secondly , successful people tend to take risks and get the possibility to high outcome .
If people avoid to take risks and bet just small amout of menoy .
they are never going to be same status thoughout their lifes .
Successful people , for example , spend a large amout of money to build new office insead of limiting risks , they created a great office , making employee comfortable and willing to do their tasks .

Finally , Tryign and taking risks have a freedom leading success .
As I said , no one have done before , people exploring new things do not have to follow existed rules or retrospects .
Sometimes , the bad habit kill new imaginative ideas .
In order to successed , creative thinkings are crucial to make profits .

All in all , successful people are more likely to strat new things and taking risks for new chances , huge benefits , and freedom .
People tend to be afraid to trynig to new things and taking risks and avoid thise things .
However , if people really want to be successful people , at first they need to be brave enought to explore new things and taking risks
