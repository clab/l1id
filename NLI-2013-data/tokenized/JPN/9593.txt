Before starting this argument , I would like to define the term `` Successful '' as a achievement of what he/she wants to do . ''
.
Based on the definition determined above , I would agree with the statement due to the two reasons .

First , people who try new things basically know what he/she really wants to do and have a strong will to achieve it .
Generally , for most people , finding what he/she wants to do is very difficult and people who are doing what they already know how to do well tend to have a hard time with this process or stop thinking about it .
For example , I have been working as an auditor for more than 5 years and I know what I am doing well .
Although , the salary increases and I work more easily because of the experiences recently , I doubt if I am doing what I really want to do and to achieve .
The people who are trying new things have already gotton over this question to themselves and is in at next stage .

Second , people how are doing new things are taking risks at the same time .
For example , as I mentioned in prior paragraph , I have been an auditor for 5 years and am working as a manger now .
If I decided to leave my firm and to start new career in different company , I might have to start my career as a staff again .
Taking this kind or riks is very difficult for most people .
I respect their brave

In conclusion , based on the reasons mentioned above , I strongly agree with the statement .
