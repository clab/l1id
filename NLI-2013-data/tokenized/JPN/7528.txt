I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I have three reasons for it .
First of all , it would not be good , if you have some kind of specific things that you want to see .
Because of too many people , you have to come back within a time and you can not spend time what you want to see or experience .
I think it is better to travel by yourself or with small numbers of people , if you do have .
Therefore , you can spend , experience , as much time as you want .
You do not have to care about time or others .
It will be your own travel , not for travel for everyone .

Second , if you travel in a group with a tour guide , it means that you can not do whatever you want .
You sometimes follow orders , such as time and going to bathroom .
For example , you have to see whats in the tour .
You might not in interested in the things , but you have to walk around and see with groups .
Another example is when everyone goes to a bathroom , you should go there , too .
Otherwise , you might want to go to bathroom later .
But it would bother others and kill time for everyone because you travel with others .
You always have to think and caqre about others .
On the other hand , if you go by yourself , you will be able to skip what you do not want and spend more time what you want to see .
I think you can enjoy your trip more without caring others or stress from others .

Lastly , I think it is good for you to travel by yourself before trip , such as when you make plans and study about the places and cultures .
Because you have to travel by yourself , you might have to research about the places in detail in order to make your travel better one .
You also might have to study about the languages they use beforehand .
Then you will get opportunities to use your research and languages over there .
I think after the travel , you will become more familiar with the places , cultures and forth .
I am sure you will never forget the travel because you created . !
If you travel with others plan , through the agent , I do not think everything will be perfect or satisfy you throughly .
I guess you will complain with something at least once because you do not make it .

In conclusion , I think the best way to travel is individual .
Then I think you can spend as much time as you want , study about whatever you like , whatever you want to do .
Also you willl be able to make a trip more enjoyable and better one than plans that others make .
Because of those reason , I would prefer to travel by myself , but not going with a group led by a tour guide .
