Today in Japan , I think some young people dont help their communities .
I think it is because they are not interesting in their lives .
Some people say that they dont have much time to spend helping communities but I think those are just the reason why they dont want to do it .
So I think they should be interested in their community and give enough time to helping their communities to see their lives again .

Some communities have some problems .
I think the most biggest common problem is the environment .
I am interested in these environment so I do want to know about these problems and want to think what i can do for communities .
These environment problems are very important today i think , because those are depending on our lives and they are relative to our future lives .
So I think that people have to consider about these problems again of course , but young people should be in mind these problems becasue young people will make our future life so that they should give enough time to helping thier comminuties .
These a little helping can make our communities better .

Having siad that , some people against my idea because studying or playing sports or doing what they like are also important .
However , I think young people can give more time to helping considering their communities because young people 's infuluences are very big so that if they more pay attention to their community , i think their communities will be better .

In conclusion , young people should see thier lives again and they should consider what they can do for the future .
So i disagree with this statement .
