`` It is better to be specialized in one specific subject , than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects . ''
Today , the society is made in such a way that it focuses on `` equality '' amongst all .
This fact is supported and shown in many parts of the society such as school and sports teams .

A school is a place where students are enabled to gain knowledge on whatever subjects needed to live in a society .
The problem seen in many schools is that often school requires every student to know the same subjects and does not allow them to specialize in whatever they want to study .
That is , most of the schools see value in building broad , various knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one .
Yes , it is a fact that maybe broad knowledge about various subjects would help students learn to live smarter in the society , but it also has a great chance of ruining students ' specific abilities or potentials that they originally have .
Everyone is different in their own ways , and more importantly , they are good in their own ways .
That is , there is not much of a need to know various-but-broad subjects , for they will be provided with shallow knowledge only .
Instead , students shold decide to go to whatever field they want to go , and specialize from there .
Learning tiny bits of everything would only kill uniqueness and produce sameness among the students .

The example and problem of having everyone with the same skill level is shown by Japanese national soccer team .
Traditionally , Japanese coaches consist on having his team players have the same exact abilities in every field ; running speed , shooting sense , passings , stamina , etc .
The problem with this is that even though the team might not have to worry about anyone lacking specific abilities , it will suffer from not having anyone really good at anything .
In soccer there are offensive , middle , and defensive players .
But what if everyone had the same exact style of playing ?
What good there is to have a goalie who can run as fast as the offensive player ?
That is , not just that games will be boring due to the way they play , but they will be unsuccessful as well because they lack players with specialized skills .
Strikers score goals because they are skilled in that field , and goalies save shots because that is what they are good at .
Therefore , not just soccer players , but students should also learn to be unique and specialize in one field where they can shine .

In conclusion , it is better to be specialized in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects .
This opinion was supported by typical school and Japanese national soccer team examples .
To summer up , be unique and specialize in your own field !
