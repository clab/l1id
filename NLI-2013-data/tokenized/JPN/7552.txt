Some people thinks that the way to travel in a group led by a tour guide is not good .
However , I fully agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons .

First , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is safer than travel alone or without tour guide .
For example , when I was a junior at Waseda University , a famous private university in Tokyo , Japan , I joined the tour to French for ten days with Tanada Kota , my best friends at the same class , in 1990 .
It was the first time for me to go to abroad and I could not speak French language .
During the stay in Paris , I caught a bad cold and fever .
Mr. Suzuki , a tour gide , was a kind man , had a heart of gold , and spoke French nicely .
Mr. Suzuki took me to the hospital .
Thanks to Mr. Suzuki , I could cure my disease and came back to Japan .
As the above experience shows that traveling in a group led by a tour guide is safer than travel alone or without tour guide .

Second , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more fun than travel alone or without tour guide .
For example , when I was a junior at Chuo high school , located north of Tokyo , I joined the tour to Kyoto , a traditional area in Japan , with my friends of the swimming club .
The tour guide named Hitomi was so humoras and beautiful lady .
So , we took many pictures with Hitomi .
That was a nice memory for us even today .
Last sunday , I ran into Tomohisa Kamimura , a member of that Kyoto tour , at the Tokyo Station .
We went to a bar and talk about our memory about Ms. Hitomi for three hours with a lot of whisky .
It was great night for me .
As the above example demonstrates , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is more convenient than travel alone or without tour guide .

In conculusion , I definitely agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
