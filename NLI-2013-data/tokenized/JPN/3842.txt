I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Recently , there are many people who need help in our community such as the people who have disability or elderly people .
For example , in Japan , We have the greatest number of people who have the age of over sixty-five today .
In spite of the fact that there are a lot of elderly people who are waiting for the help , there are not enough young people who can support them because they do not have much time for helping people .

First of all , young people are more likely to work rather than help community recently .
For instance , a lot of young people prefer to have pattern jobs because they want to earn more money for theirselves .
Young people are usually independent enough to live by theirselves , so they can not get affored by their parents any more , so they need to work hard .
On the other hand , a lot of opportunity which contribute for the community are unpaid work such as volunteer work ; therefore , students who want to earn money dont have interest to spent the time to help community .

Secondary , young people are busy for studying nowadays .
A lot of university students are busy for doing their project or homework everyday , so they do not have extra time to help community .
In Japan , many people think it is getting difficult to get hired by a good company recently ; therefore students have to study harder than others and win the competition to get better job in the future .

To conclude , young people do not have much time to contribute for the community recently because they are busy for working and studying .
