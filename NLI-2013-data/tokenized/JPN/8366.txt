I agree the statements .
Most important thing for students is to understand exsiting knowledge .
Students have to learn flameworks of exiting kwnoledge .
I was a student of mathmatics and realized how important to understand concepts .
There are many simple facts in mathematics but gathering facts didnt lead me to any ideas nor concepts .
Especially students ususal do n't have ability to create idea or concepts , therfore just leaning facts dose n't make anything for the students So at first , to get ability to create new concepts nor ideas students heve to learn about what concepts is , how exititng concepts was created .
Once students get ability to cerate concepts , it 's also important to learn facts .
I know that I have to learn English harder .
It 's good experience for me to take TOEFL because I have realized my English skill .
This test makes me to want to study English .

I have take this test just because I want to no my English skill , in this meanings I can mesure my english skill before I recieve the score .

Thanks .
