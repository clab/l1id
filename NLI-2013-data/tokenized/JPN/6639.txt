I disagree with the statement saying `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use , '' bacuase it is unrealistic .
Cars are essential item for people to live with all over the world today , and it is impossible that people invent something substitute to cars .

In Japan , for example , people can get around only by puclic transportation only in the major cities , such as Tokyo or Osaka .
Anywhere outside of them cannot function without cars which transfer goods and people from and to the place .
My family does not own a car , however , this is because we live in the Tokyo area where trains come every three minutes .
This sotuation is expeptinal compared to other cities in the world , and people still have cars in Tokyo to step out of this area .

In America , the situation of public transportation is even worse .
Since America is such a huge country where the population is scattered , people have to drive wherever they go .
It is true to almost all the major cities , such as Los Angeles or Wahington D.C. Only New Yorkers can afford not to have cars .
In most of the parts in the coutry , people cannot even go shopping or schools without cars .
I once lived in the San Francisco Bay Area , which is known for its great public transportation represented by BART , yet I still wished to have a car in order to go out safely at night .
BART does not run as late and frequesnt as subways in Tokyo , therefore people need cars anyway even in the city in the States .
There is no plan to expand public transportation services either .
Even if so , it is not realistic to accomplish it in twenty years .

This provides the vision that the world remain to need as many cars as it does today .
There is nothing that can cause declining of cars in number .
Moreover , more and more country are developing its ecomony and industry nowadays .
China is a good example of a quickly developing country .
When the nation develops , there will be more population and movement of people and goods , which requires the cheapest means of transportation ; cars .
More developing counties will need cars for its development , and people who have never The need for environmentally conscious car technology will be in greater need in the future , however , the need for cars itself will not decline .
