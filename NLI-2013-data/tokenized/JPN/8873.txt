In my opinion , to learn facts is more important to understand ideas and concepts .
Because learning facts would be practical and memorable for students .
To understand concepts and ideas would be the base of learning facts .
However , without learning facts , ideas and concepts which students understood are nothing but their knowledge .

First , to learn facts is very practical .
For instance , when a child was going to touch a very hot kettle .
His or her mother would say `` Stop !
Do not touch !
It is hot and dangerous '' The child might understand the meaning of `` hot '' and `` dangerous '' as the ida or the concept .
He or she might stop their action , although their curiosity would never disappear .
We can say the same thing for the students .
When they understood concepts and ideas about Karate , they would think `` Karate is not that difficult . ''
Is that true ?
When they only understand ideas and concepts in class .
They would think that they know everything about that , but that is not true .

Second , students could learn facts and they would not forget about that .
In Japan , we have old words about learning facts and understanding ideas and concepts ; Hyakubun ha ikken ni shikazu '' that means `` When you see it , you will learn everything in no time and never disappear '' .
For example , the child who were trying to touch the hot kettle , would reach the kettle and got burnt , he or she would never forget about that .

On the contrary , after students learn facts , to understand ideas and concepts would be easy for them .
When they lost at Karate match , they would learn the concepts and ideas about Karate very quickly .
Even when they won , they would understand the concepts and ideas why they won

In conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts is very important for students .
Yet , without learning facts , their knowledge cannot be practical and memorable .
