I agree to the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
There are three reasons to support my opinion .

First of all , especially where I live in Japan the population is getting smaller every year .
Some people estimate that the population would be half in the future .
Of course , when the population gets smaller , people who use cars will be decreased .

Second of all , the focus on the environment is getting bigger every year .
Without doubt , the fossil fuels that cars give to the air are very bad to the environment .
So I think that the use of cars would be restricted internationally in twenty years .

Lastly , it is more dangerous to use cars than to use trains .
The number of the traffic accident increases , so people might get to think that they should use trains to move because it is much less dangerous than to use cars .

For those reasons , I definitely agree to the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
