I have a father who works very hard .
He is a manager of a group of Japanese people at a company called Hitachi .
Sometimes my father works so hard that he works at his company until the next morning .
I feel bad for him sometimes .
One day , I asked him about how he managed to do all the hard work .
In Japanese , he said that he enjoys the work that he does and he said that the work that he does is very hard work , but he feels rewarded when he finishes the work because he gets a bonus when he does an extra hard work .

I work very hard too .
I go to a very demanding American School with high standards .
I work hard to keep up my grades in my AP Environmental Science , AP Calculus and AP Statistics classes .
During the time off when I have free time , I work on my homework .
During the weekend , I work on my homework .
I am under a lot of stress and pressure .
I turned my college applications in last week .
I am worried that I might not get accepted into the colleges that I intend to get in .
FYI , the colleges that I applied to last week was in America .
My parents also gave me an option to apply to Japanese universities but I cannot apply to them until I get the result from the American universities because the year starts different for American and Japanese Universities .
To be honest , I do not know which country to go to .
In addition , I have a choice of rejecting the University in America and instead apply to a University in Japan or I can go to a University in America .
Either way , I do not know which country to choose between Japan and America .
The Universities in America that I applied to will give me the results of whether I am a good candidate or not in April .
Moreover I have three months until I can decide whether I will go to America or not , but I have not a clue about which country to choose because I love both countries .
( I can not stay in England because of financial problems )
Considering that young people are people younger than a college student like me and older people are people who are older than a high school senior , I think older people enjoy life more than young people .
Young people are under enormous pressure because of the issue with the University and the future after that .
On the other hand , older people do not have to endure with that pressure because they have already gone over that obstacle .
