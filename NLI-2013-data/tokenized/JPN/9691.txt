There is a statement that says `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
In this essay , I would like to respond to the statement .

Fisrt of all , I would like to define the word success .
I define the word sucess as to achieve something that can be admired by others .
So if there is someone that has done something that everyone else admires , that person is said to be successful .

Now I would like to respond to the statement .
People tend to admire someone who has done somthing that everyone else has never tried to do .
If there is someone who has tried to do something that is tried by anyone yet and succeeds by doing it , everyone admires him/her for taking risks .
This happens often in the world .
For example , there was a physicist who invented an idea called `` anti-matter '' .
This concept is never thought by anyone else because in order to come up with this idea , you need to take account negative numbers which do not seem realistic in this case .
Now in physics , the concept of `` anti-matter '' is known and it seems to be true .
The physicist who invented this idea becomes very popular and he wons a Nobel Prize .
This example tells you how taking risks lead you to success .

There are many people who have succeeded due to their challenge ; yet there are also many people who have failed to succeed because they tried to take risks .
In these cases , people ignore them and people only look at people who succeeds by taking risks .
There is a bias and in order to discussing fairly , we need to know the risk of failing .

There are also people who have suceeded due to what they already know how to do well .
For example , There is a famous football player called Ronaldinho .
He has won a World cup and other titles as well .
He has many great skills and his most famous skill is called elastico .
However this skill is not invented by him and it was invented by a player called Falcan who played many decades ago .
Ronaldinho uses Falcan ' s skill and he became very famous .
This example tells you that doing what they already know can also lead you to success .

The most important thing to succeed is not how to do ; it is how well you do .
If you try something very hard and very effectively , there is a chance to succeed .
I would agree to the statement becasue taking risks is better than `` only doing what they already know '' .
It is good at doing what they already know but it is important to at least try to invent new things .
