I disagree about this question for the following two reasons .
First , comunicate with other people is basis for human beings .
Nowadays , most young people have mobile phone and using it by not calling but mailing .
In fact , mailing is useful and easy to send message .
But I think mail is difficult to express their feelings .
Second , I think human beings can not live alone .
Everyone wants friends to speak of , and anyone loves human beings .
A long time ago , there was no mobile phone , TV , and television game .
So young people played outside with many friends who live nearby them .
It caused their communities .
But now , boys and girls play inside because of television game .
It is bad for their health and heart .
I hope young people play outside .
Because they are treasure for future .
