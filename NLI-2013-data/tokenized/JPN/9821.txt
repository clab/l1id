What 's is the successful people ?
Some people may say they have a lot of money and hard worker .
I think it means the successful person try new things and take risks .
I think successful person try to make the new world , study harder and they have a big dream .
People do n't respect the nomal person .
Peopel respect the successful person because they try to do the things which the nomal person could't to do that .
So people called the successful people and they can get a lot of money .

First , they try to make the new world .
For instance computer programer makes a atractive world .
Nowadays we can easy to show this skill in the movie and enjoy that .
They can make everything in the computer such as background , animals and universe .
This skill makes us increase our imagination .
However computer programer try to make the new world everyday because they must give us the new things which makes us surprise and ca n't image .
They must try to be left behind the world .
Otherwise they lost the job .

Second , they study so hard .
For example I usually watch the student in the bus .
they try to make the picture hardly .
They must try to do again and again and admit from the people .
Just enjoy the picture does n't make money .
The successful people are very few .
If you make the success , you should try harder .

Third , they have a big dream .
Everyone want to get a success and get the money .
And Everyone hope to respect from somebody .
For example I can tell you about me .
I came here to study about nursing .
Even though my native language is different and sometimes I ca n't comunicate with people .
But I try to continue to study because I want to be a resercher in Japan .
It took long time and big money for me .
But I want to believe my future .
If I continue to work in Japan , I can get the good life .

That 's why I agree with this opinion .
And I think the successful person is a hard worker and good dreamer .
I hope to be like that .
