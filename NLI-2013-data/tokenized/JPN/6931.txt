In twenty years , will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
I think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
It is true that cars are significantly important as transportation ways for middle distance , and the middle-distance transportation will become more important because we need communication and transaction with those who live places where are far from the places where we live in .
However , for two reasons , I think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The first reason is the increasing of substitutional transportation ways and the second reason is that the long-distance transportation becomes more impotant than the middle-distance transporation .

First , it is true that middle-distance transportation becomes more important .
However , ways of middle-distance transportation are not only cars .
For example , buses are in use for middle-distance transportation .
Recently , we pay attention to the negative effect of cars on environment because gases which are issued by cars are said to have effects which make the atomosphere warmer .
Therefore , the movement occurs that we use buses instead of my cars in order to reduce cars which are in use at the same time .
When we consider this trend , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Second , although I think that middle-distance transportation becomes more important , long-distance transportation must become more important than middle-distance transportation , since the necessity of long-distance transportation because Information Technology allows us to find new infomation about the overseas and to encourage us to go abroad .
Therefore , although middle-distance transportation may become more important , international transportation becomes important than this .
And , if international transportation is more importatnt relatively and expenditure by people remains unchanged , people reduces the expenditure for middle-distance , there are fewer cars in use than there are today .

For the above two reasons , I think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
However , this does not imply that cars are less important than today ; I mean that long-distance transportation is by far more important than middle-distance transportation and ways for middle-distance transportation change .
