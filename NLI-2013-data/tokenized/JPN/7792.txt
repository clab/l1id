If I can choose the answer whether I agree or disagree with that the best way is in a groop led by tour guide .
I definetly choose the answer that I disaggree with the statment .
I would not like travel by a tour guide .
Folowing I will take specific reasons why I dislike trabeling by tour guide .

First , there is great restriction of time if he or she travel in groupe by a tour guide .
In my case , Now I works very hard in daytime and I might be ordered accidently by the boss to work horiday .
So as is often to the case with traveling is in a grop by a tour guide , when to travel and where to trabel is already detamined and is not available for me .
Therefore , I prefer to trabel alone or with few friend by coordinating easy to suit my own work time .

Second reason I dislike traveling by a tour guide is that guiding can decrease opportunities to communicate people in the destination by using foregin language .
Usually , a tour guide can some foregin language and in travel , a guide translate foreing language of destinations and we do not have to use foreign language .
That is nonsense for me because I want to study foreign langage especially in my travel .
I beleive that traveling alone , without tour guide is good for improve my speaking foregin langrages .

Last , if I travel abroad alone without a tour guide , I can discover something in my travel with my oun effort .
That is presure for me !
All above of that , I prefer traveling alone or with few friends to traveling in a group by a tour guide .
Of course , There are some advantages of traveling in a group .
For example , The price of traveling tends to be lower and more economical if we choose traveling in a group .
But , as I take all above of that. , in my opinion , advatntages of traveling alone withotut guide is much greater than these of traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
