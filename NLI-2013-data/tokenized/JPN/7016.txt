I do n't agree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
First reason is that cars are currently most convenient transportation with high technology .
It is convenient because we do not have to wait to drive a car without worrying about the weather and can easily get to the point where we would like to go unlike commercial train or bus .
The technology is still developing which makes car run more fast and safe , provides user the confortable room inside the car .
Once people gain the convenience , we will not be able to go back to inconvenient world .

Second reason is that there will be more cars that are good for environment .
Many car companies have been develoveped their technology and skills , and contributed to the environment .
The price is yet high , but they were able to produce electonical car .

Therefore , the car will meet people 's desire that technology will eventually go with it .
