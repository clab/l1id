I think older people should enjoy life more than young people .
Old peopl usually retered their jobs , so they have a lot of time .
Moreover , When they was young they were working hardly for many reasons .
therefore , I think older people can enjoy more than young people .
People usually said young people can to everything but older people are diffcult .
However , I do not think so becouse my grandmother is always enjoy her life , for example , she learnes song , it called Shigin in Japan , and tradidional Japanese dance .
She stareted to learn thesethings when she was a 65 years old , but she can learn new things and enjoy these things .
Moreover , other my grandmother learn to sing a Japanese song , for example Enka songs , and plant vegitable and flower in her garden .
she like to take care plants and eat freash vegitables .
I think old people want to do new things becouse when they were young people they usuaslly could not to do anything to theirself .
Garbament could not allow free when during or after war .
After war people always to work very hardly .
They did not have a enough money and did not free time .
However , now to change the enviroment , so they can to do anythings if they wont and have a money .
When older people was young , they could not to have free time and could not to enjoy their lifes for working , but now they can have free time and to enjoy their lifes .
Therefore , I think older people shoul enjoy life more than young people do .
