I agree the idea that `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , becasue I have three models of the successful people .

First , one of the three successful people is my old brother .
When he was a junior high schoo student , he did not like to study very well .
He did not study , so his grade was not good .
But one day , he met a high school teacher in the town .
Then he thought I want to be his student , so I want to take the his school entrance exam .
But the school study revel is high .
I should study hard .
After my brother met the teacher , he studied very hard .
So he could get better grade than before , and he could be one of a student of the teacher 's high school .

Second , one of the three successful people is Mr. Toyota .
He created the big and famous car company in Japan .
I think the company was one of the famous car companies in the world .
When he was a child , his family was poor .
Becasue he must help to his family in his child age , he could not get studying oppotunity well .
His father 's job was small bike store , so when he graduate junior high school , he was president of the small company .
Then he created idea of corporation like big american trrain comopanies .
The idea was very big risk then , becasue it was not common idea in Japan .
Today , his company became a big company .

Third , one of the three successful people is Syoinn Yoshida .
He was one of the most famous people in Japan .
He was teacher in MEIJI era .
When he was teacher , he thought Japan should learn from other contories like England or America .
But then people , who go to abroad without permittion from government , was very big crime .
But he tried to go to America .
He swam to the America 's big boart at the night .
And he tried to go to America .
But then american officer did not permit because America did not want to attack .
But the story made Japan courage .
