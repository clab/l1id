Young people have future .
I agree this statement .
Now I am a person who is thought young people .
I enjoy my life now .
May be I will have some problems in the future .
These troubles will cause difficluty that I can enjoy the life .
Now a days many older people have these problems .
On the other hand , young peole have a long future .
Most of them will live longer than older people , so they can plan many things what they are going to do in the future .
This is also means that If they have a trouble , they have enough time to solve it .
For example health problem and finance problem .

At first , ususally young people are healther than older people .
Helth problem is seriou and it aboid happy life .
In my experonence , my grandmather always suffer from her disease .
Because of this disease , it is hard for her to walk aroud her house .
She can not go to shop to buy food .
Unfortunetly , recently sometimes she can not go to toillet on her own abilliy .
She always says that she wishs , she can go back her young days .
Many Japanese old people say that how your health is when they met some old person .

The second , older people can not work , so they have to consider about their finance .
They have to manage the money .
It is stress for them .
However young people can work well , because they are fine .
they do not have to care about it .
Also It is easy for them tothem to rend money .

In conclusion , I do not have a serious problem that she older people have now , but I will have soon .
What should do is not only enjoying this life but also prepare for the future .
Therefore , I suppose this statement is true .
