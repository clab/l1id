When I think of TV commercials , catalogs , and advertisements in a town , I certain agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

The purpose of advertisements is promoting the products ' sales .
Therefore , I think it is a natural sequence that advertisements try to make prtoducts seem better as much as possible .
Therefore , customers should be aware of the nature of advertisements and should carefully examine the products before purchase .

However , this nature of advertisements has become a growing concern today .
It has been for a while since catalog shoppings started , and online shoppings have been significantly increasing lately .
Customes cannot look closely at or touch products before perchase on catalog and online shoppings .
If advertisements make products look too much better than they are really are , customers may regret the purchase when they have the products in their hands .
I often see this situation happens around me .

I think it relies on the marketing strategies and also moral of sellers how much better advertisements are allowed to make products seem .
Sellers definetely should provide as detailed written information as possible other than `` a nice picture . ''
Sellers also may need to provide the information that customers often misunderstand about the product .
Sellers who are sincere about their products eventually attain customers ' trust , and become a winner in the field of products , hopefully .
