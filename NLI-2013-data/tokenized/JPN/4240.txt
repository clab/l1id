I think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because schools do not provide these opportunity to the children and children lose their familiarization with their hometown .

Nowadays , the children are expected to enter a high-level collage and get a master degree because they will get haigh salary or high position in the company if they can achieve to take a collage education .
Therefore , parents demands the schools to give a good education for their children , and schools make a rigid study carriculum .
They give students a lot of homeworks that do not permit students to have a free time to do something .
They study hard even after the class and remain staying in the classroom .
They are getting tired and cannot have a time to helping their communities .

By getting tired , they do not look for their surrounding .
In other words , they cannot afford to care about their communities .
In addition that , nowadays the connection with neighbors are weaker than before .
Sometimes a child does not know even the neighbor 's face and the number of family members .
It causes the careless to the neighbors .
If they do not know the neighbors , they do not think they have to consider about neighbors .

In conclusion , what I would like to say is young people do not have enough time to helping their communities because they have to use their time by studying , and they are not familiar with their surrounding environments .
However , we should not complain the children about this .
Actually , we , adults made this situation .
We grab away their freedom and , we do not children to have kindness to the surroundings .
We should know what the important thing which we have to teach children , high level education ?
Kindness to others ?
It is important .
