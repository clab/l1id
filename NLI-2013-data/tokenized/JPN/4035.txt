I agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communties .
There are two reasons as below .
First , young people need to communicate with someone who join communties because they can learn many things to become adults .
Second , young people can get good experience and advise to grow their charactertistic .
For example , they talk with elder people , then they have different thinking , so young people can get different view of thinking .

In conclustion , it is very important for young people to join their communities .
They can spend good time in their life .
