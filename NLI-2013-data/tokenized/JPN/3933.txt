It is quite difficult for me to agree or disagree with the statement .
First of all , it is quite obscure that what the word `` enough '' means .
There are many young Japanese who help their communities , but whether they give `` enough '' time to doing it depends on the subjective view of how much time young Japanese should spend their time on helping their communities .
Older generations may disagree with the statement because they may have spent lots of their time in their communities .
The generations of the parents of the young Japanese of today may think that it is simply impossible for young Japanese to spend their time on helping their communities taken into consideration the ever-intensified competition among the young generations .
Many young Japanese spend huge amount of their time in both compulsory and private education such as `` juku , '' a cram school young Japanese go to after school .
Thus , many parents may think that young people do spend `` enough '' time to helping their communities , although they have many other things to do .
I can say niether that I agree nor that I disagree with the statement , therefore , due to the ambiguous definition of the word `` enough . ''
It all depends on the reader of the statement .

However , I may agree with the statement .
Young people may not spend much of their time to helping their communities , probably because there are only few `` communities '' in Japan particularly in large cities .
Now people move from one place to other places much more often than it used to be , and , as a result , they have fewer opportunities to establish their community itself .
When there are no communities as such , people can have no time to spend on their communities .
Thus , the statement implies that young people do not spend their time on helping communities even though there are communities which young people are supposed to help , but they do not give their time possibly because the `` communities '' are disappearing from the Japanese society now .
