Some people do not agree with young people enjoy life more than older people do , but I agree with young people enjoy life more than olader people do .
I have some reasons why I agree with it .

First , young people have more free time to do fun stuff than oleder people who is like working do .
Young people can do anything that they want to do .
Here is an example .
When I was in high school , I have been to Hawaii by using my spring break .
If someone who work , they do not have vacations .
I enjoyed staying in Hawaii by myself .

Secondly , older people dose not have anegies to enjoy their life .
I mean , I do not say they are not fine , but if you are young , you have enegies to travel or meeting someone .
I like traveling around the world and I think it can really enjoy my life .
However , it would cost to do so , so I keep my money by working hard .

Thirdly , there is some stuff that only young people can do .
For example , go to the U.S. or other countries as an exchange student or meeting new people who speaks different language from what we speak .
I have been in the U.S. for one year as an exchange student and went local high school , meet new people , had experienced different cultures what I used to it .
It was really impressing for me to be a part of different family members .
I met a lot of friends during my exchage year and had lots of fun there .
I though I could not do this if I was an older people .

All of my states , I agree with young peple enjoy life more than older people do because I had experieced some stuff that only young people can .
However , older pople has more money than young people so they can enjoy their life pretty much , too .
