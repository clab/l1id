I disagree with the statement showing `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
For example , why do all of us deeply study about history ?
This is because the knowledge of facts which happened in the past may lead us to think of how to think or how to act , now , and in the future .
There is a famous Japanese sentence shown as `` Open your future by learning from the past '' .
This exactly explains why it is important to learn facts .

Furthermore , I think that any kind of idea or concept is created by an event or fact which happened in the past .
For instance , the idea to launch the United Union , involving all nations in an organization to build an organization for them to solve national conflicts by preventing war , was created after the big event , the 2nd World War .
After learning that this kind of war means nothing to whole of the world and all of the population , the genius leaders had reached to this idea .

Therefore , I think that it is also very important for students to learn facts as much as understanding ideas and concepts .
