Some people said young people nowadays does n't help our cominities .
I supose that is true , but there are some reasons why young people does n't help the comunities .
I think young people nowadays are very busy .
They have a lot of things even if they do n't help their communities .
They have to go to the piano lessons or go to swimming , or do something .
Other children must study hard from early morning to midnight , because their parents wants them go to good univercity .
The other children have to help their housework .

Young people nawadays often go to learn something even if holiday .
For example , piano , swimming , dancing and so on .
Therefore they do n't have time to help their comminities .
Even though children want to help and join them , they have already many things to do .

Most children study very hard , because their parents wants them to that .
Sometimes they may study from early mornig to late evening , or they study even it is on the holiday .
If there are the day children do n't have to study hard , they want to be relaxed at home , or play with their friends .
Therefore , they do n't have enough time to help their communities .

These days , many parents work outsides thier house , so they need thier son or doughter 's help , so children have to thier housework to help thier parents .
There are many housework .
For instance , clean their family 's rooms , make the dinner , wash the dishes , wash their cloths , and so on .
Therefore if they have to do them , they are tired and they have no time to help their communities .

Nowadays young people have a lot of things to do , I think , so they ca n't help their communities , even if they want to help them .
