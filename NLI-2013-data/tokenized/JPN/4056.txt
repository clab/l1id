Actually , recentlly , young peope really to help their community .
However , I disagree with the idea that the young people nowadays do not give enough to helping their community .
I have some following reason for that .

First , it seems that the young people dose not have enough time for that and it seems unecessary for them to help the community .
Recentlly , from people are really young , their parents and the society around them require to study hard for their future .
Some people go to cram school and go to public school far from their community .
Also , they do not have any friends in their communty .
For them , it is not a good thing to help thier community because there is no merit for them .

In my opinion even adoults do not spend time for ther community .
Nowadays , there are many people who do not have any rerationship with their neighborfoods .
If adoults do not have relation with others in the comunitty , it is unfair to require to do that kind of things for children , because adoults always should show the good way to live and the childrens are the tend to imitate what adoults do .
Thus , if people want children to help thier community , they have to showw how and why it is important and it is need .

Also , it seems that the situation around the community itself are chenging .
I do not know there is a group working for my community , so that I do not know how to spend time for my community and what to do .
Past time , there are groups that work for the community by correcting trash or so on .
However , recentlly these groups disapper and I cannot find the place work for my community .
So , it is difficult to find something good for community that people can do .

These are the reason that I disagree with the idea that the young people nowadays do not give enough to helping their community .
In this way , I do not think children di not giveive enough to helping their community .
