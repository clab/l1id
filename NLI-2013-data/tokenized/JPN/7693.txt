I am agree .
First , to travel in a group led by a tour guide has grand security .
Even if tha travelor know anything about his tour , he can travel .
There is no trouble .
Second , it 's law price compared with lonely .
Many people attennd tha guide tour , so it 's law for each people .
Third , it 's fun .
He can meat many people during the tour .
He can make various friends .
Therefore I am agree .
