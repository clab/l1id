In addition that , in developing country people have more children , and the children can grow lively because of the medicine .

Therefore , people will need more cars .

The second reason `` the development of technique '' has three kind of sides , the easiness of making road , development of economy cars , and development of economic cars .

Then we can use cars with relief .
