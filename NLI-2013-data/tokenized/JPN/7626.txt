It 's a difficult question , but I disagree the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
There are two reasons that I disagree with this idea .
First reason is about money .
If I go to England by the package tour , I would have to pay a lot of money .
Maybe I will need pay 200,000 yen at least in case of staying London in three days .
Someone think that paying a lot of money for trip is nutural , because we buy the safty at the same time .
However , I 'm a student now and I ca n't earn a lot of money , so I will go on a trip by myself .
In Feburary , I went to England with my friends .
I bought bording pass by myself and l also booked the hotel by internet by my self .
It 's easy for me to make a contract .

Second reason is about the time .
If I go on a trip led by a tour guide , I would be able to go to some famous place of sightseeing .
However , I must keep the time .
I heard that there is n't enough time to enjoy looking at the famous place .
It means that I have to hurry to do something , but I do n't need to hurry if I go on a trip by myself .
I can enjoy looking the tourist attractions , looking around the shop , eating something until my stomach filled .

For these reasons , I disagree with the idea of traveling with a lot of peple led by tour guide .
