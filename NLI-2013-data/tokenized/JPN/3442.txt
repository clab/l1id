I agree to the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are three reasons supporting my idea ; no free time for young people , no space for them to help the society , and lack of corelate experience with others .

First of all , the young people seem losing their free time .
Since now is the competing era , they need to work as hard as they can to get the `` good education '' , which suppose to give them the better future .
Therefore , young people , including children , are expected to spent as much time as they can make for the prepartion for the coming `` test '' .
Increasing in number of the cram school , especially the one for young people , crealy shows the fact that many young pepople are spenting most of their time to study .
Thus , there will be no time for them to help their community .

Second , there are no space or role for them to help the society .
Nowadays , there are so many crimes that are done by young people .
Therefore , people are suspecting on the young people .
As a result , even young people willing to help the society , limited spaces are available for them .
For example , if the students want to help to wipe off the snow in the deep-snow city , they are checked their name , and school they are going before they can help .
If the school is one of that `` lower level '' school , they will not be able to help them because of the possibility that the one will cheet the community .
As a result , we can say that even young people want to help the society , the society reject them .

Finally , young people lose their chance to have the experience of good co-relationship with others .
Because of the lower rate to get job , people are competing all the time ; there are many `` enemys '' for the young people .
As a result , having good corelationship with others , the core idea of helping the community , is hard task for them to think about .
If they cannot feel the importance of helping each other , they will not think to spent their little free time to help their community .

In conclusion , because they are busy , are rejected by society , and have no such idea as corelation with others , young people are not helping their communities , in my point of view .
All of those factors are strongly connected for the
