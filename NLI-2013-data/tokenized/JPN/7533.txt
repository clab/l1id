The statement said that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I disagree with the statement because if you travel by a tour guide , we can not learn as much as individual travel .

First , if we travel by a tour guide , we can not go everywhere we want to .
Because the tour guide has a plan and also we can not spend as much as we want in one place .
We have to fallow the tour guider everytime .
Sometimes we can not go to the place that we want .
If we go travel by ourself , we can go to the place everywhere we want .
Also we do not have to worry about time .
But there is good things about the tour guide .
That is the tour guide explain that sometimes people do not know .

Second , if we travel by a tour guide , we depend to other people .
Because we can not make a decision by ourself .
We always have to ask other people 's opinion .
For example , if we want to go to the restroom , we have to ask the tour guide .
And it will cause that everybody has to wait for them .
Because we can not walk by individual .
This was real happen to me .
When my family went to travel by a tour guide , I wanted to go to the restroom and I asked my parents to go to the bathroom , but they are not let me to go to the restroom .
Then , I had to hold .
So I thought travel by a tour guide is not very smart .
Especailly , people have a litte children .

Third , if we go other country to travel by a tour guide , we can not learn language .
For me , I am interesting to learn other language and while I try to speak other language and the tour guider helped me , it bather me .
I try best as I can .

There are good things about a tour guige , too .
The tour guide prepare everything we need such as hotel , meal , or plan during travel .
Also , the tour guider translate when they go to the foreing country .
This is good for people who do not want to speak other language .

In conclusion , the best way to travel is not in a group by a tour guide .
It is fun to travel by ourself .
It will be like adventure .
Traveling by ourself has a lots of advantages .
I think we should not depended other people , because we will not grow .
If we travel ourself , we will grow by step by step .
But we will not see it .
We should try travel by ourself .
Especally , who travel a lot by tour guide .
