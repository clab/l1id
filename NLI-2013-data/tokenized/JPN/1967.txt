I disagreee this statement .
Because , I think it depends on people .
I take one example and approach this problem .
Now I live in Tokyo with my grand mother .
Her name is Kazuko .
She is 68 years old .
Usually over 60 are rentnerin and have no work .
But she is still worker .
She works in drug store .
Every day she gets up early and leaves house .
And she goes back to home late .
I thougt that hard working is difficult for her .
So I asked her
`` Such a hard working is difficult is n't you ? ''
`` No , it is enjoyable !! ''
She said .
I was surprised to hear that .
She continued .
`` Once I retired .
But then I was at a loss what should I do .
And I had a boring life .
After that I determined I work again !! ''
Generally speaking I think a lot of people assume `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
But strictry speaking , it is nonsense .
Thinking `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' is neglect to older people , I think !!
Now I 'm second grade university student and major in English literature .
When I was a freshman , I majored in Gerrman literature .
It was boring for me.so thenI did n't enjoy life .
But I decided changing my major and could achieve this desire .
So now I am enjoying my daily life !!
Conclusion states that `` Enjoying life '' does n't matter age !!
Thank you !!
That 's all !!
