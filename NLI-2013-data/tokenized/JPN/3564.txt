I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities from the following three reasons ; ( 1 ) they have enough time , ( 2 ) they have little intention to do , ( 3 ) their communities do n't expect young people to do ,

First , I believe they have enough time to helping their communities .
Because they have a lot of time to play and go anywhere with their friends .
According to a certain survey , young people use 60percent of their private time with their friends , 20 percent with family , 15percent with collegues of their company and 5percent with their communities .

Second , they have little intention to helping their communities .
They are little interested with staying with their communities .
One of the biggest reasons is that they should follow their traditional customes .
They are bothersome to young people .
Most young people want to stay with their friends using modern equipments , such as TV game .
In addition , besides helping their communities , young generation have a lot of chances and places to be involved and help other communities and wider world , such as other countries and cities and communities .

Third , their communities also do n't expect young people to envolve into the events .
Because it is difficult both side to communicate well , teach something and stay together .
Sometimes to helping the communities might be botherd and harmful to their communities .
In my case , as I did n't know how to do , I could n't help any thing to my community in the past .
As a result , I did n't want to be involved into their events as much as possible .

From the above reasons , I do n't strongly agree that young generation recent days do not give satisfactory time to helping and be involved into heir communities .
