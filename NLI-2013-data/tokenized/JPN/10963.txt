`` New things '' make you excited and `` take risk '' does not scare you at all .
There many successful people around the world , what is common between them is that they tried new things and took risks .
I strongly agree with that statement with following reasons : New things does not need to be compared and bothered by competitors .

Looking through inventions around the wourld .
Nothing existed before it had invented .
So you would not imagen and think what it looks like or how it works before someone announce a new things .
Inventor is always using their imaginations to make new product .
It comes not only their mind but also people 's demands .
Although they feel worry until thier investment is achieved form people , they feel excite to make new things .
Once it has appeared in public , there is no comparable thing in the market .
So that it is easy to get great reputation from public .

I had worked at coordination company in Japan , this company was found for coordinate Japanese TV and Commercial company or production to film in Africa .
When we established this company , people said `` nobody want to go to Africa and public are not interested in Africa at all '' .
During the first year was hard time for us .
But from the second year , we gradually got customer who goes to Africa .
More and more take TV people to Africa , more and more publics are interested in Africa .
As a result , we had a big African festival in Tokyo collaborate with many African embassies and Japanese key TV stations .
Since our company is the only one in Japan , we can constantly get a work and never bother about competetors .

Although we had to make difficult dicision and take risks to try new things .
It produce benefits of uncomparerable and no competitors .
