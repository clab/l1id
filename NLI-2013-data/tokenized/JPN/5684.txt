I agree with the statement , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
For example , the health care industly , especially those diet products .
`` It is so easy , and so quick to lose weight . ''
Then why is 50 % of population overweight in this country ?
Advertising with loud background music , good looking models , and catchy frases .
That 's all you need to convence people to buy product .
Unfortunatley , I am one of the people who just overpowered by advertisements on TV .
I bouthg a treadmill which I thought it was the greatest product that I can lose weight with less work .
Now it is in the closet and I will never see it again .
When you are wathing these commercials , you feel like you can be what the commercial say you will be .

Almost entire nation watches TV everyday .
Advertisements are everywhere not only TV , but also internet , magazines .
And these mass media have so much power these days .
It is so powerful that overpowering people 's ability to think in this materialistic world we live in .
If the commercial says so , it is good product .
You need to stop to think what is really going on .
It is so controled by advertisement industry , people forget that we do have ability to think what best for you .
We need to share the information which producuts really work , and which do n't .
We have to protect ourselves from overpowered media misleading .
