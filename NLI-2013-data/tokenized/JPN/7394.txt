There are many people are traveling many places and some of them are traveling with tour guide .
I think tour guide is necessary for trip and it is a best way to trip with tour guide .
I have several reasons .

First , I believe it is more safer than take trip without tour guide .
For examples , if you go to trip to some country that speaks neither Japanese nor english , you will not communicate with people there and you can not say what you want to say .
But , if you have tour guide with you , she knows the language and she can be a tranlator .

Also , the tour guide knows everything about the place you go , such as how dengerous is , how much money is need it , which restaurant is good , and so on .
So , you do not have to worry about the trip and you can have fun .

In addition , I believe the schedule or plan that they make is quiute useful because you can go many place in reasonable time , and having fun .
To sum up , even it will costs extra , I believe that to go on trip with tour guide will provide you with many advantages , can go many places , safety , and not to worry about anything .
So , I adovocate with the idea that the the best way to travel is to go with a group with a tour guide .
