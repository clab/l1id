I agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are 3 reasons I agree .
First , I can get information from a tour guide or group members .
Last summer , I visited to Okinawa in a tour group .
It is first time for me to Okinawa .
I have few information .
However , in group tour it is OK , because tour guide has so much information .
To follow the guide , I can really enjoy the travel .

Next , I can go to the place which not famouse , but very nice .
There is a good place which we can not know from the guid book .
The tour guide tell us that information .
For example , good restaulant , good suvenia shop , and good shight seeing place so on .

Thirdly , I can travel safety .
If we face some happning , I can ask the guide to help .
They have to help us to contrast .
Thesedays , Japanese often aim from robber in other country .
Moreover , when I face the trafic accident or dissester , for example earthquipe , My familiy get information imidietlly from the tour company .
