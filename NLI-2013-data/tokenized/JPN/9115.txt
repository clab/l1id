I agree with this that .
It is really important for students to unbderstand ideas and concepts .
It is more difficult thing than learn facts .
First , they can learn facts anytime , if they wish .
But how about the ideas or concepts ?
The answer is it wo n't .
Because to understand ideas and concepts are n't on the text or online .
Even the teacher wo n't teach about that .
And I think the most of the kids does n't know which of these .
Do you know why ?
The most oof the parents and the school sides think they are not necessary to teach or need them .
But I think it 's wrong .
If we get the facts and concepts , the children can understand the really really basic part of the things .
And that makes children interests .

Second , the facts and concepts are more specific thing .
Every adults thinks , they are difficult for children so the children do n't have to know about that .
That is not true .
The truth is the adults do n't know about the facts and concepts .
That 's why they saying about that .
They do n't know so the children does n't have to know .
I think that 's kind of stupid .
And the adults scare about the kids will learn that something they do n't know .

I think it is very good thing to know about the facts and concepts .
I know it 's hard , but if you learn that your world will be change .
Do n't you think that 's more interesting thing than ljust learning from the text ?
I think yes .
So iwant to kids to know about the facts and conceots .
Then they will interest about the lots of things .
If all kids interest in facts and concepts the world will be change more interesting thing ever .
So , if they learn and know about tfacts and concepts they will theach their 's future kids .
And the world will change .
I hope that world will be come as soon .
