Some students prefer to study only exact answers for exam ; however , some people take their time to understand the idea and concepts of topis .
I prefer to understand the idea before than learn only facts .

When we were children , we used to take a lot of quizes and tests at school .
I remember that I used to memorize all of the answers for test for following day ; however as soon as I test finished , I forgot almost the answers .
What a tragity !!!
This is the main idea of support my side opposes to only memorizing facts .
When people try to memorize things not knowing the idea of topics , facts do n't stay their brains longer .
Although if we study procedures of ideas and concepts , it makes a big difference .

Here is another example .
Either medical department or science department , students have a various type of experiments .
They have oppotunities to learn how and why answers in the text book are made moreover they actually experience themselves using their actual bodies to prove answers .
Those experiments definitely support them to memorize so that they do n't forget answers easily .

As I stated above , only knowing facts are sometims help students to pass the exam ; however , if they concern about career , they realize that it is not working .
At a work environment , especially specialized field such as engnerring , workers are expected to show their knowledges and ablities straight away from school .
It they only concentrated on their studying in memorizing facts , do you think they can be stated as good workers ?
The answer is No .

As a result , students should understand ideas and concepts before learn facts because they help them to understand topics in depth level and also there is a benefit when they think about their career .
