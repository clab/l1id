I disagree the yong people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I guess every people should respect and help each other .
Joining community is good way to learn any little society of the group .
The young people should take communication in the community place as possible as they can .
Now , we have a many ways to communicate with person who you are interested in .
Unfortunately , some younger generations does not like to give enough time to helping their communities .

First , Giving enough time to their community is the important for yong people .
I understand that some yong people would like to be alone thermselfs and keep their own time .
Sometimes , it is good chance to think own proble just themselves , however , the person who joined the community may gives a second opinion .

Also , in the young people community , they can meet your friends in the community .
We do not alive without our community .
In my experices , I found my best friends in my communities when I was 17years old .

Finally , young people should give to help their communities .
Young people can learn any educational experiences from their communities .
Sometimes young people communies make some troubles but you should not be shy to join community .
