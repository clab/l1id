I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

I think profit is the most important for almost every company , so when they advertise their products to the customer , the products have to be look nice so that their customer would buy them .
In addition , the company should advertise the products nicer and I think this is a part of their job .
For example , when vegetables are advertised on the paper , they usually look fresh and clean but not with dirts .
Brcause the company thinks they would better to advertise the clean ones so that many customers might want to go to the shop and buy them .

However , as most people have already experienced like this situation .
When you see the advertisment of product that you want to buy , it seems nice to you .
But when you actually see the product at the shop , it is not that nice as you were expected and start to complaining .
I think this is natural and what you need to do is SEE BEFORE YOU BUY IT .

If company advertise their products as exactly as it looks , not many people would buy them compare to the situation in the statement .
Because of these reasons , I agree to the opinion that the most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
