Most of people buy the material by watching a television comercials .
However , when the good was very different from the commercial , we waste the time and money after buying it .
I sometimes feel some of advertisments are n't genuin materials which are couting something else , different color , or kind of immitations .

There are some photograpohers who take a picture about the commercial materials .
So , they are couting something on a genuine food when he want to take a picture .
I could n't eat some foods without hearing the ture .
Moreover , the american restaurant in the united states looked very deliciously , but actually I feel bad taste .

I like to going to the shopping when I want to buy some clothes which I getting to be a favorite one .
The color of clothe is definitely important .
In Japan , there are diverse colors and it 's very difficult to make these color , thus I want to get it with Japanese color .

However , my favorite clothe are different of color .
I claimed these materials to shop staff .
But they just talked about the photographer is mistook to make the catalogue .
When I buy the car , I always look the advertisement which are listed a lot of them .
If I felt this car is cool as well as expensive one , I try to buy it .
However , it 's totally different from list .
Because advertising-maker used the immitation materials when he makes the catalog .

In the concludion , many advertising are so different from the genuine thing .
We should take care about these truths .
Whenever we buy something , we should check it on our foot before buying something via the Internet or telephone order .
We had better to hear the oral communication with genuine experienve about the materials .
