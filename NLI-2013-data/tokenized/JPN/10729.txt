I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
People learn things from thier own mistakes , in order to be successful , we have to face new obstacles and overcome them rather than just doing what we know and not gaining anything .

First of all , all advertising companys create new product and see how we react to it even though they might loose some money for producing it .
By knowing how humans react , they can get better sense of how the product works for us .
They might need to improve more on the product , or they are really helpful and we might need them .
By creating the new product , they get idea of how it works for us .

In addition , computers and all mechanical things are part of our life .
We need them in our everyday life .
It needed lots of patience to create computers and telephones to make them really convenient .
People tried new things that work the best for us and computers are now big part of our society .
Humans cannot live without them , it is a source of connecting this world into smaller places .

Lastly , Martin Luther King Jr. fought for equall right , he believed that all men are created equall .
We can now live safely and peacefully because of his action .
His speech moved lots of people , gave opportunity for others to fight for their own rights .
He no longer exists but he is known for one of the successor in our life .

It takes lots of risk and courage to try new things but that is how people learn things , starts to know importance of taking risk .
For instance , learning foreign language will be challenging for sure but pains we experience will turn into courage and we learn to be more confident and successful .
We each should try new things and prepare for some risks in order to grow ourselves as a person .
