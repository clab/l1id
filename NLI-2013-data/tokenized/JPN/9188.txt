I agree with that statement because of these reasons .
At first , understanding ideas is really significant for students when they learn new study , For example , when I was a high school student , I started learing physics .
I t was dificult for me to learn facts and formulas withought understanding ideas .
I could remenber facts , but I did not understand and put into long term memory .
However , when I was taught The idea of physics by my friend , I could understand .
I knew facts , so it was easy to accompany that idea and facts .
If I learned idea and concept first , I would remember important formulas and facts for a long time .
Thus , understanding concepts is more important for students .

In addition .
understanding ideas and concept is helpful to student .
When I took ` American government ' class , the instructors explained meaningful concept of this class befor telling facts .
He introduced huge image of this corse , and he suggested ideas of each terms for this class .
I am an international student , and I was not used to American government , because his introduction was really helpful for me .
If he introduced just facts or facts , I would not get importance of this class and be interested in American government .
Therefor students can take advantages by understanding ideas and concepts .

Although learning facts is also meaningful , it does not help students .
When students want to know something , learning facts is useful because they do not have to spend much time .
However , if they understand something , it does not function .
Understanding ideas and concepts does not mean only obtaining idea , but also learing facts .

In my opinion , understanding and learing are accompanied with each othere .
When students gain someting , they should understand that , and then they can learn facts deeply .
Thus , I agree this statement .
