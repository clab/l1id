I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
That is because young people are busy on their business time and on their private time .
Let me explain why young people are busy on those two time .

On business time , young people are apt to have a lot of tasks comparing to a business person in 20 years ago .
In this two decades , most of companies in the world have been decreasing a redundant costs .
So a lot of workers is dismissed .
Consequently business persons who can avoid lay off have a lot of tasks which dismissed workers have .
In my case , I work at a famous bank in Japan which is Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi .
I always work from 9 am to 22 pm because of having many tasks .
Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi made lay off in last year.2000 workers were dismissed .
In my department which is composed of 8 bankers , two old bankers were dismissed .
So the tasks for 6 bankers increased .
Therefore I do not have a enough time to helping my communities in weekday .

On private time , young people are also busy .
Young people have a lot of media , for instance mobile phone and internet , comparing to a person in 20 years ago .
So young people are apt to spend a lot of time for using those medea .
For my experience , my mobile phone ring 20 times in a day .
My parents and friends always telephone me .
Additionally I was recieved 50 e-mails in a day .
So I need a lot of time for responing those calling and e-mails .
I do not have a enough time to helping my communities on my private time .

As a mentioned so far , I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
As developing of business and techenology , we are tend to be busy
