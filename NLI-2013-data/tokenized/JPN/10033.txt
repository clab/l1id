Since I was a little girl , I have heard and read many successful stories of different people .
I believe and agree that successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

First of all , my dance teacher always told us to get out from our comfortable zones when we are choreographing the dances .
The dancers are tend to choreograph their favorite genre .
For example , a dancer , who likes a genre of modern , has more possibility to choreograph a modern piece .
However , if that person takes a risk to choreograph a Hip Hop piece , there will also be a possibility to be a successful choreographer .
My teacher told us that we are going to research and think about the choreography if we try new things , which in this case a choreography .
Many of her students created masterpieces by taking risks ; those pieces were selected for the State festivals and other honored shows .

There is a chance to become successful , but also not successful .
It is a life .
Some people take risks and then lose their properties such as money , family , and more .
Taking risks has a huge risk .

However , if we try again and again , success will come back to us .
One of the famous cartoonist in the world , Walt Disney , had to try new things .
Because his company stole his character from him and gave it to other cartoonists of that company , he lost his job .
But , he never stopped to put efforts ; The Micky Mouse was born .
Even though he could earn so much money , he tried new things such as making a long animated film for the first time .
The things he tried had always risks , but he became successful eventually .
He was a person that if he loves his job , he will always try new things .
This is one way to be a successful .

In conclusion , we should never stop trying new things in our lives .
Even we face hardships , if we try so many times , those efforts we put will be paid off .
This is how to be successful .
Therefore , I agree that successful people are ones who try new things and take risks .
