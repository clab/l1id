I agree the statement that successful people try new things and take risks .
Those who were did something well tend to challenge for new things because they think that they will be good in other things .
The risk is not important thing as they succeed .
That 's why many successful people do new things even if they take risks .

When I went to Japanese middle school in Japan , I had joined gymnastics club .
I like gymnastics because I liked gradual steps to get new skill , and I can have successful feeling after I practiced the skill many times and did it .
If I suceed in one skill , I could practice more difficult skill which may take risks , such as injure .
I always tried to challenge new skill because I want to get the skill and show my friend how I am great .
I did not care about the risk because I thought if I think about the risk , I cannot do anything .

The novel , great business , by Kyoko Mori shows how the certain businessman succeed and become boss of his company , although he was bottom of status at first .
Tsukasa worked very hard for his family .
As he worked many hours without any absents and his grade was the highest among the collagues .
One day , he was suggested by his previous boss that he should be the boss of his company .
Although he was uneasy since he need more responsibility to be the boss .
However , finally , he decided to be the boss .
He did n't mind the risk and become more successful person .

Success often lead to another steps that people have never did .
That 's important thing for people 's live .
People cannot afraid of taking risks .
They always have to challenge to do anything .
