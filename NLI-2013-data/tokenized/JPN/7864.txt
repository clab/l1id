I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons .

First of all , traveling with a tour guide is easier and more efficient than any other way to travel .
The groups led by a tour guide usually have a well-designed schdule and members in the group are able to visit as many places in a short period as possible .
Moreover , even though the members do not know the language spoken in the place they visit , they have less trouble with the help of the tour guide .
For example , when I traveled in the United States ten years ago , I joined a tour led by a tour guide .
The bus that exclusively drove for us led us to the famous sight-seeing spots in New York City , such as the Empire State Building and the World Trade Center .
Dinner was planned at famous restaurants in little Italy .
At night , we all went to see a musical show , which was at the time very popular and was hard to get the tickets for .
If I had not joined the tour , I could not have seen the musical show .
This example clearly show sthat traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better .

Second , traveling with a tour guide gives people opportunities to learn more about the local cultures and history .
For example , I hired a tour guide when I traveled in St. Petersburg , Russia .
There are many famous buildings and museums in and out of the city , and I wanted to visit all of them especially the largest one in the city .
On the day we visited the meseum there was a long , long line in front og the main entrance , but the tour guide led us to another small entrance of the museum and we were able to get in without waiting for a long time .
Inside the museum , she led us to the rooms with famous paintings and decorations which all the tourists must see .
She also gave us lectures about arts , history , and kings and queens that all related to the museum history .
By her explanation , I was able to understand Russian culture of the time .
Because she was a Russian guide , she knew very well about the area .
After our tour finished , she took a group to the restaurant where Pucikin , a Russian writer , would have meals everyday .
The experience was unforgettable .

In conclusion , I definitely agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
