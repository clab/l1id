I agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I think that all people need to basic skill and knowledge .
If I did not know launguage , I did not study at all .
When I got the job that is very supecific jpb , if I did not broad knowledge , I would not work at all .

For instance , Mr Takenaka who was japanese prime minister , is specilized in economics .
He decided a lot of effective economics bill .
But Mr Takenaka did not know other progrems well .
He made some happening in sumit because he is locking knowledge of international rule .
And he made bad effect wellfere bill because of his locking knowledge .
So , Mr takenaka 's example say that good economist who specilize someone did not always good prime mminister .
Thus we should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than spcialize in one specific subject .
If you want to change your job , you can easy to change because you have broad knouledge of many academic subjects .

But I did not disagree with having knowledge specialize in one specific subject .
If I have specidic skill and knouledge , I can be charastaristic .
And I can easy to get my job .

So I suggested that pepole , who want to study , should study about broad knowledge of many academic subjects as people find supecific subject that they want get knowledge .
In my experience , I was high school student .
I would like to became a doctor .
But I did not study specalize in sicology .
I studeied many subjects , and I reconsider what I want to become .
As day go by , I would like to become a international accountant .
So I can change my future easily , because I had broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
And now I major in economics in university .

So I think that it is important to get broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
