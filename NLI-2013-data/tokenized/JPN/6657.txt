I think there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
Of couse I think car company will produce a new model , and we want to buy more .
however , it is difficult to increase cars more , because there are 2 big problem , poluteing enviroment and losting fossil energy .

At first , we have to think about the poluting enviroment .
Now , the car 's gas is poluting our enviroment .
I think if we have more cars , our enviroment would be change .
And it is not only poluting the envitroment , but also effect our health .
Reasently , there is a news that there are many people in Tokyo are worried about cought is because of car 's gas .
So , poluting our enviroment is big problem and we have to reduce the car 's gas .

Moreover , we have to think about the fossil energy .
Now , most of the cars are moved by the fossil .
But , the fossil is not produced easily , it is limited .
So , we have to reduce to use the fossil .

Accoding to these reasons , I think tere will be fewer cars .
