I do not think travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel .
There are some reasons I do not prefer .
First , tour will limit us where to go .
Although it will be much cheaper than going alone the tour might not be as what you have thought .
You might want to see around other places but since it is moving with group , you will not able to go by only your feelings .

Secondly , the tour guide will decide the time they are looking , so you are not able to see it as long as you want .
Different from travelling by yourself , a tour wants to go many place as possible to have more customers .
So they are not able to take enough time to see each place because they have to go next on time .
This might be OK for some people , but others might think they are not satisfied .

Thirdly , there will be many other people that you do not know each other .
This will make you feel tired and no privercy .
It will make you feel tired by It is not only by yourself , so you have to make rules to have the trip smooth .
But for any reason you are going to the trip , I think they want to get away from every day life .
So this will not let you feel freely if you have to make rules .

From these reasons , I prefer travelling by ourselves might be the best way to travel .
Traveling by ourselves might cost higher , but you are able to plan the trip freely as you think and do what ever you want to make it satisfied .
I am sure this kind of trip will be greater than going in a group led by a tour guide .
