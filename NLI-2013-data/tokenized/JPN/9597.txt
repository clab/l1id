There are a variety of people in the world that has different professions .
Between them , there are successful and unsuccessful people using their talent .
In my opinion , what makes this difference is that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing that they already know how to do well , when the unsuccessful people do n't .
Three reasons will support this idea ; by taking risks , they will grow respect to others , understand fear of going out from the comfort zone , and experience different worlds that would make his or her own profession improve .

Firstly , people should know how to respect other people for living in a society .
If you could n't understand , or at least try to understand what other people are saying , you could not observe important opinions that might help your talent improve .
What is true in every successful people are , that they observe people 's ideas , see if it is valuable for him or herself , and make it their own advantage .

Secondly , people grow more mature when they know how it feels to lose .
Understanding and experiencing the fear to step outside from your comfort zone , and explore the outer world and other people 's point of views , makes you more thoughtful .
If they happen to know only themselves and his or her sorroundings , they would have an extemely short-sighted and stubborn point of view .
They will be overly-confident and proud about themselves and this will definately not help the person to succeed in their profession .

Thirdly , exposure to an area that you have n't experienced before would be very efficient for the person 's own growth as a human being .
Risking yourselves and trying something new , or observing new information and reflecting it to your own activity , puts spice to your professions that results in an evolution of your talent .

In conclusion , by risking your own property and experiencing the world you do not know , makes the person more of a kind and respectful , intelligent man or a woman .
Therefore , I think that it is beneficial to take risks rather than staying in their comfort zone .
