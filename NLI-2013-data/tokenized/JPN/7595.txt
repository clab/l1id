I disagree with the statement , I prefer to travel alone without a tour guide .
Because traveling in such condition spoil the numerous opportunities in traveling .
The first reason I am against for the idea is the tour can easily become reactive .
Travellers can lost their opportunity in learning about the destination .
The travelers who are also a customer of a tour guide do n't need to learn about the destination .
The service supplier , the tour guide has made a tour completely .
All the travellers have to do is following the tour guide .
It can spoil the oppotunity to enjoy the travel deeply .
For instance , when I was in high school , I was in a grade trip committee and organized the trip .
I am sure that people in the committee worked harder to know about the destination so that we , the menber in the committee enjoyed the trip the most .
We could understood many things in the place , for example , the reason why the custom is like that , why people think in that way , etc .

The second reason is that it can cause travellers not communicating with people in destination .
It ca n't be said that you understood the place not knowing the people in the destination .
Due to the security reason , tour guides are scarcely introduce many kinds of places .
To add to , the travellers ' chances to communicate with people in destination were taken away by paying money to the tour guide .
They threw away the opportunity to reserve hotels , resarch the transportation , what temperature or weather there , etc .
It is much work .
