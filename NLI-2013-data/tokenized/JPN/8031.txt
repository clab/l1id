There are a lot of larning styles .
Depend on the purpose , the leaning style would be different .
Each person has different poit of view ; However , in my opinion , I agree that to understand ideas and concepts is more important that to learn facts for students .
I believe that the important poimt of learning is how we can use that knowledge in our life .
If we ca n't use the knowledge practicaly from study , it is no meaning .
I think that to understanding ideas and concepts will help to use the knowledge more efficient way .

First reason for my opinion is that we can learn a lot of things more deeply from understanding ideas and concepts .
For example , when I learn history , if I think about the reason and concept , such as why our ancestor had a war or why they made a the low , I can learn a lot of things from the past .

I believe that such a knowledge would be help to choose for the future .

The second reason for my opinion is that it is more easy to memorize .
For example when I studied to enter university , I just memorized a lot of knowledge such as historical date or vocabraries , however I forget these knowledge easily .
I believe that if I did n't think about connection about facts , it is easy to forget and such a knowledge will be patent knowledge .

If we think that we better use our knowledge more practical way , I think to understand ideas and concept is necessary .
From understand these things , our knowledge will be use usuful things .
