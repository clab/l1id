I disagree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
In my opinion , learning facts is more important and efficient for studemts .
There are three reasons .
First reason is that facts are efficient in a real situation .
Second reason is that facts always follows a reality .
Therefore , it helpes to solve a problem .
Third reason is that people learn the idea and concepts through the facts .

First of all , the facts are always efficient in a real situation .
for example , in business , people do n't know what to do when they face problems although they have knowledge about a concept of business .
Concept is just a concept .
Fact and the skill that business people need in real situation is mostly different from the concept .
Business people who knows pefectly about concept and idea do n't always succeed in business because a market is very complicated and always change .
In another words , the fact in the market is always changing .
Therefore , they have to flexibly keep up with the cahnge of the fact .

Secondly , the reality does not always follow the reality .
There are so many accidents .
Therefore business people need to know as many cases and solutions as possible which may be needed in reality .

Thirdly , people can learn concepts and ideas through the facts .
Learning concepts through the facts and real experience is more efficient for us to work in reality than learning only concepts and ideas .

If I do n't know about the facts , I will not be able to have a good solitions
