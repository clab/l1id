Some people would think specialize knowledge is the most important , however I prefer to choose the broad knowledge of many academic subject .
There are theree reasons for this : to have many information , to have wide view points and to make own new field .

First of all , the foundation of our knowledge was decided be the quantity of the imformation .
For instance , I major bussiness administration in my university .
If I do not study about not only foundamental bussiness theory but also other advertizement theory , I can not know deeply about marketing theory .
Likethis , Bord knowledge is essentioal .

Secondly , if a persson consentrate on only the specific field , they will not be able to have wide view point .
In jeneral speaking , like these kinds of people can not understand other peoples idea so they will have bias thinking way .
Adding to this , these kinds people like to be minority , so they will have difficult time in their life .

Finally , in order to make own new field , it is better to have wide knowledge .
Noneless to say , new theory is made by the combain of the fandamental knowledoge which saomeone have .
If a person specialize in a specific problem , there will be limit of them .
Because , new field is introduced by creative thinking based on the wide information .

From these reasons , I think if a person concentrate on the specific field , there are more less potentioal in their future .
Truly , studying only one subject which a person really want to study is important things .
Yet , when we think about this problem from long term .
Clealy , having vast knowledge of many kinds of academic subject is more good for the person 's future .
