I prefer to travel in agroup led by a tour guide .
As you know , evrybody can enjyoy a trip evrywhere in this global society , so there are many choices for their own .
Especially , Its deponds on people what kinds of the style they like it .
I want to show why I choice the opinion .

Firsty , It is very convinient if we had a guide .
We do n't need to plan ourselves where we go .
It sometimes make us stressful and kill a time .
The guide know where we want to go and can explain about it perfectly .
We can enjoy the trip without worrying .
The last time I travel in Korea by myself made me so nervous .
I could n't speak and read their language , so communication is so important .
If I had had a guide , the travel would have changed well .

Second , If we are a group led by a tour guide , we can exchange information of the travel .
The travel will meke up a lot of wonderful excitement .
It will be happy if we could share the impression with a group .
Inaddition this , the guide can show best possition to look at the building if we want to go to the a favorite sites .

Following the reasons , I agree with the opinion that The best way to travel os on a group led by a tour guide .
Travel sould enjoy with many people .
from my experience , I want to go many travel and talk to friends sharing the memory .
That strory lead me another trip .
