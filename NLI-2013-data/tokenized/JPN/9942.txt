I agree this statement .
People who successed on business usually try new things and take risks .
To begin with , only new ideas can success .
An old idea woudl n't make you rich or popular .
only new ideas do .
people usually interested in new things because they think it is cool or trendy .
For example , many people bought new types of video game like Wii or Playstation3 in Japan .
Some people bought these games on impulse because the news programs or TV showed a great systeme about it and mede you buy it .
Now , how about old type of vide games ?
Will you buy it ?
Answer is no even TV suggested it because you already know what is problem of thes old games and you can find out that TV 's information is not always correct .

Another reason is that risky cahnce will be worth a lot .
Many rich people tried vey hard to became rich .
In another ward , the took many risks to aim their goals .
So risks annd success is relating .
If you took risks , you might fail .
However , you might do well .
When the risks that you took is greater , the prize is also great .
That 's why people who did n't take risks would n't sucess .
It is similler to gambling .
For example , my uncle went to the casino last year .
He first played a slot machines which needed only 10 cents .
He won many times , but it did n't make him rich .
Eventually , he lost 10 dollars .

In conclusion , Trying new thing and Taling risks would make you success .
Successful people do n't do comon things and take small risks .
