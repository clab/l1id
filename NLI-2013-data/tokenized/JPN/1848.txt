I stand behind of the opinion that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .
There are three reasons : changed society , health and internet .
First , comparing to some decades before to present , the society has completely changed .
Old timers were spending time for themselves to live somehow for gaining money as much as possible when they are young .
However , young people these days are given with almost any goods which are essential for everyday 's living when they are born .
Therefore , young people can spend their time for enjoying themselves .

Secondly , although in order to enjoy life , people should be healthy , older people more likely not to be healthy than young people .
If they are sick , even they are very much optimistic person , it is usually hard for people to enjoy their life enough .

Lastly , in present circumustance , in order to enjoy this worldwide and borderless society , people are needed to operate a computer and usage an internet service enough .
To operate a computer is a kind of hard for older people .
For instance , my father who is 65 years old only can type by his right hand so that using a lot of time to operate a computer .
Also in the occasion of the computer crushed , my father , one of the older person , ca n't solve the situation .

On the other hand , young people are more used to usage a computer and know much about it and internet servece .
In their age , computer in no more complicated material than mere everyday 's staff like a microwave .

Younger people usually are much more familier to the system of computer and know about several solutions about the computer trouble comparing to olders .
Also Young people can type the keybord faster than oldtimers , in that way young people do n't feel flustration for using a computer .

For all those reasons , I think young people are enjoying their life than old people do .
