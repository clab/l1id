Today , most young people are very busy about their work , such as studying , clab in the school , and thier some hobbies .
Because of this , I think young people nowadays have less time to help communities and they are not enough .

My primary reason is that school work have made young people very busy .
We have not only studying in our school but also club activities .
I am a high school student now and I am in the drama club .

When I go back home form school I have to do my homework , and prepare for the check test which we have alomot everyday at English and Language art class , and also Ihave to practice acting from the club .
I am the main person of the next show so I cannot quit practing .

These thing made my very busy and not to even allow me to wartch my favorite TV show !
Also , I think many yong people are not interested in their communities very much .
Some of them does not care about thier communitiy at all .
I love where I live now so I do not understand why they think like that but maybe they do not have friends in their community or they think thier parents are enough to help community , so they do not need to .

As you can see , many yong people are very busy about their school , and some of them are not interested in their community .
Therefore agree young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
