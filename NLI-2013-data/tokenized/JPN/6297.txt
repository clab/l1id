As our world developed and became industrialized , the needs of cars had increased .
However , in twnty years , will the needs of car continue or will there be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
I belive they will be fewer .
The oil price has been increacing , and cars pollute our enviroment .
More and more people are concerned with enviroment nowadays , and I believe there would be a better transportation in the future .

As most people know , cars destroies our enviroment and pollute earth .
Cars have long been used in our history , and it has made improvements .
There are cars that produces less carbon dioxcie , but they are expensive and only available to rich people .
There are many people who would prefer those kind of cars , but I believe that those cars would not be available to everyone even after twenty years .

In recent developing China , the needs of cars are increasing in incredible high rate .
It might look as a good thing because China is begining to enter developed society and becoming industrialized .
However it is a big propblem .
China is one of the most populated countries in the world .
If every family of China had a car and used the car , our world would be polluted and be done with in very little time .
We can not stop China from developing .
So in order to avoid that situation , we need new none eviroment polluting transportation .
In the future all countries will develop in some ways .

In conclusion , I belive that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , and that there will be new transportation that is kind to earth .
