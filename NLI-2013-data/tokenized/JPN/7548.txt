I disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , for I believe that the purpose of travelling is not just to have fun and relax with other people , but it can also be an opportunity for you to increase your own knowledge about a specific event that occured in the place in the past .
Thus , I think that the best way to travel is not always in a group , but it can also be in an individual or in couples , depending on why you have chosen to travel and what you want to gain from your trip .

When I travelled to Hiroshima last year with my sister , I was convinced that travelling in a group is not always the best .
The reason why I wanted to travel to Hiroshioma in the first place was that I wanted to learn more about the Japanese history regarding its surrender during World War II .
The aim of the trip was therefore not to have a fun , relaxing time being free from school work or anything , but it was for me to increase my own knowledge about my own country .
It was meant to be serious .

I decided to take my sister with me as I realized that she knew more about the specific event than I did .
I expected that she would help me interpret the things we would see in Hiroshima , like the atomic-bombed dome .
As a result of this trip , we both had a great time .
I managed to learn a lot about the history Japan has gone through , and my sister also enjoyed guiding me in Hiroshima .
The way we did not take any of our freinds with us allowed me to concentrate on the aims I had for the trip .
Furthermore , we were given an opportunity to have deeper conversations than we had ever had , and we became closer than before .
I can surely say that the trip would not have been as good as this if we travelled in a group .

As it can be seen , it is totally possible to have a great trip even if you are not travelling in a group .
How great the trip would become depends significantly on what you wish to gain from the trip .
If being in a group is not the best way for you to fulfil your aim , then that might mean that travelling alone is better for you to fully enjoy your trip .
