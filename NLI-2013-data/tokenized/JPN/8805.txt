Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?
I strongly agree with the statement for three reasons .
Understanding ideas and concepts is important for development of students ' ability to apply , to care for others , and also to come up with questions and theories .

First of all , without ideas and concepts , students cannot use the knowledge in daily life .
For example , let 's say there is a boy who has learned the pythagorian theorem but has never been taught how the mathematicians came to the theorem .
He does not know where and how the facts came from , therefore is unable to apply his knowledge for some similar but different problems .

Secondly , I believe that the sense of moral issues can only be developed through vast knowledge of ideas and concepts .
To understand how people act , students have to know ideas and concepts about human mind rather than facts , because everyone is different .
If students are taught moral issues as facts , not as concepts , they will likely to stick with that idea and not able to think of other people .

The last and probably the most important reason is that understanding ideas and concepts well may lead the students to develop with further questions and theories .
Knowing where and how a fact comes from gives the students better understanding about the fact .
Moreover , further investigation using concepts will lead some of them to find facts that have never been discovered .
Development of theories is definitely due to well-understanding of ideas and concepts .

Some adults , even the teachers , insist the students learn facts rather than understand ideas and concepts .
I strongly oppose to that opinion .
As I stated , understanding ideas and concepts result in students ' ability to apply knowledge , to understand moral issues , and to come up with questions and theories .
