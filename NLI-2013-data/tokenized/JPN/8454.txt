I agree with this statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
There are two reasons to support .

First of all , it will be boring for them to learn only the fact .
If the student just only learn the fact , they will be satisfied with their knowledge and wo n't try to think any more .
Thinking is a important process to improve their knowledge .
If they just learn the fact , they do n't need to think why it happened or how it happened .
They will just know the answer right away without thinking .
In fact , thinking is exciting .
When they learn an idea , they will try to use it in many situations .
For example , when students learn about static electricity , they will try to make electirical shocks by rubbing objects and find out which objects makes the most electricity .
They are thinking and also enjoying the method .
But if they know the fact , they will just chose the right object and done .
That is very boring .

Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts are very important .
From my experience , I really think so .
When I was playing basketball in middle school , I just did as the coach said to me during practice .
I did n't really think about why are we doing this practice and just did as we were told to do .
But as time goes by , our team became weaker and weaker .
We searched for the reason .
Finally we found out the reason .
Every practice we did had a meaning .
We were n't just running , we were running as if we are in the game .
We were n't just shooting , we were shooting as if there are opponents blocking .
We were just doing the fact that the coach said but we should have understand the idea and concepts of the practice .

After we noticed the fact , we started to work hard and we became the second place in the competition .
I was really happy and thanked the coach for teaching us for not telling the answer and made us think by ourseves .
From this experience , I learned that understanding ideas and concepts are far more important that learning facts .

This is why I agree with this statement .
