I disagree with that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than understanding facts .
I think lerning fact is better than understanding ideas and concepts .

First , understanding ideas and concepts might be difficult for some students .
However , they would be able to guess what ideas and concepts are by lerning facts .
Only being lerned by someone does not make thier thought develop .
Thinking by themselves is best thing to halp their thoughts .

Second , even thogh understanding ideas and concepts is important , things do not always happen by follownig ideas and concepts .
Sometimes other results that students can not expect from the ideas and concepts which they understand may happen .
Yet understanding facts tell students that whan kinds of results would happen , and this makes them easier to understand things .

Third , some students might misunderstand these ideas and concepts , and they would make mistakes , but students who understand facts at first can get along things , because they already know what kind of things they have to be done .

For these reasons I disagree this statement .
