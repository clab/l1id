I basically think that it is important for the undegraduate students to have chances to get knowledge of many academic subjects .
And for the garduate students , I think they should specialize in one specific subject .
But I personally think , no matter the undergraduate or graduated students , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I will mention the reasons why I agree with the statement in the following paragraphs .

First , I think people should keep broaden the sight for lives by studying a variety of academic subjects .
I think people cannot live by doing one thing , and need to learn a lot about things through lives .
And if people can learn a numerous kinds of academic subjects rather than one specific subject , I think people can get more chance to do something .
In my case , I learned many academic subjects when I was a college student .
I especially learned about Accounting , International trading , English and also Chinese language class .
I am now working at a Japanese trading company and in charge of trading Oolong tea leaves from Hongkong China .
And now I feel the subjects that I took at university are really useful for my business .
For this exmple , taking many academic subjects to broaden knowledge is tremendously help on our way of working .

Second , I think that broadening knowledge by taking many academic subjects makes us greatly motivated .
As I mentioned above , I took the Accounting class when I was a student .
Actually , I was not interested in it first , but as the class went ahead , I totally addicted about the attractive characteristics of Accounting .
Now I am working in a field of international trading but addition to this , I am now studying to get a license of Japanese certified public accountant .

In conclusion , I think to have boroad knowledge of many academic subjects make cahnge our sight for lives , enlarge way of working and our mind incredibly motivated .
For those reasons , I myself agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
