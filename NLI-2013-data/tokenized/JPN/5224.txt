Most advertisements seem to make products seem much better than they really are .
Most advertisement seems to emphasize too much of their benefits or vital points in their products .
To make the advertisements more effective , people work for the advertisements use more color , put overstatements about the products in good way , and use popular actors , actresses , and even singers to make the effects bigger .
In general , customers should not believe in too much for the advertisements itself .

I have two examples to show how the way advertisements work .
One is that the advertisement of CAMEL cigarette , there are actually two advertisements paper for men and women .
But the common point is that there is a man and woman who look beautiful and look cool with the cigarette on its both advertisement .
The advertisements want consumers to think to be looked cool or even mature when they smoke like the model on its advertisements .

The other example is about nutrition pills .
There are many kinds of pills or powders such as diet pill , protein powder , Omega 6 pills , etc and its advertisement affects people greatly .
Those advertisement make people think their body look not nice even if they really do not , and let them buy those pills to loose weight or make mascle .
Some people might believe if they take big amount of protein powder , they would make huge muscle which they want .
However , the truth is they cannot .
Those protein powder does not help to make more muscle .
People who buy the protein power are just waisting their money .

People can buy anything they want in this society .
However , many of them do not realize how they are affected by those advertisement when they go shopping and choose things to buy .
Customers have to know only what they really need to buy , but not for the products they think atractive because of its advertisement .

Be a smart shopper .
