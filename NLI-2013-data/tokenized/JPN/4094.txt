I do agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This is because by thinking about myself and friends around me , I cannot find many young people , who are interacted to the community a lot .
I believe this culture change is happening worldwide and considered it is usual these days .

When my grandparents are young , they said they remembered that their parents were interacting with the community deeply and felt normanl that they had to live in that way .
At the time when my grandparents are little , the Wordl War II was happening therefore , strong bond in the community was needed more than nowadays .
Young teenagers were there to look after the little children and help the old people .
That was something they all had to do in order to survive .

However , as the war ended and my parent 's generation was born , there was not so much situations needed for people to stick together because that was the only way to survive .
My parent 's said that they remember that their parent 's tell them to care about community and help them since that is how their parent 's grew up but my parent 's said that they never really understood why .

I also do not remember my parents teaching me to interact with community and spend time for it .
This can be because in my 17 years of life , I moved more than 10 times because of my father 's job and every time I moved to new community , it was hard for our family to join easily .
So we were kind of giving up on this kind of culture .
Even if the person never moved around so much , I believe not many people like to interact with community because people became colder about the connection with different people .

In western and some parts of eastern countries , the cultural change in religion was also significance to this change .
In old days , religion was strict and if you are christian , you had to attend to mass every sunday .
However , nowadays , attending to mass is quite free and not many people critisises you if you do not attend to the mass .

However , it does not mean that spending time for community is wastful because people are acting in this way .
Human beings cannot live without interacting each other and it is very imporant to be a well being and help each other without benefits .
It is very sad that nowadays young people are not spending enough time for community and for our future , we should connect with people more and create comfortable community .
