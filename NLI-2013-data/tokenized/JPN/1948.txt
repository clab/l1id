Some people in Japan , where I live , the life old people has is more enjoyable , but I think young people enjoy life more than old people for the following reasons .

First , youg people can do many sports without concerning about their bodies .
For example , when I was a student at Kaisei High School , one of the best universities in Japan , I was on a baseball team whose name was Swallows .
Even now , I can remember those days easily .
I practiced baseball with my friends every day .
That was the most enjoyable time for me .
It was not matter for me whether I could catch ball .
The most impotant thing was doing my best for catching white balls .
The moment when I jump in to the ball was the best moment .
So , I think without exciting sports it the life is not enjoyable .

Second , the happiness to go to school is what only young people can get .
For example , when I was a student at Waseda University in Tokyo , Japan , I had a school festival .
Our group decided to open Waseda Cafe .
Though we used a lot of time and money , we were happy because we could get important friendships .

So , I think school is very good .
As the reasons and examples show , I strongly believe that young people can have much more enjoyable time than that older people have .
