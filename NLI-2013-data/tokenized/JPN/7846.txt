Old temples , beautiful Japanese trees , and traditional Japanese snacks and food .
Kyoto is one of my favorite places to travel .
On the contrary , Tokyo is where modern lives of Japanese people can be observed .
High buildings , crowded streets , and fetid smells of smogs .
But what if you do not know anything about Japan and would like to travel ?
Would you rather buy a tour package led by a tour guide ?
The best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide because of lack of personal preparetion , flexibility , and personal experience .

The first reason that a tour guided by a guide is not recommended is that people tend not to prepare by themselves .
It is true that a guide knows the places the tourists will go and prepare plans for them .
However , it is very uninteresting for tourists to go places without personal preparation .
For example , if you are interested in Japanese history and go to Kyoto , it will be a great pleasure .
Rather than the guide telling you what happened in Horyu-temple and why Kinkaku-temple was constructed , if you learned by yourself and are interested in , it will be more great excitement to go there .
In addition , lots of information are easily available online or in books , you do not have to get a tour guide to travel around .
Thus , you can prepare by yourselves to fit to your own interests and excitement .

The second drawback of a tour guided by a guide is lack of flexibility .
The plan is so rigid that you do not have freedom to spend your time as much as you wish .
The guide shouts , `` Get off the bus at 2:15 pm , and come back at 3:15 pm .
Be sharp ; otherwise , other people will be annoyed . ''
How does it sound ?
On the other hand , if you find a place is so boring and have to stay for three hours because of the schedule of the tour , how do you feel ?
In addition , the plan of the tour does n't necessarily reflect your interest .
Mostly , the plan by a guide is so generalized that the places you will go are more likely famous places .
For example , I went to France primarily to see the iron chuck which is the standard of measurement because I am interested .
Is there any tour like that ?

Lastly , the first and second disadvantages of a tour led by a guide strongly relate to lack of personal experience .
If you prepare by yourself and go to the places to learn something more , the journey will be very brilliant .
If you have a travel desined by your own tastes and favorites , the journey might be difficult but be unique .
If you find the place uninteresting and dull , you can change your plan .
If you find a better restauraunt to eat , you can just hop into the restaurant .
All these experiences will be so precious , personal , and luminious .

In conclusion , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide due to lack of personal preparation , flexibility , and personal experience .
Yes , travel with a guide might be safer and knowledgble , but getting personalized and unique experience in travelling is the most important .
