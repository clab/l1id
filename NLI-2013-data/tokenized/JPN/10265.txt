Today , there are many kinds of persons who behave in several different ways .
Some take risks , some plays it safe .
Most people think that persons who take risks are more successful rather than others who do what they already know how to do well .
It is difficult to say this statement is true or wrong .
In fact , I think it is true that people try new things and take risks are more successful than others for several reasons .

First of all , people who do n't take risks stay always in a same field .
For example , a man who have already worked in a small restaurant have good chance to work in it for his or her entire life .
On the other hand .
eople who take risks could find their positive ability easily .
Therefore , they can work in a field that they are good to do for example .
People who are not afraid to take risks could improve the probability to success , because they are always trying to do well .

Second , it is easier to get higher gain by taking risks .
For example , an investor who invests in a mutural fund of a poor country could double or triple the amount of money faster .
They take risks , but they are always challenging to make it better , therefore , they easily success in various situation .
In contrast , people who do n't take any risk could get the gain safely , but slowly .
We were all born to do something big to increase our well-being in this society , so why should they play it safe ?
I really do n't think people who do n't take risks are more successfull than other who take risks .

In summary , I agree that people take risks are more successful than others do n't take risks for those two reasons .
People are afraid to take risks to get more gain , but they should be brave enough to take some risks to succeed in their lives .
