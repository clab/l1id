Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
On the ather hand , other people think it is not always true .
I agree with formar idea .
I will describe some reasons from my experience in this essay .

First of all , young people have a lot of vitality .
So they can enjoy something such a sports or study as possible as they can .
For example , now I go to the art school and study hard everyday .
My school always put students some assainment .
The quantiteis of the assaiment is so large that I often do them all over the night to finish then .
I can continue to study becouse Iike art .

second , I think young people have many oppotunities to find new one such a new friends or new world .
In my case , I went to the school of Tokyo by leaving to my home town .
In the school , there are many students who have defferent backgroud .
To communicat them , my range of thinking is more bigger ever before .
For example , talking with a person who have a defferent thinking towoad the art is very exaiting .

For these reasons I belive that young people is more enjoy their life .
Youthful is great .
