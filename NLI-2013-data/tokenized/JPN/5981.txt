In my view , In twenty years from now will be more cars in use than today .
So I disagree the fewer cars in future .

First , It will be changed that people buy a car more cusually .
Although , people started concidering environmentally friendly socity , like recomending a pubulic transportation , bus or subway .
More atracting having a own car nowaday .

Many car company are very competitive , producing a nice , new modle stayl every year to attract consumers thouth a media , televison , internet .
And a cost of per car has been aceptable for even young single person .

Fortermore , a life of each family member might be more imdipendent .
havind a car for as personal belings will be possible in nearlly future .

Second , New nutural enegy or electronics engine have been found instad of oil gas .
new type of car only uses a little oil and conbine electronic enegy and it is already useig some region .
they are low cost and environmentally harmless for earth .

Finally .
I assum that even a lot of cars in future dose not pollute as much as used to be .
but more number of cars will appear .
And I disagree that it will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
