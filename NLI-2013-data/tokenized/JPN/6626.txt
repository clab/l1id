After the World War II , the development of the influstructure especially the development of the car have increased rapidly .
However the perspectives of people who are using cars changes gradually in recent years .
In my opinion , the use of cars in twenty years will be decrease as the development of the influstructure and technology .

First of all , there are a lot of people who are concerning about the impact of using cars to the environment .
In some countries such as in Netherland and China , they work on the policy of using bicycles to avoid producing Carbon-dioxide gas , which possibly damages the natural environment .
However , there are some countries that says CO2 gas is not neseccarry for damaging the environment , therefore it is not always a majorities idea of decreasing the number of using cars .

Second of all , there are more public transportations such as busses , trains and air transportations are developping by new technology .
For example , there are many railways in Japan to transform people one place to the other faster and more convenient .
Also in Taiwan and China , they built the Bullet train or maglev train which transport group of people at once , and also think about the impact on nature .
Also in the less economically developped countries such as the countries in African region , it would be harder to get car for individual residences due to the civil war and poorvaty , it is important to produce the cheap public transportation for them .
Therefore , I think the increasing number of car users will not be occured in the LEDCs .

Third of all , since many countries of more developped countries such as in Singapore , Japan and Switherland , the decreasing in number of child becomes a sesrious problem .
In these countries , the government are likely to set the law to get more than four people to ride the cars , therefore the number of the cars might decrease gradually .

Since the time passed , people 's perspectives of using car changing .
I think this fact would make the number of cars fewer than now .
