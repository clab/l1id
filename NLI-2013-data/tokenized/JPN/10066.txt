After people get something beautiful , we start to feel that we want it more .
If we have to take a risk , we might take that risk and try to get it because we can get even more beautiful thing .
However , does everybody follow their feeling ?
Specially in the business ?

I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and if they should take the risks , they will take it .
Firstly the reason why I think is because , there are possibilities for successful people to success even more .
What is the risk for them is It is not hundred percent of posibillities , I believe .

Secondly it is possible that they want to do new things about their business and try their luck .
For example , we bet the money in casino and won lots of money luckly , what will we do ?
Some people , do not spend on betting anymore and leave the casino or some people believe that they have strong luck that day and will keep spending on it .

On the other hand , in the casino , we can not keep winning as a similar to business and this topic .
In my opinion , people sometime should not take the risk , stay where they are , decide carefully and think with reality .
To not follow their feeling , might cause more success in their business .

Successful people more likely to take the risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Without risk , it is difficult to become successful and get what we want .
However , it is not the only answer for everything .
I believe we should take the risk when we should .
On the other hand when we should stop and stay where we are , we should stop and stay such as losing our money in casino .
