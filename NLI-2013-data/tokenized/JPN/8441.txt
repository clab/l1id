I disagree with this idea because I do not think ideas and concepts are more important than the facts .
There are three reasons to support my opinion .
First , concepts and ideas are only needed to be well on their school .
Student have to understand the concept and idea to solve questions on their test .
But I do not think it is `` learnig '' .
Acutually , it is `` memorising '' .

Second , facts are the most important things in this world .
No one can deny any facts and break it .
We have to know the facts to be well on our sosiety .
If students understand only concepts or facts , they will be confused finaly .

Third , not only student also adults have to understand facts to understand it 's concepts and ideas .
In my opinion , nobody can understand completely the concepts and ideas without the facts .
That 's why they have to understand the facts first .

A lot of students are learning only concepts and ideas to be well on their school .
By this education , they cannot solve any irreguler questions even if it is using same idea as what they could solve before .
Because they do not know the fact for the problem that 's why they cannot enhance their knowledge .
Those students would be wondered that why they are using those concepts and ideas to solve their problems after they started to work on their major corces .
I think , people have to know the fact first to study what they interested in .

When I study something new for me , I am always wondered that why we are using this idea and how it is used to solve problems in acutual situations .
To solve these questions , we have to know the fact for the satatement .

From my opinion , I think the facts are more important than the concepts and ideas to solve our question or study what we are interested .
That 's why I disagree with the statement .
