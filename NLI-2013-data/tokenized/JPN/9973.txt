Successful people do not have to try new things if they are satisfied their succeed .

They should improve their successful job rather than try totally new things .
Of course , they can try new things but there is no promise to get success again .
I assume that people could have got success is not so careful to try new job because they have confidence from their success .
They do not have any pressere in bad way .
They feel that they can do everything they want and get succeess .

I will not stop them if they have really good ideas for their project or their projects have some similar points which they had , or they are quite sure they can get successful .
Acutually , they know how to get succeess and what would be able to go well or bad .
This is their own problems so I should not stop or disturb them .

However , from my perspective , they should not do that because we really can not get success so often .
Concentrating to one thing is more effective than trying a lot of things .
If they have a lot of categolies to do , they would be so busy and each things can be too simple because they have no time to think about each shops .
For example , there is a boss who has MacDonald 's and H & M .
If H & M is very popular and they can get a lot of money from it , who thinks about a new barger of MacDonald 's ?
The boss would think about H & M all the time and they do not really think about MacDonald 's .
Of course they can get money from MacDonald 's but the shop would not be better .

For these reasons , I do not think successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
They can be a professional people of that .
