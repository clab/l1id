I agree that .
In my case , I agree .
There are few reasons .
First of all , having a lot of Knowledge makes me live easily and useful .
For example , When I see a TV news program , I can understand almost of every issues and have my own opinions against them .

Secondly , having a plently of broad Knowledge means having a lot of topics to talk about .
For example , when I go to a party , I have to talk to a person who I do n't know .
At the time , we should talk something .
If I know a lot of topics , making a conversation is easily .
When we first meet a person , we do n't talk about specific subject deeply except some kind of academic meetings .

Ofcourse , a person who mastered a specific subject can help many person or things .
For example , doctors , lowers , scientists , etc .
However , I am not the kind of person .
My way is that ask a specialist when I do n't know .
So , they are .
Conclude , I agree that it is better to know many subjects than to know one specific subject .
