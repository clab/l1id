Although it 's important to learn ideas and concepts in textbooks , I disagree the statements that it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because the ideas and concepts are origined from facts .
For example , capitalism , one of the economic ideas , had been generated around 19th century in the United Kingdom when they made stock markets .
This idea was generated from the fact that the stock markets was made .
The facts give the ideas and concepts when people try to understand the phenomenon of facts .

Moreover , the new facts are not defined as ideas and concepts immediately since the ideas and concepts are produced through discussion of facts .
It takes time for people to generate ideas and concepts through the long procedure of discussion and comprehension .
Still we do n't know why the pyramids in Egypt were constructed .
This is completely mistery of ideas and concepts .
But we can learn the facts that pyramids were constructed through history .
We could miss some point if we focus on only ideas and concepts .

Needless to say , sometimes the ideas comflict with each other because people comprehend the facts individually and generate ideas differently .
Those different ideas generate conflicts .
I assume that the wars are induced since the happiness is defined by individual people .
For example , people in some countries believe in communism , one of the political ideas , and the other people believe in democratism .
Those might start wars at some points .

Of course , I agree it 's very important to refer ideas and concepts in written texbooks according to facts because this process helps student to understand the facts better .
However , students should study facts at first since those ideas are always origined from the facts .
