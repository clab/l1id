I think there will not be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
There is two reasons like below .

At first , the present population in the world is six billion , and it never stop to increase , and it is said the world population is growing with much more high speed .
So it is certain that the demand of car also increases with the increase of the population .

Second , I think it is difficult that we invent a brand new vehicle that is more convinient than car in twenty years .
We have already had another transportation system like plane , ship , bicycle , but they are used with different needs , and they are not useful as a alternative of car .
