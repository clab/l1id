I agree with this statement .
Successful people really know about themselves .
They know what they really good at , so they do n't try for new things that taking them into the risks .
It is very different between successful people and unsuccessful people .

Successful people work hard on their certain thing .
For example , if a person is an expert in graphic design , that person should work hard on something that relates to graphic design .
That is easy way to succeed .
This is because a person know almost everything about graphic design .
However if that person works in electric company , do you know what will happened ?
A person will fail with that job .
This is because that person only knows about graphic design , not electric matters .
It is very risky that a person does n't know nothing about new things .
So successful people do n't try new thing that causes risks .

How about unsucessful people .
Whenever they suceed something , they fell they can do whatever they want .
So they try to start new job that they do n't really know about it .
That is very risky .
However , unsucessful people do n't realize until they are failing with that job .
It is too late !
They must realize before starting new job .
Whnever they realize , they have a lot of money to recompense and sometimes those people are going to suicide .
That is very fool thing to do .
The life is very precious and people should n't waste it .
No one forgives those people even the God .

Now we know how different between successful people and unsuccessful people .
They are same human but they are so different in inside of their minds .
So to be successful .
do n't try new things and work hard on whatever you are experts in .
