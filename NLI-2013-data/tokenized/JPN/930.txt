I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
It is hard to agree with one or the other .
But there are several reasons that drawn me into this conclusion .

First , having a lot of knowledge of many academic subjects will give you different views of things .
I believe that it will help you grow as a person .
When you encounter a problem , if you know that there are more then one side on everything in this world and be able to try to look at the problem from other sides , it will be easier for you to get through the problem .
However , if you are into just one thing , even though you know a lot about it , because all you have learned in your life is your specialization , you will have hard time passing through those problems .

Second , it might seem great to specializing in one specific subject , but there always are greater people above you .
And more you are into the subject , more you suffer from not being the best .
This argument fails unless you are not the best .
But how many bests are there ?
Yes , one .
there are more chances for you to be the non-best .

Third , let me put this whole quesion into the real world .
If you are specialized in one subject .
You might get paid well .
You might get a good spot at work .
But you are not a hero at home .
You are just a person , who brings a lot of money to your house .
However , if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , people that matters , your family will appreciate you being able to answer questions about a lot of things .
I would rather be a hero at home with my family I care about then a hero at work to have a happy life .

The opinion you come up with on this subject has a lot to do with what kind of person you are .
I am a kind of person , who values my friends and family .
It is important to for me to stay heppy and not depressed .
It could be a waste of life for some people .
But to me , having good time means living the life the fullest .
I do not want to live my life suffering .
That is why I agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
