Some people agree with broading knowledge of many academic subjects .
It is true that it has advantages .
By broading knowlege acadmic subjects , one can rcognize and choose what subject one want to learn most and one can understand the expand of academic area also .
But I think if one is a student , he already has decide what he want to learn before taking many academic subjects .
Therefore I strongly agree with the thought to specialize in one subject .

I have two reason to support my opinion .
The one is that in business they need people who specialized in one subject .
For example , in Japan , for last fifteen years , they had needed a generalist who were able to do everything not so bad in the office .
But he were not able to do one thing better than anyone .
Genaralists were able to do everything but they did not have charactaristic abilities .
So Japan cannot catch up with United States in the financial business matter yet .
In addition , a generalist may be replaced to someone whose payment is cheeper than his , because there is no reason he is the person who is need for the position in the company .

The other is that unless one consentrate on one subject , he cannot understand the interesting of the subject .
Once one specialized one thing , he can proud of himself and this extends his intrest in other subjects .
Moreover , he can understand how much
