I agree with the opnion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects for the following reasons .

First , having broad knowlege of many academic subjects is more convient .
For example , in 1995 when I was junior in Tokyo University in Tokyo Japan , I studied law and tax .
One day , when I and my friends were researching for bank law , I were confusing with the law .
One of my friend , Tanaka , is the best student studied economy and had a lot of knowledge of bank system .
He helped me .
I were able to learn a lot of thing about the bank law .

As the example shows that having broad knowelege of many academic is more convient .

Second , to have variety of academic subjects is more fun .
For example , in 1996 when I worked part-time at a private school , I taught Japanese History .
I taught Japanese History , Law and Tax in the historiacl class .
Children in my class were interested in social sytem .
They asked me a lot of question about history , law and tax .
Some of children wanted to study law .
I had good time in my lecture .

This experience clearly shows that having broad knowelge of many acadmeic subjects make me fun and brings me good time .

Thus , I definitely agree with the opnion that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects than specializing in one specific subject .
