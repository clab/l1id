I agree this statement which is more importaint for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Because if you understand ideas and concept , you can use the different way ahving your knowlege more than fact .

For example , Right now i am taking math class .
Usually , every question already have the answer .
You can check answer from the answerseet .
However , when i was solving some questions , i could not get the answer .
you might think you cans check the answer from the book .
Even i check the answer and see the fact , i feel that i want to know the idea which how to get the answer .

Fact can not use different way , as i mention only know the answer which is fact is not able to use anotherway .

Another example is language .
I am also taking Chinese class .
every character has different meaning .
some character has so cunfusing line and sometimes tree for four character is mix together and becomes one word .
The word chinese character of domitory has roof , people , and hundred meaning of character .
The reason why is that people live together under the oneYou just remember the word as fact , you might not care about reason .
if you want to understand ideas of each word , you can guess the meaning .
You can guess what is character means using your relative goods or life .
if you just know the fact , you can not gusee anymore .
