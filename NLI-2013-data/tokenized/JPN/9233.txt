In my opinion , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning just the facts .
This is because students may not understand the ideas from the facts , but students may learn the facts from understanding the ideas .

For instance , imagin you are in the high level math class , and instructore gives you an assignment paper .
The instructor says just `` Do it '' , to you .
If you have a knowledge about that questions on the assignment , you may do it .
However , if you do not have knowledge , you never do it .
Therefore , you will ask instructor how to solve these questions , and the instructor gives you an answer-list paper .
So you can write answers now .
This is what I think about learning just the facts .
In this situation , you never study math .

On the other hand , If you are in the same math class , but instructor exchanged .
The instructor gives you the same assignment paper , and he says `` let 's start a lecture using that paper '' .
Next , the instructor bigins the lecture to tell you how to solve the questions on the assignment paper , and he also recommends you and gives a few time to consider the solving method or formula .
After that time , instructor gives you the answers or correct your idea about these questions , and he also explains why this method is useful .
At the end of the class , you have studied math , and if some questions remain on the assignment papre , you can try to answer them from the knowledge of what you studied while hte class .
Finally , you can say that you study math .
