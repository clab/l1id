Based on my experience , I do not agree with the statement , though I understand the importance of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects for using academic skills properly .
In particular , technology without ethics is dangerous such as genetic engineering and nuclear power without deep consideration of their effect on our society .
Once we specialize in one specific subject , we tend to be narrow minded and do not care about other things happening in the world .
In that sence , I agree with the idea that having broad academic knowledge is important .

However , if academic skills are required for becoming professional in any areas , to know deeply in one subject is much more important than to know broadly in many subjects .
If I make an advise for high school student who enter a university for academic skills , I would say `` it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects if you want to be a professional . ''

To know something is totally different from to do with something , in general .
For example , skills to do research as a professional in one specific subject is very much different the skills to know many subjects as a hobby .
When we are young , we tend to try to broaden our possibility and be interested in many areas .
Based on my experience , however , our time is limited and too short to know many academic knowledges deeply .
We have to choose either way of knowing deeply or knowing broadly .
They are trade off .
Therefore , after getting enough knowledge of one specific subject as a professional , having a broad knowledge of other academic subjects is the best way , I think .
Once we are used to one academic subject , it is much easier to know other academic subjects , because the structures of academic subjects are similar , in general .

To summarize , if we would like to do with the academic skills as a professional , I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject for several years in a university .
