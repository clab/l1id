I would agree with this statement .
I think successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do .

First , there are successful people who tried new things .
Eveyone knows about these companies named Microsoft , Honda , and so on .
These are now big companies but started by few people .
They made new buisiness and made lots of money .
Nobody thought that they were going to success first .
They took risks and opened buisiness and successed .

Ssecond , even if you do n't try new things , some people ca n't success on their life .
If both people who try new things and not try new things ca n't success , I think people who tried new things are more brave .
Even if they ould n't success at the time , they might success next time .
Because tthey once tried and learned what is not successful .
Nothing is born form challenging new thing .
I also think it is boring to do same things again and again .
People used to live without light long time ago .
Now , people invented light and we can do anything at night .

Third , I think their attitude for trying new things is hard but they can get to learn some thing .
Even they cant success first , they will success at the end .
People tend to respect who is working hard .
Some people might bring good plan to you .
I think the important thing is learning and not making same mistake again .

According to above , I think successful people try new things .
I want to success in my life so I will try new things .
I want to challenge new things and learn lots of things .
I hope those things I learned will help me in the future .
