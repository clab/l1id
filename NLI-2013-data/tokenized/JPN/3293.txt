In Japan , some people think that young people give enough time to helping their communities recently .
However , I agee with the idea that young people do not do that for the folloing reasons .

First , young people nowadays have seldom opportunities to help their communities .
For example , when I was a student of secondary school in 1990 , I lived in Nagoya , which is the fourth largest city in Japan .
In Nagoya , there were some rules in my communiy that people had to gather once a month , and had to pick up trushes on the roads near our community .
Young persons and children also required to attend the activity .
It takes about two hours at one time , but I could contribute to the community .
But now , there are no activity like that in my community and I hardly hear the existence of such an activity from my friends .
This example demontrates that I strongly believe that there are not enough opportunities for young people to help their communities .

Second , young people nowadays have little sense to belong to their communities .
For instance , when I lived in Nagoya , the neighboors were so kind that there were many opportunities to meet them .
I thought that the neighboors were close to me , and that the community was important for me .
I always wanted to help my own community because I felt belonging to the community .
But now , the neighboors become more far away because people like to spend time more with their friends rather than with their neighboors .
In addition , a sense of privacy increased now , people tend to keep a distance from their neighboors .
This example clearly shows that young people nowadays have little sense to belong to their communities .

Therefore , I definitely agree with the idea that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities recently .
