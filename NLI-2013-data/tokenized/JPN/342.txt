It is likely that to specialize in one specific subject is beneficial for people who have decided to develop their carreers in a certain area , but I think that , in general , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more helpful in our lives .

First of all , to obtain a great number of academic encourages us to have many options or choices with regard to our intellectual activities as well as our careers .
If one has knowledge of only one fierld , he or she can not revise the direction of life .
For example , my old friend had a prominent knowledge about iron industry and he decided to get into a certain large iron company .
Fortunately he joined the largest company in Japan , but the iron industry faced a serious recession later , which required him to take advantage of another skill or knowledge which he did not have .
I think people ought to be as versitile as possible , and ramify their lives according to condirions and phenominon .

Secondly , to develop a diverse sequence of knowledge help us find what we would have never found .
When I worked for a life insurance conpany , I was studying the neiboring industries such as the property / casuality insurance , mutual funds , and investment banking .
Then , the idea that it is possible to make a innovative products by mixing the features of each industry had occured to me .
And eventually , I became one of the member of our project in which we established a financial holding company under which there are now several financial institutions .
In addition , I am in charge of product development , especially high-brid product which consists of both life insurance and mutual fund .

In conllusion , for the reasons pointed out above , I definitely think that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
