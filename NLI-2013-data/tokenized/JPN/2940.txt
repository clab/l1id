Since different people have different life activities and styles , It is really difficult to generalize if youg people enjoy life more that older people do .
However , from my experience , I think that older people enjoy life more than ypung poeple do .

First of all , many young people do n't have freedom while the olders do .
For instance , they have to belong to schools to ged education , and they have to study seriously every day as long as they want to get a blight future which is essentially to get a good salary job and family .
To study is one of the most stressful activities they experience .
on the other hand , it is more likely for the olders to forcus their lives on what they really want to do such as hiking and traveling .
for instance , I am a college students so that I do not have time to spend for my hobbies such as rockclimbing and swiming in the semester .
and I envy older people who enjoy riding a bike .

secondly , teenagers tend to have difficulties to establish a good relationships with others and have other serious distress such as family probrems .
This actually make many of them commit suiside .
young people tend to depend on their parents so that they do n't have any abillity to change their lives .
as a consequence , it is more difficult for younger people to have time to enjoy their lives .

finally , young people do n't have good economical or finacial establsiment so that they tend to have money problems while older people do .
To have joyful time , money is essence .
if you do n't have enough money , I connot enjoy you life .
therefore , older people have more time to enjoy life .

Each peason has different life in different age so that it is not possilble to detrermine whether young people enjoy life more that older people do .
However , again , older people have more opportunities to have time to enjoy their lives , according to my experience .
