I think older people enjoy life more than young people .
There are two reasons .
Will , knowledge and money .
First of all , it is will .
older people think how to life .
Because they had busy time when they were young .
For example , doing job and growing own children and housu keeping and so on .
I have heard that they want to do something which they want .
They talk to me what they want when they have free time .
In other words , they have something to do after retired .
And they have `` will '' , which they are going to enjoy it .
I Otherwise there are less experence for young peole .
So they want to do many tinng , either .
For exzmple , sport and study .
Doing those is very fun for young people .
But sometime young people do not those by own wish .
Someone , who is their parents and teachers so on , let them do .
I think thinkings of older people is real enjoying life .

Second point is knowledge .

Third point is about money .
Money is necessary to enjoy life for people .
In Japan , older people can get pentions .
So there are many mony which they use for myself .
I think money is not everything , but it is important to enjoy life .
Older people can go to trip , going to house where their grandchirldren ive .
