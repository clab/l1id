Some people may think that people should specialize in one specific subject because they can write a good thesis .
However , I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject for the following reasons .

First of all , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is useful for working .
For example , in 2000 , when I was a forth year student in University of Tokyo , my major was civil engineering .
Of course , I took the subjects about the civil engineering , but I also tool the subjects such as economics and politics .
Now , I work at Japan Central railway company as a engineer and my project is to plan to build the station building .
I need to discuss with many co-workers .
I can solve the problems about this project effectively because I learn about wide knowledge about many subjects .
As a result , this project goes on very well .
This experience shows that having wide knowledge of a lot of academic subjects is very useful for working .

In addition , people can communicate well by having wide knowledge about many academic subjects .
For instance , I join on the swimming club now .
This team is consist of a lot of members such as professors in Keio University , workers at banks and engineers at heavy industrial companies .
In this club , we often go to the bar after the practice of the swimming and exchange some information .
I can communicate effectively with every members because I have wide knowledge of many academic subjects and I can ask some questions to them .
As a result , I can make many friends .
As the above example demonstrates , people can communicate well by having wide knowledge about a lot of academic subjects .

In conclusion , I strongly believe that it is better to have wide knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
