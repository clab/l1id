Travelling can serve many purposes , ranging from pleasure and academic to businesses .
A guided tour is often part of the former example of travelling ; for one 's pleasure or academic purpose .
The best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide , however ; if I had the choice , I would rather travel alone .
This is because of freedom that solo travel provides : freedom of planning your own travel , and freedom of avoiding problems caused by other group members .

First , a benifit of travelling alone is that it gives you the freedom to plan your own travel .
Since you are the only one who ` singed up ' for the tour , you are free to decide on the places you want to go to , when to go there , and what to do when you get there .
As an example , when I went to Hawaii last summer , I decided to go there on my own , rather than joining a group tour .
Because of that , I was able to see what I wanted to see ; the beaches to surf , rather than going shopping malls , which the tour focused .
Also , I was able to pick when I wanted to go , unlike the fixed dates indicated on those tours .
By travelling alone , I was able to enjoy my stay in Hawaii based on the greater magnitude of freedom I had .

Second , travelling alone gives you an additional degree of freedom since you are free from problems caused by others ; the possible costs I may have to incur due to actions of others .
Imagine a scenario where I decided to sign up for a group tour to Hawaii .
The schedule of which plane to take and what time the bus would come and pick me up at Honolulu International has already been planned out .
But it 's not just my schedule ; it 's the entire group 's schedule .
Let 's say that several selfish people decided to show up late .
The whole tour has to suffer from the possible consequences caused by those individuals ; perhaps skiiping an activity we wanted to do or even delaying the trip entirely .
It would n't make sense if the tour had to give up going to the beach because some individual was taking too long deciding on whether she should get a pink or a white Coach bag .
By traveling alone , I am able to avoid possible problems caused by irresponsible companions .

On the statement of `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , '' I disagree in respect to the lack of freedom I would get from travelling in a group .
Travelling alone would allow you to plan your own trip , ( the freedom of choosing the activity and its day ) and avoid possible problems caused by accompanying tourists ( such as skipping or delaying an activity . )
Unless I am certain that the tour somewhat follows an agenda similar to that of mine , I would not consider traveling on a group tour led by a guide .
