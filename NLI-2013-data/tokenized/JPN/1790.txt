I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Since young people are making our society these days , in my opinion , the society is made good for young people .

There are many places in which young peple enjoy and older people can not .
For example , game center is the place where we can play many games .
Many young people go to there and enjoy games .
However it is too dangerous for older people to visit there since there are many bad young people .

Also , I think that young people have chance to communicate with people more .
Young people go to schools and meet friends .
They also can join many activities out of the school .
Older people may join some activities but there are not many activities for older people .
In my experience , I went to the USA last year as an exchange student nad I met alot of people who I could not see if I was in Japan .
If I were older , I am sure that I could not go to America and have great experiences .

In addition , older people have physical problems .
It is hard for older people to go to many palaces and enjoy all of them .
However young people have more enagy so they do not get tired easily .

Therefor I think that young people enjoy life more than older people .
