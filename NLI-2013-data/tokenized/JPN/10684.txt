I agree wtith this opinion that Successful people try new thiungs and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
there are several reasons .
In my case , my mother is a succsessful person .
However I always think many thingshappened in daily life negatively .
For example , Now I am in Canada to study english .
However I had a complain about my class .
one of my reasons was that class was so noisy .
Many peolpe always speak a lot and I could not consentrate at all .
Then I discussed with my adviser , MYthla .
She told me that I will change the class that is more higher level .
however I did not have a confidence If i can do well in this level .
After school .
I told all story to my mother .
then she gave me an advice .
she told me the story thet she experienced .
the story was whar she went to skiing with her friends .
and her advioce was that If you go to skiing with friend who has same skill with me , you can enjoy but your skill will not improved .
however if you skiing with friend who has better skill than me , then your skill is more improve .
I agreed with her advice .
I think the person who doing what they already know how to do well does not take risk but they will not receive anything instead of their safty .
If I will skiing with my friends , for me It is big challenge but I can learn from my fail .
and , perhops I will try to do that I will never happen again .
Everybody have a bad experience .
however We can get many advice from it .

Therefore I think successful people is the person who do not afraid of fail and keep challenge to get new things .
