Now , cars have become very convinient tools in our life .
We can move anywhere if we have a car at least in our house .
However , I agree with the opinion .
There are thee reasons why I think so .
First , reducing cars tend to decrease of the amount of harmful gass .
Recently , we are facing to the problem such as glorbal warming , air poolution , and many other ploblems .
I am surely thinking that these problems are becoming worse and worse , and finally , we may face the serious situation someday .
S Decreasing cars cause to improve these problems .

Second , becoming fewer cars can also abolish the noise problem .
Residents in the central city may trouble with the problems because there are a great deal of cars are running close their houses .
If cars become fewer , complaining about these noisy environment become fewer at the same time .

Finally , it can also reduce the rate of car crash accidents .
According to the resent reseach , the death rate is becoming higher and higher by many tipes of car accidnts .
To increase the cars rate also invite the producing the high rate of the car accidents .
If the amounts of cars reduce , we can reduce such a terrible accident before hand than now .

Therefore , I storonglly agree with the opinion that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Certainly , life of using car is very useful , but there are many demerit as well as these convinient points .
If we do n't have cars , we surely can find the other ways in twenty years .
