I agree with the statement .
I will chose the group travel led by tour guide .
First , using a tour guide takes us less time to search the detail of the place we will visit and the way how to go there .
If we do n't have enought time to study them , this become a convinient way to travel .

Secondaly , a tour guide may know the special place which ordinay tourists do n't know .
I think it is very difficult to find out the place which local people only knonw good .
So if we travel led by a tour guide , we may more appriciate the tour .

Fainaly , travels led by a tour guide provides us with more safly tours .
For example , foreign countries travel is the case .
When we go to the countries , if we do n't know what the language spoken or how safe the region is , that may ocuur some dangerous situations .
So , If we do n't have a confidence we get along with them , using a tour guide is good selection .
