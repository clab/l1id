Rich people in other words , people who are prospered in specific field are more likely to challenge new things .
There are some supporting ideas and facts that lead me to agree to this statement .

First of all , I would like to ask you that is it fun after completing a particular subject ?
I think people need some kind of stimulation in your life .
According to the statement , it said `` taking risks '' .
I inferred this as challenges .
For instance , a president of a company successfully complete a task he got , what he will do next is do something else exciteing .
I guess most of people in the world are greedy .
The greed will make those riches or the successful people to step on the deck .

This is a fact that I have a friend who successfully runs a business in Brunei .
He runs two jewellry shops and an enormous restaurant in the middle of the capital city of Brunei .
I thought that would be enough for that time I meet him few years ago .
Then recently , I called him whether he is doing well or not .
I felt that his response sounds like a kind of depression but also an excitement .
What he was doing is trying another thing , in other words , challenging .
He actually was doing a currency exchanges .
However , as you can see he got bored of running the shops and restuarant therefore he sought new excitement in his life .

In conclusion , people are more likely to somehow improve and increase their abilities by challenging something .
It seems more in the high-class , I mean rich or successful people , beacuse of their wealth .
Enough money to challenge new things rather than poor .

It is nothing excited if you do the same things everyday .
Due to these thoughts and the experiences i agreed with the statement .
