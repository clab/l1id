Some people believe that successful people shoud try new things and take risks .
Others believe that successful people shoud only do what they already know how to do well .
However , I believe that people should only do what they already know how to do well rather than trying new things and taking risks .
I have two convincing reasons .
They can save time and money by doing what they already know how to do well .

First , we can save time .
If people want to try new things , they have to do error and trial to establish new things .
It takes time to establish new things .
If I want to establish new physics theory , I have to spend a lot of time to think about the theory , probably I have to spend my whole life .
In contrast , If they only do what they know how to do well , they do not need to spend so much time .
In the case of physics , they just need to remember physical laws which alreadly known .
Thus , we can save time by doing what they already know how to do well .

Second , we can save money .
If people want to try new tnings , they have to take risks .
Often they lose money because they fail to try new things .
Many people want to have their own company .
However , they do not because they want to avoid risks .
For example , if I have enough knowledge about car technology and want to have new company to make cars , I have to invest enormous money .
In addition , I have to compete other car companies like GM , Ford and Toyota which have far more money than I. Thus , my car company will bunkrupt easily .
Then I will lost money .
Therefore , if people want to success , they should do what they already know how to do well .
They cannot expect to earn more money than they expect , but they can earn money as they expect .

In conclusion , I believe that people should only do what they are alreay know how to do well rather than trying new things and taking risks .
I have two convincing reasons .
They can save time and money by doing what they already know how to do well .
