I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are three reasons for this : safety , skills of foreign language , and convenience .

First , it is more safer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
The tour assistants know the place where the crimes are likely to occur , so they will notice the customers about that .
Moreover , stolers may think that it is harder to stole something from person in group than from the person walking alone .

Second reason is that I am not confident of the skills of foreign languages .
When we have any troubles in abroad , we feel more anxious than usual .
This is partly because it is difficult to communicate with others and to catch infomations due to lack of language skills .
If we have tour assistants , what to do for solving a problem is calling and asking them to help ourselves .

Third , travel tours are very usuful .
I do not like to prepare for traveling , say , making reservations for staying or dinner , getting tickets for flight , and so on .
When I travel by myself , I have to clear these steps .
On the other hand , if I entry a travel tour , these steps will be cleared by the tour company .
In addition , the tour assistants show famous spots for sightseeing , It is true that we lose some extent of freedom in tours , but totally thinking ,
