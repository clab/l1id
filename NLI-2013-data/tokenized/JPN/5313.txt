I am agree wih the statemant .
I have three reasons why I 'm support the statement .
First , it is natural making products seem much better than they really are .
Advertisement is economy .
So , making products seem much better is nurtural .
Please imagine .
For example , food .
If the advertisement in food do n't look like delicious , Most people will not buy because it seems taste bad .
Then , economy does n't work .
Nobady buy it , then , the products disappear .
The reasn why most people buy the product is influenced in advertisement .
At least , Japan , most people are influenced by advertisement .
In fact , I 'm one of them .

Second , advertisement is competition between many companies .
How they can make the people to buy it or How make their products look like good .
It is true that the product which I bought was bad .
However , it shows that how the advertisement have big influence .

Finally , you know that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
You shoud remember thet .
I think making prducts seem much better is bad thing .
But , above all , it is economy .
So , we ca n't do anything .
All we have to do is remember that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
