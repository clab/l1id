I agree with that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts for students .
There are some reasons to surpport my opinion .
First of all , think about the ordinary things .
For example , as we all know , the water becomes a ice at the point of the temperture is 0 degree .
This is a fact and it is common knowlegde .
However , how can we understand the fact ?
We understand the fact by knowing the ideas .
Almost people have taken the science class when they were in school and learnt about the temperture .
They might have done some lab and seen the ideas of the fact .
Seeing the ideas is effective to understand the fact .

Secondly , in an advertising .
I have learnt about marketing , and I realized that the fact is the only the fact , and I have to know the concept of an advertisment .
I had n't known that the knowing the concept is very important to improve my skill of advertisment .

I always tried to think about the concept of advertisments .
Even I did n't understnad the meaning of the advertisments , I could know the fact of the advertisments after I researched the concept of the advertisments .
I then gradually became to be able to understand the fact of the advertisments .
Therefore , I needed to know the concept .
This is helpful to creat the advertisment to me because I have to think the concept so I needed to learn about the concept .

For these reason , I think students should understand ideas and concepts well .
It will help them when they have to think about the fact .
I also think that the fact is the only fact , it is not well-understanding if students do n't understand ideas and concepts .
Therefore , I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts .
