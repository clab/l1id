I believe that young people enjoy life far more than old people do .
This is due to three main reasons .
In this essay , I will explain why I have come to this conclition .

Firstly , most young people have good health .
As a eighteen-yearold my self , I rarely get sick or get injured compared with my neighbor lady who is seventy-five .
She always tell me that health is the most important aspect , and to take care of my health since it is so important .
Many people in Japanese society believe this idea .
Also , there is a word in japanese that saids : The inner health comes from the outer health .
This means that if an individual is physicaly healthy , he/she will be mentaly health , refering to having positive emotions .
Which indicates that people can enjoy their lifes when they are healthy .

Secondly , having both old and new ways of thinking is easy for young people .
Young people can learn new ideas or analise new techniques .
They are able to use technology , and conseme new ideas .
In addition , young people can learn history at school , or listen to stories from older people , such as parents , grand-parents , and neighbors .
Having a diverse thinking will allow a prosperous life , which can mean a enjoyable life .
On the other hand , older people are not advanced in handleing new ideas , on new techniques .
Forexample , my mother who is fifty-years-old , can not handle advanced technology such as her mobile-phone .

Thirdly , young people are usualy ambisious then older people .
This is because young have not seen the big world yet , which allows them tohave diverse goals .
Also , young people can study hard to get in a good university , to enjoy life .
However , most older people have brain which can not consume many materials physicaly .
Also , older peoplr know the limit of goals and dreams .
I believe that having a goal or a dream increases the standards of living .
Which leads to an enjoyable life .
