Recently , it is said that young pepople do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree this opinion , because young people of nowadays are so busy of their own things , and they are poor ability of communication , and they regard the community as not so important .

On the first , young people is very busy , because they need to go to prepschoop after school .
In japan , the end of primary school , there are entrance examination to the junior highschool .
So they need to study hard .
Moreover they learn many kind of things , for example , tennis , swimming , piano , something like that ...
After enter university , they are busy to social life such as the party , part-time job , the date ..

There are no time to spend for their communities .
Secondly , young people do not know how to communicate with the many kind of people .
Usually they are grown up small familly , so they are not good at communicate another people except their familly or school mates .
So it is difficult to communicate for them .

Thirdly , young people regard the community activity as not so inportant .
Some of them are busy for theirselves , so they think that it is useless to attend the community 's activity .

In these reason , I think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It is pitty , but it is real situation in Japan .
