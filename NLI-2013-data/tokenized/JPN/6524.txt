I disagree that ` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are tody ' for the following reasons .

First , cars are very convenient .
No other tranportations can replace them .
For example , car has been ` a people 's legs ' .
When I lived in Hiroshima , one of the local city of Japan , I can not move anywhere without a car .
Social systems are in the condition people can use a car .
Additionally , I find it more in the countryside , people can not go to shops without cars .
I believe that cars are convenient and have been the tools for living .

Second , I think that cars will be developed to adjust our life .
The features of car can change and can solve the problems .
For example , cars comsume a lot of energy and pollute our environments , but now improving their mechanism to reduce bad inpacts .
I believe that cars will be developed better in twenty years and will not lose their possition .

In conclution , for the reasons mentioned above , I strongly do not believe that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
