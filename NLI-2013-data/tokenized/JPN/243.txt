I think to understand ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is for them to learn facts .
The reason is that to understand ideas and concepts is more creative activities for students .
When we try to understand the ideas and concepts , we must consider lots of factors of ideas and concepts .
At first we must confirm whose ideas or concepts they are , to add more information to them as the backgrounds .
Next , we make analyse why they have the ideas or the concepts using aquired background information .
After these prosesses , we can aproach to the stage to make answers or own opinions .
To get answers or opinions , students can make discussion with friends , parent , and brothers .
In additon , they can get some suggestions from their teachers or they also can make investigation using books or internet to add more information .
I think that these consequent prosesses are very important for students to develop their way of thinking .

In contrast , learning facts does not need such prosseses .
It is easy to access the fact without any kind of thinking .
To learn facts , students just sit down on their seats in the class room and just listen to what their teacher says .
In this case , the information is only given form their teacher to students .
If students listen to what their teacher says and write down it on their notebook , they can get new knowledge .
But do they use their brain to consider anything during this behaviour ?
The answer is no .
They just listen and move their hand to write .
These prosesses are not creative and maybe macines can do it completely .

In conclusion , I strongly think to understand ideas and concepts is more important for students than it is for them to learn facts .
