For a long time , every people have studied a lot .
We must learn with many subjects , for example history , mathematics , English , and science .
We must know the facts to learn , although it is not enough .
I think we must know the ideas and concepts too .

In genaral , children can memorise more than adults , because their brains are softer .
Though , it will become more difficult to memorise with their growth .
But I heard if there are some concepts or ideas with facts , we do not forget .
There an example .
When we are studing world history , we must know about the World Wars .
The facts are just learn the countries which involved these wars or the people who started to fights .
We memorise them at this time , but we will forget someday .
However , if teacher give students a chance to think about these countries thinking , and they will not forget this experience easily .
Because it will become student 's experience , it not just learn about history .
