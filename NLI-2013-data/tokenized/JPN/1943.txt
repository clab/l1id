I agree the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
There are two reason for this , physical strength and less responsibility .
First , generally youg people have better physical condition than older people .
With a time has past , people become to get aged and the pysical conditon become worth .
Having strong condition give young people more time .
For example , it is possibel for healty young people to get up early in a morning , drive to mountain , enjoy picnic , and have a party after comming back from picnic .
Physical strengh give young people possible to use their time tightly .
Same 2 days weekend means different for those tough youth and tired old people .

Next , young people tend to have less responsibility in family and society compare with older people .
Single young people just need to take care of themselves .
That means cost for living is not high , so that they can chose their job by thier own idea .
If they do not like the job , they can quit a job and look for another .
It is easy for young people to live alone .
But for old peple , specially have family , it is totally different .
They have a responsiblity to take care of their families .
If the one who wants to quite a job , it is not easy to decide .
They have to finde a job that pay them much enough to take care of their families .
In society , more old people have higher position than yong people .
Those higher position also give high pressure to old people .
They have to take care of not only their families but also their staff in their organizations .

Because of those two reasons , I agree the idea that young people enjoy thier life more than old people do .
