I do not agree with this opinion because of these three reasons ; expenses to have a tour guide , not being able to communicate with local residents , and not being able to learn taking resposobilities and the real side of the place .

First , it is expensive to have a tour guide compared to taking a trip on your own or in a group .
It is not nessesary to worry about the cost if the person is rich , however not very many people would like to speand too much money just on traveling because it is also important to spend money on souveniours or on the food .
Therefore it is not nessesary to have a tour guide .

Second , it is hard to communicate with local residents with a tour guide .
When taking a trip , it is a great opportunity to talk to the local residents because they may be able to tell you where good restaurants are or nice places where local people only know .
Also , when traveling a foreign country , it is fun using a foreign language .
If you are traveling with a tour guide and he or she always does things for you , you might lose these opportunities .

Third , the tour with a tour gude in a group can be fun with no learning and responsibilities .
Taking trips can be a learning place .
You can learn about the people , culture , atomosphere , and the language where you visit .
When you are with a tour guide , you will only listen to the tour guide and your friend in the group , therefore these learning opportunities decrease compared to taking trips without a tour guide .
Also you will be dependant on the tour gide so that you will not be able to learn as much as traveking alone .

Let 's travel alone !
You may be scared to travel alone , however there are so many things you can learn by taking trips on your own .
It is cheap to take trips without a tour guide and fun to get to know the local residents .
You will also be able to learn many things by traveling alone .
Again , I do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
