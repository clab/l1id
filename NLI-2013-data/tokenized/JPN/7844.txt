I disagree with the statement .
I believe the best way to travel is to guide or plan a trip by oneself .
In this way , a person can see what she wants to see and spend as much time as she wants at a place where she wants to be .
In addition , she can learn a culture of a country where he or she is visiting .

The problem associated with a planned tour by a travel agency is that a traveler cannot stay a place where she is visiting for as much as she wants because the travel is already scheduled and the tour has to move on on time .
Hence , she has less time to see or stay at a place where she is visiting .
In my opinion , this is negative because I do not like to feel being restricted by time .

Another problem with a travel company 's planned tour is that a traveler will not be able to get to interact with people living in a country where she is visiting .
Interacting with local people in the country is the best way to learn its culture .
If she was in a group led by a tour guide and have a question about the country , she would not ask local people walking on a street but rather she would ask it to the tour guide who comes from her country .
However , if she was not in the tour group and had a question about the country , she would have to ask to local people .
I believe interacting with local people is a great way to learn a country 's culture because by watching how they react to a traveler and she can learn some aspects of the culture .

In conclusion , it is better to plan a trip by oneself rather than following a planned trip offered by a travel agency .
Some might argue that the planned trip by the travel company would be better because travelers do not have to worry about where to eat and how to get to a place and so on .
They are correct in that traveling in a country by oneself where local people do not speak a traveler 's language is hard and creates a problem with food and so on .
On the other hand , I believe that it is a part of traveling a foreign country .
If there was not such a part in a travel , it would be the same as staying in your country .
Struggling with getting food and getting to a place would give a traveler a good experience on how to function in a different culture and how to adopt it .
Overall , I believe that traveling in a foreign country by oneself will give h an experience that he can use for later in his life .
