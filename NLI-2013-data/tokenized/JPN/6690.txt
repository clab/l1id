It is true that cat is very usable , and so meny people use it for going to works and shopping , many other things .
But I disagree to this statement , because of the following two reasons .

Firstly , cars makes a lot of CO2 , and this is being a big problem now .
I want to believe that people will try not to use cars too much , and make the CO2 level more lower .
Secondly , internet is getting common very rapidly .
In twenty years , maybe all the people in the developed country wii have their own computer , and they could study and do works , everything at home .
Even shoppin can be done by internet .
This means people does not have to go out as much as now .
So , the use of car will be less .
To place the time used for going to school , works , and shopping , we can go walking and play sports outside .
This is much more healthy and comfterble than using car to go everywhere .
Maybe families and friends can take more good comunication by walking together wathing the views .
And more , we does not have to be catche by the traffic problem .
I wish these things will really happen and the numbers of car will decrease .
Ofcourse the CO2 problem is too the big reason , but nowadays there are too much sad news caused by cars .
I think the decreasing of car uses will also decrease sad news .
Now many families have more than two cars at home .
But we should have the least
