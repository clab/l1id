I quite agree with that opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are some reasons why I agree with this opinion .
You can find new interests , new friends and can take advantage to the other people .

First , you will find new interests if you studied many kinds of academic subjects .
Some university force to student to study only the subject which the student major .
It is also important to specialize in one subjects , but it must discrease your unknown ability .
And it can connect to your future .
The knowledge which you studied is never be bad thing but very useful when you graduate from the university .

Second , you can find new friends .
If you take only the subjects you major , the range of friends is very narrow .
If you major business but interested in history , you should take history class .
There are many students who have same interests and you cannot meet them in the bussiness department .
They can be your best friends and can be good rival in your life .

Finally , deepen the knowledges about many kinds of subjects advantage to the other people .
I 'm studying English because I want to communicate with many people around the world and get the fine job which have the opputunity to use English .
However , there are many people who can speak English in the world .
I thought haw can I take advantage to ither people who can speak English .
So I decided to study many kind of academic subjects .
If you have a lot of knowledge , you can get the job which you want to .

To broad knowledge of many academic subjects is obviously increase your ability and the path which connect to your future .
So I agree with the statement perfectly .
