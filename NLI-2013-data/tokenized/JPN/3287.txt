When I was elementary student , I went to swimming school , cram school , and tennis school , so that I did n't have a time to contact with my community .
Therefore , I agree with the opinion that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities .
The reason is that their parents have the children learn many things .
Another reason is that the relationship in community is getting weak .

Many children go to cram school and learn many things such as swimming and tennis .
In recent years , people 's academic level is emphasised , so that parents let their children go to cram school to get better the their childrens ' ability to enter the good school .
Because of this tendensy , the competition to enter the good school is more higher that that of few years ago .
Therefore , the parents get their children to go to 2 or more cram school .
For example , my cousin is 3 years old , and he already go to kind of cram school to learn how to caculate and english .
Though he is 3 years old , he daose n't have a time to play with his friends .
Moreover , if the children have a little time expect the time which they go to cram school , they will use a time to play with their freinds and do n't help their communities .
Therfore , the time to helping their communities dose n't exsist in youg people 's life .

The relationship of community is weak .
For example , my friend dose n't know the neightboor because they do n't meet each other and there are n't event in their community .
Thefore , there are n't the oppotunities to know who live in the communities and make frieds with each other .
In these comuniti that the citizens relationship is weak , how they can help the neightboor who they do n't kanow .
When I was elementary student , the big earthquake was occured in my city .
It is noamal to help each other if the disaster occur .
However , no one help each other and they just think about their families .

The good thing for young people is to help their communities .
By doing this , they can get the sprit of voluteer and the sprit of helping people .
However , in recently , they are very busy to do learn many things to earn the good school .
Also , the citizens are only care about their family becasue of weakness of relationship in their communities .
Therefore , I difenitily agree with the opinion that young people do not give enought time to helping thier communities .
