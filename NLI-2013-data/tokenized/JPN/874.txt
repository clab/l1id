Although sometimes we need specialized knowlege , I agree with the statement .
It is important for us to have borader knowledge of many academic subjects .
The details of my reason is as follows .

Sometimes knowing only one subject may narrow possiblities they choose in their life .
For example , my friend was studying English literature at his university .
At that time he was so interested in that and did not study other subjects such as mathematics .
Now he is job-hunting and got stuck because English literature is not importatnt for the company which he wants to get in .
Much broader knowledge is required by the company .

Also , I found very interesting to talk to people who know things which I do not know .
Those people look very confident , and speak convincingly .
I think the reason why they are so is connected to his/her extensive knowledge about so many different subjects .
Knowing about many academic subjects clearly makes people attractive .

Finally when people are stuck in their lives , what they can count on is themselves .
They have to use their knowlege when they are in trouble .
If peple have broader knowlege of many academic subjects , they might be provided with more chance to get out of troubles .

To conclude I agree with the idea that people should know many academic subjects .
