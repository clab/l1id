It is true that many people succeed by only doing what they already know how to do well .
In fact , the artist or claftmen are successful people .
However , I do agree that if people try new things and take risks , they can be more successful in their lives .
Trying new things creats new inventions and technology and new experience .
Moreover , new things can solve problems in a society .

If people try new things and take risks , they can invent new technology .
Bill Gats is a good example .
His invention of microsoft made people 's life more convinient and easire .
He become a millionare becaue he tried new things and took risks .

If people try new things and take risks , they can have more new experience .
Moreover , the new experience is the key to be successful .
For example , one of my friend from Taiwan trid to come to Canda in order to get PHD dgree .
This was very new expericne for her and took risks because she had to leave her country and live by herself .
However , she become a famous resercher after she graduated from the university .

More importantly , whiout trying new things , many difficult problmes in this world wo n't be able to be solved .
If people can solve the probelms , they can be very halpful and successful .
For instance , the lack of energy is one of the social problems .
My boss at Universtiy has been studying about a fusion energy .
He and his co-wokers try to creat new energy for the future .
Even though his reserch has not complied , he is one of the famous scientists in the world .

In conclustion , many may belive that doing what people already know how to do well becomes more successful .
However , if people try new things , they can invent new products which are necesarry for many people .
Additionally , if poeple challenge new things and take risks , they can develop new experience .
This also made people successful .
Finally , as people try new things , they can solve many problems in the future .
