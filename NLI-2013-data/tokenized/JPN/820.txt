Some people assert that learning broad knowledge of many academic subfects is more important than learing one specific subject .
Others think that specializing in one subject is better .
I think that it is better to know broad knowledge than study only one subject .
I agree with the importance of specialing one topic , but we have already know very detail by using Internet , so I think that knowing many things is more important for living in the furure than studying one subject and show some benefits about it .

First , people can spread their vision through learning many subjects .
If people study only one subject , their way fo thinking or vision must be narrow .
Today , so many problems in the world , and they are inter-relating complexly .
For example , when he/she think about global warming , he/she have to look at economical , social , biological issues , so people must know and think about it by many visions .
Moreover , this example shows not only environmental problems , but also business or political issues , because some cases are as complex as environmenal problems .
Therefore , building a lot of visions is very important .

Another benefit of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is that which skill is very important for taking leadership .
Today , leader have to know many things more than general people .
For being respected and dependad on leader , people have to know wide knowledge , and solve difficult problems .
If leader do not know very detail or specific data , I think that it is no problem , because they could ask each specialists .
Then , the most important skill of working as a leader is choosing or finding best way to solve the problem .
For example , when thier partner wants to ask him why my work do not becoming well , if leaders who know only one thing deepy , they can answer about just his subject , but if leaders who know many subjects , they could advise partner by using many knowledge .

In conclusion , there are two main benefits of having wide knowledge , which are able to spread many visions and able to be a reliable leader in the future .
Therefore , if you work in the company or goverment as a leader , you have to learn not only one issue , but a lot of subjects .
