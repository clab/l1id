I disagree with this statement .
I believe that there is a better chance in having a successful career for a person when that person specializes in one specific subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic fields .
As i write this essay , I would like to explain to the readers why specializing in a certain field is a good idea .

Eventhough it is important to have wide range of knowledges , it would be pointless if you do not know how to use them wisely .
Your knowledge from different fields could spread out all over the place and lead you to nothing .
That is the last thing you would like it to happen .

For example , learning different kinds of languages .
You know basic greetings and could understand typical everyday conversations in five different languages might make you feel smart .
However , you would not be able to do businness in those languages because you do not have enough knowledge of that language .
In other words , you can not have a carreer using those knowledges .

In conclusion , I would like to strongly state that to be specialized in one specific subject would help lead you to have a successful carreer .
In other words , a brighter future .
The more knowledge you have , the better .
However , the important point here is how you are going to use that knowledge in your life .
