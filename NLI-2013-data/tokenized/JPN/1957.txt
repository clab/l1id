People often think that young people tend to enjoy life more than older people do .
I personaly disagree with this statement .
I strongly believe , as I myself get older , older people enjoy life more than younger people because of the difference in experience time the one has spent .

First , old people tend to live selective life from their experience .
Although this seems not very exciting , as younger people always looks so , the scale of `` enjoying life '' is way higher .
For example , I often go to hot springs with my wife for vacation .
I never thought of going to just take a bath taking hours of time in a car to reach the location when I was in teenage .
But after all the experience that I visited several hot springs , I know the wellness of it .
Now I know it is very relaxing and comfortable to just be there , I never offend using my time for transportation to that location .
As I saw the hot spring for the first time , it was very exciting but never felt that it was enjoyable .
Since I have more experience , with hot springs , I choose to go there rather than the situation I happened to be there .
I feel that I am selecting choices of events based on the experience how well you can enjoy .

For the younger people , as I recall my younger age , they often look joyful only by the excitement from the first or rare experience of events .
I was enjoying very much playing with my TV games , 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , straight .
I was excited to become better at the games and talk about it in schools , at that time .
After all that excitement and experience , I never play TV games .
Now I choose not to do whatever will not my life better in terms of living life .
I learned from the full-time game player experience .
Now I am confident in spending my time for goods of myself .

In conclusion , as I pointed out above , I totally believe that old people enjoy life more than younger people do .
I definitely think that I am selecting what is good for my life and I am enjoying my life a lot better than my younger ages .
