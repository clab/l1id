I disagree this idea that young people nowadays do not help communities .
I support this idea for specific reason .

I wathed TV proglam last week , and that proglam is about volunteer activity .
I saw many college students were doing volunteer on TV .
The students support elderly people .
These elderly people experienced World War 2 , and the students want to listen these elderly 's talk about war they have never experienced before .
By making good relationship with these elderly , the young people try to understand their sadness , and they try to find the meaning of peace .
They said , `` We do n't know war , and we feel we are living in peaceful country , but there are still many wars around the world , and people killing , and dying more and more ..
We think young people should learn from war-experienced people more than text book . ''

I 'm also belong volunteer club which is teaching Japanese to foreigners .
Many of them are kids , and they came Japan because their parents came Japan to find thier job .
In Japan , salary is much higher than developping country .
Of course they can not speak japanese , so their children can not keep up with japanese students .
Even more , they often teased and descriminated by their friends .
They need help .

Abouv all , young people
