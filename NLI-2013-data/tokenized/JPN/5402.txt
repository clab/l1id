I agree with the statement which says that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Although there are some legal rules for advertisements to prevent it from being advertized with wrong information , there still are some problems .

For example , when you were to do online shopping , you can easily find some products which are advertized completely different from they actually are .
Once I bought a necklace online from a store in other country and when I received it , I was very surprised how different it was from what I thought from the website advertisement .
I am sure that many other people must have experienced this kind of situation .
I think this online shopping example clearly shows that many products are overly advertised to seem much better than actual product .
When you do the online shopping , all you depend on is their advertisement and maybe its picture .
Sometimes pictures show only the good angle of the product which attracts buyers .

Even the advertisement on TV have the same problem sometimes .
TV advertisements for food products are one of the example .
Usually , when they advertise about their food products , they would not say the food does not taste good or they are ok to eat .
They always have to show that the food product tastes very good .
You see a advertisement of a food product and you expect it to taste good from the impression of the TV commercial but sometimes when you actually eat the food product , you think ' It does not taste as good as I thought !! '
.
I think it shows the fact that those advertisement on TV makes the products seem much better than they are often times .

It would not be an advertisement if it makes you an impression that the product is not good , but I think that they should at least not let the buyers to surprise a lot .
They should either produce better products or not to advertise them at all .
