The good way of the group travelling with a tour guide is that the group touring is makes travel funny .
We can meet many people who have n't meet yet , and we can also be friends .
And if I have tour group we can talk each other about place we went and could discuss about it .

Also if I go to truvel with a tour guide she will teach us about good place , good restaurant , and lots of other things .
It might be very good things for us .
Thats because if that place we travel is unknown country , we do n't know where is here and also we ca n't speak language .
When that happen if we have a tour guide , she will set up all thing that we need for us and surely she will presentate place where we travel correctly and truely .

The good way of travelling yourself is that you can go to anywhere you want , but if I go to travel with group it might not be true .
Example , if I want to go to Dysney Land , but the tour guide said we will go to Univertial Studio so you should follow them .

My think is not agree , but not disagree .
That means I think you can choose group travelling or yourself travelling in the stuation like if you want travel with many people , you can go with group .
When you want travel all around freedom , you can go to travel yourself .
