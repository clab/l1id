In the modern society , things have changed dramatically every day , company owners or executives at companies who should categorized to be a successful people should pursue new things all the time to understand what customers need and where the current trend goes .

I have been working as a personal assistant to the president for a Japanese company at the moment .
He has started the company and told me that he went through so many hardships until he made the company successful .
He mentioned that there are nothing you can gain if you do n't take any risks .
Obviously , becoming successful involves a lot of risks to take .

I believe that if you keep doing the same thing all the time , you feel comfortable and confident what you are doing but you do not gain anything much .
Especially in the business world , if you stick to old idea all the time because you are afraid of changing , you could not expect to grow your business .

If you like to become a successful business person , you have to read a lot of books to get wide range of knowledge , to try a lot of new things to keep yourself interested in something .
New things which keep yourself being interested in do not have to be always business or politics but music or sports .
By doing do , you can make a conversation to anyone such as your staff or your childre at any age and gender without feeling a barrier .
After pursueing new things , some of them ended up becoming your hobby and your hobby brings some friends to share your common interest .

I believe that people who is willing to challenge new things without worrying too much of taking some risks tend to be succesful because they tend to have positive attitude toward everything in their live that they are dealing with , while people who tend to stick to one thing that they are doing fine tend to be stable financially but never be successful .
