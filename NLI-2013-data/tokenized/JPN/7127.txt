For this question , I would like to say that the quantity of cars in the world will be greater than what we have in these days .
The reasons why I think this way are based on three alternative reasons which we will see in close future -- economic power transition , improving our technology and As a primary reason , The transition of economic power is strongly arguable .
As we can see on the news , the economic power has been changing to many places where there were not much power last century .
For example , when it comes to transition of ecomomic power , we can not get rid of the image that China has found in last few years .
According to a statistics , China will have been getting much more economical power and will be considered as the most economically powerful country in the world by 2010 .
Not to mention , the population in China is well known as the biggest one in the world .
Also , many people of them are still considered as lower class people which can mean they have no transporter by themselves .
In next , twenty years , it is clear that those people can afford to buy a car , at least , they will be dreaming about owning their cars for sure .

As another reason , the cost to make a car will be fewerd in next decades .
As our techniques are considerably developing in our society , the cost will and time will be decreased .
Moreover , it is possible to think that human beings no longer require to make a car .
All roles can be done by robots or remote controlers .

Surey , some people might doubt abour the fossil energies that we have because of its limitation .
Solving the problem seems to be uneasy ; however , in many ways , we have already accomplished to substitute some other natural energies such as solar system or electric motors .
Those are much cheaper than fueling our gage with gas , more importantly , those energies are considerably good with our earth .

In conclusion , as long as recent economical transition and world technology we have are existed , I assume the quantity of cars in the world will be greater than what it is now .
