I agree with this idea .
Because , I think for be successful people They need have confidence themself decision and think .
So , I think if , people who scared of risk or do n't want to take risk .
That kind person ca n't be successful people .
Because , I think this word is realistic and useful for this world `` No risk No return . ''
`` High risk High return . ''

Successful people they have confidence themselves .
So , they can creat new thing and they can try to new thing .
If people do n't have confidence themselves , they ca n't creat anything .
how they even can try new thing .
That mean is they even can take a risk .

If , people feel satisfy and they tend to defence itself about sociallity position and money .
According that word `` No risk No return '' I think they just will lose money and position .
If people feel satisfaction about their potision and money , they do n't want do anything without difende themselves .
People gearn money from their move .
Even smart people or people who do n't have any creer and skills , they ca n't earn money without move .
So , simply People who only do defence , they ca n't earn money .
Although , they need money for defence themselves .
