I disagree with the idea that young generation do n't have enough time to helping their communities for the following reasons .
First reason is that almost all schools have a class which give students to do some volunteer activity these days in Japan .
When I was in the senior high school , I took the class of volunteer work once a week .
In this class , students picked up garvages on the road , playing with children who has mental illnes , and joined to social events , for example , festivals of our town .
Through my high school days , I could learn spirit of welfare , and it made me to help my community more easily .

Second reason is that young people have many opportunities to help old people nowadays .
Because of tendency to becoming aging-society , there are a lot of people who are aged in Japan .
If we go out , we may face the situation that we must help old people at least once in a day .
For example , I help to carring a lagguage of old lady at stairs of station every morning , and give them a seat on the train .
Moreover , sometimes I go to neighbor 's house to talk with old lady who live alone in order to erace her loneliness .

Thus , there are many opportunities for young people to contribute their society in many ways , and this opportunity are going to increase as aging-society will be advances .
