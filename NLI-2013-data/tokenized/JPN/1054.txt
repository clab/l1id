I agree with this statement .
I think it is important to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .
It is because we need broad knowledge for all works , lefe and etcetra .
I think that specializing on one specific subject are based on the broad knowledge .

First , for example , we think of economist .
Truely , they are supecialized in the economic subject .
But , they have a lot of knowledge broadly .
It is because economists need to have various knowledge to think of economy .
For instance .
on thinking about economic plan with another county , they need the knowlwdge of the histry , relationship and some other about that coutry .

Second , in our life we need broad knowlege , too .
For example , when we read the newspaper , ther are so much imformation of many things .
If we do not have braod knowledge , I think I cannot understand the almost of the news .
It is because today 's news are made of the histrical things , geografy things and so on .
So we need broad knowledge to understand today 's things .

From these two points , I think it is impottant to have broad knowlege of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
