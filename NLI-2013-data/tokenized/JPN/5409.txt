I agree that the majority of advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are .
However , they are made to seem much better than the actual product for several reasons ; to have consumers , to have good reputation for the prodcut , and to earn profit .

The advertisements , especially those which people have interested in , are made in an attempt to get attention of as many people as possible .
Therefore , it makes the products seem better than it actually is .
For example , an advertisements for reducing weight .

If the advertisements were not made to be for selling , meaning if it only stated actual facts , the consumers will not even thing about buying them .
Because the advertisements make the product seem like a magical , the consumers will buy the prodcuct , profitting the company .

Companies which makes that products have people who they must pay .
In order to give employees payments , the companies must have consumers to consume their products .
In order for consumers to consume their products , the companies must have good advertisement , appealing to the consumers .
This is why most advertisements make products better than th
