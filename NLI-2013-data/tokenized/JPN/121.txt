I agree with this statement .
Young man nowadays tend to do only their private things , including playing sports , or studying .
I feel that they should give more time to helping their communities .
This practice will lead more people to be related with their communities .

In these days , the relationships between individual and communities , from fammilies to the city or the town where they live , become lesser and lesser .
This situation might lead some problems , such as , the collapse of the fammilies and the increase of the crimes .
For example , in these ten years , we saw a lot of dangerous crimes which were occured by childrens were happened quite frequently .
For example , about seven years ago , some fourteen years old boy killed seven people included five-year old girl , in Japan .
Not only the case of Japan , in the United States , a boy who had a gun occupied the school and some students were injured .
This kinds of serious crimes are happened all over the world .

I think we should change this situation , which people are isolated indivudually against their community , and that will prevent young people 's crimes .
So I will reccomend two resolutions to resolve the problem .
First , we should make young people to help their communities through their school life .
For example , we will make some agreement that school boys and girls should go to some places as volunteers .
Through this experience , they will know they have a responsibilities to their communities , and even though they are still young , they could help other person .
Secondly the adult people should lead young people as a model .
Infact , in these days even adults do not help their communities , so before they will say to the young people , they should refine themselves .

However , some people might argue that today 's young people does not have enough time to spend for their communities , because they are too busy for their private matters .
Like in Japan , children should study hard to get into the good universtiy , and get the good jobs , so they usually go to the private school , in addition to the normal schools .
This kind of situation will make them difficult to help their communities .
So to this problem , I want to say that we , adults , should change our social structure and this school-oriented society .

I can understand the problem which the young people have , but I hope they will change their attiude and we , adults and young people , will live peacefully in the future .
