Today , many older people tend to travel all around the world , live in abroad , enjoy their hobbies , going to older people 's school for talking and playing with same age people after retiring their jobs .
Thus , I disagree with this statement `` Youn people enjoy life more than older people do . ''

Many travel companies tend to make travel plans and long-stay in abroad plans for only older people these days .
For example , my parents are thinking of traveling all around the world and living in abroad to relax and enjoy their rest of life after retiring their jobs .
My university teacher has been talking same kind of things .
In addition , I know some older people who live in abroad .
I agree with their thinking because they have worked very hard and have not seen the whole world .
Older people can have a lot of free time to enjoy their hobbies .
They do not need to care about time .

Thinking about young people , they also have free time when they are students .
During going to school , they can travel , study about their interests , stick to their hobbies .
However , after graduating school , they need to work and they have much less free time .

Thus , I think older people enjoy life same as young people do .
Or might enjoy more than young people becuase they do not need to anything .
In my opinion , I would like to enjoy retired life , but I would like to enjoy more when I am young .
This is because to get a job which i want to do , and to get a happy life , i need to see the world by own my eyes .
Traveling around the world is very fun to me , and this would also benefit my future .
By the way , I really hope that my parents would have very enjoyable life after retire .
