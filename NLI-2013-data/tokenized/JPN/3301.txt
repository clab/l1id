I agree this opinion .
I have three reasons about this .
First , the age of communities is growing up .
There are usually many older people in the communities with enlonging the mean age .
Older people have many witness , skills and cultures , so young people have to absorb it to heridate the new generation .
Indeed Young people are difficult talk with older people because the interested thing are quites different .
We have to get those things .

Second , it is safty to protect our communities themselves .
The ratio of damaging by the thives could decrese with power of protecting themselves .
In fact , it is possible to decrese it by walking around the communities at night .
We are be too careful to close at doors and windows as possible as we can , but thieves are often appears .
It is necessary to prevent from invading thieves with communities powers .

Finally , humans live with groups .
We cannot live alone .
While young age , it is little opportunities to be helped by other people .
If they need , they take a telepone some friends at long distance .
They get not helps but opinions , we can put it off .
