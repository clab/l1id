Nowadays , many people go traveling to many different countries .
Tourism is getting popular in every countries .
Some people go traveling using well-planned tour with a tour guide .
Other do n't .
I prefer to going traveling alone to going traveling in a group with a tour guide .
First , it is difficult to go somewhere that I want if the tour is well-planned by a tour guide .
In my case , I would like to stay as long as possible if my feel is good in special place .
In contrast , if I feel unconfatable to stay in one place , I would like to leave soon .
However , if many people are in the tour , it is difficult to change the plan .
Those things make me unconfatable .

Second , meeting many local people and other travellers is one of favorite things for me in my trip .
If I travel alone , I can meet many people .
However , if I belong to the group of the tour , the chance of meeting local people or travellars will decrease .
Comunication using local language gives me more excelent experience .

Third , getting more exciting and adventuous things is my favorite part for travelling .
Even though it is difficult to find my distination , I feel that I am traveling now while finding my direction .
Actually , I have to dicide everything for the trip .
Yet I like to prepare everything before I go travelling .
Moreover , looking for the history by myself before the trip is important to plan the trip interestying .
If people use the tour , they tend not to looking for the information about the country that they go .

In conclusion , going travel by myself makes me more excited than going travel in a group by a well-planned tour .
In addition , my maturity will get better through meeting many interesting people who live in different countries and deciding everything by myself .
As a result , I usually go traveling by myself .
