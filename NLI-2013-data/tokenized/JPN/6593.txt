The statement says that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , in twenty years .
However , I do not think that the number of cars will decrease in twenty years .
I have two reasons to support my opinion .

First , cars are the most convenient vehicle we have ever had to move wherever we want to go .
For example , most places on the earth cannot be reached only by other means such as trains , airplanes , or by foot .
I imagine that globalization will have spread more in twenty years , which means that people will move more actively than they do now .
When pople move more actively , cars must be the most convenient tool to satisfy their desire to move .
Furthermore , if more cars are produced , the price of cars will decrease , which results in more people to be able to afford cars .
When considering the world population will get enhanced in twenty years , I am convinced that more people will posses cars than now .
Thus , there is no chance to think about the decrease in the number of cars in use .

Secondly , there are hundreds of car manufacturers in the world .
I do not think they will reduce their number of products , because their profit may decrease by doing so .
Manufacturers are good at marketing and catching consumers ' needs in the first place .
Naturally so are car manufacturers .
The world concern may be inclined to eco-friendly system in twenty years , but I am sure that car manufacturers will create those cars which match the needs of consumers and of the earth in twenty years as well as they do now .
Additionally , there have never been periods when the number of cars decreased so far .
Therefore , it is likely that this trend will continue , as long as car manufacturers desire to produce many cars under the support of appropriate marketing .

In conclusion , because of these two reasons cited above , I disagree the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are now today .
