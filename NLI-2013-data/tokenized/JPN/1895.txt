I agree with young people enjoy life more than older people do becouse there are two main points of my view about agreement .
These are that young people enjoy their life in technological way and social way .

First of all , recently , the technology wich surround our life astonishingly immproved a lot .
Several decade ago , noone could imagin how the technology develop like now generation .
Older people 's activity was limitted due to unsufficient technology of their lives .
Back in their day , they had to use old style technology to accomplish their purposes , in contrust , it was n't efficient .
It took more time and energy than now .
It mean , older people 's enjoyable time was robbed by efforting .
On the other hand , new technology has very high quality .
It succeeded cutting off wasty time to do something compare with older people did .
So , younger people can afford to having a good time as spending the time to their hobby and thing witch they has interest .

Secondly , by using a high technology , the sociaty of younger people is expanded its range .
Now , there are a lot of ways to communicate with unknown people like internet , cell phone , and some sort of book .
We have many oppotunities to know each other and to make a new friendship with new people .
To know new people , we can shear the time and our thought .
It probably more enjoyable for young people .
However , older people could n't do that becouse as I mantioned before , there is no way to accomplish this method at the age .
