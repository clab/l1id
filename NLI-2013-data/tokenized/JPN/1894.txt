I agree with the statement that , young people enjoy life more that older people do .
There are 3 reasons why I agree with that opinion .
First of all , for young people most of the things they experience are new and they facinate young people .
Young people have curiosity and it motivates them to do things and try many things .
I believe that trying to do something is essential for my life and it is the best way to enjoy my life .
However elderly people know what is interesting and what is not , and they easily give up trying .

Secondly , young people often worry .
They worry about their future , love , relationship between their friends or family and so on .
While they are worrying about these things there are lots of talking , laughing and crying and that makes people grow up .
Young people often have more dificulties than elderly people do , and it is because taht young people have less knowledge .
But I do not think having less knowledge for life experience is bad thing .
It also can motivate people .
Usually , older peoople use their knowledge of their experience and avoid having difficulty and chose easier way .
It is not an interesting thing for me at all .

Third reason is concerned about physical problems .
When people get older , that is natural that you have more physical problems that you used to when you were young .
Physical and phycology effect each other , so when older people get physical pain , they might be nervouse and do not feel like doing anything .
Actually , my grand mother used to play golf untill about she was 55 , but since she got a pain on her knee , she stopped playing golf and the more , she stopped going outside .
I was very sad I saw her always sitting on a chair and watching TV .
But young people have much less physical problems so that we can try anything we want to .

Young people are hopefull and have lots of energy .
When you get older and reflect yourself for not to do anything you wanted to , is what I hate the most .
Challenging is the best thing to satisfy your life .

For those reasons I believe that young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
