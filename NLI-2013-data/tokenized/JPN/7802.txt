There are a lot of people travelling on vacation .
Some people go to abroad while some people travel in the country .
They either travel individually or in a group led by a tour guide .
For my opinion , I think it is better to travel with a tour guide because it is more convenient , economical and safe .

To start with , when travelling to the place we do not know individually not using the tour guide , we may wonder where to go and what to do .
Also , we have to check the airplane or bus we have to ride , check the weather and so on .
On the other hand , if we just go to the tour guide shop tell where they want to go , the touris would kindly introduce us a perfect plan .
They would probably plan to go to several popular places and prepare traditional food .
Therefore , being in a group led by a tour guide is very convenient and easy when we are travelling .

Moreover , the more people we travel with , the less we have to pay individually .
The tour guide plan includes the fee of staying , trabelling , food and so on .
Since they move with a group , all the things will be chaper than travelling individually .
For example , the Tokyo Disney Land costs more than 5000 yen in dividually .
If we go as a group , however , costs only 3000 yen .
It is more economical to be in a group .
Also , we may get friends if we travel in a group .
It will be more exciting and fun if we make friends and enjoy the trip .

Lastly , it is much safe to travel with a lot of people instead of travelling alone .
Also , the tour guide knows about the place and know what to do on emergencies .
We would feel more camfortable if we travel with many people , too .

To conclude , travelling in a group led b a tour guide is the best way .
It is convenient because we do not have to plan the trip .
Also , it would be very cheap but safe if we travel with a lot of people .
It is the best idea to rely on the tour guide and have a relaxing travel .
