I disagree with the statement that students to understand facts rather than ideas and concepts tThere are two reasons for this statements : time and knowridge .
The first reason why it is more important to students to learn facts lather than ideas and concepts is that they can learn wide variety of knowridge .
This way students get more knowridge .

The second reason why it is more veneficial to students to learn facts lather than ideas and statement is time .
Students can use the time more usefull .
If student understand ideas and concept for each facts , they have to spend so much time and energy .
For instance , when I was elementary school , I learned mathmatics formura without concept .
In order to remember all the formuras , the teacher gave us a song for the formura .
Thus , we can easily remember this formura without spent exstra enersy and time. , and it is still usefull to me .

I disagree with the statement that students to understand ideas and concepts than facts , because students to can use time usefull and get more knowridge .
