In Japan , which is my home country , some people may prefer a travel in a group led by a tour guide .
However personally , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

First , a group travel led by a tour guide prevents me from visiting places under my own decisions and interests .
For example , when I went to China in 1995 , I chose a group travel because Chinese travel industry was not matured in this time and then I had to pay more cost for a self travel by time consuming procedures like a visa premission than I did in a group travel .
However , I missed visiting most interested place in China , a Great wall by the unexpected change of tour schedule .

Second , a group travel led by a tour guide allows me not to study about the place by myself .
For instance , When I went to Spain with my wife , a tour guide provided us with much information about the place .
However , because tour guide allowed us only to listen his explanations , my wife and I forgot almost all information which he gave .
On the other hand , I went to Thailand by myself in my college days .
I prepared for the travel by reading many books related to the country .
As a result of self preparation , I could enjoy whole travel .
Furtheremore , I can learn much information by heart because of self efforts .

Of course , there are some advantages in traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
For instance , in a group travel , I can enjoy a travel more safer than in a self travel .
I have bad experience that I was robbed my belongings in Italy because I walked downtown in midnight alone .
I believe that I could avoid such a dangerous accidents by a group travel .
However totally , on my opinion , a self travel 's benefits are not outweighed by those of a group travel .

Therefore , for the reasons mentioned above , I completely disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
