We all hope that we want to enjoy our lives .
Then this question comes to my mind , which enjoy life more , young people or older people ?
I think young people enjoy life more than older people .
There are three reasons .
First , young people have healthier bodies than older people do .
Second , they have longer time in rest of their lives than the older people do .
Third , older people tend to say that the younger the better .

First of all , young people have healthier and stronger body than older people do .
They can continue to work longer , run faster , need shorter time to sleep , and so on than the old people do .
That means young peopel can enjoy what the old people can not do .
For example , they can swim in the mornig , go out for lunch , go shopping , and have party with their friends .

Second , they have longer time remained in their lives than the old people do .
If you want to be a very good and famous doctor , it will take about ten years to attend medical school and get enough experience as a doctor .
Young people can plan and achieve this aime because they have time .
However , old people may not beacuse they only have limited time in rest of their lives .

Finally , I often hear old people say that the younger the better .
I am still young and can only imagine how the lives of old people .
The old people , however , experienced life of young people already and say the younger the better comparing their lives to the ones when they were young .

To conclude .
I believe young people enjoy life more than old people .
They have strong body to do anything they want while old people have limitations because of their health problems .
Also , young people have longer time to do anything .
In addition , old people admit that the younger the better .
I strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than old people .
Actually , I think , that means young people have to challenge anything they want and have to enjoy their lives to the max .
