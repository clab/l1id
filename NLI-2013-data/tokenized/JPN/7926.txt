I prefore to travel with a tour guide exspecially we go to some country and also that is a first time to go there .
When we go to some country , we have to speak their language .
If we go by ourselve , we have to make a resavation for hotels , and also it 's hard to read and understand the menu in a restaurant .
When I went to Korea with my friends , we did n't join a tour .
We had some guide books that showed famous restaurants and places in Korea .
When we went to a restaurant , the menu was written in Hongle , not even in English .
We could n't read them , so we just point out the menu when they took orders .
The food was n't that we expected .

We can learn more things from a tour guide when you go to some historical places .
The tour guides know so many things .
There are some guide book to lean those histories but sometimes there are not enough to us , and also the books could n't answer the questions when we have some questions about which we visit .
We get more explaination from the guides .

Sometimes , the guide take us a local restaurant or store where local people usually go .
When I went to France with a small group of people with a tour guide , the guide took us the restaurant where he usually goes .
The food was cheap and really good .
And the other day , he took us to a little town in the countly-side of France .
It did n't show in any guide books .
There are some winaries and stores .
We had a really nice time in France .
