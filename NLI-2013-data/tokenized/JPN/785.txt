While some think that it is better to learn many academic subject , others believe that it is better to major in only one specific subject .
I prefer the latter idea , specializing in one tipical subject , for three reasons .

At first , I think that people who majored in one specific subject such as law and medics are able to earn a lot of money .
For example , in Japan , lawyer and doctor are high-classed professionals and can earn much money .
To the contrary , people who do not have deep knowledge of specific subject cannot earn a lot of money .
To tell the truth , I am a officer of National Tax Agency in Japan and possess broad knowledge about tax especially cooporate tax , so I can earn 100000 dollers per year owe to my knowledge .

Second , the reason why I prefer to specializing in one special subject is that students can enjoy their university life .
If they learn a lot of academic subjects such as economics , history and mathematics , they have little time to use freely .
On the other hand , students who study only one specific subject hard can possess a lot of time , so they can do sports or enjoy their academic life .

Thirdly , I think that students can be interesting in studying if they learn one academic subject hardly .
In general , people tend to be interesting the subject as they study more hard and deeper .
Thus , I think that they will be taste the jo about studying .

Therefore , for these reasons I insist that it is better to study only one specific subject than to learn many academic subject .
Through my experiences , I enjoyed my college life and am be able to earn a lot of money because I studied only about tax .
