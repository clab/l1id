I 'm agree for the statement above .
because if you can study wide range of subject rather then to stick on to specific subject , your knowlege be wider and more accurate then others .
I 'm actually currently taking course simmier as the first year of university students should study .
Soon i will finish the semister A which was just only included core subject and sub subject for those who had n't got good grade on the past ppublic exam .
but student have choices in the semister B. although student got to take core subject as well as who were taking sub subject need to contitunely taking it but also can chose two subject from elective .
when I was in high school , student just allowed to choose either bussiness or science way .
every year one or two student were taking half bussiness and scince stream subject .
for those did that in F.6 which had public exam .
the needed subject are crashing date , time at different location .
according to that some subject been missed out , so need to repeat exam or repeat the course .
and yea had n't much choice for subject at there .
Although now im needed to follow taking core subject , but i have hope for the semister b by thinking of taking the subject i like .
which was i wanted to take experience on it since I was at middle school .
beside of taking other elective , I decided to take bussiness too .
Because I thought i can learn more about the bussiness and i belive i can understand it more and can learn different method from different teacher .
why i 'm saying that because im currently at the local school which i 've never had expericed of it , because i was studying in japanese school or international school in the past .
i 'm beliving my self that now i have much more knowlege then in the past .
i can say this to my fellow and my younger frineds , that if you guys have wide range of subject then i will encourage you to take it as much as it can , this will surely give you positive way of your style .
I 'm saying that , this i had the word from my private teacher which was `` your now a these days and the experience you had it in the really hard situation this wi ''
