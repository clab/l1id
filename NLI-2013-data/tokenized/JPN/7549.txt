I agree this idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are two reasons : relieved and expart of the guide .
To the beginning , i 'm relieved when a tour guide leads us .
Because she knows everythingFor example , I travel to a foreign country .
If I can not communicate in English and not mother language , I worry about it .
I may not to able to listen guide and not to see the direction .
Then I may get lost .
In my case , I traveled in London alone .
I have a map and book which is written the details about that city .
I walked around the city while I look the book .
But I got lost .
I was so nervous because I could not find that there were no japanese and people who could speak in Japanese .
Then I thought .
If I belongs to a tour group by a tour guide , I did n't get lost .

Next and the last , a tour guide is expart of introducing .
Because She or he know the imformation better than ordinary people .
For instance , in this case , it is also a foreign country .
Last summer , I went to Italy in a group led by a tour guide .
This is my first time to visit Italy and also the first time to travel led by a tour guide .
I wanted to visit various place , so I often asked a tour guide like this .
Where should I go in order to eat dinner to cheep restaurant ??
or Which place is the best to go to the church ??
A tour guide always told me .
And also she told us the history of the city , country .
furthermore she showed us the secret place where it is not written in the book .
I felt it was happy to know .

For those reason , I agree this idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
