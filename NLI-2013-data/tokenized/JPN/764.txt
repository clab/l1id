I agree with the opinion to specialize in one specific subject .
And I will tell you about the reason why I think so .
At first , recently academic subjects is developing rapidly , and unless you have a deep knowledge about the subject you learn , you ca n't understand anything about that .
Before twenty century , the field of academic was not broad and not vast , so many specialist could learn many fields , but now we ca n't .

Second , the person who is the expert in one specific subject will get a lot of award .
For example , Nobel Prize will hand in the specialist of one region like medical , piece , chemistry , physics and so on .

Though this is an extreme example , if one person would know any sperficial knowledge of any subject , the person wo n't get the Nobel Prize .
At last , learning broad knowledge of many academic subjects is very difficult .
As the matter of fact , there is a `` liberal arts '' in the university of the US , and university student is trying to study a lot of broad knowledge .
But completing `` liberal arts '' is very difficult in four year .

Sometimes studying makes some university students exhausted .
So studying only one subject deeply is the good way for university students .
Alhough I explain how bad studying broad knowledge is , there is one good point to study `` liberal arts '' .
If you know a lot of knowledge outside your speciality , sometimes you can get some ideas for your speciality .
Because there are a lot of similarity between the subject to subject , you can be easy to hit the idea if you are trouble to write a paper or something else .

In the conclusion , If you have a much time to study in your life , studying `` liberal arts '' at first and then studying your speciality will be the best way to complete your way of academics .
