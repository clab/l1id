I really like to travel around the world .
I can see a beautiful place taht I have ever seen and have a lot of valuable experiences .
There are many kinds of styles when we go traveling .
I can not agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons .

To begin with , the way of traveling in a group led by a tour guide has less time that we can spend free .
Most of these trips have very tight schedule .
We have to see the famous place more quickly and we can not choose the gift for our friends or parents slowly .
In my opinion , traveling should be more flexible and reluxing .

In addition , the way of traveling in a group led by a tour guide has little chance to happening .
I think that happning is very important factor to enjoy trip .
When I went to Italy with my friend , I meet one Italian chef in a bus by chance .
We enjoyed talking and then we can eat Italian foods in his house .
It was very delicious .

In conclusion , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
