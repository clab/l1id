For the following reasons , I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

First , using cars will be more convenient in twenty years .
For example , when I was a university student at a HItotsubashi University in 1995 , I went to Hokkaido , which has many natural parks in Japan , by my friend Ken 's car .
Because the car had no car navigation systems , which showed the map where we were automatically , Ken and I had a trouble to find the road we should go .
However , now most cars in Japan has car navigation systems .
We come to know the road easily .
Although now we are not able to see the map about all over Japan , in the twenty years we will be able to see it .
Using cars will be clearly more convenient in twenty years .

Second , a lot of more safety cars will be made in twenty years .
For example , now in Japan , where I live , there are more than ten thousand traffic accidents annually .
Last year , one of my cousins , Kumiko , who was six years old , came across a traffic accident and because she ran into the road in order to catch a ball she dropped .
The car driver , Mr. Suzuki was not able to stop immediately when he found her because it was suddenly .
If the car coule have stopped automatically , he coule have avoid the accident .
Now I hear the news that car company are trying to make safety cars that can stop immediately when someone or something suddenly appear in front of the cars .
I believe these cars will be made and used in twenty years because we will not have to be anxious about traffic accidents .
A lot of more safety cars will be definitely made in twenty years .

Therefore , I strongly disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
