I disagree with the statement that `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' When people were young , they have a lot of dreams .
`` I wanna be an astronamer , a teacher , a musician , a painter '' , and so on .
They have a lot of dreams .
so , they make effort , compete with others .
In that age , they have no idea to die , even though commit suicide .
Their life is fullfilled with joy , delight , hope , or the future .

For financial ground , they have not to feed their child ( of couse , they have no child ! ) , they have not to cook , they have not to , they have not to , ...
they can only do what they want !!

When they get adult , they must work .
This is the most important , and relactant thing .
People say `` Enjoy working '' , but they say that because they have no way out from boring life .

Get old means know what who do not want to .
so , I agree the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do ''

thanks for TOEFL iBT !
