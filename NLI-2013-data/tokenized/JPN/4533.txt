I agree with the statement .
I think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The companies often mislead the customers by putting exceptions in very small prints , by over exaggerating , and by using famous actors and athletes in their advertisements .

First of all , when I pay close attentions to advertisements , I often see advertisements with very small prints at the bottom that are hard to see .
Those prints states exceptions .
For example , the advertisement may say , `` 80 % of people lose weight by using this product ! ''
However , I may see a print at the bottom that says , `` this is not based on scientific data . ''
This is just one type of the `` exceptions '' that most people do n't catch .

Additionally , the companies use catch phrases all the time to attract customers .
They often exaggerate too much .
For example , the advertisement of pills losing weight might say , `` Do n't you want to look like a model ?
By taking this pill , you can become really skinny easily like top models ! ''
Do n't you think this catch phrase is a bit awkward ?
Pills do not make you look like a super model .
It exggerates way too much .

Moreover , the companies often use famous actors , actresses , or athletes in their advertisements .
For example , sports companies , such as Nike , Adidas , or Puma , might use Micheal Jordan when advertising for basketball shoes .
Cosmetic companies often use beautiful actresses .
The costomers assume that the actress uses that product and buy that product .
Also , in advertising for medicines , they companies use doctors and nurses who seem to know what they are talking about .
By using professionals of each area , the companies are able to convince more customers .
Doctors are much convincing when talking about medicines rather than having some random shop keepers talking about the topic even if they were saying same things .

To summerize , I agree with the statement , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The companies often mislead the customers by putting exceptions in very small prints , by over exaggerating , and by using famous actors , athletes , and professionals in their advertisements .
However , you cannot just blame the companies .
To sell products and compete with other companies , that is one of the most important strategies .
Thus , you must be very careful in seeing the advertisements .
