I agree with what the article says .
Some people think understand ideas and concepts is important for students , and some people think lern facts is important for students .
However , from the fact of national survey and my own experience , I think understand ideas and concepts is more important for students .

First off , I agree with the article because national survey says some countries which teach ideas and concepts to students in math , and history class usually have ranked in high educated countries in the wold .
According to the article , in some countries , such as Greenland and Honkong , which teach students ideas and concepts , adults usually have great insight and memory about what they studied when they were in high schools .
However , some countries , which tend to teach student just fact , adults usually do n't remember what they studied when they were in high schools .

Second , I agree with what the article says because if people study just facts , they ca n't apply what they studied in daily life .
People are studyng to make them knowledgble .
Since , I 'm from Japan , I had an experience to support my opinion .
When I `` m taking a math class in Hong Kong , people usually asked me many question about math .
Even though , i was really good on my math , I could n't answer futher questions of them and they considered I 'm cheating .

In conclusion .
i agree with what the article says because of these reasons .
