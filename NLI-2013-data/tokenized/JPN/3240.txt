I agree with this statement because sometimes when we watch tv we see news which is about people helping their comunities such as cleaning roads or advertising , but most of those people who helps comunity we see is old people .
Why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities are because young people think its the old people 's job or they do not care about their comunities .
Even though They do not help their comunities , some of them complain to their comunities .
I think its just wrong because if they have something to complain to their comunities they should go and complain it and work the problem out with the other comunitiy workers .
Thats the best way to get worked out the problem .
However there are heaps of young people who do not care about their comunities .
They do n't even know who is the leader of their comunitiy or what their comunity working for people , if they know that who cleans roads or park , they would not make a mess on the road .
As we can see , usually the messes on the road were made by young people that means they do n't clean their road and let the other people to clean them .
