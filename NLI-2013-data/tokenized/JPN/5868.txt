In Japan , where I live , many people agree with the idea that cars will reduce in several decades .
For the following reasons , however , I do disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .

First , there will be no sufficient alternatives which reduce the numer of cars in twenty years .
For example , sophiscated train systems can be alternatives for cars , but to construct such train systems in the whole world is impossible .
I live in a rural area in Japan , where there is no railway .
Since the number of population is not large and the cost perfomance of building railroads is not good , nobody plans to introduce a train system .
There are many areas in the world such as my town in the world , where the number of population is raising rapidly .
This population growth will result in an incereasing number of cars .
This example strongly shows that there will be no alternatives which reduce the numer of cars in twenty years .

Second , cars are very convinient for people to move something or theirselvers , so that people keep using cars in the future .
For example , people often use cars to move heavy luggage .
By the way , people tend to live longer , and the number of elder peple is increasing .
The older a person gets , the weaker a person becomes .
This means increasing elder people depends on more cars to move their heavy luggage , even in every day shopping .
The number of elder people in my neighbour who harness cars to carry what they bought in a supermarket is actually increasing and keep utilizing them .
This example definitely demonstrates that cars are very convinient for people to move something or theirselvers , so that people keep using cars in the future .

Therefore , with the reasons and examples I mentioned above , I absolutely disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
I believe that people will use cars in the future , but I wish more ecologic cars would be invented to not pollute the atomosphere of the Earth any more .
