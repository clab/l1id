I disagree the idea that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in Japan , there are following reasons .

First , the way of thinking is verifing now , so car makers should produce many kinds of cars to match the pople 's needs .
Some pople use theircars only when go shopping , others use their cars as a kind of hobby .
they like suport cars , racing cars or off road cars , etc .
Today , a tipical family living in Japan has one car .
But it is said that a tipical family living in Jpan will have two cars in a few years .
one of them will be for the father and the other will be for the mother .
The price of cars has bacome very cheap because of technology development , a tipical family will be able to buy two cars in a few years .

In addion , in Japan , we cannot have second car now because we do n't have enough parking space in our home or we cannot pay the expensive parking fee .
But there days , the Japanese real estates have become cheaper than before .
if this situcation continues , we will be able to have enough parking space in our home or pay enough parking fee in a few years .

At last , in Japan , the goverment improves the railroads and highways by investing a lot of money these days .
Because the public transportation system in Japan has been imploved these thirty years , and then the govermaent now thinks to improve the railroads and highways mainly .
As a resault , the terrible trafic jams in Japan will be resolved in a few years , So the number of Japanese who want to buy and use their car will increase .

So , I totally disagree the ideat that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in Japan .
