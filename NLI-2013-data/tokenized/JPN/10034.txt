I agree with the opinion that people success more often when they try new things and take risks , rather than only doing what they are already farmiliar with .
There are two reasons for this : motivation and chances .

First , when people try something that can be challenging to them , they are motivated .
In fact , they try their best .
When people try their best , they have more chance of succeeding .
However , when people do something that they know how to do well , they do not try their best because they already know what the limit is and what they can do with it .
However , when people try new things , they are motivated to learn more about it .
Also , they do not yet know how far they can go with it , so they are motivated to know whay they can do .

Second , when people try new things , they have more chances to encounter something that is in their interest but did not know the existance of .
What they already know how to do well is probablly something that other people already know and is farmiliar to all of them .
If they take risks , they are more likely to encounter something that is challenging , but is interesting to them at the same time .
If people try things that are uncommon , they are more likely to be succesful because people have not yet explored that territory yet .
People can feel that they are doing something special .

I believe people should take risks and try new things rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
It is challenging to take risks , but taking them leads to success .
People have more chance of encountering something people can be successful on , which brings up their motivation .
