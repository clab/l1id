Personally , I agree to the following statement : It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Many students tend to only memorize the facts and formulas when they study for a test and do not try to go more in depth to understand the meaning behind it .
However , memorization of facts only limits that person 's knowledge .
Although to learn the facts of a particular lesson is very important , a student needs to realize the greater importance of fully understanding the ideas and the concepts .

For example , when a student learns new formulas in his/her math class , usually he/she undergoes a process where the teacher explains how these formulas work .
If the student is only taught to memorize the Pythagorean Theorem , he/she will be missing the important value about the theorem .
It is after the teacher has fully explained on how Pythagoras discovered his theory when the students are able to understand the value and the use of it .
They also will able to understand the `` why '' question .
Without the knowledge of why mathematicians use this formula , many of the students will not be able to distinguish when to use these formulas on a test or on a problem .
This is not only a case in a math class .
In many of the science books , students are taught vast amounts of scientific facts such as friction , gravity , and light .
However , to fully understand what these facts mean , they must understand the concept of it .
It is best for the student to understand why friction occurs and how it happens rather than learning what is is .

By learning facts , the students can learn the concerte , objective portion of the subject .
However , through ideas and concepts , they are able to further learn about other possible solutions and perspectives .
When a student fully understands the knowledge and the concept of it , he/she can use this new knowledge in other fields .
For example , just memorizing the facts of sine , cosine , and tangent formulas does not help the student to answer some of the physics questions about angles of light incident and refraction .

Learning the facts only give shallow knowledges .
When the students understand the ideas and concepts on how scientists and researchers came up with the facts , it means that they are truly learning .
