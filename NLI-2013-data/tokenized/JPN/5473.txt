I do not agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Because I do not want to waste my money I earned to work hard and ask for quolity of products .
Because the products I buy is related to my life .
If goods is worse than they really are , it affect my life .

For example , I often purchase goods such as books or DVD on the internet shop .
However , I sometimes disapear goods I bought because they are so old and dirty .
So , I will not use them for a long time .

When I think of buying electical products , I need durable goods .
So , if advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , I disapear and must change it soon .
The other example , when I bought foods , it is bad taste and too expensive .

If i bought inferior goods , I waste monney I earned .
I work hard everyday so I want to spend my money on my profit .
