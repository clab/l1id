I agree with the statement that `` it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' because students can use their imagination to think out side of box which helps them to think widely and nothing avoid them to think what they feel about it .

First , for example of learning chemistry experiments , from what we call `` experiment '' , students have a right to find out by themselves .
It is more interesting to know from their teacher giveing the anwer to them than have them explore it .

Second , for example of learning history around the world , because not always right thing to learn what happened , sometimes it is better to know what was really behind the scene .
It is good have a knowlege from what teacher from textbook but it is always need extra know ledge to understand what really history means .

Third , for example of learning literature , like read excellent peices from excellent authors which not always that these authors have great lives .
They have good ideas so write good stories .

Most of all , it gives intersting `` for students to undrstand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
They need to know how to flow thier ideas by doing this .
