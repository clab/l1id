In my opinion , most advertisement should not make products seem much better that they really are .
This is because , it will be more confusing , and the consumers will be disappointed .

If the advertisements are much better that real products , it is same as the companies told a lie .
I you bought the products affected by the advertisements , you feel the products are different from the products which were shown by the advertisements .
Therefore , the products actually differ , and the advertisements , in fact the companies , must be fake .

If the avobe situation was happened , what are you going to feel ?
I think probably you get upset .
This is because the products which you bought are worse than the products which were shown by the advertisement .
So you must feel the companies are liers .

I have an example of such situation .
One day , I bought the elextronic souces , and the advertisement of the product showed `` The electronic souces are keeped for 1 year '' .
I looked the sentence before I bought , and also I decided buying it from the sentence .
At first , the electronic souces worked comfortably .
However , about 1 month later , the elecronic souces did not work , it meant the product became empty .
In fact , the product was not keeped for 1 YEAR , it was only keeped for 1 MONTH .
Then , of course I got upset , because the advertisement was a lie .

In conclusion , when the companies make the advertisements , they should not show the product much better than real product , because it is absolutely a lie .
