I definitely disagree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because I know that a lot of young people work for their communities as volunterre .
I would like to offer some examples to support my opinion .

First , there are a large number of students at my university who are interested in helping their communities .
For exmple , when I went to the volunterre meeting at the university a few days ago , although it was still on summer vacation , the meeting room was packed with students who wanted to volunterre .
I was so exited to see and know that the number of students made time for the meeting .
It shows the fact that there are a lot of young studets who are interested in helping their communities and make time for it .

Second , I know that a lot of my freinds are working for volunterre already .
Moreover , at the meeting of this kind , I have seen a lot of young people who join for volunterre including from different universities , locations and backgrounds .
If young people have not given enought time to supporting their communities acitively these days how come I have seen these people ?
Also I know that they are not only suppoting their communities but also they are willing to do it .
They feel more reponsible to the community through the acitivity .
Doing these activities give them a lot of satisfation as a member of communities and society .

For these reasons , I disagree the idea strongly that young people today do not make enought time to helping their communities .
Furthermore , as long as I know , they participate more to help their communities .
