I strongly agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .
While the facts can be basis of analysing and developing ideas , it is more valuable to learn abstruct ideas for students .
There are two reasons to support this arguments .
One is the applicability of concepts , and the other is values of the learning process of ideas .

Firstly , ideas and concepts can stay in students memory and apply in different situation .
In contrust , facts are fixed and forgetable .
For example , I used to learn history in the facts based method and memorised historical events and peopls in details , but after several years I forgot everything which I learned .
If I had chance to think about the reasons or possible solution of the historical events in my head , it would be applicable in my own situation .

Secondary , the process of learning about ideas and concept is the effective way of learning rather than memorising facts .
In this process , students try to understant difficult things and ask themselves critically .
This is very important part of learning and it makes students more intelligent .

In conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts are more significant in the process of learning .
