I agree with the opinion that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
That reasons for bigger interests and friends .
Describing bigger interest , because , I think that you better learn many academic subjects than expert subject .
Fethermore , you can make friends who have several interest .
And more fun and more exiting .
This is all of my reasons .
