I agree to the statement `` Most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are '' .
In an advertisement such as commercials on TV 's and ad 's in magazines , it seem like it is a very attrative product and trying to get people 's attention by their first look .
The company will use backgroung and surroundings , unreal features and famous people to apeal their products .

When I was a little , I used to see commercials advertisement of barbie dolls all the time .
The commericials showed how You could do so many thing with the dolls and how much fun you can have with them .
There were music on the background and a perfect set that the girls played in .
I was absolutley attracted by the commerical and always asked for a new barbie doll .
But when I baught them , it might not move the way it moved in the TV and some of the features showed in the commercial did not come with the product .

Another way they are making the product look better , is by using special features .
For example , I once saw as TV show that showed how they created commercials for food products .
Usually they will not show the real food .
There are proffesionals who make food from clays and plastics to show more texture and better in looks .
They will use sprays to show coldness of drinks and steams to show how hot they are .
They can also create their commercial using computer graphics so that it can look better .

The usage of celebrities has an influence on the viewer also .
Even if the product is not as good as it looks , when it is held or presented by a famous celebrity , you might think that the product is attractive be convined in buying the product .

In an commercial or an advertisement , they will use the background , special features that is unreal , and celebrities to make the product to be apealing .
From these reasons I belive that most of the advertisement are making the pruducts look more attractive than it really is .
