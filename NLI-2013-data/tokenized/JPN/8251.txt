I disagree with the statement .
Because I think ideas and concepts are made by people .
If each of the people lives in different countries , each of ideas and concepts are different even though they think about same thing .

For example , I would like to talk about World War 2 .
My grandfather joind the war as a soldier when he was 20s .
His idea is that the war was made by several countries governments .
The Japanese government is one of them .
My brother said that did the Japanese government start the war when he saw a movie ` Pearl Harvar ' .
He had little doubt it at that time although he had already learned the war at hisory classes for more than ten years ago .
Some Korean friends asked me if I felt guilty for the war and Korean .

All of these ideas are not official statements .
But I am sure many people have same ideas as those people .
They knew about some of the facts .
I think if I understand each of ideas without the facts , it is not real understanding .

When I want to understand some ideas and concepts , I should focus on what the ideas and concepts were caused by .
This is the most important thing for understanding .
