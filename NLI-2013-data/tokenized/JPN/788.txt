I agree with this statement .
I think that the broad knowledge of many academic subjects is important for several experience .
Also , it is useful on the several situation .
First of all , I think that people who have the knowledge about anything are respected by other people .
If the teacher know about not only English but also scientics , when he or she is asked by his or her students , he or she can answer smoothly .
And , they can solve their question .
In my case , my English teacher has knowledge anout anything .
For example , he knows about the art , the history of the livings , and the lifes of the other countries ' tribes .
When I talked with him about these subjects , I was surprised and thought that I could learn various things from him as my teacher .
I can ask the question what I ca n't solve , and everytime , he responds my question .
Therefore , I respect of him because he is intelligent .

In addition , if people know that , they can use their knowledge anytime .
For example , when they are forced to write the essay about the subjects that I mentioned before , they can write them without researching .
They do n't have to waste of time to investigate or ask to the others .
Moreover , even if they research about them , they know the basic things , so they can improve their knpwledge from other information .
In my experience , when I had to research to write the essay about the problem about Yasukuni Shrine because I had no idea about that .
At that time , I regretted that I did n't have the knowledge .
If I knew about the problem , I could write the essay more deeply or effectively .

In summary , I think that it is good thing for them to have the knowledge about various subjects .
One reason is they can be praised their intelligence when theycan answer the question from other people .
The other thing is that it is useful on their lives .
