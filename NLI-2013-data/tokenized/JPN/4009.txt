Some people might say that young people nowadays have enough time to help the communities around them .
But , personally , I think young people had limited time to take part in the community activites .
Where I live , in Japan , the young people do not spend their time for communities .
So , I would like to illustrate the situations below .

Most importantly , young people in recent years tend to be more busier than those in previous years .
For example , the recent young people have to study from the morning to the midnight every day .
They have to go to junior or high schools and also have to go to the preparatory schools in order to get in a competitive Universities .
Moreover , they must take part in the club activities such as basketball club or Judo club after school to strengthen themselves physically and mentally .
I think there are more time for University students to help their communities than any other students in different ages .
But after graduated from University , young businessperson must work from early in the morning till midnight in Japan .
They could not afford to have sufficient dinner time because of the hectic schedules .
Therefore , they hardly have time to spend for community activities .

In addition , the young people tend to get involved with the familiar relationship in their spare time .
For instance , they pleasedly meet with their friends in weekends , however , they are likely to be reluctant to participate in the program to help their own communities .
There are not so many mutual relationship between the young people such as high school students and the people living in the area where the school locates or their own house locates .
Additionally , the many young people in their 20s now leave their own hometown toward the central city to live alone and enjoy their life times .
They increasingly tend to get involved with people in the close and comfortable relathionship .
It means that it become more difficult for the young people to get involived with local communities .

Considering from the point mentioned above , I think that young people do not have enough time to spend for community activities .
Personally , I hope that more young people help their communities to build the relationship between the people with different ages and in different situations and adults supports the young people .
