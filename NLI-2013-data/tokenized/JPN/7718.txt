I do not agree that a group tour with a guide can provide us with the best trip for several reasons .
First , if we hire a tour guide , we can not travel by our desicion , which may limit our intersting of the trip .
Second , concering cost effectiveness , we should spend much more money on the tour which is followed by a tour guide .
Third , I would like to travel with my family and my best friends .
In group tour , we should spend a lot of time with strange people .

When I travel , I ususally plan my schedule and destination of trip by myself .
I would like to travel freely and comfortably .
I think that a tour guide tends to earn money from their tourists .
For example , a tour guide may take tourist to a expensive souvenior shops which pay money to the tourguide for their contract .

In a economical point of view , tour trips with guides shoud be more expensive than self arrange trips becuse tour fees includes their salary .
If we plan our trip by ourself , we can choice a hotel and restaurant .
However , we take part in a group tour , our trips would be fixed in the selection of accomodation and restaurants .
I think that a gouop tour led by a tour gide should be boring .

I have never used a package tour like group tour because I like to plan a trip .
Reserching about travels by using the internet and some timetable allow me to be fun .
I would like to give a best trip to my family and my friends .

In conclusion , I prefer a self-organized tour rather than a group tour with a guide .
