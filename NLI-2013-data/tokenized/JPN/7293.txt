I partially agree the idea and to travel in a group with a tour guide supposed to be one of the most efficient way to visit a place , especially when people go to the country where they never been so far .
As for me , I usually travel with my friends and I have no experience to company with the person , such as a tour guide because I believe that there are following disadvantages to do it : I do not wast the time by visitting the place which I am not so interested in ; and I hope to have a look real aspects of the country or place .

The people who participate in a gruop traveling must be varioused to age , interest or sex .
To fulfill the satisfaction of every visitors , travel companies would take them many sorts of place regardless thinking about what or in where they actually would like to experience in the trip .
The travel time is limited and at the same time I really want to make it fun , therfore I should go or do only what makes me have interest .

Further , travel companies tend to emphasize only good aspects of the places to a travelor , in order not only to make them have a fond of memories there , but also to make them come back there .
I am tired of seeing a place where most of tourists visit and having a meal which most of them have eaten .

Taken together , for the person who hopes to know the place where he or she visits deeply , like me , should have a coonection or freiend who dwell there for a long time and they diffinetely take he or she the restaurant or bar which tour group rarely visit .
