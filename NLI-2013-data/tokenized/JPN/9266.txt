I agree with this statement .
If they do not get the main idea and just knowing some facts about it , it would n't be a good thing for the students .
For me , at the same time , I was thinking if I agree or disagree with the statement .
Because , I am in high school freshman year right now .
I take ancient history for social studies .
First of all , when i just start reading the text book and trying to understand the main ideas about history , I cant get everything in my mind .
Maybe it is just me but first I always have to get some interesting facts to make myself want to learn about history .

Right now , I am learing about the Crusades .
I did n't have any idea what crusades were .
So I started reading the text book and trying to get a main idea .
But it never made myself want to read farther .
I decided to go online and look up for some facts about the crusades .
I think it was something like there was this girl who lost her mother when she was small .
All she knew about her mother was that she lived in a different country .
She knew that the Crusades traveled around and spread christianity .
Although she thought it was going to be hard to find he mother .
But she thought it is better than doing nothing .
Therefore , she decided to spread the christianity with them .
I got that fact online and I am not sure if its a true fact but it still made me want to know how the crusades travelled and their where .

By getting facts , I got the main idea at the end .
But if I get the main idea at first , I think it would of been easier to study later on .
So in my opinion , understanding ideas and learing facts are both really important .
But ideas are more important for students first .
