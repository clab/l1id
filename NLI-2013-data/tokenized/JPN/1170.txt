Some people may think specializing in one specific subject is better .
However , personally , I believe it is better to have borad knowledge of many academic subjects .
There are two reasons for this .

The primary reason is that the new areas of academic subject have been created often by combining some subjects .
For example , portfolio magement theory which won Novel Prize was created by combination of mathmatics/statistics and economics .
If the resercher who won the prize was engaged only in traditional economics , it was impossible for him to develope this epochmaking theory .
In general , the evolution of the area of Finance theory has been depending on the combination of math , statistics , economics , phycology , and a lot of other subject .
This is quite good thing .

Another reason is that it is good for the future convenient of both students and proffessors to have broad knowledge .
In other words , broad knowledge increases the probability that they can turn their academic area into good direction .
For instance , one of my proffessors in university who has been an expert of computer science deveoped his career in new area , the law of patent .
While he has studied computer science , he has become aware that the new technology cannot alway be money .
The obstacle for him was the law of patent .
After being an expert of the law of patent , he is respected as an expert who can understand technology and the law related to patent .

Considering with all of the above factors , I would like to claim that we should aquire borad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specialize in just one specific subject .
By aquiring broad knowledge of many academic subjects , we can increase the probability to create new academic area and to develope our career flexibly .
