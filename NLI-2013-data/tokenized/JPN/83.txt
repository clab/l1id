I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Even though I think it ^ s true that young people has more power to do new things , so that can make them excited .
About me , just few days ago I went to my x junior high school to get in the pool with my friend .
It ^ s forbidden .
in the midnight .
We get over the fence and suceeded to get in the pool .
We laughed and laughed and laughed .
it was fun because the task was risky , wasnt allowed , etc ..
too many reasons .
Ill never forget this .
So , young people can do anything , and easy to find something fun .
I wouldnt find the stupid thing that we did fun when I got old .

But I guess there ^ s another way to enjoy old people ^ s life .
may be to do flower arrengement ?
Im not sure but , I think Any person at any situation can enjoy their life if they want to enjoy their life .
My friend , who is 18 years old recently had to stay at hospital for almost 2 weeks , firstly she complained about that often like * why me ??
it is middle of summer break !
I had many plans that i cant do now ! ''
I was sorry for her .

A week later , when I went to her hospital room , she was doing a game that I gave her .
She had never played a game before , but she started , and found it so much fun , and she is still now a big fun of games , My grandfather , who is dead when he was 87 , I love him so much by the way , enjoyed his life soooo much !
he always said in his life time , that ` I am the happiest person in this world '' He went to war comming back with nothing , He lost all his family and house then , but he worked hard and he built 3 buildings and became quite rich .
He was in hell once but he used to say that ` working hard was fun because the more I work , the more money I get !
money counting was the omly fun I have at that time .

And He got me and my little sister as stepdaughters .
He loved us more than anything .
When he lost his ability to move his body , we went to his hospital everyday .
He still said : Im the happiest person in this world `` then .
As I am the person who feels OK to everything that comes to me , If you are not healthy , If you are not pretty , If you do not have boy friend , If you are not young , if you are not old , you can make your time or even your life full of happiness .
