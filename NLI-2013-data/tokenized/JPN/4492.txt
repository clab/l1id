There are a lot of advertisments in society , and I often see them .
I like seeing them , so I agree with the follwing statement that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
I have some reasons .

First of all , it is often possible for most advertisments to make products seem much better than they really are because they often have a lot of coments and pictures .
For example , a lot of advertisements have many user 's coments , and they also have a lot of pictures .
The a lot of coments and pictures influence on readers .
If advertisement has nice coments and pictures , the goods is bought by a lot of people .

Second , the advertisements having a lot of pictures and coments can make reader happy .
For example , if you see advertisements which do not have advertisements , you maybe think the advertisements is very boring .
But , most advertisements have a lot of pictures and coments , so you can enjoy seeing the advertisements .
Therefore , you feel that most advertisements is very good , even if the advertisements is not better than they really are .

For these reasons , I think that I disagree with the following statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
