Certainly some people think that young persons seldom participate and help the communities these days .
But personally I believe that the education and society give young people the chance and the time to have a contact with communities to help other people .

First , the school focuses on the importance of volunteer works in the community these days , so that students give their more time to do volunteer works than before .
For example , when I was in high school , the teachers set up the volunnteer commitee which give the information and chance to do volunteer works in the hospital to clean the rooms .
In addition , the school produced the event that students pick up the trash around the school once a week .
The experience of attending the volunteer work and helping the community once a week is enough time for students .
That experience give me the chance to have a contact with my community .
I was very busy at studying , but I have a chance to realize the importance of helping communities .
According to the newspaper , the school more emphasize on teaching the importance of volunteer works these days .
This example demonstrates that schools make enough oppotunity for students to help their communities .

Second , the community have a chance to young people to help their communities .
For instance , In Tokyo , where I live , the number of the trouble of robbers and fire accidents caused by people is increasing .
Therefore , in my town , the commitee of the town decide to ask youg people to look around the town to protect the accidents during the night .
I attend this activity once a week .
This example also shows that the young poeple have a time to help the community because of their needs to defense by themselves .

I can understand the opinion that young people are busy of studing and eager to play the TV game , so that they seldom help their community .
However , The schools and communiries make enough time and chance for young generations to help their community .

Therefore , I definetly disagree with the statement that young persons do not use their time to helping their communities .
