I am a kinds of peason who agree with the oppinion that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what ther already know how to do well .
The life is one time .
Therefore , we tends to think that we want to live with calm and happy life .
However , I believe that we have to keep challenging .

One of my friends ; his name is Yu , he is in London now .
We used to be classmates when we were in senior high school .
Since he was a student , he always said that he wanted to work in the United Nations .
Everyone knows it is really hard to work there .
However , he has never given up his real dream .
After he graduated university in Tokyo , he belonged to the government as a member of economy department .
Then , he decided to go abroad to learn bussiness and economy .
After this desition , he kept studying and finally he got a ticket to study abroad as a nation scolarship .
Now he is in London and studies in bussiness school .
After graduation , he is going to back to Japan and work for the goverment again , but as a member of international department .
Then , he is thinking about go to United State and study 2 more years .
After all , he is trying to apply to the United Nations .
This is still a dream , however he is trying new things , even though he should have good salary to keep working in Japan .

Though , I am not sure that who is to be called a successful person , I am thinking I am the one by myself .
Most of my friends are working in Japan .
They have kept working since they graduated their univercities ; it has been almost 10 years .
They have a carrer now .
Therefore , some of them became a chief of their groups .
However , I have never worked in Japan .
I am a kindergarten teacher .
I used to work in Indonesia as a staff of Jakarta Japanese school .
Then I came to United State to work as a same kind of jobs but defferent style to teach .
Sometimes I am warried about myself , because I am still single and I have no carrer in Japan .
However , I keep doing what I wanted to do .
I feel homesick sometimes , hoewver , instead of that , I can meet new friends here in America .
They make me encourage and make my mind more challengeable .

Thus , I think successful people is enjoying their life and very bright , even though it used to be hard .
People who can have a challengeship can be a succesful peason .
