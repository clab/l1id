I agree with this statement , ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '

In my opinion , successful people has great ability to do something , efoort a bit , and good luck .
As you see some famous stars or celebrities , they are mostly clever and have amazing ideas which no one had never though .
However , they had also risks because they are trying to do something new .
New things must have risks because no one had tried before .
Although they had risks , they always try and get succeed .
Needless to say , it 's not easy , but they have strong feelings to do what they want to do .
In addition , they have experiences and knowledges , for example about bisiness , arts , trading money , and so on .
This is the most important thing to be succeed .

On the other hand , people who want to something new , but are afraid of doing that can never be succeed .
If they really want to be succeed , they should be brave to try new things .
However , if they do n't have any own plans and people who help and support them , they must not try if they want to do .

As a result , in my opinion , successful people always learn , study , compair and check others .
They read books , magazines , get information and so on .
Then first of all , they want to try as soon as possible , faster than others .
Taking risks are not matter for them .
Being interested is the most imoirtant thing to be succeed .
If we are not interesting in everything at all , we ca n't find any new things .
Not only feeling that , but also knowledge , ability effort and energy are needed .
No one ca n't be susseed without them what i told .
