I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I have two reasons to support my opinion .

First of all , I believe an understanding of a concept will lead to further understandings .
For instance , without the primary understading of how Muslim is practiced and worshipped , one will not be able to fully understand why a certain ritual exists in that religion .
By understanding ideas of a fact , one will also be able to develop his or her ability to think , and to interconnect different aspects of numerous information on various topics .
An example will be understading the concept of Darwin 's evolution theory .
Through this understanding , a student will not only learn a new biological fact , but he or she will also be able to connect this information in a history class when a discussion on the Industrial Revolution ( the time period when the theory was first introduced ) .
The student will learn that the revolution had allowed quick spread of the scientsit 's idea than before .
With the combination of the biological and historical aspects of Darwin 's theory , the student will be able to recognize the difficulty the scientist faced when he had informed the society his new idea , and had received many criticisms about it .

Secondly , I am against simply learning facts , because I seek no point in merely memorizing a piece of information .
Even is one was able to answer a question correctly , if the person was unable to explain the reasons for the answers , not much credit can be given .
Let 's say a man knew that mixing an imputiry in water will lower its melting point .
Even if he did know that fact , if he did not know how this could help him in a real life situation , how much would this knowledge mean to him ?
What would be the point in knowing such thing ?
On the other hand , if the man had the understanding that an impurity lowers water 's melting point , his understanding will allow him more thinking , integrating this fact to the other knowlegde the man possesses .
The man will incorporate his knowledge that salt is an impurity , that snow is also a form of water , and that the ground becomes slippery when snow melts .
As a result , he knows that he can pour salt over snow to prevent it from melting quickly , preventing people to slip .

With these reasons , I belive it is more important for students to understand ideas than to learn just the facts
