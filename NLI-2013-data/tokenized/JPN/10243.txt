I totally agree with the opinion that successful people tend to take risks .
In deed , doing just ordinary thing is stable .
At the same time , however , it 's not inspire the next .
I suppose that if people do n't take any risks , they feel bored and have limits to more success .

My grand father could success his job .
He did a lot of things in his job .
At first , he started chinese restaurant .
As soon as this is success , he started opening another restaurant which is forcused on beer .

In my grand father 's era , beer is not as popular as now .
He rialized this situation .
Then he opend his another restaurant called `` beer garden '' .
Actually he was not first person who started beer garden , but his second restaurant was more success than first chinese restaurant .

I think he could success for the following reasons .
He did not feel risky at all , when he established his new business .
Whereas it seems that he was glad to start new thing .
It is important that doing new thing is glad to .
