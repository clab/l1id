Holleywood star Tom Cruz did n't stop with that he already know how to do well .
Currently , he is trying to do other thing .
Not only Tom Cruz is the one who success and also want to try new things and take risks .
A lot of famous people want take risks rather than only doing they already know they can do well .
Therefore , I agree with Successful people try new things and not do the thing that already know how to do well .

For one thing , most of the famous people will be in news that he or she want to do some other thing and take risks rather than what they have talented in .
For example , in Japan they have a famous singer name Hikaru Utada .
She has very talented voice in singing and a lot of people likes to hear when she is singing .
One day she said she want to go university in New York .
Most of the news talked about that moment .
She was singing the song in United States and also she study hard in University of New York call Columbia university .
Most of people knows that Hikaru Utada is successful person in Japan .

For another thing , most of the successful people have a lot of interesting emotion .
They think what if he or she do this or that .
For example , one of the famous Japanese comedian star name Hamada tries a lot of thing that he never tries .
He tried most of the sports such as sky diving , gold , tenis and every other sports that this world exist .
Most of the successful person does everything that he or she is interest in .

In conclution , Successful people likes to take risks and also they have amount of interesting emotions .
I never saw the famous people who is doing only that he or she already know how to do well .
