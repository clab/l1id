Where I live , Japan , poeple spend their vacation on travel around the world .
Therefore , there are many tours designed by tour companies .
Some pepole prefer to take these tours with friends led by a tour guide , but I find more advantages that planning a tour by myself is suitable for me .
Therefore I disagree with this statement .

Of course , there are some advantages to travel led by a tour guide .
For instance , people feel at ease when they are led by a tour guide who know very well about the area which they visit .
Also , sometimes a tour less costs to stay hotel or transpotation than pay by myself .
Although there are some advantages to take a tour , I definitely choose to travel by myself .

The primary reason that I can cite is I can more enjoy a tour with free plan , bacause I do n't feel comfortable if I have to travel with a person who I have n't met before .
it is more comfortable for me to travel alone or with friends .

Socondly , if I travel led by a tour , I feel I have to be punctual even though it 's my vacation , my precious day off , because I must not make a tour plan confused and get others in trouble .
On the other hand , I can take my time to visit , buy something or eat nice meals as long as I want .
I do n't feel guilty at all .
therefore As I mentioned so far I definitely choose to travel without a tour guide otherwise I feel stressed on my precious time .
I just want to enjoy and relax on my vacation effectively .
