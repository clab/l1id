I agree with the idea which more and more young people lose their interest toward community works or voluntary works .
Then I wonder who is responsible for that .
Of course young peoele have responsibility by themselves .
Everytime I go out in Tokyo , I see many young people who throw their gabbish on the street without any consideration .
I wonder have they ever thought about cleenig crews who mostly works voluntarilly .
I also see many young people sitting on priority seats in front of eldery people or handicaped-person on the train .
They usually chat with their friends loudly or talikg on the cell-phones .
I think these behavior exactly mirror the younger 's attitude toward community works or voluntary works .

I blamed Japanese youngers , however , I think Japanese government also have a responsibility for today 's trend which young peopel do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Basically , Japanese schools do not require students to work at their community or to joinn voluntary works and there are no class about how imporatnt helping community is .
Those lackness makes yound people lose their interest in community works .

Lastly , I also think community itself have a responsibility for young people .
I am sure that young people do not spend enough time on community works , however , I want to ask the community that they have helped any young people or gave them advices in the community .
Unless community and young people find out the way that they support and help each other , there is no way that this situation will be changed .

I think majority of young people do not give them time to help others in their community .
However , I also know some young people are eager to work for their community only because they want to contribute their community .
I think young people just have not realized how worth it is .
If everybody will change in order to their community better , I belive that the number of young people who join community works will increse .
