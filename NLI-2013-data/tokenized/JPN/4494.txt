I think the most advertisements are made to look the products much better than they really are .
They make the ad or TV commercials intensionally attract the customer by emphasizing a certain poing of products .

Typical example is , I think , an advertisements of car .
One commercial that I felt like I missed the poing was the one ; a man at the groccary casher looks at what he was going to buy and what the other man is going to .
He got vegitables and a pack of big in Tofu in his cart and the other man has huge bulk of beef .
After that he rushes into a car dealere and buys a big car .
An impression that I had from this TV commercial is , `` Get a big car , get your dignity . ''
But the car eats gas like a monster .

In these days , especiall after the midle-east crisis , the gas efficiency is one of the most important elements when you choose which car you perchase .
More people concern about efficiency much more they used to before .

I believe that the car company ought to forcus on what the era require them to make and respond what poeple need .
The ad does n't show anything like that but encourage people to reverse the flow of the current .
We , comsumers need to be smart enough to read what they show and what they hide behind the advertisement .
