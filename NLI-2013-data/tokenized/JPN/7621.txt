The guides gives us a lot of good imformation about the place , and they know where is good place to see .
We do not have to reserch about the place where we travel .
It is very easy to travel .

But I think that the best way to travel is not in a group by a tour guide .
There are some reasons why I think so .
First , I think it is not intresting to just follow the guides when I travel .
I think , however , it is important to find something interesting or something new by myself .
I am happy when I find something that other people do not know and when I find somewhere beautiful by myself .
Second , traveling by myself makes me feel confident .
When I went to Australia .
I went to the zoo by myself .
I researche the fee to enter the zoo , how to get there , what to see .
It made confidenceto me that I can travel in foreign country by myself .
Above all , if the travel is in foreign countries , I would like to travel by myself definitly , because traveling abroad is chance to learn the language or culture of the country where I travel .
The tour guide might explain what is good , what to eat , where to see , and so on , in Japanese .
I think it is important to be surrounded by the air of the place to have best experience .

I do not think traveling led by a tour guide is bad , but the better way to have fun is to travel without her .
I think finding or learning something new is good experience and the experience will never be the same , on the other hand , traveling led by her is almost always the same .
I think people who want to do something different from the otheres should travel by theirselves .
