I do'nt agree with the statement .
The first reason is that there are no other transportation better than cars .
Cars are acctually covenient .
From door to door we can go anywhere we want .
Especially with a big baggage or small child .
No one disturb us in the car .
So there are few persons who want to give up drive with their cars .

On the other hand , we have many problem with cars .
For example , traffic jams and dificulty of findind parking .
As the increasing of car , those kind of problem became bigger than before , Still , I do n't think it will cause people give up driving cars .
This kind of disadvantage is tolerable .
The advantage of using cars are bigger , And there may be energic problem to cars .
The oil stock will be exhausted in near futuer , But , to my mind , industrial progress will give us other energic power such as water or sollar power to move cars .
Therefore this shortcoming of using car will not have good reason .

THen , how about other transportation ?
As for trains , the 'll cost a lot to make rails and keep land .
Plains also cost to move on .
Car is conpact and flexible .
In additon , the second reason I think we will continue to use cars are that cars are someway have role as our fasion .
many people are euthusiastic to chose one 's car .
Having car is a kind of status of people .

So , nevertheless some more convenient and smart machines are prevented , we are using cars more and more .
And I do n't think no other transportation which fit people better than cars will be prevent in twenty years .
