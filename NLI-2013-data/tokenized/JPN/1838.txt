Young people seemed have everything becouse they are young and they have energy for doing anything , so it seemed like older people have finished to enjoy their life along thier age .
Also , it sounds that young people have much more ambitious than older people , in fact , it must be misunderstand .
It can not say that young people enjoy life more than old people becouse both ages have advantage and disadvantage , also older people might enjoy life more than young people do .

First , as I mentiond before , an advantadge of young people is their age .
They have a lot of time and long distance for the end of their life .
It is certainly the advantage of young people which older people do not have .
Howevver , young people do not have enough money even if they had time and ambitious for their plan for enjoying life .
Therefore , young people should not only think about enjoying life with plans also need to work on their job for getting money .

Second , although older people actually have less time than young people , it means that old people have been working for getting money .
Hence , they have enough money for enjoying their plan .
They have almost same ambitious as young people have .
Besides , they have a great experience of enjoying life through their working life .
There have not been only interesting experience , also some bad or miserable experience .
However , it can be a part of enjoying their life as well .
Here is the biggest diference between young people and older people .
So , I think that older people are enjoying much more than youngers .

In conclusion , enjoyment of life is related to its age , and I disagree with the statement that `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''
.
Both young and older people have the advantages and disadvantages .
