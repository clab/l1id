Many poeple like traveling .
On one side , poeple go to travel by themselves .
On the other side , people go there with a tour guide who knows a place well .
A tour guide is a professional about the place .
However , people ca n't go whatever they want , and sometimes it takes less money than going with a guide .
There is three benefits to travel alone , not with a guide .

According to some people , traveling with a guide does n't waste of their time .
However , they ca n't go whatever they want .
Moreover , they ca n't stay a sightseeing place even theey want to spend their time more at there .
With a guide , she has alreay planed their scabules time by time .
Therefore , tourists might follow her plan .

People shoud enjoy their time in a place .
Second , sometimes tourists have to go to some shopping stores which is connecetted with the tour guide coumpany because of back money .
On the other hands , it it waste of their time .
During the time , people can go to other spots or they can rest .
Usually , these kind of shops are more expencive than other shopps .
Moreover , people can communicate with native people when they go to local markets .
It is good memory and experience for them .

Finally , a tour guide knows the place well , and people do n't needc to worry about language .
If people ca n't speake a native language , it is stressful for them .
However , it is less exciting .
People travel because they want to do other things from their nornal lives .
Even though they ca n't speake language , it is possible to communicate with local people , using jestures .
