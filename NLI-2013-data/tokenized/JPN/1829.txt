I would definitely agree that young people have the more enjoyable life than older people .
There are two reasons : physical strength and sensitive feeling .
To begin with , the phsical strength is necessary to enjoy life .
For example , if people go to the other country for travel , they have to carry the heavy baggage in which all equipments for travel install .

Generally speaking , it is easier for young people to complete , as compared as older people .
Additionally if they could not carry heavy baggage like older people , the areas where they could go is limited or they have to pay money to make someone carry .
Older people will not go around .
Because they have the phsical strengh .
Therefore , young people enjoy to travel in the other country , even though they have to move with their heavy baggage .

In the second place , the sensitive feeling will lead to enjoy life .
If people face any arts , such as pictures , music , paintings , they will able to obsorb in their sensitive feeling .
For example , gradually they are deeply interested in music and they would like to learn and play instruments .
In my opinion , young people have the sensitive feeling which is need for playing instruments , as compared as older people .
On the other hand , it will be clear for older people that the sensitive feeling will be decreased when they start learning instruments .
That 's why , young people enjoy life to face or learn any arts .

As a result , I would definitely agree that young people have the more enjoyable life than older people , as thinking about the physical strength and the sensitive feeling .
