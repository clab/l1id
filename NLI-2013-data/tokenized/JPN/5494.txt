I agee with the statment , because the advertizements make products seem much better than they really are .
Especially , the visual advertisemnts make them better effecitively .
the products in the picture is the best conditon .
it means that it is not natural .
people often are decieved by the advirtisemnts when they purchase the products .

For example , the cleannig detergents inTV commercial shows how clean they make the floor , table , deshes , and window glasses .
it is a kind of show , not real .
when we are wathing the TV shows , we are impressed and amazed .
And then , we may go to a supermarket to buy the product which is new but it might not be as different as it used to be .

Another example is the menu in the restaurant .
we can see a lot of foods in the pictures .
And , we choose the most likely good taste one .
However , the most of the foods in the menu are not the one which we expected .
Some of them are suppoused to be disappointed .

we can see many kinds of visual advertisemnts in our lives .
the advertisement effect us to decide to puchase the products in all of other competiton products , although the most products in the advertisements are better than they are .
