I belive motivation is one of the most important qualities that make people successful .
Seeking new opportinities and better ways is avoidable .
Therefore , I strongly agree with the statement that successful individuals always try new things and take risks .

My mother always told me a story about my grandfather who was born in a poor neighbourhood and had no wealth when he was young .
He started business with a very small shoe store .
There was no employee or manager .
He was the only one working there and the store was neiter famous or popular .
He , however , had a ambition to make the store bigger and make more money .
He borrowed some money from a bank and bought a land , then expanded the store .
The decision was risky because there was not guarantee that he could pay the money back .
Some of my grandfather 's relatives , including his own father told him to stop dreaming and be careful because he was making enough money to support his family .

Because of his effort , his business was significantly succeeded and he finally ownedtwo big malls .
This great contribution could not be achieved without his risky challanges .
He could have chosen to run the small shoes store and have comfortable life as he was told by his relatives .
He did not have to worry about failing if he did , but he could not experience the great success as well .

Being conservative and doing things we already know are not totally useless .
Many people choose this way and are satisfied with their situation .
However , being motivative and finding better ways will teach more lessons to people .
Only creative and ambitious people can innovate new great ideas and be successful .
Taking a risk is neccesary to be successful in any field .
