Students ' learning experiences comprise of the development of knowledge as well as the ability to think critically .
In classes and through textbooks and handouts , students will encounter new concepts and ideas in addition to the factual matters that are related to the subject they are learning .
It is my understanding that education takes place in a variety of scopes and levels , and neither of the elements could be more important than the other .

For example , in History classes , students are expected to learn adn understand the various historical events of different geographical areas , at times entailing them to memorize minute facts and incidents for the exam .
However , students are also expected to understand the background ideas and concepts that lie behind such specific events to fully understand the learning material in a larger context .

In Science or Math courses , students expose themselves to various equations and concepts to understand the world from a scientific point of view .
In exams and quizzes their understanding will be assessed based on whether they have memorized the specific facts in addition to whether they can apply the equations introduced .
If students understand the concepts and ideas that construct the equations , not only will the students be able to answer the questions correctly , they would be able to complete the course with confidence that they could answer similar questions in the future .
Such confidence will only derive if students acquire both factual information as well as conceptual understanding .

Finally , the importance of learning concepts and facts are important to any other courses such as art , music or cooking .
only science courses but in arts and social science courses .
ILearning facts and understanding concepts are interrelated and neither of them are more important than the other .
