I agree with this , because I think it will be expencive gas of cars in twenty years .
It is getting to expencive the gas in the world now .
It is getting to decrease amount of gas in the world , so it is getting to difficult to get gas and expencive to get .
In addision , if it will be a war in SaudiArabia , it will be difficult to get gas more and more .
Second , we should think about enviroment of the earth .
We have a lot of problem about polution in the world .
To getting warm in the world is one of the problem , so we should not ride a car by ourselves .
We should be decreased about CO2 in air .
And if it will be expencive gas of cars , we will use tranceportation , like a bus , a subway and a train .
It is good way to decrease of CO2 .
Finally , I think there are a lot of convinience tranceportation better than a car in twenty years .
A car is not going to be covinience .
We are going to use public trancepotation naturally .
That is why , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
