Although older people can enjoy life , I definitely agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Young people can enjoy eating , travering , and be health .

First , young people can eat and drink a lot because they are young .
For example , when young people want to eat some great dishes , they can eat all of them .
They can satisfy with the experience that they eat a lot .
However , usually , older people cannot eat a lot of food because they become full soon or they do not want to eat a lot .

Not only can young people enjoy eating , but also they can enjoy travering .
If the person who is young wanted to go to somewhere , the person could go there soon .
The person does not need a lot of preparation for the trip .
However , if the person who is old wanted to go to trip , the person would need a lot of time to prepare the trip .
So , young people are very flexible and agressive .

These aspects are very important with young people , however , healty is the most important part of young people .
Older people are suffered from a lot of illnesses .
They catch a cold easily , become tired soon , and need a lot of time for their rest .
Also , they cannot play hard sports .
However , young people are healty and very agressive .
They can play hard sports like baseball , soccur , swimming and so on .
Young people recover from illnesses soon .

In conclusion , Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
They can enjoy eating , travering , and be health .
Young people can do anything that they want to .
