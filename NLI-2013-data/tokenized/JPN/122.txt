In every time and every parts of the world , young people are criticized that they had changed for bad , especially by the adults .
And always it is partly true .
But this time I disagree with the statement , which says young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I think , nowadays young people rather DO give enough time to helping their communities .
Today , let me explain my opinion and supporting reasons .

First of all , young people are said to be so much indulged that they do not contribute for the community by the adults .
But I think , they become much more active for their communities than adults says .
I saw a documentary film about the cleen-up project in Shibuya .
In that film , even girls called GALs or guys like TEAMERs , who are most likely to be explained dull and infavor of anything , take part in the project .
Actually , when gals expressed their opinion to others , they seems to be more enthusiastic than any other adults same participate in the project .
So it means that they sincerely think of their communities , and give their time and passion .

And secondly , someone says that young people are not interested in their community so they do not give their times in to helping their communities .
But I oppose that opinion either .
My friend takes part in Sanja Festival in Asakusa for 10 years , and she found interests in it .
And amazingly , not only her is the person who thinks that .
Year by year the young people who take part in the festival increases .
It means that , if communities open up to youths and communicate with them more , young people interested in their activity .

I think , everyone should do something before being analogous to young people for how less helpful young people are , and how less time young people use for communities .
Youths always have interest , and time for their communities to use .
I can say that , only if having very little opportunity , young people are more active for helping their community .
