Surely I admit that young people apt to have more power to enjoy their lives and left more time .
However I insist that olded poeple enjoy life more than young poeple .
There are two reasons for this .
They have more experiences and money .

First , older people have learned how to enjoy life from their longer period of life .
They , of corse , have experiences of love with girl/boyfireinds , which sometimes include faiure to success .
Older people should know how to belong with their partner .
For example , my farther who have many girlfriend before marriage , now , has very good time with my mother because he can lead the partnership effectively and can solve probelms easily .
Sometimes they go to travel togethet .
They look so enjoyful for their life Second , since many older people have earned the salarys in companies or their own shop , they tend to have far more money than young peole have , who have not worked yet or have just had a job .
Avarage revenue of business people after working 30-40 yeas in Japan no less than 500 dollars .
While almost 0 or someone have debt among young people in particula for students .
It make older Moreover after retiring their firm oleder pople have pention .
people spend money as they like .
Actually many older retired like topeople consume toys for their grandsons with their pleasure .

As these reasons it is apparently true that older people enjoy life far more than young peole .
Their long-term knowleade and the outcome of their effort in in the wrok places bring them to happy `` second life '' with their partner and cute garandsons .
