While there may be some advantages to learing many disciplines of academic subjects , I think that it is much better to study specifi subject .
There are two reasons for this : its practicality and its effectiveness .

First of all , the reason why It is much more beneficial to study specified subjects rather than broader areas comes from its practicality .
For example , it will be much easier to find a good job if you concentrate on studying a limited area of academic subjects .
A recent survay shows that about 80 % of large firms in Japan want people who have their own specialities not broader knowledge of many academic areas .
In addition , it is much easiler to help other people if you focus on studying a narrow area of academic subjects .
From my experience , I found it true .
For example , I could contribute to a group work by using my expertise that is mass media studies .
The study group that researches on the effect of the animation in Japan after the Second World War , needs some people whose expertise is the recent history of the animation .
because my major is deeply related to the subject , I could help them .
It is obvious that it is very difficult to support them without concentrating on the specific area .

Secondly , another reason why it is much more advantageous to learn a specific area results from its effectiveness .
It is clear that it is difficult to remember all of the area that you have laerned before .
According to a scientific data , your brain much more effectively memorizes a specified subject instead of a broader areas in the long run .
Therefore , it must be a waste of time to study a broad range of accademic areas .
Furthermore , it is also evident that focusing on a specific subject leads to learing a broader area of academic subjects .
Many great scholars such as Kant , asserted that it is essential to scrutinize a specific area to understand the broader areas .
I found it true form my experience , too .

In conclusion , I agree with the idea that it is much more beneficial to specialize a specific subject because of its practicality and effectiveness .
