First , I agree with the advertisements ' good effectness towrad the products because they give much information about the products .
On the advertisements , the reasons why the products are good are informed .
Even sometimes , they compare with the other products saying the others are worse than ours .
Because of this , the products are seemed to be better .

I feel this is right because the advertisements are made to let the consumers pay strongly attention to the products .
They may include some expressions so that consumers can hold the products ' image long .
Based on this , I feel that most advertisements have power to let the products be seemed better ones .
