In my opnion , there is no doubt that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
However , some people have opposite opinion , so I must explain carefully .

we have those who believe that people had better to study about one specific subject .
they think that the way is more effective to produce professionals .
In addition , they feel that the wide range of knowledge is not necessary for professionals such as engineers and artist .
forexample , some pianist who had educated only play the piano .
However , he became a very famous pianist .
even though he did not have general knowledge , he could live himself .

Over the recent years , the problem has happened which the young people can not find their way .
some person feel that The wide range of knwoledge affcted the problem .
It is natural that people who has a lot of way make him confused .

In contrast , we have those who believe that the people , especially students must study many accademic subject .
because , studying only one subject make narrow student life .
To sum up .
we must pay attention what student to need .
after that , we must give them chance todecide .
