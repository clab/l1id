The tour in group is always an approved hobby for many people around the world .
The vacation become easier as the planes and other transportation become usable .
People will travel in group because it is more fun than traveling alone and it will remain as the long time memory .
The tourist group can be on the bus or by walking the city or other palces by the tourist guide explains the significant of each places such as its history and uses .
Although a group can learn a lot from tourist guide leading them while explaining each places , it is more fun and best to tour in group by themselves looking at the handy travel book .

The travel to Europe , Pacific Islands , Asia , and many other places is becoming famous now a days .
These places are popoular to travel in group with friends , family , or relatives .
I have been to Hawaii as a band trip a year ago .
When there , we did have a guides when we were riding on the bus and visting many recreational places .
It was fun to learn from those funny guides and walking around with them , but most fun part of the trip was a free time .
At free time , we did not have any guides with us that it was fun to get to go to anywhere we want .
Those places were beaches , the Dole plantation , the Polynesian cultural center , and many other places .
It was really fun to walk around in the palces with my friends .
Traveling by ourselves 's most crucial part is that we get to any where we want , because with the guides , the tour is already setted up and we do not have much time in our own .

Because the trip to Hawaii was with the school field trip , the guides and sheparones were needed in our trip .
If I have a chance to go to Hawaii or different place another time , I would definately go in group with my friends without the a tour guide .
