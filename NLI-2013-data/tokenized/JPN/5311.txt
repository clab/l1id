We have rights to know and educate the truth occuring in the world .
Advertisements make products a lot of information through television , radio , newspaper and internet .
I do not agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .

Some persons who works in the advertisement companies give information to us .
They have a focus on the some events , and in detail they give their thoughts and insights .
If they all have caught a mistake sensation of the actual events , there is huge problem .
However since actually advertisement presents to us after cheking many editors , I believe that overmistaken advertisement will disappear from the advertisements .

For getting really advertisements and information , it is necessary to be free in our sociality , education and economy .
If we do not have the freedom rights of knowledge , education , speaking and religion , I agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Under the condistion such as no freedom rights , we have possibility which prodcuts seem much better than advertisements really are .

For example , the peoples in North Korea are blocked from a lot of information of the others ' countries .
They hear only information which central social committee decides that may advertise for the peoples .
However they believe true information because they do not know the information of the others country .

In conclusion , when we could have freedom rights , most advertisements make products which they really are .
If we could not , most advertisements make products seem much better than they reall are .
In United States , since I have freedom rights , I do not agree its sentence .
