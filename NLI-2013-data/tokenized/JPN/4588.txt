Most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are , and I agree with the idea .
Those items sometimes betray people and do not work as much as it says on the advertisement , though it is customers responsibility to choose and purchase what they want , and business companies have right to do so .

First , as I mentioned before , it is customers responsibility to choose and purchase what they want .
If they do not want to try , they really do not have to .
If customers want to know how well it works , they can ask the opinions from someone who had used the products before purchasing it .

Furthermore , advertisement is crutial to business world to attract customers and increase the number of purchase .
If they fail , they will not compete other rival companies , which making the similar products .
In my own experience , during political science , my partner and I had to run for president and vice president .
We had to made twenty plans we will do if we were elected .
To attract other students in the class , we had to make up nice plans that are obviously impossible if we were really running for presidency in real life .

In conclusion , I agree to the idea of making advertisements which make products seem much better than they really are .
Afterward it is the customers ' responsibility to choose what they want , and the business world has the right reason to do what they are doing now to survive .
