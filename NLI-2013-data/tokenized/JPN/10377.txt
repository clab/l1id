With rapid economic development , people face new situations everyday .
Some people try new things and take risks to succeed , others , on the other hand , continue doing what they already know how to do well .
In my opinion , challenging new things and taking riskes would be a better choice for success .
This essay will discuss some reasons to support my view .

Trying new things , successful people could find new matters what they can do .
First of all , individuals can find their possibilities that they did not know .
Secondly , business persons could extend their business by trying new things .
For instance , my friend who own cake shops increased his sales since he started inernet shop on a website .
In a word , people can expand their lives by trying new matters .

Taking risks would lead people to succeed .
Firstly , individuals can change their circumstances to improve their lives .
For example , I could improve my English by coming to Canada that was risky yet I could get better job in Canada .
Secondly , taking riskes , people can obtain big chances .
My uncle made huge money by startign his business .
In short , people can not improve their lives without taking chances .

Other people , on the other hand , have different view ; such as doing same things that they know well would be much better for success .
However , other people who are eager for success usually think up new ideas and technologies in the modern world .
Consequently , only doing same things would become useless .
To sum , people can not avoid to try new things and take riskes .

To conclude , successful people try new things and realize new possibilities in many different situations .
Moreover , by taking risks , they gain chances of success .
In the contrary , doing what people already know how to do well may become out of date .
Hence , it is not difficult to say that successful people try new thingl and take riskes rather than doing same things what they know .
