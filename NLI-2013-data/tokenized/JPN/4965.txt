I am japanese and I grew up in japan .
so I have japanese culture .
when I went to over sea , I was able to learn about different culture .
and I had enjoyed studying about that .
and I thought If I come here and stay to study English , I can enjoy my American life .
but actueary , I think that American culture is rude .
because , for example , American macine always has broken very soon .
last month I bought a new motercycle and old car from my friend to go to school .
but now my motercycle and car has broken soon .
and take repair .
but has broken again .
in japan .
japanese is very polite .
so the macine which made in japan is very good and not have broken soon If we buy new one .
I think japanese culture is too polite by American people .

but I can not understand yet that have broken soon .
I think which made in JAPAN is very good .
on the other hand .
I have to understand about american culture if I continure staying here .
when I can understand about american culture , I may enjoy the american life .
I hope that come soon this thing .
and I am going to learn another countrys culture and enjoying .
some people have other culture each other .
and I would like to think that american culture also has good point for me .
