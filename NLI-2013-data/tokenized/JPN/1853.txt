I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
There are two reasons for this ; healthy and changing the life .
First of all , young people are more health than older people .
If young people feel that they want to climb up the Mt , Fuji , they can climb up .
However , older people could n't .
This is because , most older people are bad health .
Another thing is that they may have not energy to move , so they can not go abroad .
They will feel that own country is more confortable than ather countries .

Second of all , young people have longer life than older people .
By trying a lot of things , young people will change their life and the way of thinking .
Older people are hardly to change the life by trying new things .
For example , when young people listen to the music of an artist , they may change the thinkig .
Then they want to be artist may be .

For these reasons , I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
