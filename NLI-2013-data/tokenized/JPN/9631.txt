In general speaking , a lot of people love new things , especially young peole .
I suppose that everyone need ambisious feeling for many thing , therefore I agree with that successful people should try new things even there are some risks .

For example , there is one successful person with art , and he already has a lot of jobs belonging art .
But one day , he really interested in to be auther .
However , if he quit his job now , he cannot avoid from the position of the person who has no job .
In this case , he has to think carefully about his future first , and then , if he really want to be auther even there are some risks , he should be the auther .
However , he has to efforrt to be the auther very much .
If he notice that he shoul not to be the auther later , and there are no jobs , it is his responsibility .
It was good for him to notice that he should continue his jobs same as before .

If someone who want to try new things even there are some risks , they should try .
There are no experoles of own lives only doing what they already know how to do well .
Even the people who love to dong only one thing , they might had a time to think
