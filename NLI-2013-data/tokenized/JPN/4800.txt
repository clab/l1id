I completely disagree to the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for 3 reasons .
First , I often see many products written `` No Fat '' or `` No Chemical '' on the paccages .
When I bought some pack of yogult written `` No Fat '' on their paccages and ate one of them , I felt that it was too sweet to eat and it must contain fat .

Second , the advertisements want to increase benefit .
If they put some words that fascinate consumers on their products , the consumers would buy them ; even though , those words are actually not real .
Especially for the consumers who are interested in health or environment .

Finally , many consumers always try to buy better products .
The advertisements know that , so they put fascinative words on the paccage .
These are because that I think the advertisements do n't make better products than they really are .
I want to them to make the believable products .
