Nowadays , there are some kind of ways to learn something which have never taken before in personal .
I disagree with the statement which is more effective to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
People should face to the facts what would have more Important things .

First of all , it is no doubt about that facts are composed by real thing .
Most of them have records or certifications in several ways , writing , taking photos , painting , or existing substance itself like a fossil .
There are obvious no assumptions and personal opinions in the facts .
Besides , facts would not change the their form because they can not be made by human thoughts .
For example , earth is existing on solar system , it is fact .
But some people had ideas earth is just existing own , no system , in ancient world .

Second , ideas and concepts are based on facts .
If there are no facts , ideas and concepts can not be born .
People tend to add to some thoughts in their own way on the fundamental , facts .
In the other words , facts bring the human thoughts , ideas and concepts .
In conclusion , facts have some more advantages for the study than ideas and concepts that I have shown the above .
There is no possibility the existense ideas and concepts without facts .
