I agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Now I am working for a Japanese company in Japan and usually the holiday I can take is really shorter than other contries .
To travel efficiently , traveling in agroup with a guide is the best way .
I do n't need to spend many time to find a resturant and to worry about the losing way .
And the other good point is that traveling in a group , I can meet many people who I can share the atmospere of the places .
I will explaiin more details as follows .

The first reason is that traveling in agroup with a tour guide help me to travel effeciently .
As I mentioned before , I cannot take a long holiday as a usual Japanese company .
Therefore , I do n't have enough time to stay the same place .
To visit many places in the short term , I need a guide to help me to go around .
In addition , I do n't so worry about emergency situations such as losing ways , traffic jams , and train delays because a tour guide usually know how to handle the situation .

The second reason is that I can share the impression of the trip with group members and exchange our opinions .
Even though traveling alone can make more free time , I would like to share the atmosphere of the places with others .
For exsample .
I will go to a resturant during the trip .
If I eat alone , I cannot enjoy the meal .
I will miss someone who can talk to me .

Consequently , I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I can travel many places during my short holiday if a guide lead me .
Moreover , I can share how I feel in the place with other people .
