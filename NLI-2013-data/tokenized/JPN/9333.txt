I agree with the statement .
Knowing facts is very important but we always need to think , and I believe that it is more important to have better understanding of things and concepts to make good decisions in real life .
Understanding ideas and concepts give you a skill of sloving a problem when you come across to something .
Understanding ideas and learning facts are closely connected .
If you have an idea about something , you think about it , learn about it , and everntually learn a fact .
In another word , is a process of learning facts .
For example , if you know what is happening in Iraq , if you do n't have an understanding for it , you do n't do anything for it .
Facts without your opinion or concepts are useless even though how important the fact is .
Process will leads you to the result and you learn a lot of things through out the process .
I believe this from my experience .
Once when I had a homework to search about the Titanic , I was just looking for a website that says what happened to it in the beginning , but soon I realized there were lots of things that happened other than sinking nad I learn much more interesting event that actually happened before it sank .
Process is more important than a fact and i will lead you to the result which is a fact .
Sometimes , I say to myself `` care about process than a fact '' because it is easy to forget and only look for a fact .
