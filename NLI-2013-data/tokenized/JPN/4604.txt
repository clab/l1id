I agree with this statement .
Some advertisements are thinking that to sell their products is the most important this is why they say any different things about the products even on the T.V and newspaper .
Somethimes this things make people angry so much .
But this thing also couse bad for themselfs .

Last time my mom was watching T.V. Then , a advertisements were talking about some stuff for study .
He said that if you use this stuff , you can be so smart and remember so many things spanding just a week .
He was so serious on the T.V and these stuff looked like really good for us .
Then , my mom ordered the stuff for us .
Few days later , we got it and tried to use it but it was not like on the T.V. Actually it was completely different .
So my mom called the company .
Finally we could get buck money but we were looking forward to useing the stuff .
They made us so mud .

In the same case , some people may state this thing to court .
If they so , the company is going to lose .
I heard that the guy , he bought really expensive car on the T.V .
Because he did not have enough money to buy this car .
On the T.V is usually selling more cheeper .
But is was fake .
So he impeached to court and fought against the company .
Finally he won and got money from them .
But even they know it , they continue to sell their products like that .

Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for selling their goods .
But it make consumers so mud and sometimes confused .
They need to think more carefully about consumers as a some people .
Just selling goods is so bud for people 's relationship .
I think when people 's relationship is destroyed , the companys is also destroyed by themselfs .
