As the touring company is more popular resently , the students in the school , some communities and some groups of families go on trip with a tour guide .
I agree with the passage , `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' I will give following two reasons why trip with the tour guide is best way .

In the first , tourists can deepen the knowledge of the place where they trip by the tour guide .
Most tourists is not fammilier with the place ; they do n't know about the language people speaks and history , what manner and behaivor people respects and so on .
Therefore , tourists is necessary to inform tourists what intresting there are ; as a result , they have fun in the place .

Next , tourists needs the tour guide who leads there .
They may lose their way , and be in troble with the paticular language and culture .
For example , American childreen who go to Singapore recieved a heavy panishment in order to not follow the rule there : they throw their gum in the public place .
If a tourist was along with them and teach Singapore 's rule to them , they would n't be in the troble there .

Therefore , the best way to travel is group led by tour guide in which tourists should have fun the travel in a patucular place .
They can learn about the place more and do n't in trouble term of the tour guide .
