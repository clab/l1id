The world continues to explore and build modern technologies to facilitate our lives or simply to satisfy our curiosity to know more about the world and what we can benefit form it .
Cars are one of these many successful inventions .
Despite their usefulness and popularity , cars present environmental problems .
This issue of global warming and the greenhouse effect is one that is talked about environmentalists and world leaders .
Due to the efforts to tackle this problme one may expect a decrease in car usage over the next twenty years .
However , I do not think that there will be fewer cars because there are no signs of decreasing vehicles in our current society .
Moreover , its efficiency and luxuries it can provide outweigh the issue of global warming for anyone to consider the imediment of car usage .
There are also hybrid cars which I believe will increase in number and users .

In the status quo , rather than seeing a decrease in people using cars , we see more people acquiring them .
The various brands of the cars continue to advertise their new luxury carriages and customers continue to appreciate cars .
This has been the case for many years since cars first came into existence and unless some new , wild , completely advantageous invention is revealed to replace cars , I am inclined to believe that there will be more cars in use around the globe .

The increasing carbon dioxide emmisions and its effects on the earth has and continues to be explored .
In efforts to minimise the harms caused by all the human inventions , including cars , car brands are now advertising hybrid cars which run on natural fuels that cause considerably less pollution .
Such inventions prove that people love cars and cannot part with them right now when they do not see the complete significance of global warming .
Hybrid cars are a solution to solve the problem of wanting to decrease carbon dioxide emissions but also to continue driving .
Thus , there is no need , in the eyes of many people , to stop driving cars for any reason .

Cars continue to expand its horizons as it improves its abilities to do things .
For example , car navigation systems and dvd player insertions are all new improvements to satisfy customers .
The usefuleness and its easy use attracts more people to obtain their driving license and for drivers to renew their cars every so often .
Furthermore , owning a car gives the owner responsibility in life , heightening their feeling of independence .
In addition to this new acquired independence and property , one begins to be interested in the type , make and abilities the car possesses .
To show off with the car becomes a new motive .
Furthermore , with developing economy all over the world , more people are willing to spend their fortune on cars .
Such arousals in emotions and considerable effects on one 's life only interest people to buy and use cars .

Twenty years seem almost too soon for people to stop driving cars .
With developing technology and economy I can only conclude that we will continue to see as many cars in use if not more .
Only a new technology like `` floo powder '' in the world of Harry Potter could possibly divert people 's attentions away from cars .
