I agree with the idea that young people thesedays are reluctant to spend their time on participating community activities .
There are two reasons for this : distance from their home town and lack of information .

First , young people tend to live in urban areas apart from their original communities for the purpose of pursuing their study or works .
Since more reputed universities or jobs providing higher incomes are usually available only in cities , young people are more likely to choose to live in urban areas rather than to stay with their parents at rural areas .
I am the case actually .
I have been lived separately from my parents since I entered university which locates far from my home town at the age of 19 .
Since I have lived far away from my village , I could not manage to go back so frequently , and as a result , I have not been able to join any community activities since then .
Thus , the physical distance from their communities make young people impossible to spend their time on supporting their communities .

Secondly , young people feel that it is less necessary to support their communities because of the lack of information on present situation .
This is closely related to the first point which I mentioned above .
Since they are living apart from their community , they scarcely have an opportunity to communicate with their neighbours and to know the present situation of their communities .
Because of the lack of communications , youths cannot realize what kind of help their communities really need .
Therefore , young people become less concerned about problems happened in their communities .

In conclusion , young people currently tends not to use their time to assist their communities , since they are living isolated from their community and there are rare chance for young people to know the actual situation in their communities .
