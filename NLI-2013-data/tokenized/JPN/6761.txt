I agree with this statement .
There are three reasons .
First , in twenty years there will be more trains at the city than today .
So people can choose car or train when they go out .
Second , in twenty years people will be worry about the environment than today .
I think that people should be worry about the environment of the world future .
Third in twenty years the number of the population will be getting down .
That is why I agree with this statement .
