These days less and less young people attend their community-meetings .
And I storngly agree with the idea .
Young people who do not spend time to help their communities have some reasons .

First , they do not know the importance their communities .
Although they depend their lives upon them , they do not notice the fact .
Because of it they think they do not have to wast their time to help their communities .

Second , there are a lot of much more attractive things than working for their communities around them .
For example they want to spend their time to work for their part time jobs rather than to work for their communities .
It is because of their benefits .
That is , even if they work for their communities hard they cannot get money .
So they decide to spend their time more attractive thing .

All in all , as I said above , nowadays they think they do n't want to spend thier time to help their communities .
