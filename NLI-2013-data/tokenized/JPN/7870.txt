Today , the tourism has increased rapidly and it has become one of the biggest business in the world .
It is because the development of the technology allowed people go abroad much easier than before both physically and economically and even the people who do not have the enough ability to go around the foreign countries become to be able to do it .
For such people , the group travel with the tour guide can be the very strong help to have the good travel , however , this kind of travel is not best way to enjoy the travevel ; people can not feel the real atmosphere of the travel which is the precious for the traveling .
As the reason why the group travel can not feel the atmosphere , two reasons can be told .
First is because of the bus thay use for transition and the other is the fact that they can not touch with the real local culture .

People traveling in a group with a tour guide often use the bus to go around and seldom walk by themselves .
If they walk , the couse is decided by the guide and they have few opportunities to explore by themselves .
It causes that they can see only the famous points of the country , and sometimes causes the fact that people even do not know where they are in the country .
To walk and to exploring the city - not only the famous points but also the usual cities views - really helps to know the atmosphere there and this is also the part of the traveling .
So , using bus and going only the famous points with the tour guide can not feel the atmosphere and it might mean that people lose the very important part of the traveling .

Also , the traveling in the group with the tour guide never offer the opportunities to contact with the local people .
If there is , this is still the opprtunity which is managed by the tour guide ; so it is fake .
The experiences of the real contact with the local people and the problem that might occure sometimes are also precious to know the atmosphere and it is also very important part of the traveling .
In the group travelling , all things are decided by the guides and any surprising events to feel the atmosphere seldom happen .

So , in these sences , the traveling in a group with a tour guide does not offer the opportunities to feel the real atmosphere of the country , therefore , is not good way to have the precious experiences of the traveling .
