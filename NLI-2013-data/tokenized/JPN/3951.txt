I totally agree the statment'Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ' .
I will evaluate with the following paragraphs .
Before I tell you my reasons , I state that what is mean by ` helping communities ' .
For me it is working in society in your own time by free which means Volunteer .
First of all nowadays young people have a lot of things to do in school .
For example a small test everyday , big exam onece a month and Leaving certificate for end of the school which is really important for the colleage .
What I mean is the young people must study for them and which takes enough a lot of time .
Hence it is difficult to have time for comminties .

The second reason is there is so many ways to having fun at the weekend .
In the past there were no Prikura machinne ( taking pictures of yourself and freinds. ) , Shopping , Game Center and Disco .
They are very popular for young people .
Hence they are much prefer to do them instead of helping comunties .

Also in my opinion young people have an imagie for community which is too hard .
They care more about their fashion , the points in school , Celeblities , gosships and all .
They never interested in the real societies .

As you can see the society and people has been cahnged .
In other words young people have things to do for themselves .
Although I know that they are selfish and ridiculous opinions but that is why i beleive young people nowdays do not give enough yimr y
