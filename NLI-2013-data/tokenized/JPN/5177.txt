Some people say that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Certainly , many companies spend much money for advertisement because it may have much effects on the sales increase .
But , personally , I think many users are getting wiser to find out that many products are not necessarily as good as they are promoted in the advertisements .
Therefore , I do n't agree that most products seem much better than they really are .

My primary reason is that we have become wise to find out whether the products are really good or not despite of the advertisements .
Recently , we often hear the news that people were deceived by the false advertisements and paid much money for the worthless products .
For example , where I lived , Japan , cosmetic surgery is very popular among young women generation .
However , I have read the article that many women suffered damage by cosmetic surgery although they paid high price for it .
Many advertisements of cosmetic surgery describe only the good effects and does n't mention the possibility of bad supplementle effects after surgery .
As a result of these bad news , women tend to cast a doubt on the advertisements and investigate the hospital enough before paying money .
As a result , many private hospitals which provided bad treatment is suffering from the loss of customers .

The another reason is that some advertisements exaggerate the products too much and they do n't seem the products much better than they are .
For example , in Japan , we often see the advertisements of English school or materials for studying English .
some of them say that we could master English if we go to school for 10 days .
Who believes such an advertisement ?
I think some advertisement using unrealistic words too much does not look the products well .

In conclusion , I do n't think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
We have learned that we should not believe what advertisement says without having a doubt on it .
