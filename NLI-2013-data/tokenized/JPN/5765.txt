I disagree with the statement , `` In twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
Nowadays , almost all families in the developed countries have at least one car .
They use it for various reasons , such as traveling , commuting , and they use it even if they are going to near places .
Car has been the most popular way for transportation .

On the other hand , the developing countries are still struggling to get their ways of living more comfortable .
They are trying to develop their techniques for industry .
It is obvious that those people living in developing countries desiring to get their countries more developed .
And when they managed to developed , what would they want to possess ?
If I were the poor living in developing country , I am sure that I would desire to have a nice car , or may be a television .
Even if I got rich , and bought a television for my family , I would still desiring to have a car .

On our earth , there are still many developing countries .
The number of cars we can count know is still a tip of the iceberg .
Twenty years later , we would have more developed countries than now .
If this really happens , the noumber of car would increase .
How am I to forsee that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years ?

However , there may be an development in car industry .
That may result in a new type of car , but it is only that .
Even if car has developed , I think there would be no change in our expression .
We would call our new type of car as usual ; car .
There have been many developments in things around us , such as television , mobile phone , and computer .
If we think about our early developments in those things , we would be able to imagine that there would be no change in how we call it .

For example , computer has changed alot .
First , it was only an big box that can calculate the number quickly .
We had to have a big space to have one .
Although , look at our modern computer .
Our technology has enabled us to have own conputer for each of us .
We could not have imagined it when we first saw the big box that can only calculate .
Now , we can even communicate with people all over the world .
Even if there are big difference between the first computer and the computer now , we call it in same way .

For these reasons , I disagree with the opinion .
