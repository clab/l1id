I disagree with traveling in a group led by a tour guide .
Scinse I would rather be alone than do something with others , I wouldnot like to be in a group .
First , I would rather go wherever I want with what I feel that time .
I love to adventure to the places where i have never been or had never known .
Tours with some tour guides are generally planned by them .
It may prevent me to do something I want .
Planned things do not suit to me .
Moreover I am not a very timely person .
Therefore I am afraid that I would not be able to be on time .

Second , I like to enjoy by myself , which does not mean I do not like people though .
Of cause , there are many benefits that as being a member of tour group .
The tour guide may explain a lot of infornmation abd details such as what kind of places they are , or these history and what is famous for .
I am sure it would greatly help my tour fantastic , but I would rather than find new things by my own .
I believe that it is so much exciting and I can enjoy my tour more as discovering .

As being in tour group , I might feel like I am watched from other people every time .
I might not enjoy much because of this feeling .
