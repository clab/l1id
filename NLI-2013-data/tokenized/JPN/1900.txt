I do n't think young people enoy life than older people do .
It seem to be so , because younger people are energic and spirited than elder people , and the ranges of action they can do are wider than elder .
That 's why elder people say `` the yourth enjoy their lif than us . ''

However , I doubt young people is more enjoyed their life than elder people ?
The first reason is that the the yourth impossible to escape from comming across the lot of ploblems .
The ploblems are may be about friends , parents , future , and oneselfs .
They do n't know how to handle them .

They have to think over about ploblems , and expelience difficult situtation , and spend hardtime .
And then , they finaly find the way of solution by oneself .
This process need for growing to adult .
And then , when they mature enough , they finally know how to enjoy the life accutually .
Sometimes , the yourth enjoying themselves mean ecaping from uneasy .
So it 's not real enjoy .
Just discourse .

And there is also money aspect .
For exsample , I love music very much , and also desire to go the gig of the favorite artists .
However when I was high school student , i never go the gig , just because Id did n't have enough money .
But after entering University , I started to work as a ppirt time , and finaly could go the gig .
That was wonderful expeliene .
But still now , the times I could go the gig is limited .
Because the capital is shortage .
My friend who is already work as full-part time can go the gig whenever she wants .

So thaI think elder people well know the solution way of difficults they encounter by expelience and have well finance .
So , they afford to enjoy their life than the yourth .
