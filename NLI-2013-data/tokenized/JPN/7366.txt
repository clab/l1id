I agree with statement that the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guide .
There are two reasons why , trovel is in a group led by a tour guide is cheeper than private and we may know tour guides recomend places

First of all , in a group led by tour guide is more unexpensive than private travel .
For example , in private , an airplaine cost 3000 dallar for America from Japan .
But use the tour industry service wichi can dicline the cost of plaine to 15000dallar .
However involve the foods and hotel .
it is very cheep .

seconds , we could visit a wounderful place if I joined the tour group .
Guides know a lot of good places in there country .
Tour guide must study hard about sightseen to become .
so tour guide is professional of travel and sightseen .

All of theres reason I sustain that the most good way to travel is a led by a tour guide .
