I agree with this opinion .
I have two reasons for this .
At first , We will be able to think about a thing with broad value if we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I think that a person who specialize in one specific subject is apt to think about a thing with one value .
For example , we have to use knowledge of develoment economics and environment economics at least when we think about how to improve the problems of developing countries .
We cannot think about how to solve it if we only use one subject .

At second , we need broad value and broad knowledge in this time .
That is because the world is getting international more and more .
We have to think about a thing at any sight .
For example , It is about problems of war .
A war is difficult problem to improve .
So we have to approach it with broad knowledge .
We have to consider economical , financial and philosofical problems of it .
There are so many things in the world that we cannot think and solve them without broad knowledge .

For this two reasons , I think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
It is sure that the world has many complex problems .
And it is also sure that these problems cannot solve without broad knowledge .
So I assure you that we must have broad knowledge and broad view in whole of our lives .
