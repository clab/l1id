I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I personally like new products and often buy those new advertised products by TV .
However , I usually get disappointed and regret spending extra money .
I will explain why I think the advertisements make products seem better than they really are .

For instance , I often believe that the advertisements of cosmetic products are way too much exagerated .
We often see the beautiful models wearing new products and telling us the difference from other products in advertisements .
After we watch the advertisement , we feel that we might be able to change ourselves and become like the model who advertised it .
This is wrong .
We forget that the model is already beautiful without wearng this new product .
She might look different with new product , however , it does not mean that we , who all buy new product , can have face or be like her .
For so many times , I was disappointed to try new cosmetics noticing that I look nothing different from using other products .
I think the cosmetic advertisements make products seem much better than they really are through advertising with beautiful models and professional make-up artists .

Another example is the advertisement of frozen food .
Since I do not cook often , I always buy frozen foods for my dinner .
In the TV advertisements , those foods look so good and delicious , but in reality , they are not as good as they look like in TV advertisements .
That is because in advertisements , the company use recent cooked food and film or take pictures wth the perfect angle decided by professional person .
The disappointment after cooking several minuites in microwave oven is huge for me and sometimes I feel anger buying those products .
Some products look completely different from the ones advertised in TV .

I think that the most advertisements have tried to show products much worth than they really are .
I know that is the role and nature of advertisements in this consumer society .
We all should keep that in mind .
