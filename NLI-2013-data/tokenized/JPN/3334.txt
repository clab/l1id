I agree with the statement .
Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
In my opinion , there are several reasons about this .

The first reason that young people nowadays do n't give the time to helping their communities .
I think that young people do n't try to communicate with people who lives in near them .
Young people tend to stay in their house or they are go out from house .
But it is not only young people .
Nowadays people do n't often join the communities .
And people do n't communicate with each other agglessive .

A second reason that young people do n't give the time to helping their communities .
They use their time for themself not for their communities .
They use the time for themself than they use for their communities .
Because it is age that people priority identity now .

Lastly , why the young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are no advantages if young people give time to helping their communities .
So they do n't feel requirement to give time to helping their communities .

Nowadays young people tend to avoid communicate with people near them .
People will be more isolated from communities .
That is why , young people nowadays do not give enogh time to helping their communities .
