Successful people shoul not try new things especialy it involved risks .
There are mainly three reasons which are life time is limited , people is not living by themselves , and we have place to lurn how to reduce risks .

First , our life time is limited .
If a person try to be a successful parson , it requres many efforts to reach the goal .
At the same time , spending huge amount of time is needed .
Therefore we spend most of life time to achive a gole , and most of the time there is no extra time fore anther time for spending .
And there are approplieit age to do everythings .

Second , in generally we usually have family , and we need to support the family .
It makes hard to take any risks which may become a case to seperat the family .
Forthermore , it is imppsible to throw away the family rerationship becase I believe the relrationship is the most important thing in owr life .

Finaly , we have place to lurn how to reduce the risks .
Even if a new charenge cost the own life , some people cannot stop try to start new thing .
In this case we have pleace to go to avoiding the risk and get the knowlage before start new thing .
It is universitis or colleges which give us the new life style .
After graduet the university or college , it makes esier , at the same time the new thing become familiar thing .

These three reasons are very enought to say that successful people should not try the new things with risks .
And there are so many other choices and so many way to avoid the risk .
