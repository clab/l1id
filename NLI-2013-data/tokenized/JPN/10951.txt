I agree this statment , because if they do noy have a risk. , they wo n't grow theriself .
If they do n't grow theriself , they wo n't success .
If you do just what you know now , your skill for everything wo n't change forever .
And to challege to other thing is to make success .

I think that the successful people took a risk .
If they do n't take a risk , they do n't succseed about everything .
In my case , I took a risk of luaguage .
I 'm studying abroad in Canada now and go to the high school same as Canadian .
That was hard for me .
I could not speak English very much and was afraid of speaking to Canadian and useing English in front fo Canadian .
But I diecided myself to come here and study English .
I realized again and I became to try to speak to everyone though they are Canadian .
Finally , I could make friends and got good relationship between my host family .
And to try everything was changed my mind like kindly and more positive .

Second , in my opinion , if somenody do n't want to take a resk and challeange anything , they wo n't grow theriself .
To grow yourself , you must do something for you .
I guess that something include some risk .
But if you do't grow , you can not be successed .
Bucause , your mind is same as before you do n't callenge anything .

In japan , i did not take a risk and challenge to anything so i did not grow at all .
But I came here i did growed a lot .
Bucause I did challenge a lot and to grow myself .
So i got a friends , good relationship and confidence to everything .

Finally , I think to challenge is to make success .
If you do n't challeng , you don'y have anything even gad mark or result .
You do n't get anything and you do n't successed .

For these three reason , I agree this statement ; Successeful people had a risk for challenging .
