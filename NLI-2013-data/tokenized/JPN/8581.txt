I agree that it is important for student to understand ideas and concepts for several reasons .
First , it is good to understand the ideas and concepts .
Because if they understand ideas and concepts , they can study more easy , and they are might interested in the ideas and concepts .
For example , when I studied at school , my teacher did not teach ideas and concepts .
Therefore , I was always comfused about it , and I did not understand what they want to say or what they want to teach us .
Therefore , I think they should teach ideas and concepts .
Second , if they understand it , they can say their opinion about these .
I think that it is connect with develope about ideas and concepts .
If they can say opinion and the opinion is good or useful , it is good to develope these .
And it is goodfor students to practice saying opinion .
Third , if they understand ideas and concepts , it is might useful in their future .
If they do not understand ideas and concepts , they are not interested in these , and they think they do not want to use in future .
I think if they know ideas and concepts , they are going to want to learn more or they want to know fact .
If teacher want student learn more , I think it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
