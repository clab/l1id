I agree with this statement .
Becouse I know many people who tried new things and took risks to success .
One man came to study hair cutting to New York 30 years ago by him self .
He is japanese who I met in New York .
At that time when he came New York by ship , it was n't common at all .
Just few japanese were living in New York and nobody had n't tried to come studying hair cut .
When he came New York , he was so poor and could't speak English at all .
He did n't know how he could learn hair cutting .
So he just went into hair salon and asked to teach .
And also he tried to make friends little by little .
After few years later he got chance to have a shop .
Now he has many salon all of the world .

My father is also one person who took risks .
He is living in small city in Japan .
He is an archtecter and he has a office by himself .
So he has to do all works by himself .
I think it is a risk .
He can do everything how he wants , but when he is sick nobody do n't his job .
But he success very well becouse of it .
