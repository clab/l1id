I disagree to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I have two reasons to support my opinion .
First of all , I think there is a limit that people can learn .
If they want to study many academic subjects , the knowledge of them become usefulless .
I think people cannot concentrate them with such a lot of subjects at once !
It has no meanings that people have usefulless knowledge .

Secondly , all of the people must have the subject they are good at and not so .
For example , I belong to the Fuculty of Arts and Letters .
I think I am good at English and Japanese but not good at Math and Science .
My friends in this Faculty also say that .
On the other hand , my friends who are in the Faculties of Science , Engeneering , Agriculture say that they are good at Math and Science but not good at Japanese .
It is obviously on hand !
Studying the subjects that people are not good at is not effective .
They feel more boring when they study such subjects than when they study ones they like .

These are the reasons why I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
To concentrate with one subject in particular you are interested in , it is done a lot of great studies each sections .
