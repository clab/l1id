I agrre it .
I think successful pelple tried new things and taked risks .
Try is make a light of future .
But some people get damage after tried , but I think all success pople got damage before success .
They tried again and again and get success .

First of all , if you try to something and try to accomplish , you should get a lot of problem at the middle , but do not quit when you tired .
because you have a lot of chances yet .
New things did not try to everybody , so if you accomplish it , you could make a big future .

Second , look at the around who success people .
They do not say get easy about success .
They got a lot of wall and became a miserable then they became a rich or famous .

Third , new things could makes us huppy .
Now , we have a lot of technology .
For example , television , call phone , car , and micro chip that makes us better than long years ago .
If we do not have them right now , we can not live in this world .
In addition , thechnology is developing now too .

Im deed , I think we have to agree it , because you living and using in the new technology world , so it means that meny people tried and accomplish something .
Why do not dissagree it ?
If you try to something , we could get a lot of new things than now .
