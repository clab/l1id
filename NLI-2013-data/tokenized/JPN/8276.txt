I agree with the following statement .
It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
In addition , in my opinion , it is hard to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .

To learn facts , the students do not need to have their own ideas , they just remember these facts and it is really hard because the facts do not have any backgrounds , concepts , and ideas .
For example , in the history class , I often just remember the facts , like what happened in 1945 , I just remembered a lot of events in the text books without thinking .
As I thought , I got a great score on the test but a few days later , I forgot these events that I remembered .
I did not understand about the events at all , just remembered them for the tests .
I think this is not leanig or studying .

I think every things have reasons and results .
When I am interested in something that I have not known I always think of the reasons and results , not the facts .
For instance , In history class , the theacher taught me many things which have been happened and many people who affected to many things .
I preffer to think about why they did so than what is happened because there is many reasons and jenerally it is so complex .
It is really interesting to me and I noticed that if I could understand their ideas , concepts or details , I never forget these memories .
I was really interested in Japanese history and especially , Ryouma Sakamoto .
He is really famous person in Japan and he has many strategies for life .
I researched about him and his effects , and I think I could understand his ideas and comsepts .
Now , I never forget about him because I could understand his ideas and concepts , not only things that he did .

If people want to understand something correctly and deeply , I think people should to understand the ideas and concepts , not only facts .
