Almost all people have some experiences of trip , and there experiences will become great memory of their mind .
There are alot of styles of trip .
Some people go to trip with a tour guide ; hoewver , I think that going to trip with guide is not best way because people can create own plan , and they have enough time to trip

First of all , people can manage the trip plan .
It is very imprtant thiing for them because they can create original plan .
Moreover , thinking about trip plan become funtastic memory for people .
I have a experiene about this situation .
when I was a college student , I went to Canada to trip with my friend .
It was terrific becuase we could create own trip plan .
Moreover , we struggled English , but it was very necessary memory for them .
If we had gone to Canada with a tour guide , we could not have taken such a imprtant experience .

Secondly , people can go to the everywhere they want because some guides strict .
Moreover , most tours which present a tour guide are not free , and people cannnot have enough time to look everywhere .
Traveling without a guide are free , and people do not have to concern about time .
When I went to Canada with my friends , we could go to everywhere we wanted .

Therefore , traveling with a tour guide is not best way for me because there have alot of benefits .
People can think about plan which is suite for them , and they can spend enough time to spend only their time .
Moreover , the experiences become good memory for them .
