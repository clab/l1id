In the past 10 years , I have traveled in my own country and in all over the world .
The best trip was going to Australia by myself in my early 20's .
It was my first traveling oversea .
And I enjoyed to experience the new world .
There was only once that I traveled in a group by a tour guide which was one of the high ivents .
I had a lot of fun with traveling in a group though , but now , as I am looking back to the old memories , I do not agree that the best way to travel in a group by a tour guide .
There are two reasons why I would rather traveling by myself than taking a group tour .
They are feeling freely to plan my own trip and spending time and expence as I want .

First of all , I do not want to go a place where I am not even interested in visiting .
I would like to plan my trip for just for myself , to visit how , or where I want to go .

Another reason why I want to travel alone is that I do not want to spend time and money to go , or to watch thing .
It is a very precious and limited time when I decide to travel .

For those reasons why I do not agree with the statement are feeling free to plan my trip and spending time for myself that the best way to travel is in a group bt a tour guid .
