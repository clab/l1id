I disagree wit the statement .
I do not think there will be fewer cars than now at least in twenty years .
I would say that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in fifty years .

Now the earth is getting warm , which does not effect in good way for neither creatures including human beings nor plants , for instance , forests .
This thing called gloval warming are considered that it will melt graciers around polar regions .
It causes the increasing of the surface of the sea .
Many people would have to move to somewhere higher altitude .
Also the warming would cause skin cancers .
Because of really strong X-Lay .
Some people even these days have possibilities to get skin cancer , but if it gets much hotter and stronger X-Lay more people would get it .

One of the methods to solve the problem or alleviate the matter , we should decrease the emittion of carbon dioxide from gases of cars .
People are actually trying to do that , but it is really hard to make it in a couple of decades .
First of all , people in all of the world need to pay attention and focus on doing that .
I do not think everyone would pay attention about it till it becomes obvious that the earth faces to real danger .
Moerover , not all people , but also all countries , government need to work on it with citizens .
Then they need to work on it together .

There is another reason that I disagree with the statement .
Many more kinds of cars are invented and made recently such as cars with new functions .
If producters keep creating cars , the numbers of cars would not be changed .
I think it would rather increase the numbers of cars .

More new technologies such as cars we have , more problems we have in the future .
Decreasing numbers of cars is pretty hard so that I do not agree with the statement .
