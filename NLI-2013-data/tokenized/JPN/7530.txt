In my opinion , the best way of traveling is in a group led by a tour guide .
Because in this way , traveler who come to the unknown area can do sightseeing whrere is not only popular shops and buildings , but also picked up place by tour conductor who know all this place , and do not careful for dangour of the area .
Traveler may not lost their way .

If I had been in situation making traveling plan , I should have confused .
In contrary , They can not make the plan for traveling by themself .
If they would have thinking the place and building they want to go like clearly .
In addition to , they may lose oppotunity like meeting with native and local people .
Therefore I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
