I agree with that the most adevertisements make procucts seem better than they really are .
I have two reasons .
First , the informations on the products are different from the real contents .
For exeample , I often use cataloge shopping to buy my clothes .
At that time , the clothes sended from company are totally deffrent the pictures .
the size , color Seconds , the advertisements do not send real messages .
For instance , the rabel of foods says only main materals .
The advertisements need our life so , it have to send real information or massage .
