I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
My opinion is based upon the following reasons :

First , the number of the oppotuinities to contact the communities has been decreasing because of the development of internet or other erectiric device or the increase of hard-working life styles .
Nowadays , we will finish almost all businesses without facing any person of our communities .
For example .
in my childhood .
security for criminal was regarded as one of the most important role of a commnity .
However , recently , the security has been thought of as one of the most significant facilities of a house or an apartment themselves .
I believe most Japanese people depend on the security facilities rather than their communites .

Second , young people tend to seek for more interesting or stimulaous lives .
Except for a few arban areas , I believe most young people feel boring in their lives .
In quest of stimlus , many young people will reject and leave their own commnities .
\

Third , there is the shortage of effective resorces to provide young people with the imformation on the oppotunities to be asked toward young people to take part in .
So , if young people are interested in the activities in their commnities , they will not able to use such oppotunities effectivelly .

Fourth , there is no education on how important people are involved in their communities .
It is very impotant to contact with their communities because such contacts will bring about the discovery regarding the affairs closest to us and make our life more enjoyable .
In additon , as I stated belore and has been intensively discussed .
the relationship between young people and their commnunities are essential to precause criminal affairs or other dangerous things .

For these reasons , I agree the above statement .
