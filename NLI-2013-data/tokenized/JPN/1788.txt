I do not agree the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
It is true that young people have more physical capacity than young people , but older people have more precious experiences than young people .
So older people also enjoy their life .

Young people have a lot of energy , physical capacity .
So it is easy for them to travel foreign countries and able to have valueable experience .
On the contrary , it is difficult for old people to do such a experience .
But they are able to think and find many interesting event around them .
They may not be able to have experienced foreign countries , but they are able to have enough time to love cherryblossoms in bloom in spring , and they also enjoy the rain drops in rainy season .
Many young people might not think such a thing , but I think it also can be a element for enjoyable life .

Second abundunt physical capacity does not always people happy .
Recently , there are serious social problem like a murder , violation , and so on .
These problem is derived from innapropriate use of physical capacity , that is innaproproate use us youth .
Older people also do such a thing , but the probability to do such a foolish thing less happens .

Youth is very useful element to enjoy their life , but it is also become an important element to be an old .
