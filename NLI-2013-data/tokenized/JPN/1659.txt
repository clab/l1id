The question of wheter we should have general knowledge of many academic areas than specific knowledge in just one area is interesting one .
Of course , there is no simple answer to this problem .
However , personally , I think that we have to take broad knowledge from many subjects .

Firstly , general knowledge is connected with total context of science .
In spite that we have very good specific knowledge in one subject , if we do not understand the role and value of that knowledge in the science , we cannot use that understanding or skill freely .

Secondly , it means helpful for explaining to people that academist have a lot of knowlege without his or her major .
For example , if he or she is not only specialist but also person who have many understanding other topics , that person can explain the academic knowledge to use many interesting examples .
This fact makes us understand that having various broad knowledge help to realize and solve the difficult problem to ordinary people .

Finally , that academist can explain the complexed quetion easily by using a lot of examples form his broad knowledge points out the possibility of inter-academic communication .
One example of this is the subject of cultural studies in U.K ..
Sometimes , the scientist of this area have many knowlege to sociology , and there is very good explain in university .

Therefore , I agree that it is better to take general knowledge of lots of academic areas than to specialize in one specific area .
As I see it ,
