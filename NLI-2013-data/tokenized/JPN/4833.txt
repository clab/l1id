I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I think most of the advertisements are to trick people .
First of all , advertisements are made to appeal their products to people .
When the companies make advertisements , it must appeal what is so good about their products and attract people to buy it .
So they emphasize , sometimes exagerate , good parts of the products so that people will know what is cool about the products .
Of course , they do n't highlight any bad parts of the products .
As a result , when customers buy the products and find out that there are some bad parts , which were never mentioned in the advertisements .
When this happens people find that advertisements made products seemed much better than they really are .

For example , let 's say that there are two advertisements about two erasers .
One says `` This is the best eraser ever invented . ''
And the other one says `` This eraser is better than normal erasers . ''
I think most of the people will buy the eraser that was advertised as the best eraser .
Probably there is not much difference in those two .
But it is better than buying `` little above average '' eraser .
But in this case , apparently the advertisement made the eraser seem much better than they really are .

I bought a mechanical pen , that was advertised that they wo n't get my hands tired .
But when I used the pen , I did n't feel any difference from using the other pens .
It made my hands tired .
I did n't have a high-expectation for the products , so I was fine about it .
But this was a good example of products being not what they were supposed to be according to the advertisement .

Even though that advertisements do n't give very accurate idea of the products , people know that most advertisements exagerate their products as a common sense .
So I do n't think there is a major problem to overadvertise their products .
