I do not agree the idea that it is bettr to have borad knowledg of many academic subjects to specialize in one specific subjects .
I have tow reson of it : our job and interesting for people .

First , specific skills are useful when people find their job .
Most of campanies want people who have them , because they can give the campany new idea or new skill .
In fact , when we have interview test for enter some company , we need to apeel our unique points and differences from others .
Specific skills are provide for good work .

Second , to specialize in one specific subject is interesting for ourselves and for people around us , because people who have their specific subject know something that everyone do not know .
They can choose only one subject what they want to study , moreover they can give everyone surprising , interest or notice .
For example , my teacher was major in Japanese history at university so he has specific knowledge of it .
He often tells his students interesting story .

We do not know most of them so we always be really amaized but his story is really interesting .
In conclusion , it is good for us to have one specific subject in that we can get our job easily and we can give people around us amazing .
If you have it , you are looked as a great peason
