I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I will explain why I think so in following passages .
First , advertisers think what to do to sell more products everytime .
Advertisements are one of the way to sell products .
When the advertisers make advertisements , which advertisement is able to attract harts of consumuer products seem very good or not so much ?
Exactly prior one is able to get harts of the consumer .

Second , consumer might hesitate to buy products if the products seem worse than advertisements which they saw .
But first of all , advertisers have to meke consumer feel to buy products .
If the consumer do n't think to buy the products , they wo n't buy anything abslutoly .
Also , if advertisements are not able to attract consumer 's hart , the consumer wo n't think to buy products on the advertisements .
So advertisers have to attract the hart of the consumer first of all .

In conclution , advertisers want to sell much more products .
To do so , they have to attract harts of consumer .
It is needed by advertisers to make products seem much better than they really are on advertisements .
I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
