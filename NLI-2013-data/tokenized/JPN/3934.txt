I agree with this statemant for three reasons .
Firstly , many young people , even elementary school students , have a lot of things to do after school .
Some student have to do their home work , some student have to go to cram school .
They have no time to concern about their communities .

Secondly , the way of playing has changed .
Developing of computer games , for example , young people tend to play inside of their houses .
The longer they spend thier free time inside of thier houses , The lesser they spend helping thier communities .

Lastly , not only young people , but also society has changed .
Young people in thirty years ago , they used to play on the street , and they had plenty oppotunities to communicate and to help thier communities .
Recently , the number of crime in the communities increasing grately .
Strees near their house are no more safe place .
Neibours are no more reliable .

Some people will say that there are still young people who helps their community .
However , thinking about the increasing number of old people who dieing alone , we cannot avoid admitting the decreasing of young people 's time to helping thir communities .

It is sad , but it is true .
