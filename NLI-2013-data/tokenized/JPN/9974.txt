I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take riske ratheer than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I think if a parson who knows something well and using the skill to be success will also be success but it will not be successful as the parson who try new things and take a risks .
The reason I think is because the person who knows how to do well is just following the step that he knows and the he does not have any idea to challenge something new .
That mean is he will never find any better way to do something even if there is one .
Even it is easer to do the thisngs that you already know and more less risky , if you choose the difficult way to try new things there is more chance to success .

When you see the person who are successed , i think most of them tried new things with high risks .
For example there was a man who has own a company which was not doing well , and the one of the worker said that he could improve the things that they sell
