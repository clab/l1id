I can see no reasons to object it .
But I would like to make it clear that this issue is limited to most of advanced countries .
It is needless to say that the infrastructures and facilities is not still prepared in most of developing countries .
Even if the conditions is getting better , it is far away from discussing in this point .
Any way , there are three principal reasons to support that I completely agree .

Firstly , other transportation systems such us a train and a plane have been developing in the matter of time and also in the matter of money .
Now , the number of trains is available everyday .
Of course about a plane , too .
Gradually , the cost has become cheaper than before .
Actually , I could fly to U.S by 300 dollars .
It is much ceaper than before .

Secondly , from environmental point of view , people have changed their minds into preserving clean air .
This is largely due to the fact cars have influenced badly .

Lastly , the family structure has been changing .
For instance , there many families which do not have their child in it .
This means they do not need their cars to go away in more safer way .

I know the importance of cars .
However , I would like to stress the advantages of environmental problem .
To sum up , I agree this idea .
