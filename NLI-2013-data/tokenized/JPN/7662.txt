Some people disagree the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
However , personally I agree the statement for the following reasons .

First , traveling with a tour guide could save time .
For example , in 2005 I traveld to Italy with my mother by using a tour company .
My mother and I wanted to go to Italy for a long time and so we were looking forward to visiting museums and historical places .
However , there are many museums and famous places in Italy .
We worried about how would we do to see efficiently .
We consulted with our tour guide and she gave us good advice .
She changed out tour route to be able to visit efficiently , where we wanted to go .
This example clearly shows that traveling with a tour guide could save time .

Second , traveling with a tour guide could learn more .
When I perticipated in the tour goint to India in 2004 , I were led by a Indian tour guide .
We went to many temples , but I did not have much knowlege of Hindu and Muslim , Indian religions .
Then , he lectured me the religion and the means of pictures and structures in the temples .
Also , he answered my questions .
For example , what is the most famous person in India , what is the most popular occupation among Indian women and so on .
I could learn many things from the guide .
The above experience demonstrates that traveling with a tour guide could learn more .

Therefore , I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide .
