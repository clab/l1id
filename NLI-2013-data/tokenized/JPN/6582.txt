I completely agree with this statement .
It costs a lot of money to have a car especially in Japan .
People will find that there is no deal to use cars as transportation .
This considerable reasons are cost , and other way of transportations .

It is expensive to charge gasoline , because of decreasing .
The place where we can get gasoline is now the stage of the war .
I have read that there will be no energy fifty years later .
Not only that it is expensive , but also people are afraid of their future life without energy power , so am I .

There are many kinds of public transportations around us such as bus , train , and air plane .
It saves gasoline not to use private car .
It costs about sixty dollars for a car filled up gus .
On the other hand , it costs about two hundred dollars to get an air plane ticket , then we can go abroad .
In addition , There are so many advantages to use public transportation .
Therefore , people do not have to rely on their own cars .

In conclution , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because people will not be able to pay the expense , and there are other useful foot in our life .
Moreover , we can say that the less people to support riding own cars , the better reactions to the earth .
It means that it is good for environment as well .
I think there are too much cars around us .
