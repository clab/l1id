Although some people say that they best way to travel is in the group led by a tour guide , but I cocnsider that the best way to travel is traveling alone because of several resosns such as spending private time , and can plan the best suitable tour for myself .

Actually .
there are few positive aspects that people should travel as a group with a tour guide .
The tour guide knows a lot of information about the place where we visits : therefore , we can know a lot of interesting information though the tour guide , which the outsider cannot be told usually .
For instance , when I visited Canada , I traveled with tour guide and we could get a lot of local and interesting information about Canada , However , to great extent , traveling by myself is a lot of better than traveling as a gourp led by a tour guide .
If we travel with a tour guide , we cannot usually decide where to go , but every single travel plan would be decided by tour guide .
Therefore , we cannot get free time or spend the time for something we want .
Even though , we do not know much about the place , we can easily use internet or book to make the plan , and prepare for our trip by ourselves .
Therefore , we do not really need to have a tour guide for trip .

Aslo , traveling as a group might bring some problem , when someone in the group has a disability on their physical strength .
For example , if some one very old is in the group then we might need to spend extra time for them because they might not be able to move as fast as young people do .
Also , if someone gets injure on the way of the trip , we need to go to hospital or need to spend time for them .
On the other hand , individual traveling does not have these troubles as much as traveling as a group .
Therefore , I prefer to make a trip as a individual rather than led by a tour guide .

Moreover , I prefer to have a lot of private time rather than spending time with such a huge group .
Therefore , I prefer to spend the private time with myself during the traveling by the car or transportation , Based on my oppinion , the best way to travel is individual traveling rather than travel as a huge group led by tour guide .
Even thoug , tour guide well-planed our tour , I prefer to spend my private time for only myself .
Moreover , I can get a lot of help by reading the book or using the Internet , in order to make the most interesting tour plan for me .
Therefore , I disagree to the idea that the bestr
