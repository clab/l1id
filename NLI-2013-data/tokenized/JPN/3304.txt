I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
as I said I do n't agree because I am also a young people and i also do n't spend that much time on my communities .
I think that it is because we , young people do not have enpough time to spend their time on there communities because of their homeworks .
they has too much homework , so they can not really concentrate what they need to do for themselves , They always get messed up in middle of their homework , they always start crying .

Also another reason that I think is that they always spend their time to play their video games .
they always thiink about finishing the game ina year or some what like that .
and also the bad thing about the video games is that their eyes will get bad .
as they do not limite how much time you can play video games a day , your eyes will burn some day .
( Which means that you wo n't be able to see anything with out the horrile glasses . )
The horrible thing about getting your eyes getting burned is thetyou wo n't be able to see anything without your glasses .
As you wake up on the morning and open your eyes you will always start off the day with the blurry world .
And the world will change for ever .
Sometimes when my mother tells me that one of her friend that got a burnt eye took a surgry and got his/her normal eye back my mom 's friend said `` I never knew that the world was this beatiful '' as she was amaze her eyes again became burt again .
so even though you take a surgery of your eyes it wo n't be any good .

So these were the reasoning that why I agreed with young people now adays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
and my own opinion is that myself also do n't give enough time helping my communities myself .
