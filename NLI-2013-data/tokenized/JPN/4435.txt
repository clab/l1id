Nowadays , we can see lots of advertisements in any where , in the train , bus or on the television and any time when we walk on a street or read newspaper .
Most of advertisements are attractive and wonderful ; howvere , I believe that they make products too better than producuts or goods really are because they always point out only profits of goods , never say disadvantage .

When I see advertisements , I concentrate on their `` beautiful pictures '' that I am often confused whether they are ture or not .
I think the picture in the advertisement show products ' look too good that it appeares clear color , clean , and sometimes it change products ' size ; therefore I often decive by the picture .
Even though recent technology of camera or photo is increasing , the advertisement should make the products naturally .

I wonder that the comments of the advertisement is too parfect even though everyone knows that it is for proceding to sell because I have seen only great comments or explantions .
I know that it is important to write or say advantages , but hope that it is helpful if I can
