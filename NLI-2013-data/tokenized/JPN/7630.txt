I have traveled in many countries with my friends , and my answer for this statement is that it is depend on where we travel , and what purpose we travel .
Almost all of the countries that I have traveled is developed europian countries , like France , England , Germany , and Italy .
Because there are so many travelers there , it is not big deal to travel there without guides .
We can find many guide books in bookstore , and we also can find many information about the place we would go on the internet .
About communication problem , I only could speak Japanese and English , but I did not have big problem traveling there .
There are some merit to have tour guide .
They must be the specialists of that place , so that all the place they led us to must be something important or great .
However , personally I prefer to travel only with my friends because I like to go with flow , in different words , go wherever I want with my feelings .
I also like to find nice place where that nobody would come .
My main purpose is sightseeing , neither shopping , eating , nor girls-hunting .
Therefore , for me , it is better not to have guide with me .

The problem is when we go to some undeveloped countries or dangerous place , like Easten Europe , Middle East , or South East Asia .
I have seen one horror movie `` Hostle '' , which story is like three travelers came to one old Easten Europe country and kidnapped , got killed by criminal groups .
I know the movie is fiction , but it escalate my fear of traveling those undeveloped countries .
When we go to undeveloped countries , there is a big problem .
We can not get a lot of information about that place .
Therefore we might step into dangerous area and be harmed without knowing why .
Also , we might cause problems because of the country 's tradition .
In that case , I think it is better to ask someone who knows about the place a lot to guide us to avoid dangerous situation .
