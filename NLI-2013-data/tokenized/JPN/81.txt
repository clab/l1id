First of all , I would like to refer about the range of `` young people '' and `` old people '' .
I would like to refer `` young people '' , as an university students , and `` old people '' as those parents .

These days , parents , who have sent their children to universities , tend to restart enjoying their own lives .
Untill high school , a number of parents consider their children as immature .
Although , as soon as they enter university , they change their idea that their children are no longer immature .
Therefore , after their children are grown up to university students , parents shift their life for enjoying themselves .
In my opinion , I am against to the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do , in terms of studying and relationships between friends .

Firstly , young people , who are in universities , have to study a lot .
Most of them have lectures everyday , have to make a presentation , or submit reports .
On the other hand , old people , have no schools nor lectures .
They are totally free to spend their free time .

Secondly , about relashionships between friends .
When people enter universities , the first thing they try to do , is making friends .
It can be an enjoyable thing , but in return , it might be a stressful thing .
They have to seek for an opportunity to speak to a new person , and get to know each other .
Although , parents , who have already gained a friend , do not need to make new friends .
They do not need to experience those stressful times any more .

To give an more considerable instance , my mother enjoys more of her life after my enterance to university .
She goes out with her best friend more often , go out with her to see a play , movies , etc .
Moreover , she is making more time to stay with her husband .
They go out for a drive , or take a walk with our dog .

From these facts I can maintain that parents are enjoying their life , as much as university students do , in terms of school affairs and relationships between colleagues .
As we see parents , as old people , from these two points , we can say that it is true that they are enjoying their life .
It might be not an exaggeration to say that old people are enjoying their lives much more than younger people .
From these reasons , I am against to the idea that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
