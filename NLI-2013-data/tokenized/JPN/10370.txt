I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because nothing happens without trying something new .
I could also be able to learn new thing from risks .
Since I already know the thing , that would not tell me anymore First , if I am afraid of doing something new and do n't make any action , I would n't get any reaction which I needed .
Trying new things and taking risks , I can concentrate on doing the things .
Without risk , I might spoil myself because of the lack of tentions .
For example , when i came to America to learn English , I was afraid of speaking English and making mistakes ; therefore , I tried to escape having a long conversation with Americans .
Short one like greeting made me calm because i knew how to do it .
However , my English skill was n't improved at all .

Second , I think I can learn better from mistakes which are same as risks .
To take risk , I could see new things that i could n't see without risks .
Similarly as first example , I did'nt want to make any mistakes and I cared about my English grammer as perfect English too much , so I could n't speak much .
One day , my American friend asked me why I cared of the grammer so much and advised me not to afraid , and then I could learn more .
Since the time , I started to take risks .
Sometimes American was not nice when they knew I was not a native speaker ; however , most of them taught me how to use correct words in sentences .
That 's the reason why my English was improved .
I believe there are more lessons from failure than success .

Repeating what I already know is sometimes boring .
It is possible that some people catches me up , and starts doing same things as me .
At the time I am not a successful person anymore .
If I continue doing same things , they would become old and useless .

In conclusion , to be a successful person , I need to keep doing new thing which nobody can not follow and take a risk for great knowledge from failure .
Nothing happens seems to be the safest , but at the same time , it means no change and profit in my life .
