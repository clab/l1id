I agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
First , I think the ideas and consepts make the facts .
Just a fact as it is has no meaning .
For example , as for studing history , `` something war '' is not important .
Why they began war , what did the war bring them , is important to study .

Second , if students understand iedas and consepts , they can possibly make better facts from same ideas and concepts .
Let 's assume that the students studied about ideas and concepts of the cars , some students maight think about other type of viecles .
It may grow the imagination of the students .

Third , if students did n't understand ideas and concepts , they could use facts in the wrong way .
It is sometimes dangerous .
When I worked in Sushi restaurant as a Sushi chef , I trained a young lady .
She did n't know why we used the rubber globes for cleaning .
She touched the detergent by bear hand .
Then her hand b This is why I think understanding ideas and concepts are more important for students .
