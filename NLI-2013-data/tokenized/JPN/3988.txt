I agree .
I think resently young people contact with thier communituies .
For example they do n't greet with people .
There is n't comunication .
and they think contact of communities is boreing .
but , comunication with communities is very important .
Becouse , This defend communities 's sefty .
Resently , more and more commits incresing .
expecially , comunication is effectiv for robber .
If communities 's contact hard , robber can n't aim at this city .
In This way , comunities 's contact make sefty .
Next , If young peppe contribute their communities , this city improve .
young people have great power to change commuities .
For example , Using this power effectivilly , clean up this city .
confatabule city enable to assemble people , so this city improve .
and If people increse , commance deveroping .
Shops and departments increse too .
young people give time to helping their communitise
