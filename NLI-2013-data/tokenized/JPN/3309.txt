Some people think that young people do not spend their time to do something that is beneficial for their society .
But I do not agree this opinion .
The most primary reason for this is that modern many university student are much more ready to be the one of member of workers than those in the past .
some illustrations of that is they join internships , experience the works as a part-time job , and study abroad to master English .
My fatehr said to me that he did not have to study or experience work like today .

Moreover , as people can prolong teir lives , young people have to help them nowadays .
It is critisized that there are so many old people in Japan , where I live in .
I think that It is only young people who can help with their living .

To summerize above passege , young people nowadays cannot help giving much more time to help thir community as the system of teir society is changing .
