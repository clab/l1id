I do not agree with the statement .
That is one-sided and not considering the meaning of what is really to `` enjoy '' .
Young people seems that they are more energetic and full of hopes and potentials .
Their interests might be focus only on future .
In a way self-centered .
To them , life seems going forever and ever and never ends .
They are enjoying youth .
Not life .
Some of the younger people , they have n't even lived yet .
Also , life does not always go as you wish or planed .
When you 're younger , you do n't have much patience and it seems frustating .

We do n't live alone , noone does .
Life means including all other people comes in our lives .
As we get older , we realize that .
When you focus on only the future and yourself , how can you appreciate and enjoy ?
I like the old saying : stop and smell the roses .
Surely the future would be always there no matter how old you become but your priority shifts as you get older .
But as you get older you realize what 's matters in life .
People who once realize the priority , more likely to enjoy life .
In most cases it 's the freinds and family in your life because they are the ones you ca n't live without .
Also as you get older you realize what is the quality of life .
In younger days , you would think youth would be there forever then once day you realize that is not true .

I also believe it take some maturity to enjoy life itself .
I know some older people who are retired and not much so called excitement in life going on like younger people but they seems happier and more satisfied of their lives .
Everytime I ask them if they are happy , the answer is always yes .
You 'd be wonder why or how can they , old and boring but they are happy with themselves and knowing what they have accomplished .
They are pretty much content with what they went through and gained some confidence from it .

So therefore , I do not agree with the statement .
It takes some time until you make peace with yourself and your own life .
Older people enjoy life more than the younger people .
