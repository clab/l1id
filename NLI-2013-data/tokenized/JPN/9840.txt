It could be said , it really depends on what kind of type the person is , therefore , I agree with this opinion .
Some people successed with only doing what they already know how to do well but I hardly believe that the kind of peple could successed only in limit of levels .
No risks but no big returns .

I think that successful people try new thing not just to money but they like to try new thing .
As a result of their action , they earn a lot of mony and find a different way to successed from others .
Thinking about our computerized life , when I was a junior high school student , nobody know what the internet means .
Only few people showed their interest on it and start some internet business .
Nowadays internet business is the one of most successful business but they always have to try new things and develop their knowledge and technics .
If they do n't , no longer become to successful people !

Also if people in this world are doing only they already know things , our cultures and industries have no chance to improve .
We always need to seek something new to us .
Of course there are some risks all the time to do new things , but if we do n't try , we ca n't gain anything including the meanings of successful .

I do n't want to think all the time to become successful person but I always want to try to be a challenging person for everythins .
And someday , I may become one of a successful person .
