There are a lot of people all over the world to travel somewhre in a year .
Some people think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
However , I disagree with the thinking about traveling .
I will write reasons next paragraphs .

First , I want to go alone or my friends about my trip , because I da n't want to be led someone .
I will buy guid book which we are going to go places .
After that , we will be held meeting about traveling .
On the other hands , if we would join a group , we will have to be led a tour guide , so we could not spend a great time .

Second , I do n't want to pay waste mony using a tour guide .
A tour guide shows around somewhre as a job .
Therefore , money of traveling is included their payment .
If we would go traveling somewhere by ourselves , we only pay our traveling money .

Third , I want to look many places by myself .
I want to find hotels , restaurants and so on also .
It is comfortable to use travel company .
However , I think that it will be good memories prefer traveling alone or only with my friends to in a group .

Thus , I do n't consider that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I have some reasons about traveling .
I do n't want to pay waste money , and I want to decide by myself .
