I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people .
When people are young they always want to challenge things , and are very energetic .
However older people have to work , to maintain their lifestyle and has already become calm .
Therefore I believe young enjoy life more than older people .
I will explain my reasons in the following essay .

Young people are always trying to do new things so they are very active which makes them enjoy their life .
Generally young people dont have to think about others and just think about their own life .
Therefore they can do whatever they want to do .
For instance , if they want to go on a trip just to disocover something , they can do it easily .
However if they get older and have a family to support , it will become difficult for them to do so .
When people are young they have many chances and opportunities to change their future lives .
Thus they can just do what they want to do .
And when people do what they want to do , they enjoy their lives to the fullest .

Older people generally already have a job and some have families .
Therefore it makes them hard for them to have the time to do their hobbies , or to travel .
And to support their families , they have to make a lot of money so it is not easy to quit their jobs just to challenge their dreams .
Older people cannot just do what they want to do because it would affect many other things .
As they in a stricted situation , it is difficult for them to enjoy their lives .

In my opinion , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
It is very difficult for older people to do what they want to do because it effects other things such as their family .
However young people dont have to think about those things and can challenge whatever they want to do .
Therefore I believe young people enjoy life more than older people .
