Cars have been the means of transportation around the world for centuries .
It is no doubt that the car is a major part of many peoples lives .
So will there be fewer cars in use twenty years from now ?
Well , I think that the car will very much be present twenty years from now and probably with more users then ever , with a few changes to the car 's functions and design of course .

I think that the car will change greatly over a twenty year period .
Resulting in a burst of popularlity with many individuals around the world .
I think that many of the functions of the cars will be changed as well .
I think that the car , twenty years from now will use electric fuel not gasoline .
I think this because there are many problems arising around the world regarding the price of gasoline .
Not only is the price of gasoline expensive but it is also destroying the atmosphere , resulting in global warming .
I feel that the car industry will thus , shift its vision on cars from gasoline to highly productive , well-made electric cars .
These electric cars will not only run on small amounts of electricity , but it will also have no exhaust pollution , creating a better and cleaner environment .
It is because that I think these changes will occur that I say that the number of cars will not diminish in the future .
I feel that with the environmentally friendly benefits and with the attachment that society already has on cars will make people keep riding cars .

I also think that there will not be fewer cars in twenty years because I think that many people in many socities are very attached to the car .
It is not a mere transportation vehicle , but it is a part of tradition to drive a car in many countries .
For example , it is a tradition to get your drivers license when you turn the age of 16 in America .
Also it is a sign of wealth in many countries to own a car in many countries , such as China .
Therefore , I feel that there will not be a decline in the use of cars because ; by losing the car you will lose many traditions , and traditions are a part of culture .
So it is hard for me to think that the human race would diminish an entire part of culture from there lives within a short period of twenty years .

The attachment to cars by the human society and the possiblity to alter cars to better suit the needs of the environment and the people , make me conclude that the usage of cars will not decline in twenty years .
