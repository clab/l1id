When you study , there are mainly two ways of studying ; understanding ideas and concepts , and learnimg facts .
In this essay , I would like to respond to the statement ; it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
But before I start judjing the statement , I would like to raise advantages and disadvantages of two ways of learning .

Firstly , I would like to raise advantages of studying ideas and concepts .
The first advantage is that if you understant an idea or a concept , you can solve more difficult and complex problems using your understanding .
It means you can use your knowledge in variety of situations and it is definitely a good thing .
The second advantage is that it is interesting to learn an idea or a concept .
Most people feel satisfaction or feel happy when they understand new things .
An idea or a concept is sometimes difficult to understantd but it is more enjoyable to study than just memorising facts .
I fpeople feel happy to study , thei r motivation toward the study goes up .

One advantage of understanding concepts and ideas is that iunderstanding concepts is much more difficult than learning facts .
So people could stop trying to understand concepts before they succeed to .

Now i want to raise advantages of learning facts .
The first advantage is that it is easy to remenber facts .
You do not have to understandwhat you are memorising about ; everyone can do it .
People could be confident if they succeed to memorise facts ; it stimulates their interests in what they are studying .
The second advantage is that since facts do not depend on one ' s feeling , facts are universal .
There is no communication gap between facts .
Therefore if you learn facts , you can show off your knowledge to people who do not speak your language .

However there are also disadvantages for learning facts .
One disadvantage can be raised and it is that you are not understanding concepts behind the facts .
If you do not understand concepts , you can not use your knowledge in a different situation .

I strongly agree with the statement which says it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ; yet as described in this essay , it is also important to learn facts .
The best way of studying is to combine both ways of studying .
However if a student is only allowed to choose one of the two ways , I strongly recommend to focus on understanding concepts and ideas rather than learning facts .
