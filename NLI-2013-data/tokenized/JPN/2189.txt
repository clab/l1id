There some differences between young people and older people .
I want to explain important points that their characteristics .
First , young people are more active because they have to go to school , they have to learn what their requirment .
They also have to grew to become what they want to be .
Though , they are grewing up , there are a lot of sturuggles that they have to face to it .
They are confused and lost because they can not see what is going to happen next .

Second , think about older people are more calm and have knowledge , go done though that their development .
They can do whatever they want to do because they finish high school .
They may have time to think about their grand children who they got .
But there are things that they can not do which is going to school , playing sports over beyond their avarage , being expart at some thing new .

So some limits coming up to them because their age is increasing .
But it doesnt mean that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

For example , if you want to have own time like relaxing , sleeping , talking with friends , seems like young people have time to those kind of stuff , but young people may not do it becaue there are a lot of things to do like home work , sports club , planning for university or job .
But older people may do it because they have time , maybe they are having job that they really want to do .
School wark is hard to have fun , there are such a limit time , they are still struggling with everything .
Older people can enjoy what that young people enjoy , if they want to play sports as much as that young people do then they can do it .
Young people can not do it exactly same thing as old people do .
They have future to enjoy and older people are enjoying that future right now .
