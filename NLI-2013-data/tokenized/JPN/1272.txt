In Japan , where I live , some people agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
But I disagree with that opinion because of the following reasons ; it is not enough time to learn many academic subjects indeed ; people can not understand many academic subjects simultaneously ; people can live by using only one specifc subject .

It might be true that it is better to have borad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
However , those who say that we should follow that opinion fail to address several important issues .

First , we do not have adequate time to learn many academic subjects in school .
For example , my brother , Takahumi was very interested ethics in his high school days because he thought that ethics was one of the most important subjects that people should learn .
But as he had to learn about twelve subjects simlutaneously , ethics was held once in a week .
Under this situation , he graduated from his high school without understanding ethics fully .
I believe that high school should give students many times a week to the specific subject which students want to learn .

Furthermore , people can not understand many academic subjects simlutaneously .
For example , my sister , Takako liked to learn world history in her junior high school days .
But after entering a high school , she said to me that she was bad at world history .
I asked her a reason why .
She told me that she have to learn many subjects in her high school and do many homeworks of them simultaneously and she do not have enough time to read text book of world history during her freetime in advance .

Finally and most importantly , however , people can live by using only one subject .
For example , I entered Tokyo univeisity which is the most difficult university in Japan in 1992 by taking examinations about six subjects , that is , math , English , Japanese language , Japanese history , world history , physics , science .
Then , I learned many subjects in my university .
But after graduating my university , I 've not used the knowledge of most subjects which I learned in my school days .
As I am working at the Investment division in a financial institution , it is adequate for me to work there by knowing the specific knowledge about math .
I feel strongly that I should learn much more specific knowledge about math .
So , people should consentrate not many subjects but one specific subject .

Therefore , on the basis of the facts discussed above , I find that we should agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects .
