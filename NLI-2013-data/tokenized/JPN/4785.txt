I agree with this the following statement that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
I have two reasons to suppot my opinion .
First of all , the thing refluences our diary life because we think that it is natural that our life become more convenient once a year .
In this society , we use many convenient products .
Now we have bad idea that useless we can use some products sush as electronic products and computer comfortablely , we do not want to use these products .
It is said that the way of thinking developed the following statement .
For example , in my house this idea is spreading because my parents try to buy new products seem much better that they really are .
Actually they bought new ovan a few month ago .

Next , as many people require new products next to next , the company try to invent the more developing products .
The efffect plays a important role in Japan economic .
Becasue if many companies stop to invent products , Japan will suffer a big problem that influences economic , society , and so on .

In conclusion , I really agree with the following statement that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .
Most advertisement do not make products , our life cannot keep well , and Japan will be at a loss .
This is important thing .
