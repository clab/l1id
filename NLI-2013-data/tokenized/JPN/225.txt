I personally do not think that the travel in a tour with a guide is preferrable for several reasons .
Instead , I suggest the travel alone as a best way .
This essay compares and contrasts the advantages and disadvantages of travelling alone and in a group led by a tour guide .

First of all , a tour led by a guide requires a set schedule : tourists cannot go around as they like ; instead , they exclusively have to follow the guide all the day .
By contrast , travelling alone permits a person much freedom : she or he can decide the schedule of that day according to her or his will .

Second , although the existence of a guide might seem to be helpful , it sometimes does not function so .
For example , at the tourist site , the guide gives an explanation to it , and tourists just listen to the guide .
This form of information-acquring is just passive .
Instead , I prefer learning things by myself actively , and I think this is the major advantage of travelling alone because the knowledge or memory acquired by positive attitude should be better than memory got by passive attitude .

Third , the guided tour might not allow people to take a closer look at tourist sites or monuments .
Since there is a certain number of people in the group , it is hard to estimate that an individual can have a closer look at tourist features until he or she gets satisfied .
This is precisely due to the set schedule as indicated .
People have to go around the one place to another in a rush in order to make it on time .
Again , on the contrary , sicne traveling alone allows much freedom , a traveler can take a closer look on the site or tourist features .

Having said that though , travelling in a group led by a guide does have some advantages such as : some interaction and socialised relationship amongst other members of the group ; safety because they travel with other people .

However , as far as the first advantage of travelling in a group is concerned , it is still achievable even if it is a travel by alone .
Being open , friendly and social enables the traveller to have the interaction with other people along the journey : even if s/he does not have any friends or fellows at the beginning , s/he can acquire them through the trip , and this is the exactly exciting point of travelling alone .

As far as the security issue is concerned , the advantage seems to rest upon travelling alone .
Yet , considering other aspects , as argued , travelling alone should be still entitled to be a desirable way of the journey overall .
