I agree with the idea that successful people try new things and more likely to take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
The attitude to try new things and take risks can bring you broader range of possibility , lessons from failure , and strong drive toward success .

When people do only what they already knew , their vision is restricted to very small areas .
They look at only on their experiences and do not try to find if there is more effective way .
Trying to seek new things can broaden your point of view and that might lead to a revolutional discovery or progress .

Of course there is always some risks when people try to do new things .
But people cannot just stay there being afraid of taking risks if they really want a success .
Even though they fail , their experience is enriched by the failure if they learn a lesson from it .
For people only do what they can do well , they might not fail but it is hard for them to improve .
Those people who rely only on their past experience cannot enlarge their capacity .

The successful people are tend to be driven by a strong motivation toward success .
If people try to stick to what they already knew , it is impossible to get out of the range of their experience .
When people look for new things or try to get out of a plight that is caused by their own failure , their mind is always set to future .
To be successful , you need to move ahead incessantly .

Thus I believe the attitude to try new things and take risks is essential to be successful .
