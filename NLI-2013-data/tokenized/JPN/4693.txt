I agree the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .
Let me talk about two reasons .

One reason is that products in magagine advertisements seem more beautiful than they really are .
For example when the beautiful woman wore a dress in the magagine advertisements the dress seemed so beautihful because of the beauty of this woman .
But when I wore the same dress the dress did not seem beautiful .
Because I am not beautiful .
Also the shape of the dress changed because I was fat and the dress was really tiny .
I could not realize that the dress was tiny because the beautiful woman in magagine was really thick and beautiful body .

Second reason is that products in TV advertisements seem more useful than they really are .
For example when the famous cook uses the knife in TV advertisements this knife will seem more useful .
Because the famous cook can really can cook very well .
But If I or my father buy this knife we will not use knife very well .
Because we do not like cooking and we hardly use the knife .

Therefore I think most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .
