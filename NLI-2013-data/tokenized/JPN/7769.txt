For instance , if we want stay some plces more long time , this hope would n't be came true .
Fathermore we may be always urged in a harry .

Second , we can make schedule freely .
We can put into many places want to go .
Moreover we can spent our time as we want .
And we do n't need to mind time and others behaviors .

Through this , you can comunicate with local people who are not conectted with any benefits and experience the way the local people ardinaly do .
