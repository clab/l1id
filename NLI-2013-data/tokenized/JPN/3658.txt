I agree with it .
When I was young , I did not give my time to helping my community .
Becouse my community did not need not only me but also my friends .
And I did not know how to help my community .
Even now I do not know .
Of course I did clean my town , but my porpse was not to help my community but to talk with my friends .
And I sometimes helped old people with heavy bags .
But it was natural .
Moreover when I was about to help with a preparation of my community 's festival with my friends , an adult said to us that you children did not need to help us , went on play .

Instead of helping my community , I want to play and talk with my friends .
I know it is important to communicate with my community .
But I do not care about my neighboor .

Anyway my community consists of old people without young people .
If I get older , I will give time to my community .
But young people should spend their time to do whatever they want to do , for example studying , trip .
They are better for young people .
