My opinion is disagree .
I think young people should help their communities .
I have two reasons .
First of all , young people in other words , students have much time than working people .
After school , many students have a part-time job for earning money .
It is important for them to do a part-time job .
They can buy many cloths , shoes , snacks , and so on .
But , I want to recommend them helping their communities .
This may free .
But , they can know new things which do n't learn in the school .
For example , they can know about old people .
There are various people in communities .
So they can talk with who they do n't usually talk .
Old people know many things than young people .

Secondly , young people live in their communities too .
Not only clean their own house but also a park , a road etc .
