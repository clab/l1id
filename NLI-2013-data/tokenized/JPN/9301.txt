Although some students cannot understand ideas and concepts until they learn facts , ideas and concepts have more value for all students to learn than facts .
Understanding ideas and concepts is the first step of studying .
For example , at the beging of studying new thing , a teatcher may give its concept first and then tell facts as an example .
This can happen many times especially in chemistory class .
Firstly a teacher tells a theory , and then students clarify that the theory is correct in a lab class .
This is because to understand chemical experiences , understaning the theory is the neccessary step for students .
If students take a lab class first , they cannnot understand anything even if what they are doing in the class .
Thus , teacing concepts and ideas must be the first step of classes .
However , it is also the truth that there are some students who cannot under stand concepts only in explanations by theachers .

For the students who cannot understand whole of a lecture , this sequence can also work because there is no students , who cannot understand any part of leacture , in class .
During lecture , all students can catch at least so words , which are mainideas and helpful to understand ideas .
If a teacher write these important words and drow some pictures on a black board , all students can write and drow them on their notes .
After a lab class , they can review their notes and will be familiar with the ideas .
Therefore , for this kind of studens , this is very helpful .
