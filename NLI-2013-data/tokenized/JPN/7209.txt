While some people say that there should be a tour gide during the trip , I do not agree with the idea that going on a trip with a gide is beeter than going alone .
There are two reasons of this : being responsible and more chances to communicate with locals .

Going on a trip make me more responsible person in many respects .
For example , I have to make a reservation by myself and handle difficulties that I face during the trip .
If there is a tour gide while taking a trip , I wiil rely on him or her too much and I will not do anything neede for the trip such as reserving a hotel .
As a result , I will tend to be less responsible person .
In addition , If I got involved in troubles such as fighting , robbery , or getting lost , I would mamage the situation with my little skills of the langage .
This experience will teach me how to overcome difficulties when I am alone , making myself resposible .
By contrast , if you are with a tour gide , he or her will all take care of you whenever you ask help .

Furthermore , indivudual trip or trip with out a gide will offer me lots of opportunity to talk with locals .
For instance , I can make any schedule that I want and hang out with people with I get to know there .
If I go to an ethinic restaurants to have dinner and make frinds with locals , I will enjoy eintire trip with them communicationg each other .
However , in a trip with a gide , you always have to be in a group of visitors .
In other words , you have fewer chance to talk with locals .

In conclusion , I prefer going on a trip alone to going with a gide because individual trip will produce more chance to learn responsibility and communicate with local people .
