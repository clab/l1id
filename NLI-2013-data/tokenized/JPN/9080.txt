I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
First , people in Japan study a lot of facts , such as History and Math instead of idea and concept class when they were in elementary school , junior high school and high school .
It is too much time to learn facts .
they should study class which understand ideas and concepts .

Second , almost people have PC , TV , TV game and cell phone , so they do n't like thinking something .
Children often play the TV game in their house , instead of go out with their friend .
