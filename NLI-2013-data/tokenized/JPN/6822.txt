I do n't think that it will decrease the number of cars in just twenty years .
I support my opinion with some reasons I descrive below .

First , Nowadays , cars are one of the most necessary things in our everyday life .
Japanese people sometimes express about cars into `` legs '' in our conversation .
For example , a man says `` We do n't have legs to go to the station. '' , then an another man sais `` We can take a bus . ''
.
First man said `` lags '' , but of course , its not about real legs .
Ordinary people have their legs , so correctly , he wanted to say about a vehicle , but he exchanged the word into legs .
Now , you get an idea how cars are important for us like legs .
We will keep driving cars even in twenty years later .

Secondly , everybody thinks cars are convenient .
We can move far away , and we do n't need to pay for driving without gas or oil fee .
If something new vehicle or machine invented in near future , people might change their way to move , but this invention must be more convenient and cheaper than cars .
In addition to this , this story is not reality , so we should ignore this now .
Cars are too familiar vehicle to throw out , so I think it will nothing to change about cars in future .

In conclusion , cars are very convenient , and necessary for us .
