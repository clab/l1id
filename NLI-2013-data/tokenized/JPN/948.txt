I totally agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one spesific subject .
One good example of an academic subject is medicine .
I have a friend who study medicine at medical scool right now .
She often tells me about her school and about doctors .
Now I will explain following reasons and examples which I heard from her to support my opinion .

First , it is difficult to diagonise desises .
For example , if you are an ophtalmologist and one patient came and she insisted that she could n't see well .
You checked her eyes but noting was wrong with her eyes .
In that case , there might be something wrong with her brain .
However if you do n't have any knowledge about a brain , you ca n't think about it .
You ca n't save the patient from her eye sight problem .
We ca n't say that you are a good doctor .

Second , if you have only have knowkedge about medicine , it is fun to talk with others about medicine .
Probably you will be speaking with other doctors only .
However there are many kindsof people in this world .
You can gain and learn many thing form talking with them .
You do n't talk only about medicine with them .
A lot of knowledge will help you to communicate with others and make friends .

From these reasons and examples , I think we shoud have many kinds of knowledge .
It is fun to study one feild and specialize it .
However while we specialize one subject , we should also study broad subject .
This will make us to have a lot of friends an knowledge in our lives .
