I agree this statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are for following reasons .
Most of advertiesments are made of professional computer technition or professional team .
And the stuff that advertised is not the only stuff we can get , we might can get better stuff .

First of all , most of advertisement of cosmetics attract many women .
By using this lotion , many women dream that we can get smooth and soft skin like this model .
But the face of models have retouched by computer .
So nobody can get the skin that have retouched by computer after all .
I spent lots of money for lancom when I was young .
And I know I am a victim of this kind of advertisement .

Second , most of advertisement of food in the restaurant or fast food are better than real products .
Because when they make sample of food many professional work for that .
For example , professional cook , food arrangement adviser , table arrangement adviser and cameraman work for that advertisement .
But only part time staffs works in real .

Third , advertisement of fashionable clothes or shoes are also better than real products .
Whenever celebrities wear new fashionable clothes , many magazines put that picture on it .
And many woman of all over the world try to get same stuffs and that causes higher price .
If we can get same stuff , we can find same kind of stuff more cheap price at another place .
When I got a bag that Cameron Diaz has , I realised that .
Unless we have same style body or color of skin or hair , it does not work for us .

In conclusion , I believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
