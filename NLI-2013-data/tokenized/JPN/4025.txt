I agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Not many young people are seen in community activities , and it seems like their interest is not at their local .
Three reasons can be thought of when thinking about this issue .

Firstly , young people seem to be busy with their own life , and has less interest in their own communities .
This is because their everyday life is basically at the achool or university .
There , they study on subjects they have interest in , and they may also be participating in a circle or an after school activitiy .
It can be guessed that young people spend more time there , instead of helping out at local communities .

Secondly , the community itself is not systematically organized for young people to participate .
The problem of Japanese society now is that the local communities are not working out in many places because people have less contact with their neighbors .

For example , in big cities with people living in high building appartments , it is normal for people to not know most of the people who live there .
You might see some people once in a while , but in a busy life , there is rarely a chance to really get together to form a community .
Therefore , young people do not spend time to help out in their communities .

Lastly , the local communities are mainly run by older people , such as people who have retired jobs and have more time .
These people gather and organize community activities and spread it to neighbors .
For example , it takes time to organize an event in the community .
You need to plan out things to do , and also go knock on doors to ask for participation .
When there are not enough people , you struggle more and have to work harder .
So it is natural to say that people who have more time has more chance to participate and help out in the communitiy .
This might be one of the reasons that youg people spend less time in community when compared with older people .

From these three points that I have stated above , I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Young people might be energetic and be a big help , but when their interest is somewhere else , it is difficult to bring back their attention .
