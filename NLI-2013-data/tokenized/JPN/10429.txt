I agree with the statement , `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , because if they want to be more successful than they already were , they would try to expand their skills and learn more new things and try to become successful in that , too .
They would risk their time and money , and probably even their profession , in order to gain that knowledge and master that .

Once a person gets good at something , he or she either tries to get even better at that skill , or they keep it at a level they are content with .
To successful people , that is not enough .
I have a friend who is a wonderful harpist , and she practices her harp at least 9 hours a day .
She is a harpist for 3 professional college orchestra/groups and plays in concerts practically every week .
But even with all her talent , she always says it 's not enough .
Now , she 's learning how to play other insterments , like flute , clarinet , and cornet , and is expanding her musical skills to a new level .
She is almost like a professional harpist , yet she pushes herself harder and harder by practicing for hours and learning how to play new musical insterments .

In order to learn new things , people must get educated .
In order to get educated , they either have to find a professional who majors in that particular field or go to a school/college .
Most successful people have jobs and probably even a fammily , so if they want to learn something new , they would have to cut their time short with either one of them , maybe even both .
That causes new risks , like losing their job because they do n't work as much anymore , or lose their family because they do n't spend time with their family anymore and his or her husband/wife is tired of their ignorance .
But if they think their education is worth the risk , then they should go right ahead and keep on going .
You do n't have to be successful in order to learn new things .
No one has the right to stop anybody from gaining knowledge for their satisfaction .
