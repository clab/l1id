I agree with the statement which says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because I think that the transportation system such as trains or busses will be developed more than now .
Even now , in the big citys , people use trains or busses more than cars .
Maybe people think convinient to use transportations better than using a car because of dense of the people and cars .
Nobody likes the rush hours and everybody wants to avoid it .

The other reason I agree with the statement is the think of environment .
It is a serious problem the mount of CO2 the bunch of cars make .
I guess and I hope that people will care about environment more and for that , using cars is not so good way .
If many people use trains of busses instead of cars , much of CO2 is reduced .

One more last reason I agree with the statement is the cost of the car .
To have a car costs much because of gas , insuluence , maintaince , and itself .
Because of these costs , I think in next twenty years , the number of the people who use the cars will reduce .
And also , it is more healthy than cars because it makes peole stand and walk .

These are the reasons why I agree with the statement which says that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
However , of course , there are many good points about cars .
It is convinient , useful , and for some people , it 's cool to have it .
Moreover , transportations such as busses and trains also have many problems such as the rush time or times it takes .
But for many reasons I said above , I hope the improvement of the transpotation system and I think it will be .
