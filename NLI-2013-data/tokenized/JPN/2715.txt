The most fearful thing that people think is a death .
Then , some people may say that young people have a lot of time to live comparing to older people , therefore they can enjoy life more .
It is sure that older people have high possibility of death because of various reasons , such as disease and weakness of their body .
However , when the death comes are unknown .
Probabyly , a baby which is just born one hours ago may be die because of the sudden accident .
Therefore I disagree with the statement which is `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . ''

First , each people have a different situation and environment .
These situation and environment have a great impact on a person 's life .
For example a lot of children dies because of disease or lack of foods in developing countries .
Their lives are quite hard .
They do not know if they can live tomorrow or not , because they do not have any money and food .
They also have to work for their family at the young age , and sometimes , they sell their organs to get money .
Young people are healthier than older people , therefore they have to earn money .
Probably , most of young people in these situation can not enjoy their life .
Therefore it is not true that all young people enjoy life and be able to spend their all time for themelves .

Second , older people in developed countries may have a lot of free time which they can use for their own .
For example , in Japan , a lot of older people can get money from the government after the decided age .
Therefore they do not have to work , and they use these free period to do their hobbies , such as sports , music , games ...
and so on .
It is not true that all the old peple enjoy their lives , but it is true that a lot of old people enjoy their lives by arranging their future .
Although their death may be comming soon , they can enjoy their lives .

As you read , if the person can enjoy the life or not is not depend on their age , but their situation , environment , people around him / her ...
and so on .
By changing their situation and way of thinking , people can enjoy their lives .
