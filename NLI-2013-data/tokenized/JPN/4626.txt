Recently , the products of advertisements have developed , so most advertisers advertise products much better than actual .
Is it really good for customers ?
I disagree with the statement for these reasons .
First of all , when customers try to buy something , the advertisements are also one of the points that they chose which to buy .
If the advertisement is too much better than actual products , customers will disappoint .

Second , it takes much money to advertise .
In order to attract a lot of customers , producers make advertisement wonderful , so when this situation happen , the cost of advertisement becomes much more expensive .
If producers spend money to advertise more than to make products , they cannot made real good things .
In addition , products may become poor .
Also , it is bad not only customers but also producers to make poor products .
It means that customers do n't want to buy poor things although the advertisement is really nice , so products ca n't be bought .

In conclusion , It is important to attract customers by advertisement , but it is not good to spend too much money to advertise .
So , I think that the producer should make products better and spend money to improve products and invent new things rather than great advertisement .
Therefore , I do n't prefer to make products seem much better than they really are by advertisement .
