Recently , we often see various adverisments on the TV and boad in the cities .
I agree with the statement that most advertisments makes products seem much better than they really are .

First , advertisments can attracts us more than the procuts really are because the advertisments highlights the good points which the products have .
Most products have several charactoristics both good points and bad points .
In the advetisments , producer want to explain that the advantages , convinient usage , good appearance and so on .
Especially in the small miniutes of advertisment on TV , they can explain only good points of products .
Also , in small piece of paper advertisments such as flyers , they can also expalin the merit to buy the products more .
Additionly , we rarely see the disadvantageis of the products in the advertisments .
As a result , we can understand the only part of products .
So we can not understand the product fully .
This is likely to cause the products more attractive and we recognize the products as much better than they really are .

Second , advertisements force us to believe the products is better by keeping the adversitments in our mind for long time .
When I turn on TV and walk around town , we often see advertisments many times daily .
Then , I remenber the advertisments and the products .
In the case that I go to the supermarket , I often select the products which is introduced at the adverisment of product because I know the product more than other producta which are less advertized .
In this situation , even though the product I choose is not better than the others , I choose that I know well It .
As a result , product which is often advertised is selected for me because I have a mind that I know well the product even though the product might not good .

In couclusion , I think that most adverisments makes products seem much better than they really are because the advertisements attract us by highlighting the good point of the products and are kept in mind long time .
