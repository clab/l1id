I disagree with the statement that argues most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I think most people are mislead by few aggressive opinions and blaming advertisements for wrong reasons .

However , I admit that there are some advertisements , especially in food , hotels and restaurants , that try to make false impression on consumers by adding colors or increasing the volume or showing pictures of long time ago .
But in most cases , I think most advertisement are honest about their products .
Especially thanks to the arising public awareness , companies are being more careful to be truthful and honest when communicating to consumers through advertisements .

The main purpose of advertisement is to make people want to consume or buy a product or service .
In order to do that , advertisement focuses on getting attention to draw interest from consumers .
That is why they use famous actors and actresses or flashy visuals or loud and upbeat music .
But that does not have anything to do with making the product or service look better at all .
If a pair of clothes looks better when it 's put on by famous actress in an advertisement than by yourself , it is only your imagination that it looks better in the ad .
These effects make people feel happy or imagine something fun which lead them to think that the product looks good or beautiful .
But it is important to be aware that it is not because they did something to the product .
Advertisements are only adding context to the product to let the people imagine something fun or beautiful and have that imagination relate to the product .
When people watch or see advertisement , they should be aware of this effect to protect themselves from false impression caused by their own imagination .

In addition to that , partly due to regulation , there are advertisements which describe not only the strength and benefit but also risk and weakness associated with the products such as prescription drugs .
It seems contradictory to the main purpose of advertisement but in the end , honest communication should be paid off by trust and loyalty from consumers .
I think the importance of honest communication between company and consumer are being recognized in the corporate world .
