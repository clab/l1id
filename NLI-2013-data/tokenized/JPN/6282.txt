Some people disagree with the ideas that in the twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
But personally .
I agree with the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today becasue of the following reasons : Many young peole could not afford to buy their own cars twenty years ago ; Rapidly change of living environment since it was in twenty years ago has a lot of influence on the number of cars today ; cars are available in various ways .

Firstly , many young people could not afford to buy their own cars twenty years ago .
In previous days including twenty years ago , many young people could not buy their own cars because they have short of money .
As a result , the number of the cars has not increased compared with there are today .

Secondly , rapidly change of living environment since it was in twenty years ago has a lot of influence on the number of cars today .
Recently many people use their own cars because of various reasons .
Rural residents need to have their own cars because they always travel the location by cars .
Also , many families use their cars because of taking a vacation , including camping or driving .
We had a little cars twenty years ago compared with it is today .

Most importantly , cars are available in various ways today .
For example , many people of today use their cars because of working on daily jobs .
One of my friends must have their own cars because of selling products .
In addition , many sale men other than my friends use many cars because of working on daily jobs .
Many companies of today provide all employees with cars .
As a result , comparing with the number of cars twenty yeas ago , the number of cars now has increased .

In conclusion , above disscussed , I agree with the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
