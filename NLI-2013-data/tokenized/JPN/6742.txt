In the past few decades cars have been the most useful vehicle in the world .
The use of car is still increasing rapidly .
There are many people saying the negative aspect s of cars , though I think the increase of car use will go on in the next twenty years or maybe more .

The carbon dioxide which is exausted from tha cars are said to be a big cause of global warming .
This negative aspect should be prevented , but there are still great share of cars .
Why cannot people use trains and other social tranceportation .
In that way car user will be decreasing and it will be good for the enviroment .

When I was still a child and did not have the drivers license I thought the pollution the car makes was evil and something that one need to prevent .
After a few years when I took the license the thought of pollution went somewhere else from my mind .
It is just so useful .

I think cars are like smoking .
We know that this is a bad habit .
Despite the fact , people just cannot quit it .
The usefullness of car adicts the people .
No one wants to be in a bus or a train when you see the people in there getting squashed and misserable .
We than think to use the car , more private and convenient .

I believe cars would not decrease forever .
People cannot prevent th e desire of using such useful thing so we need to think of another way , like inventing a car that is ecology .
The amount of car share will be increasing as the population rise .
The decrease of population is the only way of decreasing the car .
