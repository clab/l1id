Some people believe that it is more important for students understanding ideas and concepts than learn facts .
However , I strongly disagree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and cocepts thatn it is for them to learn facts for the following reasons .

Learnig facts is faster ways to learn for students .
For exaple , when I was a sixteen years old , I had a first part time job , which was joying an assembly line in a beer factory .
I expected to the job was going to easy and simple since I learned that the concepts of assembly lines and undersood how the assembly line worked .
However , the job is not easy and simple at all .
I had to focus on another people and think what should I do next .
I made a lot of mistakes and warned from the boss .
Even though , I understood how it worked and the concept , I did not what was going to be facts , I did make the same or simillar mistakes .
However , one I knew the consequences I said myself I was not going to make same mistakes again .
And I could learn to handle the job very fast .
Therefore , learning facts is a faster way to learn than understanding and concepts .

Peole usually remember what they learn from facts .
When I was a six years old , I entered to an elementaly school in Japan .
First day of school , I was not used to attending a school : therefore , I missbehaved such as not pay attentions in class and talking with friends .
Even though , my parents told me I have to behave in class room .
I had not know what was going happen next , so I wasnot well bihave .
Teachers punished and warned me and I finally realized facts of missbihave in classrooms .
Even now , I still remember and I do not think I am not going to forget since facts are really rememberble for me .
Theexpirience above shows that learnig facts are easy to remember and stay longer than understanding ideas and concepts .
Students are be able to remember ideas and concept because once they understood .
But they can forget easily since they just understood in their brains .

Therefore , I totally agree with the statement that it is more important for students to learn facts than for them to undestand ideas and concepts .
