It is said that if we make success in our lives , we should try new things which we are unfamiliar and let put ourselves into new situation .
This is like some catch phrases of some advertisements .
I do not 100 % agree with this theory because people who can make success are only people who have found their devotions or niches .

The reason why I stated I did not 100 % agree with giving statement on left page was that I could agree with the point of trying new things in order to make success .
I think trying new things is very good for us because we fully utlize our experiences and knowledges , which reflect how we enthusiastically have lived in each of our lives , and concentrate to solve problems in each moment .
Such experience definitely guide us to grow up and become more mature than before ; thus , it will increase the percentage of our success due to our own personal development .

However , if we refer only making success like giving statement above , it si different soty .
We are able to make success without making anything new .
Whether or not we can male success depends on whether or not we can be passionate with what we are doing .
Although what we do is sort of repetetive things , eventually we can meet success as long as we enjoy them and keep being motivated .
Biologically , human brains are supposed to work well when we enjoy what we do and want to devote them .
When we look back to history , it proves that people who keep their effort toward one thing and dedicate themselves into it have bacome famous historical person , such like scholers or artists , etc .

We can always go to next chapter when we hope to do it .
It is not necessary to try new things and take resks for it .
The important thing is that figuring out our own devotions , niches .
If we feel what we do is not we can be passionate , then we should urge ourselves to try new things .
We should always believes our brain 's fuctions which lead us to sucess as long as we are passionate , enjoying what we do , and alway have vision to make success .
