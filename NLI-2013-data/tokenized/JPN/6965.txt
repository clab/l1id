Some people say that the number of automobiles will decrease in a couple of decades .
However , I disagree with the statement for the following reasons .

Fisrt of all , cars are most useful tool for people to move .
For example , in 2001 , when I was sophomore in university , I lived in Tokyo and I had a travel to Hokkaido , the most northen island in Japan .
I wanted to visit many place with beautiful forest and precious plants , because my major was biology and I was very interested in the diversity of plants in Hokkado , most cold realm in our countory .
A problem was that there were no means to reach the forest because few people wanted to visit there .
Then I determined to use a car and I enjoyed my trip with various types of plants .
If I could not use cars , I would not have visited the exciting forest .
As this example shows , cars satisfy our individual requirment , suggesting use of cars will be inevitable in near future .

Second , there are possiblity that scientists create new types of cars moving without petroleum .
One of major problems about cars is that they use petroleum .
Using petroleum causes natural environment to be polluted .
Also , shortage of petroleum in the earth is annoying problem .
To address these issue , for example , scientist now develop cars whose fuel is ethanol , a kind of alcohol .
We can easily create ethanol from crop , especially cone because of a large amount of cone 's supply .
Scientists are also developing cars moving with electricity from solar energy .
This is completely clean and not harmful .
Although there is many problems to realize these next generations of cars , many countries promote these study and the application will be realized soon .

Therefore , I disagree with the statement that the number of automobiles will decrease within next two decades .
