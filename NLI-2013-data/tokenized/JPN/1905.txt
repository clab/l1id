I think how much he/she enjoy life does not depend on how old he/she is .
So I disagreeto the statement , because it shows me that the difference of age cause some difference on enjoying life .

The main reason of my opinion is whenever people can feel joyful on any situations only by his/her own feeling .
And how peolple enjoy life does deeply depend on how people think of happiness .
It will change even in the same person in the different ages .

The case of sports , for example football , to run or move quickly , we need the good phisical abilities and sensors .
The younger people is , the quicker he/she moves .
But the quickness or speeds are not only consisted of the joyful of football .
To think the stragegy of goal or defence is one of the main portion of making the game .
So the expariences of elder people will contribute to feel joyful on football game .
So both young and old people have a chance to enjoy football .

Another case , in the season of roses , a person who knows many roses ' names feels happy to get the new one only shown in the books , another person who have a good sensitive nose to feel the difference of the roses enjoy the smell of them .
In this case , these two persons skill or talent does not matter with ages .

As I mentiond in above two examples , the sensitiveness or musule abilities might depend on how old he/she is .
It is one of the difference between young and elder people , mainly coused by matuare and phsical conditions .
So there is a possibility for younger people enjoy much more .
But we human has a good matuared brain and how happy we are is jugged by his/her own brain .
So if the person feel his life is happy , that is the evicence of spending his/her life with happyness and enjoying .
Anyone without him/herself can jugge how enjoy life anothers person .
