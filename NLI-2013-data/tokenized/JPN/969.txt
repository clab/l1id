I agree with the idea that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are three reasons why I choose the idea .

First of all , broad knowledge is useful when we have to decide something .
It gives us a object point of view , I think .
For example , when I was a high school student , I did n't have such broad knowledge that I could not choose to take the course of physics which I really wanted to study and I finally regret my choice before .
In fact , I did n't know well what physics is .
If I have knowledge about the physics , I difinitely choose the course of physics .
Threfore , broad knowledge is useful to have a objective point of view .

Second , broad knowledge helps us to work more fluently .
When we work for the company , we face various problems which are difficult to solve .
In that case , most of people do n't solve the problem by himself or herself and have a meeting to find a clue to overcome it .

It means that various knowlede which belongs to a lot of people is effective to solve the problem .
Therefore people who have broad knowledge is competent to solve the problem .

Finally , broad knowlede makes out life more fun .
When we talk with the other person , a person with broad knowledge can give a lot of subject to talk and it give people enjoyable time to talk .
For instance , I have a friend who have broad knowledge .
When I go out for a drink with him in a group , he supplys various topic and most of people concentrate on his talk .
Thus broad knowledge is efficient to spend enjoyable time with others .

For these reasons , I agree with the idea that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
