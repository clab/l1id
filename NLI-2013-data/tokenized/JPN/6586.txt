I do not think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
There are two main reasons to support my oppinions .
When people thnk about future of the car , many of they might be think about the oil problem .
Actually oil price is geeting higher and higher in theses days and some analysits say that all the oil we have now will be gone next 50 years .
But we can not ignore about ability of the new technology .
Not only Japanse car company but also all of the world company are fascinating to creat new car which is not depend on oil enagy .
Soura cars and car running by the power of Hydrogion .
And aols new enagy is realized now .
For example in Brazil they get the enagy from the plants .

Other reason is that we are so depend on car life .
Weuse car every day .
We ca n't live without car .
Especially United States , country is too learge so that other trnsportation is not be devepoed enough .
In Jaapan people are also depend on car life .
To tell the truth , legs of humans are cars .
So we will never be able to say good bay to the car .

I think it 's sad thing that we are so depend on car life .
But I also think we can creat much better car to us and to the environment after twenty years .
So that I think there will be not fewer cars in use than there are today .
I think it can be increased .
