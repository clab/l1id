Some people might say that using a tour guide is a waste of money .
But , Porsonally , I agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .

My primally reason is that using a tour guide is more safe than not using .
Especially , people who participate in the group travel have less experience going abroad .
They are completely lack of knowledge about this foreign country .
A tour guide have much experience and many information about it .
For expamle , in Asia , there are many dangerous areas which almost all residens keep away .
If you are teached by a tourist about this imformation , you will not face to the dangerous situation .
However , it is truth that there are poor guides .
Preventing you from hiring a bad tourist , you should choose the big company which provides good service .

Second reason is that the tour guide can lead you to the good place where you cant not detect by yourself .
Espescially , in a short trip , you should go aroud some country in a hurry , and you do not have enough time to spare .
In this point of view , the existence of a tour guide can reduce the waste of time .
In addition , he can provide much information which make your trip more exiciting .
If you do not hire a tour guide , you will regret hardly .
Most all of people seldom go on a trip , at most , once in year .
It is important for us to make much effort to make good plans .
In the case , A tour guide can support your trip .

Considering above all reasons , I agree with the idea that a group travel must be accompanied by a tourist .
It is worth of paying additilnal charge .
