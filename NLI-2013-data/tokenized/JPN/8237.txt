I would like to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
There are several reasons why I prefer this way .

First , a fact can be more easily to use if you know the concept of it .
If you do n't have any idea about some facts , you ca n't go further step in order to improve your ability .
For example , let 's say you know many formulas about math , but does n't know how to use it .
Of course it is really important to know formulas .
But , when you have a math test , you will be confuse because you have no idea what the formulas mean .
You 'll have variety of facts , but you ca n't use it properly .
By contrast , if you understand the concept of the formulas , you know how and when to use it .

Secondly , if you know the concepts of something , it is easily to understand the facts .
This is because you feel comfortable when you have some images that are related to the facts .
I can say this by using example from math formulas again .
If you have images of basic formulas , you should n't have hard time to memorize many formulas at the same time .
Sometimes I get confuse when I encounter to new rules we use in the math class .
This is because I do n't have a basic understanding about formulas , which means I have no ideas about it .
When I know how to prove why the formula can be used , I have deep idea about it , so it is not painful to memorize it .
Also , if I know some backgrounds of these formulas , I do well on the math exam .

Finally , you can improve in some ways by understanding the concepts .
When I play golf , the ball curve from right to left .
If I want to fix this curving , I ca n't just shots millions of balls until I could finally make it straight .
At first , I have to know why and how a golf ball makes a curve .
This part is the concept .
Once I got some basic ideas , now I can hit and try some different swings in order to make the ball straight .
