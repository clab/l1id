I agree with the most advertisements ( ad ) make products seem much better that they really are .
There is two resons such that ad 's pictuers or TV comashales are not same as real products , and ad have to show that the products are looking nice .

The first of all , most ad are over acting because ad 's pictuers are very butifule and look nice .
For example , some buger chane restrant give us the ad on TV .
In the TV , the bugers are very big and fresh , but real one is not look a like ad 's .
Also , car ad is as well as the burger ad because the car run in the mountan for faster but in the real life , nomal car can not do that .
So ads are shown much better that real one by creaters .

The next , ad have to show the products that are looking nice , so ads are made much better than real ones .
The ad have to grab or cach people 's interest , so ads are made nicer than real .
For example , if a restlant give an ad to people , they make some foods pictuers .
the pictuers are have to look nice .
The picters can not smell so creater make some trick to look smell good .
Pople look the pictuer .
they think the restlant make such nice food and then they would go .
So the ad is made nicer than real one because it have to look nice .

Most ads are made much better than real once becasue ad 's and real product are not same because for example , the humbirger is not looking same as ad 's .
and the other reson is that the ads have to look nice becaseu of advrtisements .
the ad have to foock the people as many as they can .
Therefor ads ' products and real one are not same .
