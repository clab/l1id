Young people enjoy life more than older people do ?

I do not agree the statement that Young people enjoy life more than older people do , and I state my opinion as follows .

Why age ?
All people should know how to enjoy life regardless of their age .
There may be different interests in enjoying life by age groups , but age does not limit how well people enjoy their life , therefore it is ridicurous to say that some age group is not good at enjoying life .

Generally speaking , young people are considered to be , active , healthy , outgoing , curious to new things , with full energy , and go out to seek enjoyment .
But is it true ?

Old people have more knowledge and experience in life .
They are veterans who have survived many hardships in life , and they should also have experienced many joyful and fullfilling moments in life .
It is natural to expect that they know how to cope with hardships in life and make much of joyful and fulfilling events to enrich their life .

On good example is this .
Once I was in a developing country todo volunteer work .
In the country , there were many young volunteers and also older volunteers .
To my surprise !
older people there were so active and enjoyed their life in the country .
They went to off shore fishing on a boat and enjoyed cooking fish they took .
They went to camping swimming , snorkelling , and even diving , and did everything they could do !
On the other hand , those who got sick were always young volunteers .
They had trouble with food , climate , language , culture , people , and everything .
They just did not have enough experience to cope with the different environment from their modern , confy and convenient life .

Fron this experience , I learned the lesson that at any age , people can try to enjoy life .
