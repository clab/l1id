We can choose the way to trip from going alone or going as a group wity a tour gude .
When you make the plan of trip , which do you choose ?
Someone will say that going as a group with a tour guide is the best way , because a tour guide tell any infomation and there are no time to make the plan of tour .
A tour guide will provide much infomation , but I can not agree with this opinion .
Trip is my own event , there are my preference .
I want to make own plan .
Time schedule is not free , and it is hard to care group members if I go on a trip as a group .

The tour has the program , a tour guide explain about history or any infomation , then I can not change it .
If it differ from my preference , the tour will be boring .
It means waste of money and time .
Preference of people is various , then it is not the best way to going on a trip as a group .

The time schedule is decided in a group tour , it is not free .
When I want to take many picture , if I go alone , I can take freely .
However , if I go as a group , a tour guide will tell us the time to back .
I can not enjoy if there are time schedule that someone decided .

The travel as a group has many members .
I have to care about their feeling or preference and talking .
It is hard .
When I go on a trip , I want to reflesh .
The effort of caring members makes me tired .
It is not good trip .
It is better to going alone .

As I mentioned above , I can not agree with the opinion that the vest way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
When I go on a trip , I would like to go alone rather than go as a group .
I can make the schedule depend on my preference , and make free time schedule .
In addition , there are no fere about members .
