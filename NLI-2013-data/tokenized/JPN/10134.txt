I gree with the statement that people who try new things and take risks usually turn successful than those who only do what they already know how to do well .

First of all , I believe creativeness is one of the most fundamental essences for human inventions .
All valuable inventions in the past happened because people then were creative in responding to specific difficulties or needs of the situation .
Without creativeness , one needs to abide by the negative conditions or hardship .
I strongly believe one can learn greatly from failures as well and taking risks will eventually bring the person a profit in the long run .

Some people may argue that some traditional cultures are better preserved as they are , and I agree with this opinion in principle .
However , preserving the culture can take different ways than just leaving them unchanged or untouched .
For example , it is often reported that the traditional craftmanship is at danger of being lost because of the change in people 's lifestyle .
In such cases , the tradition can be preserved by adopting its style to the modern ways , still using the accumulated knowledge or skills to make that happen .
Without such challenges , that specific tradition may be at more risk of extinction than taking up a creative change .

In conclustion , I stronfly believe that being creative and ready to take risks is a very important factor for people to be successful , and hope I will be so in the face of upcoming challenges that I may encounter by studying abroad .
