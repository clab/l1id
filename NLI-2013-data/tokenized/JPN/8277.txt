I disagree with this statemant which says that understanding ideas and concepts than learning facts .
When you listen to somebody 's lecture or opinion , you might have questions about it .
Then , you might start researching what the fact is .

Imagine that you are in class , being taught about history .
Your teacher tells you one event with reading a text book .
You become interested in that historical event .
It is prooved the event is true , I think , however , it is not the only anwser , because no one saw it acutually .
You can start research to find the fact .

You might get much defferent information about it .
That is the fact about that historical event .
However , as you learned the fact , you can have your own opinions about it .
I believe that having your own opinions is the most important thing .

Understanding the ideas and concepts is impotant , because it gives you a chance to have questions .
Learning facts means that includes understanding ideas and concepts is more important .
Moreover , you can see the fact and have your opinions about matters .
