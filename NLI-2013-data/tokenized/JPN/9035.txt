I agree with this statement .
understanding ideas and concepts is more significant than learnig facts because undertanding ideas and concepts affect on the skill of remembering and explaining things , and it also helps to learn other information .

Understanding ideas and concepts means that understanding things deeply .
If you understand details of thing which you want to remember , you do n't forget it easily .
Also , you can explain about it when you are asked some one about it .
If you learn only fact , it is good for remembering for short time to answer tomorrow 's quize , but you may not be able to remember it for long time .
You ca n't also explain about it deeply in the class .
Therefore , Understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning just facts for studernts .

Another reason why understanding details is more important than learning facts is that it affects on learnig new things .
If you perceive details of thing which you learn perfectly , you can understand things which you will learn next easily .
Most of the things which student learn in school such as math , chemistry , phsyics or english tend to relate to each other .
When you learn new things , new things are came from old things which you have already learned .
Therefore , If you understand ideas and concepts deeply , you can understand new things easily .

In conclusion , understanding details deeply helps to remember and explain things which you learned and to learn new knowledge easily .
For all these reasons , understanding ideas and cocepts is more important than learning facts for students .
