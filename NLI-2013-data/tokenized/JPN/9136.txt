I agree the following statement `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''
I really think it is more impotant to learn the ideas and the concepts more than the fact .

Students need a lot of idea to grow not only their bodies , but their inside such as opinions and the way they think .
I am not saying that to learn fact is not important , but I think it is more important to learn ideas and concepts .

I think facts come from ideas and concept .
If there is no fact , there would not be any fact in my opinion .
So I think students need to learn about the facts and concepts and then learn about the facts .
If they learn the facts first it would be difficult to understand why it happened or why it became like that .

Today , the offices and the companies looks for the ideas and how creative are the people when they hire new staffs .
You might learn some ideas or the way it is , but if you learn ideas it woud give you more facts and how it is .
I believe that both are important but it is more important to learn about ideas and concepts today .

Facts might be more important to some other kinds of job , but I think most of the jobs needs more ideas and concept than facts .
In the old days they might needed more facts instead of ideas and concepts , but today , it is more important to learn about ideas and concept to improve your opinion and what you believe .

Finally I think it is important to learn both `` ideas and concept '' and `` facts. '' but fact needs some ideas and ideas and concept causes facts .
It means they both need each other and people needs to learn both .
If you learn just either one it would not do any good , but I think students shoud learn about ideas and concept more than facts .
