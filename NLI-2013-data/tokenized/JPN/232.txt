I agree with the statement : the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
A person does not have to worry about getting lost or hurting his brain planning where he should go , a person can learn a lot of things by having the tour guides explain , and the travel will be much safer .

First of all , a person does not have to worry about getting lost or hurting his brain planning where he should go .
The tour guides are professionals .
They earn money from guiding tourists .
Of course , they know the land better than the tourists .
There is no need to worry about getting lost or going to the wrong place .
Also , a person does not have to think about where he should go each day .
The tour guides know where the best places are for people to go in the amount of time they have .
Fun is guranteed .

Second of all , the tour guides can give a person an excellent explanations and some tips that he should know .
It is always fun to know mini trivias .
For example , when my family and I went to Cancun , we visited a famous historical landscape in a tour .
Our tour guide made our trip much more exciting by adding trivias and funny stories behind the history .
Usually , I do not really like learning about history , but I really liked what I have experienced .
I also learned a lot from it .
By just looking at the buidings , I would not have learned much information , just only the basic facts .
Yet , by having a tour guide explain things , I could understand better and was more interesting .

Finally , the trip would be much safer when someone is going on a trip in a group .
People might try to steal money or trick that person if he was alone .
He might not even notice it .
However , if a person is in a group , someone in the group is likely to notice that people are trying to trick the person .
It is harder to trick twenty people rather than just tricking one person .
Thus , it is safer .

To conclude , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
A person does not have to worry about getting lost or hurting his brain planning where he should go , a person can learn a lot of things by having the tour guides explain , and the travel will be much safer .
