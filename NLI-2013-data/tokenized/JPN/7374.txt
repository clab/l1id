I disagree with the statement .
Traveling in a group takes away your freedom in time and space You may find it is easier and safer to move around in a group , but in reality , if you wish to go and stay in a certain place for a certain time , that choice is not possible if the group has a different agenda .

A tour guide can be useful and informative , but this also takes your agency of deciding what to see , where to go .

The best part of traveling in a group with a tour guide is the safety and the less effort you need to gather information about the place , and information for ensuring the safety .
But this is also the worst part of traveling in a group , in that , it eliminates positive accidents .
By positive accidents , I mean your opprotunity to meet people , find a great shop or street by accident , find a new things about the place which may not be marketed in the mainstream tourism .
Traveling in a group can take away some occurences that can only happen because you have no agenda or specific information , because you wonder around .

A good example of this is going to a restaurant .
If you travel to Hong Kong , you find there are restaurants that are specifically for tourists .
They are expensive , give less ifnormation about local food and culture , and you meet no locals .
But if you are willing to take a risk of wondering around , asking around the local people to show a good restaurant , that experience can give you so many episodes .
You get to communicate with the local people , maybe try speaking a foreign language , find out what is considered a good food in the place and how to use the public transportation , and line up in the restaurant and eat , learning the `` local '' way of doing things .

Since I prefer adventure and really experiencing a place when I travel , instead of being a part of marketted and `` selling out '' tourism , I choose to travel alone , in my way , in my own timing .
If I work hard to find a good restaurant , I would like to decide what to eat there and how long to stay , not minding what the group may and should do .

Some may say the trouble it takes to gather information about the place on his/her own is too much , and it is better to leave the job to the tour guide .
However , recently there are so many books and websites about traveling alone ( or as a couple but without any guide ) that are easily accessble , that the things I mentionied above about getting around on your won can be easily found in a book , such as `` Lonely Planet . ''

After all , traveling is a means to get away and placing yourself in an odd situation , getting away from your mundane life and chores .
In that perspective , no group tour is beneficial if that limits your adventure - possitive accidents .
By planning and traveling alone , you may find a new aspect of the place you are visiting , which is your own original version and not the marketted version that are equally given to any tourists .
I think my position can be easily supported by the numerous current TV programs about backpaking , traveling alone , seeking so-called adventure in traveling .
A famous example of this will be a program called `` global trekkers . ''
Now the trend is in adventure .
Traveling in a group with a tour guide may be a good idea for older people , but for myself , I chose traveling alone .
