I disagree the statement , `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . ''

I personally like to travel very much and I have been both on a group tour and on my own .
Although being on a tour was very helpful in a way which it gave me a lot of information that I was not familiar with regarding the places I was visiting , I still prefer traveling on my own for several reasons .

First of all , if I plan my trip and book flights , hotels , and so forth , it is usually cheaper because I am not paying an additional fee that is going to be paid to the tourist company .

Secondly , I would like to take time at places I go .
In a tour , you have to think about other people in the same group , so you cannot take as much as time you want at a certain point during a tour .
But if I travel on my own , I can create my own schedule based on what I like to do and what I am interested in .
It also gives me freedom and flexibity on changing the schedule wherever and whenever if I feel like .

Thirdly , I like to go to such local places as people markets and street-car restaurants where most tours would not cover .
I like to talk to the local people and find out where they really go .
I think one of the things about travel that would excite me is that travelling like living .
Of course I am a traveller , but at the same time , I would like to learn about the city or country in depth from the perspectives of local people .
Places that you go on a tour are probably the most beautiful parts of the city or country , which do not necessarily reflect the characteristics of the city or the country that you 're travelling .
Therefore , I would like to go to local places that I would not get to visit as a tour group in addition to famous sight seeing spots .

As a fourth point , I think that a quality of a tour mostly depends on a quality of a tour guide .
I have had a tour guide who did not have enough experience .
Because she lacked the efficiency , we wasted some time or failed to gain certain infomation .
The worst tour guide I have had was the person who discriminated people in the county that she was guiding .
She would tell us distorted stereotypical images toward people and places there .
I could not stand the way she perceived those people and the way other tourists would accept her words without any critical analyses .
Since a quality of a tour has much to do with a quality of a tour guide , it is pretty unpredictable whether the tour would be nice or not .
I would not take such a risk while paying a lot of money .

Finally , I do not want to travel with many strangers .
For me , travelling is something I do for my own pleasure and interest .
I would hate being distracted by the people unnecessarily and also would not want to accomonate in their way .
The time I am on travel is one of the most precious time I appreciate .
That 's why I would like to travel on my own or with friends and family that I would feel comfortable with throughout the trip .

For all the reasons above , I disagree the given statement , `` The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . ''
