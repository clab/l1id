I agree with the statement .
To make the point clearer , I have taken `` their communities '' as their local communities where they live .
I do not know how many young people attend their local community events or even strictly obey rules in their local community .
Examples are everywhere .
One of the reasons would be that such behavior to help their local communities needs to be learned some way or another , but not learned .
If young people lived with their parents or there were neighbors who had known them long time , they could learn it .
If young people lived in the same place where they grew up , they would undestand naturally how to behave .
But young people nowadays tend to live alone or only with their spouses and far from their hometowns .

Another reason is that since nowadays almost all the every day life is supported by business undertakings , people can live without helping their communities by themselves .
