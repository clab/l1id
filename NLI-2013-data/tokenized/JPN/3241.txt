I gisagree with this statement .
It is true that some young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , but there are also some young people who do it .

for example , my friend went to elderly peoples dorm to do volunteer work .
She talked a lot with the eldery peoples .
she said to me '' Elderly people looked happy when I talked with them .
Oher student just went there as intership , but I think we did volunteer work .
We could make them happy . ''
When I heard that , I felt that young people nowadays not all bad person .
The are many young people who are kind and do volunteer works .

Another example , I had cleaned my city to do volunteer work to take up raddishes on the road when I was a elememtaly school student and a junior high school student .
Other students in our city also did such a volunteer work .

Moreover , it does n't mean '' give enough time to helping their communities '' but I want to say this .
Nowadays , I often see that young people give thier seats to the elderly people .
I also often give my seat to elderly people .
Does n't it mean we help our community ?

I also think that working very hard , taking great degree at school , keeping the best score by school activity sports and writing great arts also means that we help our community .
For instance , great school which made grate students will be known other cities and thev city will be famous .
There are many students who study hard or plactice sport to win the play .

Above all , I disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time helping their communities .
