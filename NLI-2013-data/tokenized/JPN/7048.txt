I disagree with this statement .
I think that car is very important for our life .
Some people who live in convenient city do n't care to nothing car but local people do n't think so .
For example , `` Shopping '' .
Recently , many shopping moals and big supermarket are located in the place where is far from city or inconvenient place .
If those people do n't have a car , they can not go shopping anywhere .
And local place dose n't have many trains .
