Although young people tend to have more energy to do something than older people do , I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people .
There are two reasons for this : money and experiences .

To bigin with , the old people usually have more money than young people have .
This means older have more opptions to do something than younger .
For instance , when we want to travel somewhere , the panphlets of travel for senior tend to be costly than those for family or young people .
This is becouse , the older have tendency to eat better dishes or ride on more comfortable vheicles .
However , in general , young people focus on the cost .
We can also this tendency in panphlets of travel .
This shows that the older can more flexible how to spend their money and how to select their plans .

Next , older people have more expereinces than younger people which are based on the long life time .
Therefore , older people have less possibility to make wrong dicision .
For example , when we ca n't decide which way to choose about something , we are often consulted by older .
This is because , if we decide wrong way , sometimes we recieve inconvenience .
This means that older poeple can avoid such inconvenience by their own judgement .
For these reasons , I take issue with the idea that young people lead more enjoyable life than old people .
Each group of people can enjoy their life as their own way .
