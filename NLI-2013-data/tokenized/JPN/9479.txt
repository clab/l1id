When we are students , most teachers teach us idea , concepts , and facts .
I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn fact .
This is because there are several benefits .

One is that we can use the idea and concepts not only one case .
It means that learning the idea and concepts make us intelligent .
For example , my teacher who teaches middle school always says that it is meaningless to remember the answers .
It is more important to think that why it is happen or occure .
To understand the idea and concepts is going to be not only the memories but also the power of thinking .

The other is that the facts is not always true .
For example , famous TV show was stopped in Japan last week .
This is because the TV show said completely faked things .
If people do n't know the idea and concepts , they only beleive the facts even if that is incorrect .
We get the knowledge from researching .
When we doubt something , we have to check and find the true fact .
In order to get the true fact , we should understand the idea and concepts .
So , teacher want us the flow to lead the answers during the test .

Concequently , I agree that understanding ideas and concepts is more efficient for students than learing facts .
Above those , one is that idea and concepts proveide us the power of thinking .
The other is that fact is not always true .
We need to research something in themselves .
