I disagree with this opinion .
Cars are developing better and more conveniently recently .
There are navigations and you can watch TV on the car when you rest to drive a car .
If there is navigation , you do not get lost , and you do not have to bring a map .
When you drive somewhere , and you cannot find somewhere to stay , you can stay in a car .
If there is TV in the car , you are not bored .
Most of cars have music players .
They are high quality and clear sound .
Recently cars ' technologies are getting safer and more comfortable .
Some cars let you know when you almost hit walls and people .
The way of driving became easier than before .
It was difficult to drive cars before .
Because it is complicated to move cars before and it is dangerous to drive .
It is difficult to control speed and if you make mistakes to control , car stopped suddenly .
But there is two types of to control cars , manual and auitomatic cars .
Manual cars are old style to control .
But it is easier to drive automatic cars than manual cars .
Automatic cars are easy to control and safe .
You can control speed easily and when you make mistakes to control , cars will not stop suddenly .
Recently there are small cars .
You do not hit walls easily with small cars .
In contrary , there are big cars too .
You can let many your friends and your family in a big car .
You can have fun to spend time with many friends and family in a big car .
There are fasionable cars recently .
Their colors are various .
There are blue , red , yellow , purple and any beautiful colors .
Some cars ' inside is decorative like club , and you can listen to music loudly .
They are popular with young people .
