Without question , I disagree this statement .
there are two reasons : dvelpoping countries and the evorution of cars .
First , the people who need car become more larger in these twenty years than today .
because in most of the developing countries , the population are becoming larger and larger , and in such coutry people want to have cars as they become rich .
For example , in China there were many people who only have bike in ten years ago , but today many chinese come to rich and bigin to buy cars .
Thus , as developing countries grow in economically , needs for cars is increasing .

Second , in these days , cars become more harmless for environments because of the evorution of their tecnology .
For example , soler cars only uses sunlight and dose not contaminate air .
If these cars become more cheeper , people who care about environments could use cars .
Thus in developed countories , the needs for cars may not decline .

All in all , I can not agree with that in twenty years there willbe fewer cars in use .
Because this opinion dose not concern about needs in developing countries and evorution of tecnology .
