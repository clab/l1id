I think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This can be said from my own experiences and from what I see from other people 's experiences .
One of the reasons I think this is because , younger people have more power or stamina to do things .
For example , if a 50-year old person were to play baseball , he/she would have a hard time in hitting the ball and running to the base , and catching a ball and throwing it .
As for the younger people , they still have a lot of strength and energy left to move around and use as much power as they want .
Younger people have an advantage that they are able to move quicker and stronger compared to older people , so I think younger people would enjoy sports more than older people .

In my own experience , my dad and I were playing catch .
I could throw really fast at my dad , but my dad could n't throw that fast .
I think this was because he got tired faster than I did , or he did n't have much strength so he could n't throw a ball like he used to when he was young .
We can see that if we get older , our choices of what we can do will decrease .

Another example that young people enjoy life more than older people is that young people can fool around more compared to older people .
This can be said because if an adult were to jump around naked in his/her yard , he would get caught by the police .
On the other hand , if a 5-year old boy were to jump around naked in his yard , he obviously would n't get caught .
As you can see , older people have more restrictions compared to young people .

In conclusion , I think that young people will enjoy life more than older people do .
This can be said because younger people have more opportunities to do certain things than older people like play a sport , or go naked in your yard .
I have never been old before , but in fact , I am having the greatest time in my life now , YOUNG !!
