I do n't agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
We watch TV , listen to the radio , or watch internet everyday and while we watch TV programs , listen to radio programs , or watch internet website , we often see or hear numerous different commercials that explains about numeours kinds of products that the company want to sell to us .
Although some advertisements are really exaggertaed and give false information , I think most advertisements provide us with correct information .

The advertisements we often see during the commercial break on TV is the car advertisements .
When it comes to a car advertisemt , it shows us the outside and the inside look of the car and provides us with the engine information , safety information or warranty information .
There is no way for the car company to exaggerate or lie about their cars .
Because for example , if they lie about their car 's safety , they can easily get sued or prosecuted by the government .
There are also electronic wheel chair commercials too .
The commercials tell us that teh electronic chair is safe , useful for elderly people and also has warranty .
Now , is there any way for the companies to exaggerate or give flase information about the wheel chair .
Absolutely , no .
Commericials of the comapnies that sell mechanical products are mostly not exagerrerated and therefore , consumers can rely on them .
ALso about pills for headaches .
Those pills just work fine and they are not exaggereated .
If they do n't work , the comapny would not be able to sell their products in the first place because the government check their products before they sell .

Therefore , I do n't think that most comercials make products seem much better than they really are .
