Some people believe that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It seems to me , however , they get to be spending their time to supporting their communities .
There are three reasons for this .

First of all , increasingly , in these days , the school introduced the social communication class in the program , and young students especially students in junior hight school and high school join their communities by cleaning their town , helping seniors and so on .
It might be a compulsory education in the first place ; however because of this educational system , young people are aware of the importance of this activity , and gradually intended to join it afterwards .

Secondly , it seems that young people are getting the leader position in a lot of communities to contribute in these days .
In some area in our country , Japan , there are some activities which put the the age limit ( 25-30 year old ) to be a member of social communities .
Moreover in order to attract the young people , some communities offer the special reward , such as paying the salary or providing land .

Thanks to these activities , young people are more getting involved and helping their communities by teaching sports , their cultures , and so on .
Finally , in these days , it is frequently mentioned that now is the time of changing generation in Japan .
As you may see the election of prime ministor in Japan , Mr. Shinzo Abe , who is the youngest prime ministor , was just elected few weeks ago .
Thanks to this trend , it seems that young people positively get to feel that they have more chance and power to join their communities to achieve and help something more , even though they are too busy to spend their time to do this kind of voluntieer work .

In conclusion , using these above reasons as a basis , I would mention that young people nowdays have positive intention to help their communities .
