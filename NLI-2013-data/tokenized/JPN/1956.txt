I completely agree with this issue that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I believe there are some reasons about it .
Young people can be more interested in many things than older people .
Young people are likely to be able to do more active sports such as baseball , soccer , tennis , runnning , swimming ; on the contrary , older people are likely not to be able to do them .
Young people are likely to have stronger bodies than older people .
Moreover , Young people are likely to get more new abilities than older people , and young people are n't likely to forget them .
In addition , Young people are more hopefull than older people .
Yong people have many choices for their future .
They can easily find the way their life go .
People make many friends and look for their partner when they are young .

Thus , young people are likely to be able to enjoy their life more than older people because of these reasons .
However , despite of the reasons , It 's important for both young and older people to make effort to enjoy their life and hope to be happier than now .
