Some people might think that successful people try to new things whereas others might believe that they should do well what they already know for the success .
In my opinion , I can agree with the statement only if the success people already do well what they already know .

One possible reason is that doing easy things can reduce the risk of failing to do new things .
If small problems that can be easily coped with are left for long time , it will be the interraption of the succession .
Even tiny problems can be bigger when they are left over for a long period .

If the basic has been done , the successed new thing will yield more benefits .
Even if there were small things which were easy to be done , they would results the liability .

To success , the things that are basic and have known already sould be well done .
It decreases the risk of the failure , and the new things that are tried will increase the benefit from the succession .
If only new things are tried from no background , that will yield nothing and cost .
