In my opnion , this statement is true .
It is because most young people spend their time not helping their communities but theirselves .
For example , some people have to work for their life , other people have to study for passing the school-entrance-test .

You may think , however , many people belong to clube or volunter-activity .
Of couse , some people take part in some activities , but the number of them is decresing than the number of them in old years .
This fact shows us that young people today do not give much time to participate activities .

So , it is true that young people today do not give much time to helping their communities than young people did at the old day !
