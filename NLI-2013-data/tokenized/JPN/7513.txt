I strongly agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are three advantages for this : cost , time , and good places to visit .

First , it is much cheaper to travel in a group than travel alone .
In group travel , I can take discount .
For instance , if I try to go to Sydney , Australia , the return ticket may cost me more than 200,000 yen .
However , if I choose the travel agent 's plan , it 'll cost me around 100,000 yen .
It is ridiculous to pay such a high price to travel alone .

There are many fees for trip such as accommodation , meal , or entrance fee .
If I join group tour , I can take discount all of them .
Therefore I can save a lot of money .

Second , I do n't have to worry about schedule .
Tour instructors always know about location , If some trouble happen , the tour instructor always cope with to adjust the plan .
And they well know about history , so they simply and kindly explain us about the sightseeing spot .
If there are some trouble during the trip alone , who can look after me ?

Third , I can travel a lot of good and nice places to visit .
If I travel alone , it is much more difficult to arrange buses , trains , or planes than joining group tour .
If I went for a trip by me alone , sometimes I might take pain to kill time , and sometimes I might about to miss the transportation .
However , if I join a group tour , I do n't have to worry about it .
I 'll have more time during the trip , and that means I can visit more good sightseeing spot .

In conclusion , I strongly agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
