Some people think that the more important thing for students is to understand ideas and concepts ; other people think that the more important thing for them is to learn facts .
Both ways are very important , but I prefer to lean facts .
There are three reasons .

First of all , learning facts is basic of study .
For examle , when I was high school student , I had a history class .
This class 's purpose is learning historical facts , not ideas and concepts .

Second , students can get the specific while they are learning facts .
For instance , in math class , students are supposed to learn formulars .
This is the facts .
Finally , learning facts is to understand the truth .
In other words , facts never tell a lie .
However , if students understand ideas and concepts , it has possibilities for them to misunderstand .
For example , everybody has own idea and concept even though they are correct or not .
If these ideas and concepts are correct , they make senses and have no ploblems in their lives .
However , if they are wrong , they do not makes senses and have a lot of troubles .
In order to prevent that , student should study facts , not ideas and concepts .

I do not mention that it is not important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
At the same time , I do not mention that it is important for them to learn facts only .
As I stated , both ways are very important for students , especially young students .
In Japan , a lot of schools such as a elementary school , a junior high school , and a high school , teach their students facts .
However , a lot of universties teach thier students ideas and concepts because they are not young .
In addition , they have abilities to understand ideas and concepts .

In conclusion , it is more important for students to learn facts because they need foundamentals of study , especially young students .
