Students have variety oppotunities to learn not only understand ideas and comcepts but also fact .

At that time they know how do they live .

However , when they start to live by themselves they realize how is life going on .
they have to think about thier meals , living costs , leisures , and studying .
They can only learn form facts about that , not from ideas .

we know how much friends important , or how much family is helpful , and there are coming from not concepts but facts .

Besides , learing from the facts is more important for st
