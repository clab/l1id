While it is important specialize in one area , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific are particularly before decing the area of expertise .
It is because it is rarely the case that an event can be explained by focusing only on one area of academics .
Furthermore , it is critical to have well-rounded appreciation for any number of subjects in order to determine the area to specialization .

The world is full of examples where a broad knowledge of academic subjects is criticall in understanding the present situations .
Understanding the war in Iraq , for example , will require one to have an in-depth knowledge of politics , economics , business , religion , social and ethnic issues , and naitonal security or defense .
One cannot explain the situations without at least having some understanding of all surrounding issues .
( For example , can we leave out discussions on oil and focus only on pursuing democracy ? )
Although focusing on one particular issue is important , it can be achieved only after one has become aware of the fact that many of the events and issues are closely intertwined with one another .

The purpose of the general or required courses that the universities offer to the first-year students is to provide them with opportunities to broaden their ideas and interests .
These courses allow students to experiment , by allowing them to take courses in the areas that they might not have otherwise considered taking .
Being exposed to a number of subjects forces one to `` connect the dots '' and to analyze .
For example , in one course on religions of African diaspora , I learned that understanding of religions , politics , and social factors were necessary to appreciate those religions .
Had my focus been only on one issue , I certainly would not have had as much fascination with the significance of certain items or rituals than I did .

Therefore , I believe that while it is important to specialize in one specific subject , it should be done only when one has obtained braod knoweldge of many academi subjects .
Hence , it can be argued that having broader knowledge is better than specializing in one area .
