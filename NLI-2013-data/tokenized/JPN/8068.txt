The issue at hand is whether students are supposed to know ideas and concept or to know only facts .
Even though some people consider memorizing facts is more important , I agree with the statement , which means that understanding ideas and concepts are more important .
First , I would like to discuss it by using specific academic subjects .
For physics , some teachers think that students should learn only formula , ie facts , not basic concepts .
Last year I had a teacher who belives in this way and I was miserably confused .
As the formula of physics seem to be identical , I could not figure out what formulae I was required to use in the exam .
As a result , my grade was terrible .
However , this year , my teacher has taught me the fundamental concept of physics and how each formula came form .
This time , I could handle formula and succeeded in the exam .
From this reason , I strongly believe that understanding ideas is extremely prominent and vital .

Furthermore , it is essential to learn concepts because leaning and memorizing facts are just pain .
In my opinion , to learn something is to deepen one 's knowledge by having fun .
If people are encouraged to memorize facts and not to learn basic ideas , they will likely to dislike studying .
On the other hand , if they are supposed to learn concept , they will be able to know the way a thing is and realize how much learning can be fun .
For instance , learning histroical facts are boring .
Nevertheless , understanding why the event happened is a really attractive method to approach history .
In other words , memorizing what happended during the World War II is not fun , but understanding why this happened is extremely interesting .
In this manner , understanding ideas and concepts is suited to my opinion .
