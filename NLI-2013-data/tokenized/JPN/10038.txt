I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
For example , when Albert Einstine discovered new things , he did n't know any of those things .
He was n't familiar with his discoveries and did n't know them well .
But he took a risk and tried new things which lead to his great discoveries .
If he did n't take risks and just kept doing what he was already familiar with , he would have never found out all those famous discoveries that he did .
Because he took risks and tried new things , he discovered new important things which made him successful .

Another example is the Lewis and Clark expedition .
Before they went on their trip , no one knew what was waiting for them in the west .
But Lewis and Clark took a huge risk , leading a group of peoples into the west , hoping that there would be a great discovery there .
If they just stayed in areas they were familiar with , they would have never found the great west .
Because Lewis and Clark tried something new , they were able to find the west which made them very successful people .

My last example has something to do with something that can relate to everyday people .
My little sister was working on a science project last week .
After she had done all the required things , she took a look at her project .
She was worried that she would n't get a good grade on it .
So she called me over and asked what she could do to make her project better .
I told her that she should do something creative that other students would n't do .
Something creative would make her project stand out and catch people 's attention .
So my little sister took my advice and did something that was n't even on the rubric for the project .
By doing this , she was taking a huge risk of losing points on her project .
But because she took this risk , the teacher told her that her project was the most creative project and got extra points .
By taking the risk and trying something new , my little sister was able to earn extra points which made her grade over 100 % and also a very successful student .
In all these examples , they would have never been successful if they did n't take the risk and try new things .
But becasue they tried new things and took the risk , they were successful .
