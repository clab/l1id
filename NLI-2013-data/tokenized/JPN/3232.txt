I strongly agree that young people thesedays do not give enough time to help their communities .
There are three main reasons that illustrate this trend .
First and foremost , the number and the size of the community itself has dimminished .
In the modern society , mobility of the people has increased and the oppotunities of the transfer because of changing job have rapidry increased .
Therefore , the community is dimminishing so that there are few oppotunities for young people tto attend helping their communities .

In adittion , young people are becoming more and more independent of their communities .
Highly developed transportaions or telecommunications reduced the neccecity of the community .
The dependence on the community increase the motive to contribute to the community .
Therefore , the less young people depend on their communities , the less they want to help their communities .

Last but not least , developing social welfare are taking place of the help of young people in the community .
Some decades ago , to help the elderly or the poor in each community , the help of young and tough people was vital .
However , in the modern society , to care for the elderly or the poor is the domain of the goverment .
Therefore , the community itself does n't need young people 's help .

In conclusion , the role of young people in the communities has been little value and the role of the communitied for young people has , either .
Therefore , not only the motive of young people to help their communities has be less , but also the opptunities to do so has also been reduced .
What to be blamed is not only young people .
