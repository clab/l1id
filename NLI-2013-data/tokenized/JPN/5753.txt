I completely disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
I have three strong reasons to support my opinion .

Demand of cars are huge .
It is spread worldwide and no one can now believe life exist without cars .
In America , I experienced we definitely need cars to live especially in rural religion .
To go to the supermarket , to meet my friends , to go to school even , we need cars to bring us .
It is impossible to walk to the station , if it is placed far from one 's house .
I do not think that this situation and demand will change in twenty years , which is too early .

In my country , Japan , car industry is really huge to support out economy .
Japanese are commonly said to be good at making electorical product including cars .
Japanese companies extend not only inside of Japan , but also worldwide .
Toyota , Matsuda and Mitsubishi are companies producing great deal cars all over the world .
If there are no need to produce present numbers of cars , these companies will be in serious problem with bussiness function of my country .
As a way to maintain present economy , Japanese government will cooperate with companies .
So that people continue to buy cars for long while .

Nowadays , I saw a great news on the television screen .
It said that some American invented a new electorical car , which run faster than Jaguar and produce no gas at all .
It is actually a big deal now , however , because of this big news , other companies has got a neccesity of inventing one of these cars .
I think in a few years , it will enable to public to see electorical cars in a city and ride on them .
This is great opportunity for people to get along with environment of the earth .
Thus I think cars numbers of cars will not decrease , but car will function in other meaning .

I believe
