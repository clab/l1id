When I was younger , I was not good at mathmatics .
Then my parents recommended me to go to a place where I can study for math more .
According to the experience in my past , I strong ly agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts for students .
The reasons why I think so are understanding ideas and concepts helps to memorize easily and it makes me be ready to solve more complicatied problems .

First of all , I can memorize the elements easier when I can understand ideas and concepts .
understanding ideas and concepts means what I learn becomes my knowledge .
For example , I went to a place to learn math when I was a child .
Then my instructor taught me how a formula was made .
Every formula has an original partern .
So I just remember several basic formulas and then I can get different formulas by myself with the basic formulas .
Usually teachers recommend students to memorize every single formula as if they are all facts we have to learn .
However , my instructor showed a process how formulas are made .
The behavior lead me to understand ideas and concepts of formula .
Therefore , understanding makes the amount of momerizing .

Secondly , understanding ideas and concepts gives me more flexible comprehension when I have a more complecated problem .
For example , as math problems , there are different levels of problems .
And for tough questions , sometimes I ca n't solve tough question with basic ideas .
In that situation , it does n't work to learn facts because I need more creative and flexible solutions for the tough questions .
At the time , as my instructor did for me , if I understand ideas and concepts of math , it will be much easier to creat new ways as solving the problems .

As my conclusion , it is more importand and acutually more effective for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts because stuents are required more creative thoughts .
Facts cannot change anything because facts are already complete .
That 's why it is a fact .
However , understanding is
