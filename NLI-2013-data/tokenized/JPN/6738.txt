I think that the number of cars in this time will be fewer than that in tenty years later .
I think above becaus of air pollution problem , improvement of other transpotation systems and expenxive lands .

First of all , air pollution will be more serious .
Cars pollute a lot of duty gus .
Even now , air pollution is serious social problem .
People will notice that we must not leave the duty environment for thier sons nad daughters .
So , they will escape to driving cars .
Other people will think that they want to lung cancer .
So they will not buy cars .
Finally , many people think that driving car is bad thing for Earth and all lives .

Secondy , other transpotation systems will be more improved .
Now government and transportation company spend money to improve public transportation system , such as LRT and buses , in part of software and hardwre .
The more usuful public transportation become , the more poeol use thies systems and the less number of using cars is .

Finally , government can not get land cheeply .
We have constructed enoumas roads for cars .
But there is no land that government can get cheeply .
Now , in the city , lands are fill with houses , factories , and roads .
So govenment can not construct the road that people wont to in low construction cost .

In conclud , I disagree that in twenty years there will be fewew cars in use than there are today .
I will be comfortable by reduceing the number of cars .
