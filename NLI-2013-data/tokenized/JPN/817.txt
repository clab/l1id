I think that to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in only one specific subject , and I have three reason for this conclusion .
First , let 's think about one situation , there were one univ-educateted student and he would work at a conpany , then if he learned many subjects , I think that he could get many types of works and he could show his all abilities .
In this case , if he learned only one specific subject , I think that he might do good works , but he could get only one type of work and he could n't show his all abilities .
This is mainly reason that I think it .

Second , I think that large studies might lead the person to a big heart .
If you learnd many academic subjects , you might have a big heart enogh to get the subjects .
For example , some learnd economics and politics at an university and the other leaned only economics at the same university .
The former has a kowledge about politics whether it is deep or sarrow and the latter has no knowledge
