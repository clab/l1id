I personally believe that it is true that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This is quite clear to me as we see how local events , such as festivals and `` Hinoyoujin '' going-around ( the Japanese traditional local patrol , performed at the end of each year , to warn a local community to be careful with the fire ) are excuted by olds and barely see young people to be involved .
It is not `` enough '' because it shows the lack of the sense of community among the young people and , I believe , the sense of community is essential to a healthy society .

My primary reason to say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities is that we no longer see young people to attend local events like we use to did .
For example , in the past , to my parents time , it had been a due for young people to attend local events , such a festival , and there everybody in the community got to know everybody .
As the result , they had stronger sense of community so that they are more apt to get help from each other and people could help more secure to live in the erea so to raise their kids .
But , as time goes by , later generations started attending local events less and less .
Nowadays young people stopped attending local events .
In the case of my home town , a small city , population of about 100,000 in Okayama prepecture , Japan , we rarely see people in my age or younger are involving in the local events .
That shows that the sense of community is getting weaker at leasts in one part of Japan and I do not think this is unique to this local community .

Of course , it is also true that they are many young people who is helping their communities .
