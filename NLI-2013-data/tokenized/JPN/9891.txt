I agree to this statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well .
A person who is successful is successful because they have worked hard on something that made them successful .
And being successful also allows you to do different things instead of focusing on one thing because you have that extra time to think about other things .
Trying out different things and taking risks kind of goes together .
If you are trying out something new , you are taking the risk of trying something you have never done before .

Everyone in the world wants to be successful , but everyone has their own opinion on what being successful is like .
Some that it 's money , some say it 's power , and some say it 's having a good life .
But the main question is , what qualifies you to be successful ?
In order to be successful , you have to work hard .
You ca n't just sit around and wait for success to come to you .
You have to act in order to be successful .
For instance , succeeding in life usually involves education .
If you work hard and study really hard in college , or school , there 's a higher chance for you to be successful than the others who did n't try hard .
So in order to be successful , you have to work hard .

When you are being successful , you have the time to try out different things .
You have the spare time to try other things , so you keep trying different things .
After you try numbers of different things , you want to succeed in more things .
It 's kind of like an addiction .
For instance , a successful mathmatician might want to increase his range of what he can do , so he might raise the hurdle a little and memorise the first 100 digits of pi .
After doing that , he might move on to 200 , then 300 , then 400 , and so on .
A successful person does n't try different things .
A person trying different things become more and more successful .

If you are trying out different things , you are also taking a risk as well .
You are taking the risk of being afraid , and fighting with yourself .
Because everyone is scared to do things their first time .
Think back to the first time you rode a bike .
You were scared that you were going to fall , so you had training wheels .
But after you got used to that , you tried something new and took the risk of taking the training wheels off .
This is the fist step in trying out something new .
In order to try out something new , you have to take the risk of improving what you can already do .
This gives you more experiences in life making you a stronger and more successful person .

As mentioned above , being successful is about working hard , and achieving goals .
But in order to do this , you have to try out different things instead of focusing on one thing .
And finally , taking a risk and not being afraid of what 's to come are inportant factors in order to be successful .
Again , a successful person does n't try different things .
A person trying different things become more and more successful .
