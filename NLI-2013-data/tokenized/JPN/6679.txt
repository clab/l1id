I do not agree .
Because the car is very convenient .
Why will be fewer cars in twenty years ?
In Japan , exactly , only some people have the car today .
But What do you think about the car in the United States of Ammerica ?
I think if you are in America , you have to use it .
Like big country of America need cars .
I think that no one found the train and so on .
Because that need a lot of money .
Who pay it ?

I live in japan .
And I do not have my car now .
Because I am a student .
I do not go futher way .
I do not have much money .
I do not have a car licence .
And Japan is narrow country .
So , I must not have it .
But , I will have a car in my future .
I need it .
Because it is easier than train to transfer .
I use only train or bicycle everyday .
But they are not convenient .
Not speedy .
Not easy way .
It need much time .
Do you think so to ?
Car is the best .
I think it .
Car can go somewhere .
It does not have demelit .
If you want to say , something to demelit of using car , you arge it is costly or no space ...
and so on .
Car will develop in the future .
And I think it will be made us feeling more convenient .
And I suppose like a train will be disappear in the future .
This is probably .
I hope we
