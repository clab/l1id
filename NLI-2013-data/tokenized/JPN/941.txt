Today , in the bachelor degree of the university , many people take the double majors and try to pursue the various aspects of academic subjects .
Although I graduated from only one major of bachelor degree , I believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

First , by having many academic subjects , one can acquire not only broad knowledge but also the wider scope of opinions and ways of thinking from many subjects .
To sepcialize in one subject may lead he or she have the narrow minded or way of thinking and may have difficulties to accept different opinions since he or she concentrate into one subject .

Second , by having many subjects , one may not get bored with the subject he or she takes during the university .
When one goes to school , school life is a big part of everyday life .
On one hand , if he or she concentrate into one subject , it can be bored after years .
On the other hand , if he or she have variety of subjects in school , topics of studies change and it may be more interesting to study .

Third , if one has taken many academic subjects or double ( or more ) majors , it must be easier to get a job after the graduation .
One has more academic experiences to write about in resume and he or she can apply to more variety of jobs .
However , to specialize in one specific subject is more suitable for people who wants to be specialists in the business .

In conculsion , the variety of knowledge results in people to have wider understanding and way of thinking by the background of many academic subjects people study in schools .
