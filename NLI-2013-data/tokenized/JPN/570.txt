I agree with the following statement that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more better than having specialize in one specific subject .
I am a Japanese high school student .
I am studing various subject in my school .
It is too hard for me to understand all of these , but studing a lot of subject is very interesting and I can feel happy when I understand the something new .
So , I stronglly feel we should study and get broad knowledges from many academic subjects .
Then I would like to explain more detail .

These day , there are many enviromental problems around the world .
For example , grobal warming , water pollution , air pollution , many rain forests are destoloed , and rubbish problems .
I think these problems are not solve with a single subject knowledge , so scientists in the world should share their opinions and results of study with other field of masser 's scientist to solve these problems more better .

If we have broad knowledge of many academic subject , we could think about many things , and we could get abilities something new .
