Yes , I agree with this idea .
First , young people do not have enough total amount of time .
The environment around them has got more materialized than what it used to be , and young people live in the world of multi-media with flooded information .
So now young people can choose various lifestyle , but they became busier .

Second , everything has get too commercialized , especially in urban area .
They can live comfortablly without any help of neibors , using many services provided by enterprises .
So they do not care enough about their community .

Third , communication inside community takes place little , even on the family level .
It is very natural for them to tend to spend time for themselves , not for the others .
For these three reasons I strongly agree with the statment about nowad
