I disagree that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today by the following reasons .
First , many people who live in local place will be not able to use the official translation system , trains and buses .
In the near future , many railway companies and bus companies will cut thier local lines in order to cut the cost to move trains and buses .
To get profit from the local lines , they need many passengers .
But now the number of passengers are very few .
So they cannot get profit from the local lines and they have to cut the lines .
If they wo n't cut the local lines , they need to increase their fees .
Thus , the people who live in local place want to and have to use their own cars .
When I was elementary school student , I lived in Hokkaido in Japan .
At that time , the service of many lines of Japan National Railway in Hokkaido was stopped .
Thus , My father had to buy a car .

Second , the new technologies of car 's engine will invent for saving gasoline .
Many people think that the cost of gasoline will increase and they will be not able to use gasoline to ride a car in the near future .
But nowadays , some car dealer sell new cars which have a hybrid system ( gasoline and electricity ) , for example , TOYOTA Purius , HONDA Insight and TOYOTA Estima .
In Europe , many car manifactures is trying to use diesel engine instead of gasoline engine .
At last month , CEO of Volkswagen came to Japan and announce that they will sell many diesel cars in Japan in the near future .
Thus , I think that fuel will remain in twenty years As above the reasons I showed , I cannot agree the number of cars will decrease in twenty years .
