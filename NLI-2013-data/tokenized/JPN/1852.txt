Peresonally , I disagree with the statement that young people engjoy life more than older people do .

Of course , it is not true to say that young people do not enjoy life .
They engoy life .
For instance , they play some sports or study various things and so on .
But , generally speaking , old people can do same things , too .
Therefore we can not say that young people enjoy life more than older peple do .
I think older pepole can enjoy life more .
There are two reasons .

First of all , they do the things that young people ara not able to do easily .
For example , they can do luxuary things such as clusing or traveling all over the world , because they are more rich than yonger people .

Second of all , they know the way to enjoy more than young peple .
Older people have much experiense than yonger people and they have more favorite things .
For example , my grandmother takes part in various activity such as flower arrangement and playing tenis .
That means they can enjoy life in various ways .

In conclusion , I think older people enjoy life more than young people , because of their money and experiense .
