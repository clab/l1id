Although I do n't deny that some people prefer to travel with other people , I personally disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide as per the following reasons :

First , I cannot control my schredule and select the place to visit in the travel with a group menber by a tour guide .
Of course , the group type travel is the good way for someone like beginners of travel , such kind of controlled traveling is not interesting to me because I had a lot of experince with the travel not only in domestic but also in all over the world .

Second , in case I can travel just alone , it is possible for me to enjoy the scene and atmosphere without any disturbance by other people .
However , if there is a guide or other traveling menber , I could not enjoy the travel itself under the calm circumstance .
Not menioned , some people has a purpose to be friends with others by travel , but I do not need such friends in travel .

Third , if I join the group type travel , I have to burden some unnecessary over head cost such as fee for a guide .
On the other hand , in case of traveling just by myself , I can find some kind of discout tickets and cheaper hotels like Youth Hostel and enjoy such kind of cost saving travel with my knowledge and planning .

Lastly , if I join some group type travel , I believe that I have to see some unnecessary place or monument and buy some unnecesary gifts strongly recommended by the tour guide .
I cannot endure such kind of nuisance because what I would like to enjoy in a travel is the freedom from the daily controlled society .
In this regard , I strongly hope to be free from the control or compelled recommendation during my precious time using for travel .

As a conclusion , I prefer to travel alone rather than with a group menber led by a tour guide in accordane with the above-mentioned points althogh someone would like to trave with a goupmenber in terms of safety purpose or easiness of the travel schedule and planning control .
