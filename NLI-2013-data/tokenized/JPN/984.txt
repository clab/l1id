I agree with the following .
There are two reasons .
First , I think if they have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , they would have a wide view points of see many things than to specialize in one specific subjects .
Second , I think they learn many achademic subjects , then they can know what they like or does n't like .
And they know it , they would choose one specific subject .
I think it 's the best way .
