I disagree with that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Theere are three reasons I disagree with this statement .

It is important for students to learn facts before they learn ideas and concepts because learning without facts must be hard to understand what they are learning about .
After they know the facts , it would lead students to understand what they are learning easier .
As my experience , when I was learning about the World War Two , I could not get what the teacher wanted to tell us .
And my teacher brought a video of people after the atomic bomb .
It was showing the smoke of the bomb and how the bomb affected people 's body .
Then I could start focusing on the history of war .

The facts can get attentions from people to learn .
For example , the discrimination of African American in 1970 was not big deal for Japanese teenagers for now , but it is absolutely big deal for the African Americans still .
To know the facts such as what happened to African American in 1970 makes people to understand the discrimination and how bad it is .
This means people gets concepts of studying something important , And it is very significant to be educated or having knowledge what is going on this world because to see the facts makes world peace .

The world peace are not able to made by only one person .
All of the people in this world need to have same level of information and truth .
If people try to hide the truth , fact , others get a fear and anger .
It is going to make misunderstanding among people in the world .
The fact in the past can not be changed , so people need to admit what they did or what they have been by others .

It is important and easy for students to know facts first when students try to understand concepts of the studying .
The concepts need to be though the facts because the facts make people to know and understand even thought it is not about their problem .
Then people might be started what they need to for the facts .
