I agree with the statement .
First , in the tour we can make new friends .
In my case , this summer I went kamikouchi by tour , and then I could make lot of friends .
Fathremore , I was able to get the information of other tour from the new friends , and next summer I will go with them .
Second , we can go trip without preparing , even the place we do n't know .
Forexanple , if we wish to go Egypt and we do n't have any information of Egypt , maybe we can not find the way to go Egypt with own our self .
But if we join the tour , tour guide will get information for us and introduce lot of place in there .

In addition I can go trip alone .
I do not have to find friends who are intrested to the same place .
All I have to do is choose the place to trip and find the tour to complete my hope .

So , I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
