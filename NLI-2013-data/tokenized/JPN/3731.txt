I agree that young people do not give time to help their communities .
Recently , the world became very busy and the society changed drastically compared to 50 years ago .
There are two main reasons which prevent young people from helping their communities .

First of all , young people become very busy , they can not spend enough time in their community .
For example , nowadays , young people go to not only school for studying but also private schools .
Around 75 % of junuior high school and high school students in Tokyo , Japan go to private school twice a week till night .
In this situation , it is very difficult for students and young people to spare the time in their community .
Moreover , young people 's life has been changed .
They play with their friends in the city not only in their community .
The city has been developed , and there are many entertainments , such as movies , internet cafes , and shopping buildings .
This attracts young people so much and lets them spend most of thier free time in the city .
Thus young people never come back to their communicty .

Second of all , the community itself has been changed .
Nobody in the community does not care local activities any more .
50 years ago , there were alot of local events and meetings in the community in even Tokyo area .
One of the reason of this is alot of people are moving in and out in Tokyo because of their study and work , and people do not settle down .
Thus nobody will take care of local activities .
On the otherhand , young people in the suburb tend to move out to big cities for study and work and come back several years later , and naturally , they cannot join or help their communities .

As a conclusion , I support that young people thesedays do n't give enough time to help their communities because of luck of time and change of community .
