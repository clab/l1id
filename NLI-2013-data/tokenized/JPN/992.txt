Some say that specializing in one specific subject is valuable for Japanese university students .
However , I found more advantages that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects for Japanese university students .
There are three advantages to support to have many different type of academic subjects .

One reason for my belief is that comparing some subjects are important to study the academic subject .
One example of this is that because I am taking international politics at my university , It is much better for me to know different subjects such as ecomics , business and history in order to understand international politics .
It becomes me link with other fields to get better understanding for my study .

Another reason is that it is possible for university students to meet various people who have different backgrounds .
If the student could meet each other with various knowledge and experience , they can absorb new ideas and broaden our perspectives .

In specific terms , I can consider that I met a student who is studying Indian politics and a student who is studying Chinese politics through studying international politics .
Because of different backgrouds , we shared cultural differences and exchanged a lot of information .

Final reason is that having many opportunities to get a job .
For instance , if the student only know one subject , it is difficult to choose many fields of job .
On the other hand , if the student have many academic subjects , it is helpful to choose some fields of job .
Moreover , it is used in practical flexibly .
Actually , I got a job as an account in Japan .
I will paln to change my job to be an worker of United Nations .

Considering all of the above factors , comparing different subjects , meeting new people and getting a job are advantageous to choose many academic subjects .
Thanks to globalization , having many different academic subjects will be much more vital for studnets to understand international issues .
