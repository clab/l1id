I do n't think it is the best way to travel in a group led by tour guid .
There are many good tour in the world today , and many people use them .
I do n't think it is bad to trip because people said it is so useful .
So I want to tell my opinion as positive and negative points .

First , I will tell you positive point about tour trip .
If people go to trip with some tour , they do n't need to prepare for travel such as serch famouce place or hotel .
travel agent do everything for us if we pay money .
We can go many popular and famous places and eat good food .
If we confuse something , tour guider may help us immidiately .
We do n't need to worry about anything , and we just relay on the guid and enjoy a lot .
And also almost all tour plan is good prise like not too expensive .
peaple can join it so easily .
this is the positive point .

Next , I have opinion as a negative point .
The reason why I have never join that kind of tour is I need my private time .
If I go to trip as a tour group , I have to go everywhere with member as a tour and I have to move on time .
Even though tour guider bring me to famous place , if I do n't like there , I may want to leave soon , and even though I really like one place and want to stay there , if time to go , I have to leave there .
I do n't want to be selfish , but when I go to trip , I use my money only for trip , so I should go somewhere which I want , and I should use all minites as precious time .

I have two sides of opinion about tour travel , but I really do n't know which is the best .
I think depends on people , we can enjoy travel a lot and have a great time .
