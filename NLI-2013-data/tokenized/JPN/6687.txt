I agree with the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following reasons .

First , when people do not often use cars , the air of the city will become clearer than now .
When I was Keio junior high school student , a private school in Tokyo , the capital city of Japan , I lived near the supermarket which had a lot of parkings for the cars of the customers .
The air near my house was very dark , I was always sick inmy throat .
But when I was Tokyo university student , I moved to the small town where people did not use cars at all .

So I became nice of my conditions of throat because of the cleanness of air .

Second , in twenty years more and more transportational sytem will become expanded all over the world .
When I began to work in Osaka , the second big city of Japan , I went to the office by car , because there was no transportational system , for example , subway , bus , train .
But I was worried about a heavy traffic jam every day , besides I was often late for the starting time of the office .
After two years , Now , I can go to the office by subway happily because the transportational system became expanded to the station near my office .
Now unlike me what two years ago , I am never late for the starting time of the office .

So , in twenty years , people will use more transportational systems which have not any traffic jam .

Therefore I strongly agree the opinion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
