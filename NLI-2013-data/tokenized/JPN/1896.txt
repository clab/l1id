Some people say that young people enjoy life more than older poeple do .
However , personally , I disagree this opinion .
I think that older people can enjoy life more than yonger people .
I will give you some reasons to support my choice .

My primary reason is that older people have more time and money for enjoying their life than yougers .
Youger people , like studesnts have a lot of things that they have to do .
So I don ' t think that they have much time for spending life really .
In fact , now I 'm studing arts at the Bunsai college .
In Bunsai collefe students learn arts and english every day .
Teachers both arts and english at Bunsai always give us a lot of assinments .
So Students always are busy .
They also can not have a little part time job .
As a resolt , we have no time and no money .
This every day life gives students strong stress .

Other reason is that older people have more experiences than yonger people , So I think that they know real good things for enjoy life .
For exsample , I have a lot of kind of interesting things .
For example , drawing picture , dancing , singing a song , I want to try to everthings .
But time is limited .
I think that older peple will be able to chooce a best way rapidry .
As a reult , they can spend time usefully .

Therefore , I disagree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
