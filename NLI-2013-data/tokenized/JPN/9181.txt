It is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts for students .
There are two advantages : students can get flexible ideas , and facts are not going to disappear forever .

First , students should understand ideas and concepts .
Because we need a lot of information , we have to go in society when we become an adult .
For example , we are not going to stay at same situation .
This means , we are going to be in any situation .
Specificly , we will be in a company , at the time we will get so many kind of information or situation .
When we are in the situation , we are not going to use facts ideas .
This means , If we learn facts , it is useless for our futures .
In society , we need many kind of ideas and concepts to slove a problem .
It is more useful than facts .
For this we need to understand ideas first of all .

The second advantage is that when we are young , we can imagine so many things which adults people can not imagine .
As we know , children has soft brain .
The means , they can discover new ideas .
However , almost all adult people can not imagine flexible ideas , like children , becasue they have a not soft brain .
In addition , we can learn facts whenever we want .
Becasue facts will never disappear , we should pick up precious one between flexible ideas or facts which will never disappear .
Of course , flexible ideas is more important than facts .
If we understand ideas and concepts , we will be succeed in society , becasue company bosses want to get new things to develop their company .
Bosses do not need facts , because they also might have facts already .

For these reasons , understand ideas and concepts is more important than learn facts .
In society , we do not need facts , which everyone might know .
People need flexible ideas .
We need to understand ideas to get flexible ideas .
This communicate which understand ideas means we can get flexible ideas .
