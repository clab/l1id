I agree with the idea that it is good for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
There are several reasons that I agree with the idea about this .

First of all , the facts is just one of the result of the ideas and concepts .
WIthout ideas and concepts , it would not generate a good solution -- fact .
Second , understanding ideas and concepts will help to students to think critically and efficientlly .
If students learn only the facts , they will not be able to analize why that fact is generated and where the fact is come from .

Third , fact cannot be changed because it is just a fact .
The answer is all the same , so if students learn only facts , they do not know what they should do when the trouble and problems are arise .

If students understand ideas and concepts more than it is for them to learn facts , students will be able to think more critically and productively .
If students just learn the fact , they will just the follow the rule and they cannot find the other way to solve the problem .
Therefore , I agree with the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
