I think it depends on people because there are many kinds of young people , but I think many young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I agree this points .
I would like to explain why I thought nowadays many young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I have two reasons for that .

Young people are very busy nowadays .
They do not have freetime , so they have no time to helping their communities .
First , they have to study hard for getting good mark on the test or pass the entrance exams .
For example , they go to private school after their school for studying .
Of course , they will be smart and they can get good mark , but they do not have free time .
Second , recently many young people have part time job .
After school , they go to work , part time job , for making money .
Then they do not have free time , so they can not have time for helping their communities .

Nowadays young people stay home .
there are many things which can do inside .
For example , computers and games .
First , computers can give many things to them .
Computers give many informations , so young people do not get feeling bore at computers .
Second , there are many games in the world .
Young people can play game by them selves and it is fan .
They can get fun from many things , so they stay home .

In conclusion , nowaday many young people do not give enough time to halping their communities because they are too busy to work on studying or part time job .
Then there are many things which can do inside , so they stay at home .
I think this sistuation is not good because people should help thier communities each other .
I home young people realize it .
