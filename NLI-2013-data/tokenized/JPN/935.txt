I agree with the statement in which it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
There is several reasons why I think so .
First , if you have broad knowleadge of many kinds of academic subjects , you can communicate with many kinds of people .
In other words , you can talk with a person who are studying international politics and economics and laws if you have any knowledge .
In opposite side , if you have only knowledge of laws , you ca n't talk with a person learning about economics .

Second , by gaining widespread knowledge , you can be interested in various subjects .
I think that 's so nice .
If you have interest in various subjects , then you will have more ways you can choose in your life than a person who has interest in only one thing .

Finally , we should get as much knowleadge as possible while we are living .
I think knowing is growing , so we can grow until die .
