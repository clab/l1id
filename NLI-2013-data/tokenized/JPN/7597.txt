In Japan , where I live , many people think that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide .
However , I disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reasons .

First of all , there is quite little time to take a free time , if traveling in a group with a tour guide .
For example , when my wife and I went to haneymoon to Hawaii in 2004 , we traveled there in a group with a tour guide for seven days .
we went to a lot of interesting places , but we could not stay one place where we wanted to stay longer because of restricted time schedule .
If we had been there by ourselves , we would have stayed at our favorite places longer .
As the above experience , I definitely think that traveling by ourselves is the best .

Second , traveling in a group with a tour guide is expensive .
For instance , when I travel to Kyusyu , which is located in southern part of Japan , for three days , I stayed a excellent hotel and rent a four-door car , which made reservations by myself .
The total cost of this trip was less than a handred thousand yen .
It was a reasonable price .
On the other hand , when I traveled to the same place in Kyusyu for three days with a tour guide package , the cost of this trip was twice as much as that of traveling by myself .
This clearly shows that traveling in a group with a tour guide is not economical .

In conclusion , In Japan , where I live , most of people think that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guide .
However , I definitely disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
