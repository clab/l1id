In the world , there is so many people who is successful .
I believe that they succeed becuse they tryed todo new things and take risk is makes people to succeed .

First , if peolple do only what they already know how to well , they will not improve .
We have to make an effort and charenge new things to improve .
There is so many people who know how to do well the things .
It means there is so many people who have same ability as them .
therefore , people without challensing are same as others and they will not success .

Second , to try new things and to take risk make us to know how to solve the problems .
As people try to start new things , they will expect the problems that will be happend .
Since people know what problem will be happened , they can prepare to have the problems and find how to make it better before problem happen .
If people do only what they already know , they will not think about faillur .
So if some problems occurs to them , it is hard to solve the problems .
Also once they gat some problems , they will depress more easily than those who expected what problems will be able to occure .

Becauser of these reasons , I belive that to try new things and take risks are more important than to do what they already know how to do well for success .
