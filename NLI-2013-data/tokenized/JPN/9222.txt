I agree with the statement .
I personally strongly believe that as an student , to understand ideas and concepts in any subject is very important .
There are several reasons of why I support the statement based on my personal experiences .

First , to understand ideas and concepts require certain level of reading comprehension skills so that students can fully acquire the essense of the facts or the contexts that they are trying to understand .
In other words , students are not just understanding the concepts , but gaining and improving the reading skills to interprete what is written and said in their textbooks .
Secondly , by fully understanding the contexts of the facts , students can translate what they have learned and share with others , which enable them to discuss their own ideas and opinions .
I think this is a very important excercise as students bacause by doing that , students can learn how to express their level of understanding as well as to have the oppoutunity to hear about others ' opinoins on the same subject , which also enebles them to look at things differently if others opinions are different from their own .
Thirdly , just learning facts might end up making student to memorize the facts and end up forgetting everything as time goes by especially if the contexts are not interesting to students .
Growing up in Japan , where style of education tends to focus largely on memorizing , I know how dangerous it could be .
In Japan , even in the subject of mathematics , which is require high level of understanding the concepts and logics behind the equations that are often used in solving problems , students are told and encouraged to remember facts ( in this case , many complicated equations ) .
Just memorizing the facts and not fully understanding the ideas behind them , those facts cannot be stayed in the students `` brain '' not even as information , but disappear soon later on .

Having lisiting those reasons , I strognly believe that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts about whatever they learn in schools .
In addition , to make them realize what they have leared , it is ideal to have the opportunities to share their thoughts .
By doing those activities , their knowledge will not disappear as `` memorized '' facts will do .
