First of all , I do agree with this opinion .
I have to admit that the advertisements are essential assets for any businesses of late .
In order to succeed , the company has to market their products by using a good image .

People would prefer to have the one which was better presented visually .
I believe that people usually prone to judge by its own cover before actually examming it .
Those advertisements companies know this well and they manupilate the public images of them which lead us to consume .

For instance , the supermarket chain Marks and Spencers has been widely succeeding with their TV advertisements for the food lines .
I think this is a good example for how people 's reaction rely on the images they presented .
When you see those TV spots , you would find irresistable for those products .

Overall , I think it 's simply the nature of marketing to make commodities look better
