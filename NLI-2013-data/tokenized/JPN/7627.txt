The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
In my opinion , that 's not true .
Traveling by a group which is led by a tour guide will might be a good trip .
You do n't have to reserve a hotel or restraunt , and you do n't have to plan almost everything .
But , I think thatthere is a mistake on here .
Choosing hotel , restsaunt , country , where you going to go ...
everything is fun and called `` trip '' .
Also we have to remember is , guide company could maybe make mistakes .
So your tour could be destroyed by guide company .

These are the reasons why I disagree with this question .
