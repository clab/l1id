Where I live , in Japan more people tend to think that young people have more chances to enjoy their life than older people .
However , in my opinion , I disagree with this statement for the following reasons .

I think that there are three elements that allow people to enjoy their life .
One is good experience , second element is money and last element is time .
Considering these kind of elements , older people can enjoy life much more than young people .

First older people have more experience than young people have .
Good experience is able to give a person wider human network and deeper thought .
If there is no experience about something a person want to do , he or she will not have no idea what to do and who he or she have to contact no matter how the person hope to do it strongly .

In addition , older people have more money than young people .
It is no doubt that we have to need money so much if we want to enjoy life .
Unless there are enough money to spend usual life , it is quite difficult for us to keep my body and soul healthy .
Of course , we will not be able to spend buying clothes .

Finally , older people can use a great deal of time .
Of course university students especially in Japan have a lot of time .
But , they do not know how to spend such a precious time .
Constrastly , older people well know how to use time .

I show good example to explain these elements .
For exapmle , my uncle who retired his job last year started up his own job ; Japanese food restaurant in Tokyo .
In this business , he could use throughtly his wide range network that was build during he worked at trading company dealing with various fishes nationwide .
In addition , he can much money to establish his own business .
If young person want to do same thing , he will have trouble with collecting money .
And finally , my uncle had a lot of time to thing over what kind of business he should start up .
These elements ; experience , money and time enable his life to be wonderful .

Therefore , I strongly believe that older people can enjoy their life much more than young people .
If the opinon that young people can spend their life more enjoyable is true , our future become bored .
