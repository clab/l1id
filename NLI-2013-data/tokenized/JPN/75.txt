While some people disagree with the stement becauseof global pollution problem , but I personaly disagree to the statement , there are two reasons for that : peace and high technology .
First , I think young peopke enjoy peace .
For exmaple , I am in japan and my father suffered pacific war but I do not suffer any war .
Another example , U.S.A. people dead people in iraq war is much smaller than Vitnam war .
Acoording the survey , iraq war dead of U.S. numbers are thousands of people , by contrast in vitnam war ten of thousands of people dead .
For these reason , I feel that young people more enjoy peace than old people .

Second , young people enjoy high technology .
For example , young people enjoy intenet but old people could do not it when they were young .
Moreover it is hard for old people to adapt them .
For example , sending email is easy for me .
But for my mother 60 years , she ask me every time when she send email .
In another example , thank to air taranpo it is easy for travel today .
In japan , in1970 travel to europe costs 700,000 yen .
But now it cost 7,000 yen .
for these reasons , I feel that young people more enjoy high technology than old people .

In conclusion , I think what stetement describe is right .
Since young people can enjoy the peace , and thank to high technology young people can enjoy new world .
