I totally agree with people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , because there are some reasons why it is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
For example , it is concerned with poeple 's ability to study , people 's curiosity , and people 's efforts .
It seems strange , but there are special reasons , so I ca n't never disagree with this .

First of all , people have an infinitive ability to do something , especially in this case about studying .
In the earth , only people have such a powerful and incredible ability to improve themselves .
Once people concentrate on studying some subjects , most people are more interested in it , and also they even get interests other subjects that are related to their study .
Therefore , it is entirely good for people to improve their interests and approach them a lot .
I think knowing many academic subjects are better than just knowing one specific subjects , because we can research by a lot of different sides .

Second , almost all of the people have much curiosities about a lot of topics , so in the point that people want to study more and more , we should not bother their mind , but we had better make people who want to study many academic subjects freely .
If we interrupt them , they ca n't touch their strong desire .

Finally , people can make every effort to do anything , so people 's hope of having broad knowledge is neccesarry .
If people do n't have any hopes and motivation to do something , they ca n't improve any more .
In addition , if those people are stopped studying a lot of academic subjects , they ca n't grow and their efforts become waste of time .
Also , they really want to do that , we ca n't order them to give up because if they stop making a lot of efforts , they will have nothing special and they ca n't image their higher motivation .
Even if people have too broad knowledge of many academic subjects , their knowledge will never become vain .

Thus , I can really agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subjects because people should improve their ability to astudy a lot , it is very nice for people to have a lot of curiosities to study a lot , and it is not wast of knowledge because of their efforts , so I think having broad knowledge of a lot of sunjects is so instructive for people to live in the world .
