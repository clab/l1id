Where I live , in Japan , some people think that young people today spend a plenty of time to help their communities .
I , however , agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities for the following two reasons .

First of all , young people become to use their time for other activities .
Today , there are more attractive toys and instruments than before .
For example , there are many and many games and we can use internet now .
In Japan , young people often spend thier time on playing games at thier home , a game-center .
And we can often see young people playing portable games even in the train , bus or at schools .
In addition , they usually use internet very much both by thier personal computers and internet cafe .
So , young people are very busy , as they are earnest in spending their time in above activities .
In addtion , they become to lose ability to have relation with other persons .

Second , communities , thierselves , become to disapper .
We can live a life by ourselves more easily than before .
For example , in the past , we had to grow someting and share many things .
But now , we have almost things to live in our house .
So , now , we tend not to need other peoples help and communities help .

Therefore , I strongly agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
