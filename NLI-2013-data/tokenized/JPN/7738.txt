In my opinion , I disagree with the idea in the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I 'd like to give several reasons belows .
Here is the list of reasons why I think so .

One specific reason that comes readily to mind is that I am able to not only go anywhere with whomever I want to but also change the schedule of travel flexiblly by myself if I go to travel individually .
In traveling to somewhere , I 'd rather want to go not only very popular place but also such a place where it is not so famous .
For example , it happened when I went to germany with my family by not a tour .
After traveling several days in Germany , I went to a small church with my father in early morning .
Of course I also visit very famous place , for example the church of Kelln , but at that time , I was so impressed by the beauty of that small church .
It is one of the greatest experience for me during my stay in Germany .
Like this , Of course visiting famous place by a tour group is good , but I want to go to a place which is not presented by a tour guide .
I think that tour group tend to visit only popular place .

Secoundly , I can be excited by planning a tour itself .
When I travel to somewhere , I always take long hours for planning and organizing the schedule of trip .
I 'd like to consider how I will go round , where I will go and so on .
I can learn the geographic condition of a place or the weather pattern of a place by planning by myself .
It 's preferable for me .
Planning travel is very exiciting activity .
If I went to a trip by a tour group , I would not be able to plan on any schedule because a tour guide must make overall plan .

Of course , I ca n't deny that there should exist some advantages in traveling by a tour group .
If we travel by a tour group , we can receive detail explanation about some histrical heritage or cultural things .
And we may go a place where we ca n't find by ourself because a tour guide is a proffesional and he or she must knows well about sightseeing spot than us .
This idea may make an equally valid argument for the opposite position .
But on careful consideration , I strongly believe that advantageas brought by traveling individually must exceed those by traveling by a tour group .

Considering all of the above factors , of course there are some advantages in traveling by a tour group , I find more advantages in making a trip individually .
Actually , I tend to change my schedule many times during my trip inherently , I think my nature does n't fit the trip by a tour group .
Trip that I can change the schedule flexiblly is far more fascinating for me .
