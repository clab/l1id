What kind of people do you like ?
In my case , I tend to be interested in the people who try new things and take risk .
I think that I also like the people who is doing only same things to know how to do well , however I really like the people who try new things .
Therefore I agree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

First of all , I really like challengers for new things , because I think that challengers will give me a comfortable life .
For example , when I lived in Japan , I often watched a TV program which is some people try to invent new technologies .
I love the TV program , because some inventors had been studied some difficult new technologies , finally they invented the technologies , for example , DVD , microchips and so on .
Thanks to the invents , our lives are getting better than before .
If the inventors had n't tried that invents , our lives would have n't been convenient .
Therefore I think that such people are very important .

Moreover , I really think that a challenge spirit will give us encouragement .
For example , when I worked for a bank , there is a very good salesman in the bank .
He was very famous for a loan officer , and then he often got the best sales award .
However , one day he suddenly quit our bank , and he established a business consaltant company .
Many bankers in our bank were surprised , because if he continued to work the bank , he would be a president .
However he quit .
He said that he wants to try new own business without our bank 's name value .
After he quit our bank , I was really encouraged from him .
As a result I also quit the bank , and I tried to get an MBA in the USA .

Even though we are doing very well , I really think that challenge spirit is very important for our lives and our mental .
If we did n't try new things , our lives would n't improve and our own ability and possibility would n't broad .
I think that even if we take a risk , we should try something .
Therefore I agree wiht the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing well .
