In my opinion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and consepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I have some reasons to support my opinion .

First reason is students cannot learn facts if they do n't understand basic ideas .
For example , if students are studying about World War , they study why the war happened , how many countries were in the war , what was happened afrer the war and so on .
Then , students start learning the detail facts such as how did people live during the war , what kind of strategies did each country have .

Second , if students have understood ideas and concepts , they can easily guess more detailed facts .
For instance , students can guess people were forced to join the war if students have knowledge what is war .
To understand ideas and concepts can help students guess facts .

Also , it is easy for students to aim their goal if they understand ideas and concepts .
If students make some robots , they need to build robots according to the manual says , how to build the robots .
On the process of building the robots , students recognize some fact that the robots ' parts are need to add some oil in order to let robots move more smoothly .
Like this example , students can build robots because they read the instructions .
If studets follow the instructions , they will be aware of more information such as adding some oil .
Of course students can make robots without adding some oil , but their robots might move slowly or even be unable to walk .

In conclusion , I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because : to learn facts , students must understand the ideas ; students can guess facts if they understand the ideas ; it is easy for students to aim the goal if they know the ideas and concepts .
These three are the reasons .
