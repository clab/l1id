Commuinities are essencial for all humans .
I would have to say that the majority belongs to some kind of community .
Belonging to a community will sometimes support us whenever we are having serious truble .
Therefor , if we want to maintain such communities , we must extend the importance of the communitis to ypung peaple .

It is not always the young people that are not helping enought but also the adults .
The adults must show an ideal modol to there children leading the community and be able to pass it down to the young people .
For exaple , teach your children how important it is contributing to your commnity .
As a result , young people will obtain what they have learnt from their parents and maintain the communities condition .

Helping your own community will also unite the community .
In modern days , terrists are causing serious problems .
If we are able to unit our communities , we will be able to prevent such act
