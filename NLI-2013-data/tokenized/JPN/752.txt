I strongly think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are three major reasons for this .
First , just imagine if you were an economist , and you have very specialized knowledge about economy .
Just ask yourself waht consist the Economics .
In fact , the subject `` economics '' consists of many other academicsubject like world history , mathmatics , psycology , and so on .
It could be said to another subject s too .
No academic subject can exist itself alone .
So , if you study hard , it naturally lead to the fact that you hae broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Second , when you have conversation with other people , which kind of people do you think is more fun to be with ?
The person who talks about just one topic again and again , or the person who has various knowledge about various subjects .
I think the answer is simple .
It could be said that the person who has broad knowledge of many academic subjects has better ability of communication with others , and the ability of communicaiton is really important point to live this world .
To be succesful in any field of society , its an essencial element .

Third , to have various knowledge can improve the quality of your life .
When you travel Italy , and you are familiar to the history of ancient Rome , you could spend more excitingtime .
If you can calcurate quickly and efficiently , it would be really convenient in everyday life .
Thus , various knowledge can be your tresure .

In conclusion , some people say that by specializing in one specific , we can get deeper knowledge .
I think its true .
However , does everyone needs deep knowledge ?
I dont think so .
