I agree to the statement that yound people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I think that they are not likely to join the community events , they are not frequently share the burden of the communities and it is not often that they help the neighbors who are in need .

First example of this is that young people nowadays do not join events that are held by support of communities such as festivals and community meetings .
There may be several reasons to be claimed by them .
They may be very busy for working , they may have moved from their hometowns and may be not familiar with the community .
Whatever the reason is , it is true from my experience that the younger the people are , the less frequent they will join the community events .

Another example is that they are not likely to share the burden with community members .
For example , when the community has a rule that every member needs to go on a patrol by turns , there could be a case where only middle-aged and old people work as assigned .
Younger peple are reluctant to serve for their own part probably because they are busy , or they are just selfish .

Moreover , it is not frequently observed that young people help the neigbors when they are in need .
Even though one of the family members dies , young people who live next to such family will not help them or , in extreme cases , will not pay any attention to them .
This can be partly explained that people has become more personal than social and it would be helpful to keep privacy .
This can be a good example to illustrate that young people will not give enough time to helping their communities .

As these examples as mentioned above , low frequency to join the communiy events , unwillingness to share the burdens with community members and unlikelihood to help neighbors show that young people give insufficient time to helping their communities these days .
