I agree with this statement .
Because we will see many other travelers and will speak them in a group travel .
So we can make a lot of friends and can have a great time with them .
I think travel which there are new friends is more exciting than travel in alone .
Also , tour guide is importnt .
They are guide for famouse plaeces and explain about that .
If we go to travel in alone , we will study about many things .
