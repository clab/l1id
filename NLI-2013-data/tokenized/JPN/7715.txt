I disagree with the statement .
I think it is more intereting to travel alone or by a relatively small size of the group without a tour guide .
There are two main reasons to support my idea .

First , it is true that to have a tour guide with us are better for the instructions about the sight-seeing place .
However , I prefer to look up into the guide books by myself and imagine how to travel by my own way .
When I traveled Kenya alone , it was really alone and little bit scarely .
I have to speak by myself , look into the book , and communicate by my self .
To tell the truth , that was the most exciting experience that I ever had when travelling .
Because I was alone , I really feel everything from bottom of my heart , and had a peaceful mind to think of many things freely .

Secondly , If there are friends or the people around me , that is fun only with that situation as I can talk a lot with such a people .
However , I will loose my tentions to see carefully around myself .
Also , if the tour guide explaine about the places in detail , I will become more passive to the situation .
How can I remember these sights from heart ?
It is doutful .
Furthermore , I do not want to travel in a noisy large group with only Japanese .
I can share my pleasure for sure , but may annoyed by some noisy , impolite people .
That is the worst thing .

For these reasons , I prefer to travel individually with making intereting plans and see whatever I want to talking with not only friends but also the local peoples a lot .
That will sure to make the voyage intereting and effe
