I agree with the statemaent that young people enjoy life more than old people do .
The reason is that young people have fresh mind .
Fresh mind means that mind have a capacity for feel somthing new and it is important for people because it is good for human to feel something new and without it , people feel boring in his life .

For example when I was a child , zoo was a very exciting place .
There are lot of animals which I have not seen before .
I was very suprized by elephant 's big nose , lion 's tooth , small baby bear 's lovely face .
I really enjoyed these experience at zoo .
However , I am twenty now , and if I go to the zoo again , I will not feel exciting like my child food .
Furthermore , when I will be fifty , I will not even think about zoo .
It is natural for people to lost fresh mind with their age , because we have gotten a lot of knowledge about this world .
Knowledge is not bad things but , it is actually stole people 's fresh mind from many adult people .
And we have some responsibilities with our age .
Study , work , family , thinking about personal future , these things are imprtant so they have to do it .
And then we lost our fresh mind bacause we lost capacity for mind which feel somthing new .

Therefore , I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than plder people do .
Young mind makes people 's life more happy .
