I like listen to my father 's story about his friend .
He has own company and succeed , but I think his personality is kind of strange , in other word , he is an adventourous person .
He likes to go different places and buy new things .
I thought he is a just rich person and wastes his money for fun ; however , my thought was wrong .
He is experiencing new things and planning what is next his project .
From my experience , I believe that successful people try new things and take risks .

Trying new things gives new idea while they are doing .
If people don not try new things , they cannot have creative or intersting ideas .
I think that from several experiences we can extend our knowledege and perspective wildly .
Successful people go to a lot of different places and experince ; therefore , they can inspire new ideas .

Taking risks might be big damege , but from risk , people can learn what is a problem or weakness .
Somethimes people need to fail from something because they can notice what is it wrong , but if they keep their rotuine and not try anything , they even cannot see new solution or ideas .
For example , reserching costs a large amount of money , especially abroad , but this can be big asset after they success .
So , people should not to afraid so much to take risks .

Successful people have interesting personality .
If people are doing the same things , their brain would be hard and cannot see other possiblities like stubborn .
In conclusion , I think that when people are success , they are interesting and intelligent people because of their challenge : trying new things , not being afraid of taking risks .
So , I think that thier careea reflects their personality like enjoyable and rich personality .
