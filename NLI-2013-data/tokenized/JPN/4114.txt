I totally disagree with this statement .
I think youg people should make effort to help their communities because they must be one of the members of the communities .
Firstly I think all people should cooperate with each others .
Within the community there are many kind of people , such as youg children , adults , or eldery people .
Many of them are needing help .
Especially elder people need help .
Now there are big number of elder people in Japan and there are fewer of those who can assist them .
Generally many young adults have their kids and they do not have much time to help pthers and many adults have their job and they also have no time to help .
But how about youg peopele such as university students ?
They just have paranty of time .
Of course , I think studying or working part time job must be important , but they should make some time to help elder people and help therir community .

Second of all if young people help communities they can be learned by others in the same communities .
If one helps community they have to talk with or have soem rerationship with others .
Though this process they can learn a lot of things which schools would not provide , such as traditions or old experiences .
Fow example , when I was in my hometown I sometimes went to a kind of meeting of elder people with my grandmather .
They talked me or other youg people about some great story based on their experience .
The oen I was the most impressive was his own experience in the war time .
Since no youg pepole have experienced the war at all , we should listen to the real stroy by the real person who actually had experienced it .
Though reading article is good , it would be lack of reality , I think .

For these reason , I think youg people help community and learn form them .
