I have a opposite opinion to the idea that after twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I have three main reasons for my opinion .

First , cars are convinient than other vehicles such as airplanes and bikes .
It is true that airplanes could travel faster than cars but it is not a vehicle that everyone could easily operate .
In addition , I think more people are going to use cars replacing bikes .
For example , when I was in hurry to school , I had to ride my bike since I did not have a car .
It took me long time and I was late , so I have always hoped to have a car since then .
Other example is that when I took a train to go to the concert hall in suburb area , because it was rush hour , I had to be in overcrowded train .
I did not feel good being smashed with lots of people .
Furthermoer , I had to walk to that concert from the train station because there were not any public transportation near that concert hall .
This experience made me think that cars are more confortable and convenient than any other transportations .

Second , new technologies have made cars improve .
Some people argues that cars pollute air .
However , since the technologies have developled electronic cars , it will not be bad for the environment .
For example .
I went to one town in Switzerland , where only electronic cars were allowed .
Not only cars but public buses and trains were running by electricity .
Not until I found the electronic cars did I think that cars are not going to give bad effects in environment .

Finally , the price of the car will certainly go done .
It is much cheaper to buy a car than in the past .
This means that it would be easier for people to purchase a car .
For example , if the car price goes down , people in developing countries would be able to buy cars .
Because the climate is bad in most of those countries , people would be happy to ride on a car rather than to walk on hot desserts .

For the reasons above , I am convinced that more people are going to use cars in twenty years .
