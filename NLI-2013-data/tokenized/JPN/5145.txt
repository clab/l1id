While some people may believe that most advertisements can make products seem much more attractive than the really are , I feel that some cases can be made for the other opinion against that augument .
In short , I disagree with the statement .

It is true that some advertisement can do it .
For example , the enegy drink in Japn is typical product .
The ingredients of those dirnks are usually only sweet water with some caffein .
But people are made to believe that they can get energetic by drinking them via advertisements .
By contrasts , there are also opposite case to the effect of advertisements .

As a matter of fact , I can reffer to the case of Pocali Sweat which is the most famous sports drink in Japan .
For Japanese people , Pocali Sweat sounds fresh , healthy , and sporty .
The advertisements of the drink emphisized these image on TV and so on .
However , when the maker of this drink expanded the market to outside Japan , the company was obliged to recognized the problem .
Because The word `` Sweat '' does not sound good for English Speakers , the maker has failed to advertise the product successufully , what is worse , the advertisement has harmed its image .

As another example , I have personal experience regarding advertisement .
In my school days , I opened the food stand and sold ethnic meals in the festeval .
Then , I have just emphisezed the ethnic trait of the meals , but have failed to convey the image of deliciousness .

To sum up , because the fact mentioned above , I do not think most advertisements are always effective to make products seem much better than they really are .
