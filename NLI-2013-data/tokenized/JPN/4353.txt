In the old time , people belong to the community .
When they lived in the villege or town , everyone knew each other .
But , pepole move to cities nowaday so that their life styles change .
In my opinion , young people do not give enough time to helping thier communities because they have to study hard , interest change for playing , and do not have aquaintance in the community .

First of all , young persons have to study hard so they can not have a abundant time to take part in the community activities .
Recently many people go to highschool or university .
Comparing for one hundred years ago , they must study much more time .
If they do no go to higher education schools , they afford to participate comunity activities .
However , they do not have a time so they can not help them .

Second , young generations interested in playing than hepling communities .
For example , playing sport , music , and dance fascinates them .
They feel communities meeting are boring and not exciting .
Moreover , nowadays many young person are looking for more interesting events .
They think communities are not important so refusing attendance .

Finally , city life changes the community ideals .
As usual many people move from rural to urban place so they do not know each other .
If you do not have a relationship around your house , nobody join the community .
In addition , city life has a bad human relationship .
they are not interested in one another .

In the conclusion , modern civilization afffected the social relation as well as technology development .
Young generation would change a lot of aspects .
they got a variety of possibilities .
Thus young people do not need to help their communities because they have to study hard , interest change for playing , and do not have aquaintances in the community .
Therefore I do t agree the statement .
