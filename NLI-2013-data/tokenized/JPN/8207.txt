In my opinion , I would rather like students to learn facts more than understand ideas and concepts .
I will describe why do I think so , and give an brief example in the following paragraph .
Let me say we have some issue , for this essay .

First of all , ideas and concepts are just surface of an issue , while facts are clarified matter .
Also , ideas and concepts are sometimes people 's opinion or imagination which often unreliable , while facts are reality and truth .
Those factors let me think ideas and concepts are less important than facts ; wchich ever contains details and truth are more valuable .

To give an example , several years ago at Kyoto , Japan , there was a political meeting where President Bush refused to sign the issue of CO2 .
Many countries were upset about it .
In the argument , there were lots of defferent opinions and ideas which were criticizing or supporting President Bush .
For some countries , they even changed their mind because of the President reaction .
The fact in the was that the President did not sign the issue period .
Fact never changes , but people 's ideas and concepts do .

I do not say having one 's own concepts and ideas are not good .
But when in the learning process , students need to know truths first before having their own opinion .
I think it would be wonderful when a student has his own opinion based on the truth .
