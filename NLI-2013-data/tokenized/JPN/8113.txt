I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to uderstand ideas and concepts than it is for them to lern facts .
In this essay , I would like to explain why I have this idea , with using examples of how I used to study in Japan and how I am studying in The Netherkands .

in Japan , I 've never had experiment in science class .
What students do in the class is remembering the formulas that are given by teachers and prepare for tests .
With this way of learning , students can remember a lot of formulas in short time .
However , once they finish the test , they will forget what they remembered also within a short time .
It is because , they do n't need the formula any more .

Whereas in The Netherlands , we have severaal times of experiments in a week .
Students learn the process how the formula works so that they can understand ideas and concept of it .
With this way of lerning , it takes quite long time to remember the formula , because students need time to do the experient to reach the formula .
But , students do n't forget the formula so easily .
This is because , students can remomber the formula as an ` experience ' .
I think I can remember formulas that I lern in Dutch school after forty years , because it is my experience in the school .

Also , it is so stressful to learn only by remembering formulas , and taking tests .
Students will get bored with listening to a teacher and solving questions in a textbook .
They ca n't concentrate during the class and the efficiency of stadying is low .

On the other hand , it is fun to have experiments in the class .
Students can learn while they have fun .
Humans are tend to remember happy experience and forget unhappy experience .
The efficiency of studying is hihg .

To coclude , it is much more important to understand ideas and concept than learning fact due to its efficiency .
Students , who understand ideas and concept , will remember the studying forever .
