While many adult agree this statement , I disagree with this statement .
I am a teenager , so I can see both side of viiws .
It seems enjoyable for older people since they have got knowledge in their life .
There are two detail examples which I think enjoyable .

First of all , older people do not have to be care about anything what they do by anyone else , because it is his or her own responsibilities .
For example , I have to go home at certain time , otherwise my mother worries me , and gets angry .
That is stressful for me .
I want to hang out late with my friends , but my mother does not allow to do it .
I can not wait to be an adult , and go to downtown at night .
At the time , I will appliciate my mother 's kindness .

Second reason is that I suppose that older people can see lives more seriously than young people .
I can not think the time when I marry , have children , and die , because I feel that those events will happen in an ahead time .
However , older people have enough idea toward those events , for their friends had already experienced and talked to them .
It would be fun to see near future with such a big events .

In conclusion , older people can enjoy life more than youngre people , unless they have enough responsibilities , and knowledge .
Younger people can not have resposibilities for their acting .
Furthermore , It is difficult to enjoy life without obvious knowledge such as stories from peers .
Therefore , I disagree with this statement .
