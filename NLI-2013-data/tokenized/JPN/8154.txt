If students only needed to learn facts , then why come to school ?
They should just be reading dictionaries and encyclopedias all day .
But that is not the case .
We students , all go to school in order to obtain the knowledge and moreover , actually make it `` our own '' .
If you only learned facts , then what you become after graduating is , a walking dictionary .
We need to understand the ideas and concepts ; from there , we can be one more step intelligent .

For example , what is math without understanding ideas and concepts ?
You wo n't be able to solve problems just by knowing what the formulas are .
Maybe you could answer ones where you just plug in numbers to the formulas , but anyone could do that .
What could make you one more step intelligent is knowing `` how '' to apply those formulas in certain problems .
It is more important , or rather , necessary , to understand the ideas and concepts in math .

Also , learning ideas and concepts is one of the most efficient ways in developing a creative mind .
A student will not be creative if he/she only read dictionaries all day , as they will only obtain facts .
If students are not individually creative , then every student would n't be unique .
How boring would that be ?
That is why , teachers try to give us assignments in which we use our minds to analyze and understand specific ideas of a topic .
The teacher would assign students to write essays , reports , guidebooks , pamphlets , advertisements , posters and many others , in order to be really involved in the assigned topic .
And that is how , we students really remember what we learned in class .
By understanding ideas and involving themselves in the learning system , students become creative .

Learning facts , is the way to support understanding ideas and concepts .
It could not and should not exist alone .
The two corresponding ideas actually coexist to give the students the value in learning .
Understanding concepts and ideas is learning the `` how '' of things , and valuing the facts you learned .
And the main and basic goal of learning is to be able to make knowledge , your own .
Then , from there , we can be more than just a walking dictionary .
