I strongly disagree the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to hepling their communities .
In my school days , we give enough time to helping my communites in Japan .

Developing the economy , we decreased the relationship among the communites in Tokyo .
So our school establishs new subjects which are so amazing .
I want to explain the experience through this class .

I attended the communication center in my home town after class .
My friends and old people who are over the 60 years old attended .
My friends and I taught about the IT products such as cellular and personal computer .
Although young people enjoy the Internet and cellular , old people do not use them in general .
Modern life is sastained by the Infomation Technology .
For instance , Japanese cellular can are used as railroad ticket , wallet and so on .
But it is so complicated that old people enjoy them .
If old people do not use them , they can not catch up the social change .
So we teach how to use them in community center .

Morevoer , we can learned about Japanese culture and custom from old people .
Most of our parents work together and come back late .
And we do not live with grandparents .
Many children have not chance that we learned about old Jpanaese culture .
For instance , I was learned about the drinking tea which is one of the most famous and traditional customs in Japan .

I think that communication between young and old people resolves the aging problem .
Now the number of old people has been increased rapidley , they suffer from solitaly .
But I think that young people make them active .
And it is advantage that young people learn about customs .
These activites improve community problem .

Next , I attend to the community 's activity such as the cleaing the river .
The Tamagawa , one of the biggest rivers in Japan , was so beautiful 40 years ago .
To improve its condition , I attend this activity .

In conclusion , Japanese young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities .
Aforemationed activities improve not only Jpanaese society but also the knowledge of young Japanese .
