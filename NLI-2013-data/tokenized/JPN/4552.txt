There are many advertisement that is made for many things .
Car , food , toys , companies and etc .
Us regular people who watch these advertisement defenetly grabs our attention making us buy the product or use it .
As my opinion I think products that are advertised do look better than what they really are for many reasons .

Many food commercial makes the product look very tasty juicy and big .
They also add special effects that makes it look even better .
But truth is that its just an average food that people eat .
Many fast food restraunt tries to attract as many costumer as possible inorder to sell more product as much as possible .
In my experience I once went to a restraunt because the commerical looked very good .
As soon as I get there the food looked totally different from the commercial and it did n't taste as good as I thought it would be by watching the ad .

Secondly many adverstisements use celebrities .
Many people are attracted to this because many will think if this celebrity is using this product it must be amazing .
People tends to lured in to this trap .
I also have an similar experience that I faced when I was a little boy .
I loved to play baseball and my favorite baseball player was Mike Piazza .
One day I saw a commercial about him using a bat .
He says that this is the best bat that I 've ever used in mu life .
I chose to buy this bat with out any doubt in my mind .
But i find out that the quality of the bat was very bad .

Lastly , many company use professional to advertise their product .
Many professional advertisers use their words and exageration to catch the customers attention .
Oxy-clean for example was an product that was said that it 'll get rid of every dirt and stains possible .
On commerical they showed that it really do work .
But after you try the product you 'll see that the product does not have the same outcome as on television .

Most product are usually much better than it really is .
Many company try to trick the customers by making exagerations and special effects on the commercials so people will buy their product .
The truth is that its not as good as its on advertisements .
As you can see I agree to the statement because of the reasons above
