I disagree with the statement .
I strongly think that the number of cars in use wil increase in 20 years .
There are several reasons to support my popnion .
One of them is the remarkable increase in population over the world , especially in china .
Because of the growth of economy in the developing countries , more and more people there are becoming rich , and they tend to seek for modern or convenient life .
Having a car is one of the most outstanding symbols for people to realize that the standard of their living are improved .
Therefore , a larger number of cars will be purchaesd in those countries .

There may be a strong negative opinion to what I mentioned above because environmental issues caused by fossil fuels that are consumed by cars are getting more and more serious .
In addition , the recent price upsurge of petroleum might be a great infuence on the car usage .

However , I do not think they will be a big problem .
Nowadays , new technology is being pu into our use to solve the problems of environment or energy security in the future .

One of those technologies is fuel cell .
fuel cells can produce enrgy from hydrogen without emitting green house gas .
Even though it is useless if Hydrogen is obtained by burning fossil fuels , That van bve produced by nuclear power stations .
Also , thanks to introduction of electronic vehicles , We will not need to use fossils fuels to move cars in the future .

Therefore , I am confidrnt that the number of cars in use increase inthe
