I do not agree on this statement .
I do not think it is best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are a lot of way to travel in our life .
For example , to travel alone , to do with your friends or family , and packed tours with strangers ( such a way in the statement ) .

In various ways , if I could travel anywhere , I would like to travel alone .
It is best for me not to mind others even if it is my family , friends or boy friend .
When you walk with someone , you should catch up with him or her .
And , fllowing , you can not the thing you want to look if you have something you want .
It is too unpleaseant for me .
So , when I want to buy something , I will go shopping alone .
This is same in case of travel .
I want to go places I want .
If someone and me want to go to same place , maybe I will concider well .

On oppsition , the demerit that I thought when you travel in a group led by a tour guide .
It is semilar to the case of my former reason that I do not go shopping with someone .
A tour guide always can provide with a satisfied content to each us .
A big tour can not response to each needs of each customer .
It is problem for me .
