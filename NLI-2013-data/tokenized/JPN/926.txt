I agree with the opinion that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better that just having studied one specialized subject .
I believe that knowing many academic subjects widely would help people understand more about what you really want to learn .
People can get many points of view from that .
For instence , when you are studying economics you cannot forget about international relationships which can change economy of the world .
Also you have to think about how thinking only about good economy system may causes bad effects on the natural environments .
People can learn more about what they are majoring by knowing other academic subjects .

There are also other reasons .
Not studying other subjects , which you thought not interesting may took your possibility .
I had a friend who thought she does not good at mathmatics , but she gave herself one last chance to study mathmatics in the last year of high school .
She ended up with finding that she actually like to study mathmatics .
She have found her new possibility .
To decide not to study a sbject with first impression of yours can be dangerous sometimes .
You may miss your favorite subject .

Futhermore , studying many subjects widens your future .
If a person only knew one specific subject , you may have a few choices of jobs .
If a person studied many different subject , then those subjects can give him a lot of opportunities to think what he really want to do in the future .
When I was younger I had a totally different job in my mind for the future , but studying many subjects in high school and university has changed my opinion many times .
It is because I have found other possibilities for the future by studying many different things .

To study many subjects will take time and a lot of effort .
However without studying them you will never know your possibilities in the future .
It is not too late to study specific subject after you have studied different things .
