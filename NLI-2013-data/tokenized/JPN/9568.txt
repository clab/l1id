I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
To discuss it , I need to difine the meaning of `` successful people '' for me .
Successful people are people who found out their meaning of life .
To discover it , the process of seeking is neccessary .
The process is the same as trying new things .
Trying new things takes risks .

I call people who are doing same things without taking risks as `` unsuccessful people '' .
It is because they do not live their life thoroughly .
They already stop seeking .
It means they are loosing their chance to find the meaning of life .

It is difficult to find out what is the best thing to do for them .
Therefore searching it is very important factor for thier success .
For example , Michael Jodan , one of the most famous basketball player in the world , was used to be a baseball player when he was a child .
When he entered high school , he started to play basketball .
Then he realized it was the best thing to do for him .
However , he was not sure about he could become a professional bascketball player .
But he tried it and made it .
He retired already , but everyone of basketball fun remenbers him vividly .

Another example is Roger Federer , No.1 tennis player in the world .
Like Michael Jordan , he also did not know he was good at tennis until he became a journior high school student .
He was not a strong player before then .

Finally , as I stated above , I believe trying new things with taking risks are important element for successful people .
Life is not an easy thing .
To succeed in the real meaning , I have to keep serching the meaning of it .
