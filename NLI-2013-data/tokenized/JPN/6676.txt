No I do n't think so .
Because , world population is growing up rapidly .
Therfore the car user increase in twenty yers .

The person who have a opposite view to me might think about increasing of population case something bad to nature .
For example , acid rain and greenhouse effection .
The gas from the car is one of the biggest reason of air polusion .
If these problems get worse in twenty years , it seem to have strict control by the goverment to solve these problem .
So it might be decresing the car users .

But I think we do n't have to worry about that .
Because today , there are car which are moved by solar system and natural oraganisum oil .
`` Purius `` invented by HONDA is a kind of car uses the solar system to work .
It is quite expensive but it must be less expensive in future .
And a lot of country try to make oils or gasolines which made from natural thing , So there are much more cars in use in twenty years .
I mean the car that is kind to nature and human beings .
