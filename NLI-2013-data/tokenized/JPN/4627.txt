I disagree with `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are . ''
It is just like advertisements tell a lie to consumers .
For example , when my father watched a CM of clearner product on TV , advertisements said that it could erase all of things such as , coffee or ink .
After he used it , it could not erase coffee one .
It was not ture that the cleaner could erase coffee .
He was really angry with it , and he said he would never buy priducts at the company .
As a consumer , you cannot know about products which you cannot use for a test before you buy it .
You just watch some CMs of a prodict or look a product in the store .
The other view is advertisements is to sell products a lot to consumers , so it might be natural thing for them to make products seem much better than they really are .
However , that is really big criminal at the point of telling a lie .
Becuse of that , consumers should need to compare with other products , and you should decide by yourself which one is good .
Also you have to use our mind and think about `` Is that CM really true ?
`` .
Finally , advertisements should make products seem they really are ; otherwise , consumers will nerver trast them .
Also it should be a big problem .
