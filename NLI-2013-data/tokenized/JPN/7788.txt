When people travel , peopple might have different preferences on the way to travel .
I disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I always like to travel with my plans .
I believe that the travel planed by myself always makes the travel enjoyable due to three reasones .
In the travel led by myself , it enables me to decide where I can visit , how long I can stay at the place , and managing those plans make me a great traveler .

As I travel to somewhere , I have to think where I better to go .
If I want to have a great trip , I have to know some information of the place .
It is not only about places , but also the weather , transportations and so forth .
Through those process , I can decide the place to travel and the place will be based on my interests .
That 's why it might be one of reasones .

During travel , there might happen something different things from my expectation .
For example , the place , introduced in a travel magazine , might not be really beautiful place than I expected .
If those accidents occured , I would arrange my plan for the trip .
I might leave the place and move to next plan .
In this sence , I can adjust my plan to the situations .
Therefore , I might like freedom in my travel .

With whole process to have a trip , I can learn a lot of things that I did not know .
If I participate a travel with a tour guide , the tour guide will schedule everything .
Although the travel with a tour guide might be easy and not necessary to plan a lot , I want to learn many information for the trip .

By those three main reasones , I disagree to the opinion .
In addition , I prefer a travel led by myself .
