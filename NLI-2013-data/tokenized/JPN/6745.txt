I do not agree that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' , because cars are most useful transportation today , and it is not easy to create brand new machine in twenty years , and nowadays there are more eco-cars on the roads , and car drivers care about the nature recently .

The useful points of cars are that there are many road to drive and they are more than rollways or subways , and you can go close places to far places individualy .
Because of the good points , when you go your family trip , the car makes you more confortable , and it is easy to make your own original plans .

I guess that it is easyier to make cars easy to drive and confortable spase than create new machine .
Some people might say that driving is too rough and make them tired .
However technical skills are growing up day by day , it mat be not far futhure that you do not have to drive a car .

Some peole are considering the effort of cars to enviroment .
They think it is good to use trains and busses rahter than your own car .
However , the eco-car can slove the problems .

Nowadays , the use og eco-cars are rising and considering about our natures .
Moreover , driving car will be easy and confortable because of recently the high technical skills .
From the past , the cars are the most useful machine for indivisuals and also pubric .
I do not think cars use will not down , people still depend on their cars .
Cars will be still the most used transportation in twenty years .
