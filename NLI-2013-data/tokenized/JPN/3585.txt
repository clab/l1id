I am agree with this statement .
Because nowadays peoples has so many convinient tools and living under the good enviroments .
Tipically in young peoples like school ages , they do n't have to work for to living .
So I think , young people nowadays and all age peoples can take enough time to helping their communities .

On the other hand , I think a small part of young people dose not have or can not make enough time to helping their communities .
My conclusion of above line come from the wonder of their life style .
A small number of nowadays young people living in so stressful world .
For example , pressure of there job norma , working skedules , etc .
Recentry people become phycometry disease so easily .
Something of our life style become strange from old time .
Now , I think we needs re-thing about our community and our relatively .
Most of us forgets our heartfull rerationships and our true meanings of life .
I think we can use community relationships for our rehabilitations of emotional problems .
So finally I agree again this statements with hopes for future .
