I like to see advertisements , especially on TV .
There is a variety of advertisements ( i.e. , TV commorcials ) .
Some advertisements look like a TV drama ; some advertisements look as if it thretes us to buy it .
It is the company selling podusts who produces the advertisments for the products .
There is almost no exception on the fact , I think .
Thus , I personally agree with this statements .

Need less to say , advertisments are made in order to encourage consumers to buy products .
There is no wonder that a company trys to show its product better as much as possible .
I believe that it introduce its produt better than real .
When I was a child , I watched advertisement for an air plane toy .
In the advertisement , I was the plane flying the air .
At that time , I was so impressed and asked my paretent to buy me .
My further bought me it one day .
However , I was so disapointed with the plaine , since it did not fly ! .
My further also was dissapointed at seeing me being sisapointed .
I have never trust advertisements since then .

Recently , I enjoy advertisements as a kind of fiction of products .
I believe that advertisement is a kind of presentation to express what product a compaly wish to make .
Thus , I agree with the statements .
