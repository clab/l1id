I agree with the statement .
Because many young people recently do not take part in their communities .
They are not interested in their communities and society .
I think they do not like boring task and anything that they can not get merit .
They feel troblesome and they want to enjoy doing more anyting else than helping their communities .
They may not like that they communicate with anybody .
Now we have all information around us .
