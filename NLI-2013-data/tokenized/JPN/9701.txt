I agree with the statement which is `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''
Why do I agree with that statement ?
First , because of population .
Many people try to success in one subject so the rate fo competition is very high .
If people who has knowledge as well as general people , they cannot be on top in the major .

Second , if people who wants to success is afraid of taking risks , they mentally or tequnically cannot move from the point where they are now .
They should take risks and get knowledge and experiences from risks .
They have to grow up with their knowledge and experiences .

That 's why I agree with the statement .
There are a lot of people who want to success with the same major .
Even in one school has a lot of raivals .
When they can success , they whould make efforts more than any other people .
And they should get knowledge and experiences while they make efforts .
The imformation and experiences would help them .
