I disagree with the idea .
I want to travel alone .
I have 2 reasons for this idea .
I do not have a lot of time to travel .
Also , I want to visit as much as the sight-seeing place I could go in limited time shedule .

The first of all , I work for a company as a full time worker .
I have the annual summer holiday .
However , it is difficult to spare time for a trip .
In this situation , I would prepare the travel before to go travel .
That 's why I do not need a tour guide in sight-seeing .
I woud read , ask and resurch about this place where I am going to visit .
I spend this tour guide fee for extra service at hotels or another service .
In addition , my time to stay there is really limited .
I do want to visit places which I really want to go .
I can not control my shedule when I travel in a group .
I will miss some of them if I go with the group tour .
Also I can focus on visiting when I am alone better than in a group .

Second , It is not free to move personaly .
The tour guide is the controller in the grouop .
Also I can not change my sheule when we go in the group .
I want to go where I want to go .
That 's why I would like to go travel alone .

Therefore , I prefer to travel alone better than a group with a proffesional guide .
My time is limited so it is important .
