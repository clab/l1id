I completely agree the statement .
Everytime I see advertisements and look at what I want to buy , I think they are nice or cool .
But after that , I go to the shop the stuffs are sold , and I reakise that they are no so nice .

First , the most typical example that I come up immediately is fast food advertisement .
When I am watching TV in the dorm , I see a lot of advertisements of fast food companies .
Big hamburgers , fries , and fried chichens show up on the screen .
And I always am atracted by them .
But actually , the hamburgers and fries and chichens that I get in fast food restaurants are no as big as the one I see on TV .
It is so disgusting thing .

Second example is clothes .
Clothes that I can see on advertisements are so different from one that I can actually see in stores .
They have different colors , botuns , and the materials are look worse .
It seems like they change the image of the product to be looked better to custmers .

Third , sometimes , used cars on advertisements are really different from that you can see at shops .
They look clearner and newer .
And the most important thing is that they write only good things about the cars on the advertisement .
Most of the time they write truth , but they do n't write all the information about the cars .
When they compose the add , they cut the bad information about their products and write only the informations that seem to atract the custmers .

In conclusion , it is necessary to atract customers , because it is conected directly to company 's profit .
From this view , addvertisements are playing an important role in developing the company 's business .
But I do
