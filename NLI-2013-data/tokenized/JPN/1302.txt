It has been argued that it is better to gain wider knowledge of numerous academic subjects rather than to deeply research one specific subject .
I disagree with this idea because specializing one particular subject brings several advantages for the following reasons .

First , since technology is really advanced nowadays , professinals , who have deep knowledge of one subject , are more required than generalists who have broader knowledge .
For instance , my uncle works in Micro Soft .
He told me that when he started working in the company , there were many employees who had vast general knowledges .
However , since computer technology has been developed dramatically , the company only hires specialists these days because more sophisticated programmers are essential in order to advance its technology .
This tendency explains that it is better to focus on a specific subject than to have broad knowledge of wider subjects .

Second , as technology is sophisticated , specialized knowledge is mandatory to protect it as well .
For example , PC security and computer hackers are one of good example .
My uncle has been assigned in a computer security division in Micro Soft .
There are 20 core members in his division , who all have PhD , including my uncle .
Hackers do like computers and they study computer programs very deeply .
Thus , the security division must hire people who are very specialized to fight the hackers .
This example also represents that it is better to gain a specialized knowledge than broader knowledge of many academic topics .

Lastly , specialized knowledge brings higher income .
For instance , my uncle receives much higher salary than his long time friend who are a sales representative in Micro Soft .
His friend studied various subjects in his school age and actually regrets that he should have focused on a particular subject .

In summary , although some people insist that it is better to develop broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to focus on a particular subject , I disagree with this idea .
This is because the latest sophisticated technology requires specialists in a particular subject to develop and protect it .
Specialized knowledge also brings higher incomes .
