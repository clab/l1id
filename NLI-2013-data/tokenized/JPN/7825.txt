I would have to say that the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide but with more immediate friends and contacts .
Although , if one was planning a trip to go to a foreign country that is famous for it 's sites , it would n't be a bad idea .
Traveling with people most likely from the same country with a guide that speaks your native language would perhaps provide a comfort and ease away the shyness some tend to have when leaving their comfort zone .
But I do n't think that would be enough .

My purpose to travel would be able to experience and understand the different and not just to be able to say `` I 've been there . ''
If you only wanted to learn about a certain place , you could just buy a book or even go online and use the internet as a source to see pictures and obtain information .
You 'll be able to know how big it is , why it 's called that and everything a tour guide could tell you just by reading .
And I 'd have to say blatantly that that would seem a little boring , listening to a lecture on vacation .

Another , culture is a very important element .
With a tour guide , they 'd be able to introduce you to important restaurants and stores marketed for tourists that sell souvenirs .
With a little bit of research you could enjoy and plan all this yourself .

So , I would prefer traveling with friends and/or family .
If not , then alone .
Hopefully then , I will be able to make new friends there and also have the opportunity to hear the story from them , which is an experience that would be difficult to achieve in a pre-designed course .
