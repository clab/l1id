I think that it is good idea to go trip as a group with a guide .
This is because tourists are able to know and get knowledge from the guide who knows a lot of thing about the place .
If it is possible , people should have a guide and get knowledge from them because it can be nice oppotunity .
The point is that people are travel to see other places where they are not live in their usual daily life .
Therefore , it is more reasonable to study other cultures and thinking .
Those ideas will probably help to make their thinking wider .
In other words people who have seen many different countries or place are able to think everything more critically and logically , because they know why the cultures are differnt by taking a lecture of guides .
Also , it is important to make the group .
The first reason is that people can learn from others , not only from the guide .
If somebody in your grop can share the knowlege with you , it is great oppotunity to know other cultural thinking .
If I compare group tour to private tour , it is clear that a person who is in a grop tour can think more different way beaacsue ther are others who has another idea which he has .
In other hand , a person who takes tour by himself is going to keep his own idea , beacasue there are no others who provide othe point of view to him .

The guide is the person who is specializing to teach history or local knowledge about him or her palace .
As I mentioned in above , it is neccessary to know other cultures because you may think everything from many points of view .
Also , making group is easier way to understand how other people feel and think .
Therefore I think that the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guide .
