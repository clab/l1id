Taking risk and trying new things out rather than doing thing that have already proven to work has been the source of major inventions and accomplishments .
I conlude that trying and taking risks are the most important factors for people to be successful .

In most areas there is a need to have a good education and knowledge base to get a job done and to be succesful in a certain filed .
To run a business , for example , it is necessary to know everything aboout your product , the market and the customers and once you have gained the knowledge and experience and the products or services are streamlined and are successful in the market the business owner could try to just keep everything `` as is '' to run the business from that point on .

The problem is that if the outside factors change the demand for the product might decline , competitors might have similar products , but lower production costs which all cause the business to decline .

Thus , the business owner needs to constantly try out new things , do new investments , issue new products - take risks to ensure that his products are successful in the market .

Trying out new things gives the one who does it the best experience and the best knowledgebase he could have ; inside knowledge of what works and what does n't work .
Someone who only sticks with what he has learned already and wht he has been doing for years will never get the insights and cannto be successful in that specific area .

The same is true for taking risks : chances are always associated with risks which means , in conclusion , that only those who take risks are also able take chances .
To start a new business , to travel to an unkonwn territory , to do scientific experiments always contain risks ; but most of men 's major accomplishments have been made by those people who started the new businesses and travelled to unkonwn territories .

My conclusion is that people even need to take risks and try new things
