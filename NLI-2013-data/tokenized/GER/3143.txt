A lot of young people I know want to live their life in a very intense way while they are still young .
They think that when they get old they will not be able to enjoy life as much as they do now .
But is this really true ?

Well , first of all young people normally are healthier than older people .
So they are able to be active every day and do all kinds of sports or to travel a lot .
They can also go out at night till very late , have fun in bars and clubs .
By doing so they get to know a lot of people and make a lot of friends .
While still at school young people are most likely to have more free time than adults in which they can do whatever they want .
They are less responsible for others than older people are and can therefore try out more things .

On the other hand older people do n't have to find out what they like , they already know it .
Maybe they have less time because they have to go to work , but they have enough money to afford their hobbies .
Also other things in life get more and more important .
Like family or the job .
Most people who enjoy their job also enjoy their life .

All in all I do n't think that young people enjoy their life more than older people .
I think that they have just different ways to enjoy their time .
And none is better than the other .
It s just a process that we all go through .
What we mean by `` enjoying life '' changes as we get older .
And older people already had their `` wild times '' - when they were young .
