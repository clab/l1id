I think it is necessary to define the term car concerning this question , it can either be the car as we know it today , a vehicle using a large amount of a non renewable ressource , or it can be the same thing , just different , different in shape and size , but mostly in the type of energy it will use .
I disagree with the statement because i am of the opinion , that as soon as petrol gets too expensive for the average driver of a conventional car , the possibilities of alternative car desings and engines , will soon be much more attractive and new customers for new ideas will be found by then .
I think people will call those vehicles cars as well and there will be a large amount of those new vehicles .
Probably we will have more cars than ever before , because once the big car companies think they can make money with cars running on alternative fuels or engines , they will try as hard as they can to be as competetive and influencial as they are now .
This influnce can lead to large substities and tax advantages in the beginning of the rise of those new cars , that will make the process very fast if it has startet .
Some might say that there will be an increase in the use of public transport systems , that is true , but only in big cities where cars are not as important as they are outside urban areas .
Human beings are creatures with habits , one habit is driving cars , having the convenience of independence .
I do n't think that it is possible to take cars away totaly , not even partly , there can only be more , because that is the way almost all our societies work , based on growth and developement , there wo n't be any steps backward , there will be changes in the way we drive , but humans will drive because we are used to it .
