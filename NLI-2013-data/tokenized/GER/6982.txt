In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
What will happen with the development of cars ?
Will the amount of driving cars in 2030 increase or decrease ?

Let 's take a short look on the fast development of cars .
They were invented in about the 1920s and became more and more popular for all people all over the world within the last century .

Nowadays , it is unbelieveable not to have car or a possibility to lend one , if you need one .
People got used to their drivable possibility to get from point A to point B whenever they want to and how often they want to .
They do n't depend on any busses , trains or even flights .
Even think of the high taxes and fees one has to pay if he uses any public traffics .

Beside the fact , a car is one 's chance to get form A to B , a car enables you to feel free and independent .
If you want to go on vacation , get your car ready and leave your homecountry .
But this , unfortunately , is luxuary , especially in times like this when oil-price is as high as it has never been before .
One has to effort his or her car .
Having a car , turns out to be a question of money and the possibility to effort it .
It 'll be senseless , to spend all your loan on gas , would n't it ? !

Furthermore , the amount of gas that pollutions the air everyday , every minute , exactly every second , is still rising and does n't seem to get less in future .
Although there are several techniqual developments and inventions , it 'll be a problem and influences the environment a lot .

What will be in about 20 years ?
Will people think about this facts and problems and turn into another development of enviromental and social thinking ?
Will there be a chance to be fewer cars used than they are today ?
In my opinion , I do n't believe in this solution , being fewer cars in 2030 than they are now .
People more and more get selfish , always want the best and newest version of an invention ( car ) and they probably will change a certain way of group , social and enviromental thinking but they wo n't change their behavior towards car-using .

In my opinion , there are only two things that will lead a change in the amount of cars used .
First the changing of laws by the government enforcing people to fullfill certain policies in car using ( such as car sharing , car-free days , etc . )
and second if the oil price is still increasing !
