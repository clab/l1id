Since I am a business student with focus on marketing , the topic is very relevant for me in my everyday life .
First of all , I have to say that there is no doubt about the effects advertisement has .
Using several tecniques to present a product in the best possible light , some of the consumers may get the impression that they do not receive the complete pieces of information about it and a realistic picture .
However , although there may be some tricks to sell products more effectively , no single marketing man in the world has magic abilities .

To start out with some arguments that support the above statement it should be mentioned that print media especially offer opportunities to give the product a better image .
Most important are possibly pictures that can be turned into perfection easily with computer programms .
Additionally , the information given in newspapers or magazines are in fact putting special emphasize on the product 's qualities instead of its eventual disadvantages .
To give an example , a special feature of a mobilephone such as the great design or the modern functions would be probably printed in big , coloured letters while the expensive conditions of the speaking tarif would be printed in small letters in a corner of the page so that most readers would pay no attentin to it .

Another trick of advertising professionals is to work with people 's emotions .
Awakening positive feelings by showing impressive and colourful spots with a certain connection to special situations in life , the associations with the product the watchers have and therfore his opinion about it would be more positive than without having seen the commercial .

As one can see , there is a diversity of ways for selling a product in a maximum of positive light and although there are a lot of norms that refer to ethical and moral doubts in the society about modern advertising methods and that have to be obeid , companies know how to make use of little tricks .

I do not completely agree with the statement because , as I mentioned at the beginning of my essay , the product is only a product that can be `` tuned '' in some way but not really improved in the impression it makes .
Additonally some ethical and social norms prevent people from being tricked seriously by ad
