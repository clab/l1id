According to the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today I think these statement is wrong .
In my opinion cars are the most important transportation vehicles in our society .
In modern buisness flexibility is one of the most important things .
Only the car allows everybody to carry distances at every time he wants to every place he needs .
Public transportation systems have a lot of advantages especially in big cities whith only little space .
In these cities most of the people are travelling everyday on the same route .
But for longer distances public transportation systems are not flexibil enough .

Another argument for my opinion is that having a car makes life more easy .
For example a car is very usefull if you go to the supermarket buying a lot of boxes of water or beer .
It is impossible to carry these things by bike or by bus .

But one of the most important reasons is that people feel more independent when they have car .
They are not dependent on other people ore public transportation systems .
In my opinion people wo n't never give up these advantage unless they can not affort a car anymore .

For example I need my car nearly every day because my parents live in a small city which has hardly any public transportation system .
There ar only few busses and they do not reach most of the places .
I think public transportation systems are to exspensive for small areas or cities .
But most of the people in my country live in small towns or villages .
That 's why a car is so necessary for a lot of people .

Of course cars cause a lot of problems , especially the enviromental polution .
But these problem can be solved by inventing new alternative technics .
For example it is a good idea to resarch in hydrogen fuel or develop a fuel made of plants .

Because of all these reasons I do not aggree with the statement I 'm asked about .
