With the above made statement , i fully agree for the following reasons : The best example would probably be the tobaco advertisements shown on TV , the cinema or as large posters at bus stations .
Nobody could say that smoking is healthy or makes you feel free , but a certain brand tryes to provoke this picture by showing landscapes , cowboys and horses .
Another example is the food industry - what they say to be healthy often turnes out to be tho opposite , if you only have a close look at the ingredient list printed on the back .
But often people do n't even realize what they are consuming after having taken a close look at it because they do n't have the knowledge interpretate the meaning of what they read .
Of course - not everybody is a doctor or pharmacist and is aware of the danger that certain things might become to our health .
And that is one of the points I really think to be unfair from the froducting firms .
To sell bigger quantities of their product , they willingly make believe people wrong things .
Especially for children those advertisements might be dangerous as they even know less about what healthy and unhealthy substances can do to your body .
They just want to do , have , eat or drink everything they are told is good , brandnew , cool .
And so do their friends .
Concluding my essay I would like to outline that of course this is not the case for every product or even ` most ' as is written in the statement .
It would be unfair to declare advertisements to be generally false , dishonest or dangerous .
There definetly are advertisements which state the truth about their product !
Many adversitements even show a houmorous content and can be really amusing .
- for these reasons we can see shows at TV containing the ` funniest TV spots of the world ' - what an enrichement to our TV programs !
