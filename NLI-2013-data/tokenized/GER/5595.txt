The most common idea of marketing is `` to sell the product at any cost '' .
And as advertisement , as well as in TV as in newspapers , is a way of marketing , the goal is also pretty clear .
They want to show their product from its best side .
Who would buy a burger if it looks like crap .

For example an advertisement from Burger King , to continue with the `` burger business '' .
The company is now marketing its newest burger , the Cheesy Bacon XXL .
You see their advertisement and absolutely want to eat that burger immediately .
But why is that so ?
Because they will show you a situation of complete satisfaction .
Everybody is happy and everybody eats that burger that looks so good .
Maybe they are also singing a song which is easy to remember and hard to forget , so that you will keep that advertisement in mind , for a very long time .

But after a while , you are thinking about that Burger again , but the only things you remember , are the happy people , who are singing this song , and that makes you feel good .
You probably think you will be as happy as the people in the commercial if you eat that burger .

Another example is definitely the car companies .
There is probably no other branch , which is paying so much money for their marketing .
But the principles are the same as it is with Burger King .
You have to attract people and show your product from it 's best side , thats all what matters primarily .
Lets just have a look at the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class .
Somehow they say its the now model but there are only some small differences between the new and the old one .
But even though , the commercial is so good , that I love that car .
Because they had maybe some special effects or a cool music in the background .

These are the things that matter .
If the product is really awsome does n't really matter in an good advertisement .
So the quote is true , that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .
But there are so many indepedent sources which will give you clear information about a product , that it does n't really matter .
