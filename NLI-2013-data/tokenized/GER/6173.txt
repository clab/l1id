In the following text I discuss the question if in twenty years are fewer cars in use than today .
First of all you have to take into consideration the country you are talking about , because I am sure it is too difficult to discuss the development of car sales for all over the world .

In my case , I am going to talk about the amount of cars in Germany .
As far as I know , Germany is already one of the countries that has a very high rate of car users .
That is why it becomes harder to sell more and more cars .
Moreover it is important to know that cars are not cheap at all .
Thus , the wealth of a country influences the car sales as well .

In Germany there is one more factor .
The greens are an important power in the german government .
That can be explained by the wish of minimizing the pollution .
People do not want to see their children growing up in a world full of cars which pollute the air .

On the other hand scientists always try to improve the quality of cars and it is possible , that they will invent a car which will not pollute our environment anymore .
So I am sure , such a car would lead to more cars in twenty years .

One huge disadvantage of cars is the trouble on the streets .
In my opinion it is horrible to cross a bigger city like Berlin or London by car .
It usuallz takes several hours and even if you have been in a good mood , you will be in a very bad mood after the third traffic jam .
Compared to cars it is so much more comfortable to take the underground in a big city .
More and more young people want to live in the city and they grew up with ideas of how to avoid pollution and that is why I think in twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
