I think its true that most of the young people in an age of 20 bi 21 enjoy there live more than wsome old people in an age of 70 bi 75 .
young poeple have all there power and do n't have to thin about there health an death .
old poeple have not so much pwer and some are rearly frightend about theire death , so they life with thoughts all around there death and so they are not so happy like young people .
But if somone is old but still hase enough power to do sports and if he will be happy too .
When the person hase an religion and believes in an life after death , it would help him or her much not to think always about there death .
So I think that young and old poeple could both be unhappy or happy in there lifes .
when I think about it I 'm comming to the result that yuo ca n't say that old people do n't enjoy theire lif as much as young people do , its different from person to person .
young people have more power than old poeple have but old people have seen more in theire lif than young people , learned more and know more .
young poeple have more problems with love , school and selfconvedence and old people have more problems with death and staieng alone .
Young people and old people enjoy there lifes otherwies .
young people make more sport or go to the disco and dance , but old people can read and learn and have no work to do who says that they ca n't enjoy that .
i think you ca n't say that young people enjoying ther lif more than old people do it i think if you enjoy your lif or not is only on evryone himself .
So if I want to enjoy my lif i 'll do it and when I 'm old I 'm the same person like now
