Looking at the values of modern western societies community service does not really seem to range in the top ten of aims a succssful human being has to reach .
To be regarded as a proper member with a respectable social status for example one needs to have a career , regular income and all the incentieves that come with it , like houses , cars and journeys .
Helping in your community just seems to be not an the agenda .
Therefore I think that it is quite true that young people do not spend as much time for organizing events for the town 's elderly people or getting involved into cummunity meetings as 50 years ago but at the same I time I believe that it is not entirely their fault .
Of course it is a personal decision to get involved into social activities or not , but on the other hand human beings are not as altruistic as they like to be .
So if society wants young people to spend more time helping in their communities than I think society should start to appriciate and reward the work people are doing there .
Nowadays social committment in general is regared as burden more than a duty .
But without it communities simply are not able to work .
I guess , modern men first have to realise this important fact in order to get community services back into `` top ten '' again .
If this kind of commitment is rewarded again - not financially but socially , which means with a higher reputation - , I am pretty sure that young people will start to get involved again .
