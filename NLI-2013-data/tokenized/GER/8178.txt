In general I would not agree on the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Obviously , it is necessary to learn some fact at the beginning of your carreer .
You cannot understand ideas concerning maths when you do not know that 1 plus 1 results in 2 .
But I think it should not be the primary aim of our education to learn facts because the world has to be developped by us in the future , too .
This is not possible when someone for example just learns the theory of Albert Einstein by heart , shuts down his book and begins with something new .
He has to learn it and then he can start to think about it .
Posing some questions concerning the theory - talking to other students to get to know their opinion about it and afterwards creating his or her own ideas which are based on his knowledge .

Perhaps this process could end up in a new product combining the learned facts and the own new ideas .
As a conclusion it is in my point of view as important for students to understand ideas and concepts as to learn the basic facts .

This statement can also be connected to other topics of our society than maths of physiks .
We all know , that the most important fact is to realize an idea if it is done .
This is definitely impossible when you are not able to speak the others language .
You need to learn facts ( the foreign language ) and afterwards you can share your own ideas with everyone .
By this way it can surely be realised .
So you can say , that there are two basics existing - the learning process and the creating process and for the biggest success both have to be combined in the most efficient way .

Every student should have basic knowledge in several topics and the more knowledge you have , the better you can understand existing ideas and create your own ones .
