For me success means profiting from my doing .
For example when I take a final exam in a University class I want to succeed .
I normally choose courses refering to my interests and also to my abilities .
Of course I want to be challenged by the topics , I want to learn new things in class but I also do n't want to be overchallenged .
Finally I choose a `` medium path '' .
Some risk in combination with some facts that make me feel safe .

I can choose the medium path with taking in account two factors : The special situation and my well-being .
To the first facor I think that the situation should decide whether I go for a risk or not because it tells me how much I can profit from a doing and how much the doing will be challenging .
For example when I get the chance to talk in front of an audiance about a for me very unknown topic and I could win a sholarship with the talk , I would rather take the risk then stay at home .
The talk then does not only mean a risk for me - it also means a challenge in that situation .

The second and very important factor is my personal Character and my trait profile .
Am I an axious person ?
How do i feel in unknown situation ?
Do I like risky and dangerous situations ?
And how are my exoeriences with risk ?
If I only have had good experiences with risk I will be more self confident and will succeed with a higher probability .
But if I am forced to take a risk I won ' t feel good and the success wo n't be reachable that easily .

In summarize I think success and risk depends on an interaction of situation , personality and experiences .
Some successful people may have often tried out risky things .
Others probably took a less risky way and succeeded .
