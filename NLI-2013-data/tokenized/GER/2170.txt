I am 24 years old and a student , so I have not so much money and I am unsure about what the future will bring .
Therefore I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

One reason for my disagreement is the perspective for the future , which differs between younger and older people .
Younger people usually do not have concrete plans for their future .
Therefore it is difficult to really enjoy life , because one always thinks about what the future will bring .
I know these problem when I have to decide wether to spend a lot of money for a new computer , an enjoyment for me , or better save the money .
Due to the reason that I do not know wether I will get a job , it may be better not spending so much money .
Older people mostly have a job and spending the money will not have such a big importance .

Another reason why older people enjoy life more than younger people do , is their opportunity to spend more money for certain activities they enjoy .
For example I would enjoy learning how to fly a plane , but I do not have enough money to take courses .
Older people may have enough money to learn how to fly a plane and therefore can enjoy in doing so .

Beside these examples , enjoyment may also mean to have a wife and children .
This is something generally older people have .
So from my situation today , I look forward to have my own family and I think I will enjoy it .

The reasons and examples above show , that older people may have less problems concerning money .
They also may have a familiy and may be able to perform cost intensive activities they like .
In contrast to that , younger people do not have these possibilities and often have to think about their future .
Therefore I think that older people can enjoy and do enjoy their life more than younger people do .
So I am looking to the future and think that I will enjoy my life when I am older .
