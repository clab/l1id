Many people believe that young people enjoy life to a higher degree than older people do .
In my opinion , this is a statement that is not correct since it fundamentally denies the complexity of the issues of joy , life and age and tries to deliver a general and simplified statement .
In those crucial matters , however , I believe that trying to make a general point is not helpful in any way .
Therefore , I disagree with that statement , both because of its content and because of the way the content is delivered , namely through generality .

First of all , it is certainly a question of the perspective from which one looks at to what degree people enjoy life .
Young people might believe that older people enjoy life less because of their decreasing health conditions or because of the decay of their outward appearence whereas older people might be of the opinion that it is the youth that enjoys life less since , being at an early stage of life , they still have all the hardships of life in front of them .

In this connection , it is certainly a question of definition what it means to `` enjoy life '' .
There is no such thing as a scale measuring the joy in life that valid for every person , and there is no need to create such scale .
Everyone has a different view on life and different expectations that contributed to joyful life .
Some people enjoy life doing sports , others enjoy life by achieving financial success .
That feeling is not objective but rather subjective and it is not possible to really compare those individual feelings .
Different people have different priorities in life .
Thus , trying to decide whether younger people enjoy life more than older people do or vice versa seems impossible since it denies the very individual character traits , opinions and views that one holds .

In my opinion , it is a question of how old one really feels .
As for myself , I know a 73-year-old man who is as active as he could ever be , perfectly indulging in sports everyday by running cross country before breakfast .
This exemplifies that every individual is as distinctly different from others .
Therefore , categories of people enjoying life more or less than others do not make any sense .

In conclusion , I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because of the fact that on the one hand , everyone has to define solely for himself or herself what it means to enjoy life .
