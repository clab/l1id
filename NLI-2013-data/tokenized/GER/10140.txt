I do not agree with the statement that succesful people are taking risks and try new things rather than doing what they know how to do well .
I admit that a lot of inventions and business concepts have succeeded , because they were highly innovative .
Probably most people would have doubted that they would be profitable .
On the other hand so many people try to develop new ideas about being different and fail .
Most of today 's ideas , that actually are pretty good , do not turn out making its inventor rich .
So generally speaking taking risks more often leads into frustration and poverty whereas concentrating on your strengths is more likely to lead you to succes .

As an example I would like to tell you about a freiend of mine who had a great idea about a new sportsbrand .
Being an expert in marketing with years of experience and a wife who was working in the clothing industry he was very confident that his idea of a local brand would succed .
He took the risk of getting into the new business of producing stuff he never had done before .
Dealing with all the new fields that his business involves he was not able to fulfill everything needed to develop a succesful brand .
If he would have stuck to his roots and would have stayed in marketing only , he would have been better off for sure .

In conclusion I would say that sticking to what you know best is better for most people than being too risk taking .
In my opinion learning from people who already are succesful is the best thing one can do .
By that you can follow in someones footsteps and , if done right , succed in a much easier and less risky way than someone who wants to try out new things .
