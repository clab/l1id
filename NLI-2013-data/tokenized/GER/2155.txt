Some people think that enjoying life is connected to the age of the people .
They think , that young people would enjoy their life more than older people do .
But do n't you need the experience of having been both , young and old , to make any statement about this view in an appropiate way ?
I do n't believe that this statement is true , I think how enjoyable your life is , depends on other factors .

I'am 26 years old and from my point of view , since I was a child , or the time since I 'm conscience of myself , I never enjoyed my life so much , like I do now .
When I was a child , the only interesting things in my life , where toys and sweets and going to the holidays maybe .
Maybe my life was easier , whithout the stress and depressing things of today , But their was nothing meaningful , special .
I was not able to think in complex ways , did n't have any goals for my future , things that are of importance to me , like my university education , going abroad to study and so on .
Maybe my life is more complex and difficult today , but I 'm conscies about things , that means I enjoy important events more conscies , I make decisions more conscies and that makes my life more valueable .
That makes me independent and free .
And this increased more and more during my life , my life is getting more and more serious , which also means better .

Furthermore with getting older and `` wiser '' I also know better , which things in life are more or less important .
In the last years I learned to appreciate the importance of my family .
I did n't know that I really do need them to support me not only in a financial way , but also with their love , since a few years ago .
In a special age like in the twenties you see your parents as your enemies , you have to get older , to be aware of their value and importance for your life , to let them love you and give your love .
I could see during my life , that things for me are getting more enjoyable , with increasing experiences .
I believe that this will continue in this way and my life never will be not worth for living , or less enjoyable only because I 'm `` old '' .
