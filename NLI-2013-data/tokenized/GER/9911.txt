In general I agree with the statement , that successful people try new things and take more risks instead of only do what they are used to do .
There are several reasons why I do agree .
In the first place , if you always do the same there is no development at all and your environment remains stable .
It becomes boring and you do not differ from all the other people worldwide .
Success occurs when you do something surprising and new .
One good example is Columbus , who found America by doing something all the other men in his time hesitated .
Another example is the discovery of antibiotica , which was made by accident and trying something new .
Success means to differ from what is normal and familiar to the people .
They want to be impressed and buy things that are new and in facion , so as a designer you also have to be creative and try new things .
On the stock market you even have to take enormous risks if you want to make the highest income .
Here taking risk is fundamental .
Second , this is also true in the human partnerships .
Here you have to take high risk to talk to the person you like and say this to him or her , but only then you can be successful by coming together and get friens or even partners .
You have to take the risk and see if you fail or succeed .
Without revealing your feelings to the other person you never know , if you would have been successful if you did .
Success also means improvement and this needs changes and developments .
But these can only take place if you take risks and try new things .
Finally this statement is also true for me myself .
I have chosen to take the risk and go in a foreign country to study and do my LLM instead of staying at home and complete the normal education way that lawyers have in my home country .
This includes being in a new surrounding and far away from home , but it is a challenge and it perhaps leads me to a more successful career than without taking this risk to study in a foreign country .
In conclusion , all these points support the idea of the statement and therefore I agree with it .
