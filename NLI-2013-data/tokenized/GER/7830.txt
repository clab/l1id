When people travel , they usually go places where they have not been before .
Depending on the characteristics of this place , a tour guide can be more or less helpful .
Discovering a new city by travel , means that there will be a lot to learn about the history , architecture , culture , etc. of the city and the region .
In this case , having a tour guide , who knows the city well enough , will help you get to know the city and see places you would not have found on your own .
It can be very frustrating , to be somewhere and not know what the place is really about .
On the other hand , this problem can be overcome by doing research beforehand .
With the advent of the internet , a large number of sources are available for literally every place in the world , and people can find everything they want to know .
I personally , like to read about the places I travel and learn about them before I go there .
However , you will never get to see a city form the point of view of somebody actually living there .
Therefore , having a tour guide for at least part of the travel is my favorite choice .

If you travel in order to mainly go hiking in the mountains , to go skiing or snowboarding , or to just enjoy relaxing on a beach , there is definitely no need for a tour guide .
Such travel is To address the question whether or not to travel in a group , I would prefer going on holidays with as many people as possible .
Experiencing new things , or having fun in a relaxing holiday , is always more fullfilling and pleasurable in a group .
I always need somebody to share my thoughts with .
Also , going to bars adn clubs , or just having a nice dinner , is part of a good travel .
For those reasons , having people around to chat and have fun with is a must when I travel .

Surely , the issues of travelling with or without a tour guide and in a group or alone , is a matter of personality .
Since I am a very social person , I like to have people around me .
Also , I am always curious about other countries and their cultures , so I want to learn as much as possible form a travel and like to have somebody from the region to tell me , from personal experience , what the place is about .
