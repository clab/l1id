There have always been varying opinons on the importance of learning facts or in contrast the understanding of ideas while studying .
In my opinion the way a student should handle his stdudying depends first very much on the relevant field of study .
For example studying history requires the knowledge of certain historical data .
These are facts tha have to be learned , they can not be derived frim the understanding of a concept .
So there is an importance for the students to learn them .

On the other hand studying economics , the are a lot of models and ideas the students have to understand in order to be sucessful .
Those can no be learned ..
But can the student of history gain success in his studying only by learning facts ?
No he can not .
He also has to understand for example the strutures of ancient societies .

And can the student of economies be a good econimist just by understanding many of the econimic models and ideas ?
Again no .
There is also the need to combine this understanding with certain facts or formulars that simply have yo be learned .

Another important fact is also the type of person one student is .
Some people can keep fact they have read in their minds easily , but its hard for them to understand concepts behind .
Others have diffculties in remembering facts , but are likely to draw right conclusions from concepts they have understood once .

So it can not be said that simply learning facts , or understanding ideas is the key to sucessful studying .
The solution should be a sensible mixture of the two extremes .
Depending on what the aim of studying is and also depending on what one 's preferences and talent are .
