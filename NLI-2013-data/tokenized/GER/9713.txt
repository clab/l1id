There are different types of people in the world which show diverse actions on risking and not risking things .
Successful poeple seem to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

I actually agree with both statements because you cannot really put people into categories .
Sometimes it works but in this case it does not .
In real life you can notice a lot of successful people .
But how have they become successful ?
Indeed most of these people have risked a lot to become what they are now .
Most of these successful individuals have acted risky once in their lifetime but after that point they most likely become reasonable .
If you have been successful and started a life which really counts to you e.g. you have a good job , a settled life with a famliy and kids and a house ( in my opinion exactly that is what winning describes and what lifes is about ) , you must be a fool to risk that .

There are some typical workfields which fit in this cases , e.g. brokers .
If I assume being a broker and have exactly the kind of life I have just mentioned it would be probably very hard to not risk anything because in this workfield you have to risk to earn money .
But people have to be reasonable , risking at highest what they can afford and do what they can do best , being there for the family .

To conclude thats exactly where i want to come back why I agree to both statements .
Some of these people who have jobs which let them having risky decission to make can either go on with being what they used to be or they can concentrate on what is going to happen in the future .
If you have decided to act reasonable and not risk anything anymore combine with doing the stuff that you are good at then you will be successful but just in another stage in your life .
