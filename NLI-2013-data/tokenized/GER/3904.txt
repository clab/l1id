The problem we are dealing with is the lake of interest of young people to spend time to helping their communities .

It is a big problem that needs to be solved .
On the one hand , there is a rising number of requirements young people have to deal with .
There are a lot of things to manage .
Nowadays , young people have to do good results at school or at the university to get a well-paid job later .
Most of them are expected to make a good career .
They often have a lot of hobbies or activities and , last but not least , they also have to manage their social life .
All these activities take a lot of time , sure .
On the other hand , there must be a solution of the problem , we have to look into its matter .

First , there has to be a good time management .
Young people should learn to spend their time useful .
Adult people should support the young people with good advices or with more .
Parents can suggest a usefull activity to their child .
They could drive their child to a soccer game and pick him or her up after the game to do some work in the helping center for homeless people , for example .
Parents also could suggest to work in a local helping-station for animals .
It could be interesting work for a child , where it can learn to be responsible and to take care of others .

Moreover , social work would increase and improve the social skills of a child or a young man or women .
That does mean , that this young person may become more able to deal with problems or to solve conflicts in his life .
It also could mean that the young person will simply be able to communicate better with others .

Whereas the young people have already enough to do is actually being debated .
Despite all sorrows there are a lot of advantages of social work and work for communities .
This work does help both sides .
