In my opinion both types , the understanding of ideas and concepts and the learning of facts , are important .
One reason is , that students who just learn the facts of course have a great data bank but it 's just learned by heart , they do n't see any connections .
To see those connections the students have to take a look at the ideas and concepts of what they learn .
Another reason is that students , which just learn by heart everything , are not as able to make a decision as students who see more than just the facts .
For example , a history class talks about an important happening in their country 's history .
On the one hand they have to know the dates and why something has happened , without this it is impossible to talk about the reason and the consequences , but on the other hand it is needed that the students understand the idea which leaded to this happening .

Only with this both kinds of study combined it is possible to have a productive discussion and a succesful education .
Finally I disagree with the statement , because I think that it 's not possible to choose between one of the kinds of studying .
The students need both to get the best out of their education and so it 's important to use both types for studying .
