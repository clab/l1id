Based on my own experience and on other peoples comments about this theme I agree with the statement .

Especially today new inventions are made so quickly and life is often changing so fast .
These facts bring new questions and problems to be solved and although a certain knowledge is of course necessary in every field , it is most important to be able to adapt to new situations und to be flexible in most jobs .
Everyone can look up information , especially since the internet is available almost everywhere .
But knowledge and skills like `` soft skills '' are kind of individual and important in every part .

I myself experienced this throughout my internship at a tourist-company last summer .
Nobody asked me about numbers or specific knowledge about hotels or sights , the questions were if I could outwork an interview or if I have experience in moderating and working with groups .

In addition , I read about this topic a few times know .
There was for example an interview with a popular german journalist .
She explained that she studied history and politics but what she really learned at the time of her studies is how to search for information and present them to the readers or viewers .
To write a paper you have to find reliable literature-sources , which is n't always easy , but a skill you may need later as a journalist or if you want to manage a project of something specific .

All in all , I think it is better to teach ideas and concepts to todays students than make them learn facts because that way they get the `` tools '' to succeed in managing new situations and challenges .
