I do totally agree with the statement .
For me , there is nothing more important than understanding ideas and concepts .
It 's a shame that most school-systems concentrate more on learning by hard then understanding ideas .
The schools missed all important achievements of the last 50 years .
They focus on learning facts , not on understanding facts .
In my eyes , it 's possible to pass school only by learning facts without understanding them .
Even in universtity , in several subjects , for example in some economic-subjects , it 's possible to get along with learning facts .
But for university you shoud fullfill other requirements .
If you try to pass live only by learning facts , you have the wrong point of view .
You cannot repeat facts all the time , once in your live you have to come to the point where you understand the links between several topics and where you are able to produce your own ideas .

On the other hand you cannot achiev anything only by understanding ideas and concepts .
Once understood , you have to learn several things by hard .
The best example is to learn a language .
You can understand all the grammar - but without vocabulary you wo n't be able to have a conversation in this language .
I know a lot of smart students who are able to understand ideas very fast .
But when they understood the ideas , the do not think about them anymore , they do n't learn them by hard , and , as fast as they understood the ideas , they forget them .
It 's a waste of talent , they do not recognize that you have to work hard for good results .
They are not used to .
And , no matter of my opinion , i did also realize how important it is to learn facts , and how difficult it is .
But learning facts must never be the more important point of studies .
For only learning facts , we do n't need human beeings , computers are better in storing information without thinking of it .
As long as we think of the facts we learn , we learn the right way , the way you need to learn to be a good student .
