I do not agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I base my belief on a number of reasons .
First of all young persons ' most important duty is to concentrate on school .
They should be able to focus completely on their studies rather then be concerned with what they can do for his community .
If they failed in school they would later become a problem for their community because tehry would have to rely on public benefits in order to survive .

Likewise I believe young persons should be able to spend some of histtheirs free time with ativities that are distractive from school and help to relax instead of investing that time into helping the community .
To be successful they need opportunties to relax from their school work .
So for example young people should be given time to do sports or other distractive activities instead of forcing them to invest their precious free time into community work .

Beyond that I think young people nowadays have certain duties at home , too .
Runing a family is not just the parents ' task but also requires the childrens ' help .
Thus they have another important duty to fulfil .
Also , happy families that do not rely on community support for example because its members are able to run their everyday life do not rely on the communty 's help .
So young people give important time to their communities as they help running their families .

In the end I cannot support the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they have other duties like school that need to be fulfilled in the first place .
However , by helping at home and doing sports they contribute to a healthy community .
This way they give precious time to helping their communities .
