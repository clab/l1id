It is difficult to agree or disagree with this statement .
If people enjoy their lifes or not , depends most of the time on their character and their living circumstances .
These circumstances can be bad for young pepole as well as for older people .
But I rather think older people enjoy their lifes more than the other way round .

Most of the time young people do n't have as many responsibilities as older people have .
Older people are limited by their job , their family and other tasks .
On the other hand the job and the family can be very fullfilling for the older people and therefore make life more enjoyable .
Due to a lesser amount of responsibilities younger people can do what they want and like .
This greatly contributes to more joy in life .

But there are examples where this does n't hold true .
A relative of mine who is 58 years old quit his job with 50 and is now living a very fullfilling and enjoyable life with less responsibilities than even the young people have .

Another thing which contributes to a more enjoyable life of older people is that they can value good times more than the younger because of their experience .
Most of the older people went through bad times in their lifes and so they can value smaller things more than young people do .

Furthermore they know better what they like in life .
Young people often do n't know what the like .
They are unstable in their emotions and tend to be depressed over small things .

On the other hand older people are often less open to try new things .
Therefore they might miss activities or experiences which they would enjoy very much .
In summary it is difficult to say who is enjoying his life more , younger or older people .
I think it depends very much on the character of the person itself .
But when I had to decide between the two , I would choose the older people .
