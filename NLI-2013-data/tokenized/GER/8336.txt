The way for many students to reach good results is to learn facts and reproduce them when they are asked to .
In general , I never was a friend of just learning facts without understanding the background .
But I must agree , that it depends on the topic , which is the best way to learn .

When learning a language for example , you have to learn the vocabulary .
Or when studying medecine , you ca n't get along without just learning the whole anatomy .
The same case is when learning about history , there are some facts that you just have to keep in your mind .
But : It 's only the preparation to be able to work .
You will work with the anatomy or the historical facts , that you learned .

I think , it is much more important to understand the idea of an concept .
That is the only way , to be critical with ideas , to think about it and maybe even to innovate or improve it .

At the week-end , I 'm an instructor of First Aid at the German Red Cross .
I never say to the participants of my courses : That is the perfect way to handle a medical problem .
As an example , I would like to tell about the `` stabile Seitenlage '' , which probably can be explained as laying a consciousless person in a stable way on the side .
Very important to me is to make the people understand , what are the dangers of loosing their mind .
And to solve these problems , we think about possibilities against these dangers .
Finally , the technic called `` stabile Seitenlage '' is a proposition of me , how the dangers of beeing `` bewusstlos / consciousless ? '' can be handled .
But if a person has understand WHY `` Bewusstlosigkeit '' is dangerous and what can be done against it , he is always able to find a solution even when he ca n't remember the technic of the `` stabile Seitenlage '' .

For an ingenieur , who wants to ameliorate for example a car , it is not enough to know about the facts of the car ...
60 hp , maybe 1.100kg and so on .
He must have understood the idea of the concept , how the car works , to be able to change anything .

In summary , I think you always have to learn some facts and keep them in your mind first , but when you want to reach at a higher level , you absolutely must see `` behind '' the facts , you have to understand the concepts and ideas .

And often , you have to understand the concept only once , and you can solve any problem by logical thinking .
You can learn all the results of mathemathical terms by heart , or understand one time , how the calculator functions : - )
