The question askes to discuss the usage and the effect of advertisements on products .

First of all , my opinon about this question is that advertisements do change the point of view in terms of its quality or usage .
Many customers become manipulated in the way how a product is presented .

For example the store ALDI in Germany sells many different food products .
These products are not advertised at all and have no nice brandings and designs .
That makes them cheaper and many people buy these to save money and still get very good products .
These people are the minority of all customers in Germany .
Most of the people buy their food in great warehouses .
These markets use a lot of advertisements to offer their goods .
Even these goods come from the same production or have the same quality as goods from ALDI .
The people buy them because of the better style or the higher price .
Quality has it 's price they think .
In fact this shows that people trust more in the quality and taste of products if the advertisement tells that .
Another example are televison advertisements .
Usually there are nice-looking people acting to manipulate the spectator .
The spectator thinks he or she could be this human and gets more atractive if he or she buys the product .
The importance of the product is not important anymore .
To manipulate the customer and giving him the illusion life cannot continue without buying this product is a very common procedure nowadays .
Therefore many magazines offer testing reports on products of main interest .
They test each item and rank all of them afterwards in terms of quality or price .
Many people today do not buy electronic items before they have researched testing reports and comments from other people .
It is too unsafe for them to buy in an affect of a nice advertisement .
It is more important to get what is needed .
