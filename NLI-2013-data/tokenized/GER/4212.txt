I agree with the statement as I think there have occured various societal changes during the last decades which have influenced the attitude towards community-help in general and especially for young people .

In my point of view an essential step is taken in the early childhood .
Influenced by the fact that more and more parents are working , even mothers return to work earlier than years ago , children have to occupy themselves also in young age .
For sure , children choose activities which occur attractive and interesting for them .

This point leads to a further factor which influences the decrease in community-help of young people .
The new information technology , for instance Internet , computer-games , ...
appears more attractive and challenging to young people compared to community-help .

Also influenced by the fact that mostly both parents are working , they do not have time to help in communities .
Consequently children do not have anybody to look up and follow .

Further I believe that young people do not want to spend too much time for activities in communities , as they are much more interested in a variation of different things and want to explore the world and its diversity .
This is supported by national and internation policy which is presenting attractively the advantages of going abroad , make self-experiences in other countries and cultures , learning foreign-languages while staying in a country where this language is spoken , and so on .

Further thinking on my own experience in my home country , universities and colleges are more and more centralised .
Therefore young people have to leave their home-village pretty soon after finishing highschool if they want to attend higher education .
Consequently people are at least locally separated from their communities .

To sum up , I regret that community-help is decreasing , however I can see reasons leading to this development .
And deep in my heard I hope that young people reflect on this development and put more emphasize on communtiy-help in future .
