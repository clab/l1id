Cars !
cars are one of the most used vehicles today and they lead to a better lifestyle and comfort for a lot of people .
On the other hand there are a lot of negative aspects that are involved in the use of cars and people argue about the existence of cars .
Will there be more or fewer cars in twenty years ?

To discuss that topic we have to look at happenings all arround the world .
Daily newspapers write about pollution and about the effects that occur from cars .
People will have to consider our environment even more in the future and they really have to be aware of the risks when polluting the earth .
Another point often mentioned in headlines is the one that new energy sources , which will be able to run an engine are found and prepared for future use .
Meanwhile some scientists belive that there will be enough oil to support cars for the next century others think that oil is a very scacre ressource and there wont be enough oil to provide all cars .
Another point that has to be taken into consideration is that streets not only are overcrouded but also cause the government to spend a lot of money to repair them .
Surely some of that money will be collected by taxes from street-users such as car drivers but there has to be further consideration .
On the other hand there are reasons to make one think that there will be more cars in the future .
For example there is the growing population especially in china or asia where a lot of people nowadays drive bysicles but as soon as they can afford cars will buy a car .
That means that there are might regions where more cars will be build to satisfy one s wishes considering the hole planet population is not growing that fast anymore and therefore there is no aid of more cars .

In conclusion i think that cars will always remain on our streets at least for the next 20 years but there will not be a significant grow of cars .
Rather people start to think about future generations and environment which will make them able to establish bus systems and train stations to protect the environment .
