Allthough many people think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , from my point of view this statement is not correct .
I think so because of my personal expierences .
I lived a short time in africa - and so I think I have a better `` view of the world '' what covinced me .

In Africa it was normal that everybody help eachother and this was the own way to get something .
Maybe there is a specially situation .
There are not enough education and think 's like that .
In the other way the cities looks like in europe and you can by everthing like in europe .
The people have n't enough and so you need the help from the others .
In Europe or in the other industrial states the name of this thing is like `` develop countries '' .
But is it right ?
I do n't think so .

I can understand the author of the statement if we have only a look of the industrial states .
I think in these countiers the people are conzentrated at ther own .
Everybody want 's the best for ownself and so it can be happen that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
But is that a good way ?

In my view it 's better to help eachother because in this way you can also learn from eachother .
Furthermore I believe that helping is a good think and if you help anybody you get back more ...
Maybay not in the same second but in own time ...
And if we have n't any time in our high `` develop world '' so we must took the time because it is nessesary .
If you help somebaody you can also open your mind for an other point of view or you can learn an other waw to past the goal .
S , I believe in this way we can learn form the `` develop world '' .
It 's not good to forget in what a safty world we live .
These safty world can also changes in a world where anybody looking at there own and forget the other ...
In my opinion that will be not good .
So , perhaps have the `` industrial world '' in one time a look to the `` third world '' to learn someting - the importend thing not forget to help .

Concluding I would like to say , that I can understand the people in the high develop countries to think that the young people nowadays do not have enough time to helping their commmunities .
But the high develop countiers are not the world .
It is nessesary that the people not forget , that the succsess is not the importend thing .
If you help eachother so is a smile for a thank sometimes more ...
Maybe in the industrial countiers will change the view .
I think it will be good ...
