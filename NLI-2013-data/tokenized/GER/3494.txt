I agree with the statement .
The reasons are maybe not as straightforward as they seem and I would also argue that depending on the person , different reasons apply .
For the most part though I think that education on behalf of the parents but also the teachers needs to instill a sense of social responsibility in a child .
The need to help others that were not as fortunate or the community as a whole has to be developed .
Our education system has increasingly become a job training center where many of the aspects needed to be a leader in other settings than on the job have been neglected .

While I think there are differences between urban and suburban communities , you often get the sense that people are only focused on their little microcosm .
The family is much more detached from the community than it maybe was a couple of decades ago .
Children are unlikely to feel they need to help the community if their family is not an active and integrated part of one .

Young people tend to have a whole host of attractive alternatives to spend their time .
Whether that means sports , meeting up with friends or just spending time infront of the television .
Lastly , the financial situation of the family might also require the child to take on a job to chip in .
Helping out in the community generally is voluntary and hence , unpaid .

Bottomline I think it is too easy to just blame it on the young .
The environment also plays a large role in whether or not a young person will spend time helping in their community .
