The question about generalisation or specification is a very important topic because it is an ever lasting dicussion .
My opinion on the question wether it is better to specialise or generalise is according to the generalisation , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
In this text I will state my opinion by showing the advantages in private and office live .

The first reason supporting my view is having the possibility to see more different aspects of a topic .
Imagine you are a leader of a firm .
Managing this firm means cooperation with different stakeholder who have different interests .
When this manager now has a general knowledge in different academic subject he saves a lot of time by understanding what these stakeholder want from him .
For example when you speak with researchers you know a few things they are talking about .

Second it is important to be able to combine different knowledge .
This possibility enables you to solve a problem by your own .
Insted of always asking people from different sectors you may be able in some situations to get the solution by your own .
This is also an aspect for saving money in a firm , by doing things on his own instead of outsourcing evert small task .

The last reason for my opinion explains the advantages of broad knowledge in private live .
Having a large range of knowledge you are automatically interested in more things .
Being intersted in different things will help you to find more friends .
And with these frindes it is possible to connect a network of reliable persons who will help you in the job or beside the job .

These are a few reasons that follow my opinion to be better wide spread educated then having only a small range of view .
You can gain a lot of advantages getting and using the knowledge out of many different academic sectors .
