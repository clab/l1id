With the rashly development of the automobile industries in the 1950's the use of cars increased exorbitantly .
By the following years to date most of every household possess at least one car or sometimes more than that .
After this explosive growth of applying a car the awareness of polluting and damaging the environment is also increasing .
This has been happening in the 1960's when the hippie movement was on their peak .

This means that up from then the people begin to think about the consequences of using a car and particulary using a car for movement for which a car is n't necessary .
They also started to consider what kind of aftermath their behavior will have for their children and the children of their children .
They recognize the impact of the using a car for the environment , for example they receive that the high use of pollutant like cars can be harmful for the ozon lawyer .

The turnover of conduct and so the try to treat the environment more carefully can be also found in many politcial strategies or in new laws for protecting the environment .
But in my opinion this changed thinking can be only found in industrialized countries like in the United states or in Germany .
Most of the far east continents like Asia are the contrary .
At this time they are getting through their industralizing process .
There the car use will be increse for the next twenty years .

Independing on this situation in asia I finally agree with the statement that in twenty years less cars will be used for the reason that some parts of the world have noticed the influences of using cars for the environment and necessitiy for acting now against the alreadz done damages .
Due to this awareness the decrease of using cars will recorded in twenty years .
