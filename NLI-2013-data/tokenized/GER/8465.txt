Gathering new knowledge and understanding processes of something is of high value at every time in a persons life ; especially during study .
But how should a person get new information ?
In my opinion the most important possibility to get new knowledge is by understanding ideas and concepts of something .

By learning facts , you can get only a small impression of how something works , because it is very complicated to know everything in detail .
So by understanding the concept of the solution it can be assumed that this knowledge is aquired by the person .
When some facts are only learned they are not aquired .

By knowing concepts of something the things , missing by not learning every fact , can be dedicated from the knowledge .
In a lecture was sayed that a person forgets every seven years the half of its learned facts .
Therefore it is very important that people are able to dedicate facts from their knowledge .
So a huge knowlegdege of facts can be made by understanding things .
But the other direction is not easy .

Another point is , if many things are conceptual understood , the ability of understanding new things is higher than by people who learn facts .
So , if understanding of new topics is inceased , the competence in a sector rises faster and the specific concept can be also used faster .

After studies , many students will be confronted with researching new things and concepts .
By knowing and understanding other concepts it will be easier to adapt the searched concept from other concepts .
This ability makes researches faster an more successful .
