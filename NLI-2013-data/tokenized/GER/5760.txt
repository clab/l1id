Living in a time where technologic novelities flood society in rapidly successing waves it seems a little bold to make asumptions about the transportation situation in the next twenty years .
But , nethertheless , I have the courage to say that I do not believe that there will be fewer cars in use by then .
One might argue that the global energy supply will diminish , that the market for new cars might be saturated some time ( perhaps in the industrial nations ... )
that alternatives like buses and the train system will improve further in quality and quantity , and that humans will finally , finally concede that using public transport will help save the environment .
But looking at the situation with a global perspective , the world 's most populated regions like India , China , Southeast Asia have n't even nearly cought up to western standards in individual transportation .
In twenty years , around the globe the demand for this individual transport facilities will have skyrocketed .
If one still will speak of cars , no-one knows .
A brief look at the telecommunications sector will suffice to see how rapidly technology can evolve .
Furthermore , old cars ca n't be desposed of as easily as old telephones or computers .
So , as could be examplified with Cuba where U.S. cars from the 50ies still crowd the streets of La Habana , the new cars of today will probably find their new homes in the poorer regions of earth .
In total , I can not really relate to the idea that the total number of cars circulating on our planet will have diminished in 20 years .
To achieve a reduction in emission of carbondioxide and other waste produced by combustion of fossils it would certainly be helpful to limit the amount of cars .
But as far as I can see , besides of the - usually powerless - environmental activist found in each society , there 's no strong lobby to be found which could enforce a reduction in car volume .
And by the way , what happened to the newest Porsche or the most sophisticated Mercedes Benz ?
Would anyone really want to have them vanished ?
