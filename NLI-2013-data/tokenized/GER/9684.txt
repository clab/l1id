Overall , I agree with the statement .
Progress of individuals and of society as a whole has always been based on taking risks and exploring new options .
Not only would the known world not include America , had Christopher Columbus not taken the risk of sailing thousands of miles in a frail little boat , we would also still be traveling on foot instead of using cars , planes and submarines .
While trodden paths can tak us through everyday situations , success requires us to see and , more importantly , use oppotunities .
However , the key to success is not taking every possible risk , but to recognize and take those risks that one can benefit from most .

A successful manager will not avoid risks , but rather weigh them against their potential benefit and then decide to his best knowledge .
A successful general will not seek to avoid confrontations but choose a battlefield that gives him advantage over his enemy .
On the other hand , someone driving at night at a high speed without headlights takes a considerable risk without apparent peronal benefit and might be called a stupid rather than a successful person .

Taken together , I think that an intelligent balance between risk and benefit distinguishes a successful person from the average or outright dumb .
Simply taking risks does not .
