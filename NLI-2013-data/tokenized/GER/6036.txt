I agree with this statement although it is really hard to imagine that there should be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
During the last century the use of cars has namely grown enourmous , but I think that there will be a change soon beacuse cars are getting more and more expensive and people are earning less money .
Soon most people will not afford a car any longer .

The first problem is that in our century of unemployment you cannot spectaculate that people will get more wealthy during the next time .
Maybe even more people will get unemployed .

A result of this is the second problem , the fiscus needs money to ensure that all of those unemployed people are able to survive .
The fiscus ' most likely opportunity to get money is to higher taxes and fees and because petrol is nothing you need to survive , the fiscus highers the petrol tax at first .
Petrol , which you need to use your car , is getting more expensive .

The third problem is that our petrol-ressources are fading .
In a few years there will be no more petrol to get and the prices for the last rests will explode .
The result is that petrol is getting more and more expensive , but in a very fast and rabiate way !

I know that there exist alternatives for driving with petrol , for example using bio-diesel , solar/energy or a hybrid motor .
But these technologies have not still grown out and only few people can afford them .
They can be further developed and they will be further developed , but this will need a lot of time ( more than twenty years ) .

I think that in twenty years many people will have got rid of their cars and will not look after petrol alternatives but after car alternatives ( public traffic ) like busses , trams or trains .
