Professional or general ?

In our current society of learning and studying there are a lot of theories how to achieve the best result , how to get the best marks and how to get a well paid job .

On the one hand some people think that specialising on a certain topic or subject and having an entire knowledge of it will be the solution to achieve the most .
On the other hand there are people who think , that it is necessary to have a certain knowledge in many different subjects .
Both of these ways to prepare for life have their advantages and disadvantages .

If you are specialised on one subject and you really know much , nearly everything , about it it is going to be easy for you to get a job in this area , because you are very well qualified .
But therefore it is important that there are enough jobs to be offered in your area you are specialised on , because it is not appealing being a professional in your subject without having a chance for a job .

But when you know much about many different subjects , but not as much as you would if you were specialised on each , it is also not easy for you to find a job , because maybe you are not qualified enough in the area that is required from the company .
So you are not specified sufficiantly , albeit you know very much .
In contrast there are also many companies that ask for such a general knowledge in many areas , so your chance for getting a job also depends on the kind of jobs which are offered .

So there is the contrast between superficial knowledge in many subjects or entire knowledge of one specific subject .
I am the opinion of that both things do not benefit getting a job .
I think it is necessary to have broad knowledge in maybe two or three subjects which match together very well ( e.g. mathematics , physics and biology ) .
But furthermore it is also important to have a certain based knowledge in some more subjects , but not as specialised as in the others .
As result you will end up with different levels of knowledge in nearly every subject .
With such a qualification I think it is going to be easier to emphasize your general knowledge and to get a job .
