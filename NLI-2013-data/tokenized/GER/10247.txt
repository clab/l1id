I agree with the statement , I think successful people try a lot more things , because of many reasons .
The most important one is that they have nothing to worry about , because if you are successful , you are good in what you do , so you probably gain a lot of money for this .
That means you do not have to worry about how you can feed your family for example .

Poor people mostly have to worry about that , which means they have not much freedom in what they can do .
So , if you are successful and rich you have the opportunity to do the things you want and do not have to worry about financial problems , so you can risk a lot more things .

Besides , successful people often need stress and drill , because they probably work a lot of time and put themself under pressure to motivate themself , so they always must do something to get the drill , which also forces them to take risks and look for challenges .

I also think that those people are bored after a certain time if they are good in what they do , because they always work in this field .
So they need not only a challenge , but also a change in their life .
This is , of course , something , that fits for everyone .
Everybody wants to have a change when he does the same thing the whole day , even if he is good in this .
But , as I already mentioned , e.g. poor people do not have the possibility to decide whether they want to do this job or take any risks with stock exchanges or whatever .

To sum up , I would say , successful people are not the onlyones , which rather try new thing than do what they always do , but in contrast to the others they have the possibility to do so .
