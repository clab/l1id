This is a very difficult question which can not be answered in one strict way .
In my opinion there is no general right or no to answer this question , it depends on the situation .
To answer this question it is important to see it from different points .

On one hand it is good to have a broad knowledge of different academic subjects .
For undergraduates its better to have a main idea about different topics to see what they are interested in .
Without this knowledge it is impossible to decide which subjects you want to take in the further studies .
But not only for the academic career a wide range of knowledge is important .
To understand connections between different subjects or to understand social problems it is necessary to have an general idea about several academic points .
There is one more point in favour of a broad knowlege I want to mention .
If your academic subject you are an expert in , is no longer something which is important to work at , maybe because computers can do all these things instead of human beeings , than you have to watch for a new job in a different field of work .
In this situation experiences in different subjects will be a great advantage .

On the other hand , as an graduate student you need very specific knowledge about one subject .
If not , about what will you write your final exams ?
For which job advertisements will you apply ?
Both are impossible things without a good knowledge about a specific topic .
In nearly every exam during your studies , except you are studying something really general , you need specific and deep knowledge about one topic .

All in all I would say it is important to have both , general knowledge in different academic subjects and special knowlege in one subject .
There is one thing we should ever think about when we discuss this question .
You can not get deep knowlege in a subject before having a general idea about it .
