I totally agree with the opinion that if you want to become or stay successful in your life you have to try new things .
A change in the way of working is not only good for leaders in the company , but also for the people working in the teams and working for you .
If you try different ways to hit your target , you will be able to see different ways to reach your claim .
That implicates also that you will be able to find different ways which can be different to your `` normal '' way of working .
And perhaps sometimes one of these newly found ways works out better for you and your whole company .

If you include the people working for you in the different teams into the process of finding these new ways to work together and for each other , they will enjoy to be asked and will enjoy working for you even more and even better .
You create a corporate identy and everyone will be happier because he has been asked for his opinion .
He is a part of the company and knows that he is important for it and his chief .

The change in the company , the results it brings and the new ways caused by it will show , what is good and what is bad for the daily working .
It will take some time , but you will see the changes the new way brings .
Or if even the traditional way you worked before was and still is the better way .
Going back to the old way is allways possible .

By searching for the best possibilities you gaine opportunities .
You are allways able to decide for the best way for your company .
That means , you are also able to go back to traditional ways and behaviours .
A great chance !
