Going on a nice vacation with a relative and without a tour guide is the most relaxing vacation .
Traveling in a group has its postive and negative sides .
One of the negative sides is that people have to compromise to other people 's suggestions .
If a tourist travels alone or with a partner , they have the opportunity to go wherever they want and to do wantever they want .
To see a forgein country and its original culture , tourists have to step out of the box and leave the tour guide behind .
Going into a tiny village far away from tourism in which no tourists have been , is an adventure that speaks for itself .
Who want 's to see a place that has been seen by millions of other tourists ?
My family and I went to Kenya , South Africa , and visited the tiny villages along the river .
We were the only tourist they had seen in years .
We saw the `` real '' life they are living and realized how greatful we should be for a life like ours .
This experience shows that not only will a vacation be memorable by seeing the hotel pool and hotel buffet but also by doing something exciting - something out of the box .
Considering the statement , I have to admit that it depends on age wheather tourists choose to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
It would be more amusing and exciting for older people to join a group since they like the company of other older people .
Older people would also enjoy the freedom of letting somebody else do the work - like a tour guide - and relax and enjoy their vacation .

At the end , it is a personal choice rather people wants to travel alone , with a partner , or with a group .
Every choice has its positive and negative aspects .
