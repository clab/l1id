First of all , facts are only short informations given to someone .
They describe something as easy as possible .
This makes clear that facts are easier to learn and to remember for a short time .

In comparison , ideas and concepts come along with a description of a new invention or a solution for a problem .
Reading a book about the idea or trying to extract important informations from less important statements are quite common .
You have to understand the whole concept and try to look under the surface of the topic .

Students who are good at learning facts might also do very well in school .
For them it is only learning by heart and reproducing it in a oral or writing exam .

Sooner or later they will have forgotten those meaningless numbers or short statements .
For example describing the growth of a city lying in the middle of nowhere or how many offsprings a fieldmouse produces ; quite nice to know but meaningless .

A bigger challenge is to understand a concept or an idea .
What is the theory behind it .
On what other ideas or concepts is it based on ?
For example is it much more difficult to learn the progress of an election .
How does the House of Parliament interact with the House of Lords ?
How will my vote be counted and which party will gain how many seats ?

All in all , I think , you need to have a good synthesis of both sides .
For a student who want to achieve something in is life it is essentially to try to gain as much experience as possible and to produce your own ideas underlining them with facts .

On the one hand you need knowledge of how concepts work and of how ideas can be realised .
On the other hand you need to support those ideas with facts you have learned and still can remember throughout your life and career .
