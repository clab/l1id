I agree with the statement that a lot of the advertisements spread across our society are trying to make products look better than they are in reality .
Actually , the reasons for this development are rather obvious :

Firstly , the steadily growing amount of products of comparable function and quality causes the need for customers to distinguish between these otherwise equal products .
Taking into account the enormous exchange of information nowadays , it is quite understandable that evolving a product is not as common as it was in the past ; Most of the related products are on the same level of invention most of the time .
Therefore , advertisments have to come up with a individual way of creating an incentive to favour a particular product among others .

Secondly , the average customer is actually looking for something superior to the contents of his or her 's everyday life to enrich it .
He or she wants to be special instead of comparable and is thus looking for attributes that make a difference .
Ironically , this IS what makes these people most indistinct , since a lot of them are motivated equally by these unconcious desires .

As a result , the authors of advertisments compose their creations servicing as well the wish of the producers as the wish of the customers , making products seem `` larger-than-life '' .
In some aspects , advertisments are a replacement or addition to religious or spiritual desires : the irrational longing for a special importance of the own existance , the wish for immortality through extrinsical approval rather than intrinsic satisfaction .

In my opinion , this development is something rather annoying - at least , if you are a questioning person .
I would not go as far as to call it intimidating or even dangerous - from my point of view , this development is more likely a symptom than it is a disease and therefore not the issue itself but a consequence of it .
