Young people often in general have a bad image .
They only want to make party , they make a lot of noise , they do not really care about their future and they do not invest any of their time to help their communities .
This is a opinion that is pretty widespread , especially under elderly people .
But is that really true ?
Is our youth that much spoiled and destroyed ?

I think there are also many situations which show exactly the opposite .
Especially in the united states , where volunteer work has a very high meaning , many young people spend much of their free time helping communities .
They work with children , they work with elderly people or they engage in protecting the environment .
In those states , volunteer work is highly admired and schools would support it a lot .
Probably in european countries like switzerland or germany , this is not really the case .
Volunteer work is not that commun and it might not be that often the case that young people engage in it .
This can also be a result by the fact that schools do not support it enough and do not make it popular enough .

But very often , helping the communities may also be acted out in a form , that is not that formal or public as it is when a individual does volunteer work .
For instance it might also be a helpful act of young people when they help an elder individual crossing the street .
Or when they show them how to use a ticket machine at a train station .
So all the helpful acts can also be acted out in daily life .
For sure , such acts are often done by young people , but that is not really recognized because it is not that public .

Assumed that young people in our days really do not help their communities enough .
What could be a reason for it ?
It might be that young people are just under more pressure than they were in ancient times .
The economy is not that stable at the moment , jobs are rather rare and one has to work against a lot of competitors to find his job position .
Therefore a lot of effort has to be put into working on the career and make sure that one finds a good working place .
It often can be the case that there is simply not enough time left to do some social work .
And in our material western society , finances and a wealthy life are for most of the people more important than conducting a social life .

Based on all those facts .
I agree that young people generally do not put so much effort into helping their communities in a public form .
For instance they do not help a lot in the church or in childcare or in environmental groups .
But probably they do a more hidden kind of helping their communities simply by acting out some social acts in their daily life .
