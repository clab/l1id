At first is to say both ways are important for students .
You have to learn facts sometimes but also you have to understand ideas and concepts in general .
I would say you can really understand concepts if you have learnt a few facts before .
I imagine to be a student in information technology .
How could I understand the requirements and the development of a secure and professional working IT network for a company e.g. , without exactly knowledge of the features and performance of the components for such a network , both hardware components and software components ?
In my oppinion the learning of facts is often the basis to go the next steps .
Only if I have achieved a very good level of detailed knowledge , a very good level of known facts and information I will be able to think in higher dimensions and to understand the context and goal of this descriped ideas and concepts .
The experience from practice will support the ability to create successful concepts .

To talk about another example .
I have to develop a marketing concept for a special new product .
How can I do this without knowing how the product works , what the consumer requires and so on .
In other words , before I can develop marketing concepts I should have sold a few products , I should have talked to a few consumers of the regarding market segment .
I should also have done a few market research to learn the most important topics about competitors .
All this `` to do '' can be descriped as learning of facts , either learning in theory or learning in practice .
Both ways of learning facts are very important to be successfull later in understanding and also creating ideas and concepts .
So as a summary I would say it is not the question what is more important , learning facts or understand concepts but it is the question what comes as first .
I am sure both of them are very important
