The question whether young people enjoy life more than old people cannot be answered absolutely .
It varies from person to person .
There are , however , several factors that speak in favor of the thesis that this is indeed the case .

There is a mental , a physical and a historical aspect to this issue which I want to use to support the thesis that in general life is more fun when you are young .
In order to do so , I first want to assume that the difference between old and young is a question of age in years and secondly that the persons to be compared live in similar condidtions ( other things being equal - basically ) , which are not extreme .

First the mental part .
An important influence on the daily life of a youngster is the fact that he thinks he still has a future .
Whether he sees it as something entirely good or bad does not matter , extreme cases excluded , there will always be hope and hope leads to a positive attitude towards life .
An old person has a different perspective .
He or she will see life more in the retrospective view and will therefore see more often the chancec forgone , excluding the few very lucky people that have always taken the right choices of course .
So generally , young people will have a better mindset than older people to enjoy life .

The second point is about health .
Young people are more healthy as their whole body is in a more dynamic state and better able to heal or develop in the desire direction and to enable them to a broad range of activities .
Also the chemical balance in the first 20 or 30 years favour a more intensive spectrum of feelings - although , admittedly , to both sides .
The elderly on the other hand have to cope with limitations by their body .
We become sick more often as well as our strength decreases .
This is an important fact to keep in mind when comparing age and youth .

In addition the former and the latter subject are interlinked as the saying `` mens sana in corpore sano '' suggests .

Thirdly the historical aspect .
In the past the world has changed only slowly and periodically whereas in todays world change becomes an ever increasing and determining factor in daily life .
The ability of companies to survive is increasingly determined by the ability to cope with change .

And so it is with young and old people that have to live in this world .
Young people are able to learn and adapt better than old people whos experience becomes outdated at an ever increasing speed .
So the development of the world favours young people more than old people .

So mentally , physically and culturally young people have better chances to enjoy life .
The most important point to remember , however , is that you are only as old as you feel and that age is not a question of years .
There is no rule that you cannot stay young mentally when you are getting older ( at least not to a certain degree ) , that you enjoy your body , having accepted its limits and that you try to keep up with change .
When you manage to do so , you stay young - and enjoy life .
