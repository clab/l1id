In the today 's materialistic world everybody strives for success .
But what exactly is it that makes some people successful and some not ?
There are beliefs that certain characteristic traits , such as innovativenes and the willingness of taking risks are responsable for being successful .
In the following I will outline to which extent those beliefs are right in my personal opinion .

There are a lot of business people who are a living example for the above mentioned statement .
Bill Gates , for example , would not be the richest man on earth , if he had not have a good idea , which means he thought innovatively and if he had not be willing to take the risk that naturally arises when starting a new business .

People who are willing to take risks do not fear the consequences of their action which makes them less careful .
That is favourable because carefulness is not always helpful when , for example establishing a new business .
Everybody knows you need to risk in order to gain .

This can also be seen when watching the stock market .
There are different assets one can invet in : riskier ones and safer ones .
The riskier ones promise a higher return in exchange for the higher risk .
The other ones are safer but the outcome will be less .
So people act according to their attitude to risk .

Trying new things is also very important , I think .
You can seldom be successful when only copying someone or something else .
You have to come up with something new , something unique , for example a totally new product , to be successful .
The company `` Jamba '' would be a good example here .
Ten years ago nobody could imagine that you can make a fortune when selling ringtones for cellphones .
Jamba tried this and introduced a totally new thing to the market and obviously the company still is very successful .

However , I think that trying new things and being risky is only determinant for success to some extent .
Once a person had a great initial idea , as for a new product , the person should carefully plan the commerzialisation of it .
That means market potential should be estimated , production should be adjusted accordingly and prices and teh scope of advertising has to be determined .
If one acts too risky in those fields of action , a misclaculation is easily possible which could lead to a failure of the whole thing .

Thus , in conclusion , I would state that a certain degree of risky behaviour and innovative thinking will be very beneficial when striving for success .
Nonetheless , one should always stay focused and take all the external effects into account that can affect his or her way to success because the highest risk can sometimes also bring the highest loss .
