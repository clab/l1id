I totally disagree with this statement .
So many young guys today are helping other people to manage their life .
I live in a small city called Erding and also in such a small city a club to help students to get better marks established .
I joined this club one year ago and first I was surprised how much young people were offering there help there .
All of this people are graduate students who use their free time after beeing in their courses and classes to spend it at teaching other students .
A major fact is that the other guys and me do not earn a lot of money by this activity .
Since my first visit in the club I have been doing private lessons once a week .
And I think it is a great honor to see the person teached by you getting better and better grades .

I also have a friend who supports a poor family in Asia with 400 Euros a month .
Without that help they could not even buy clothes for all of them .
400 Euros is quite a lot of money also for the european way of life .
But the girl works hard for beeing able to afford this project .

Another example for proving my statement given above are many other students and friends of mine .
I have already asked many people for their opinion about the fact that many older poeple that the younger ones do not care about the environment surrounding them .
Most of them refused to join the military after finishing school .
Instead they did a social work .
This would be for example helping older poeple to get to the supermarket or to the church .
And surprisingly every one of the enjoyed his job .
Everyone agreed that they gained a lot of social experience whithin this time .

To sum up I would say that young people often are misunderstood .
They are neither laisy nor not willing to offer their help .
You can find young poeple all over the social environment working for free and helping the people who need this help .
