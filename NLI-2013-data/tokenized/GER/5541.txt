Why do we see soo many advertisements on TV or in magazines ?
Many people buy or even recomand things because they saw it on a commercial or in a newspaper .
The system works like `` brain washing '' .
What you see or anybody tells you is good and if you are going to hear it over and over again you are going to believe it some day .

I absolutely agree with the statement that `` many products seem much better than they really are '' .
If you look at the package of an orange juice with a sepcific brand name like `` Happy day '' you will see a nice green cover with an orange on there .
When you are thursty and you go into a supermarcet , I guess that I will pick exactly this product because the cover of it looks awesome .
Later you are going to open the dring and you will be disappointed .
You will find out that it is only sweet and what the producer promises with a commercial slogan like `` 100 % Orange Juice '' , cannot be a true thing .
Another example to underline what I mean would be the commercial of a product which many people already ate at least one time in their lifes .
`` Pringls - Chips '' .
They have all the same form and they taste good ( In my point of view ) , but a slogan says that they will never become hard because you can close it again with `` una tappa di plastica '' .
If you are going to open a product it does not matter if it is a yoghurt or a package of chips they will be not fresh after a time .

What will happen if you are going to pay in the supermarcet a lot for a simple shaver because everybody bought it and it should be so smooth and soft and there wo n't be any possibilities that you are going to cut yourself with it .
A famouse brand name would be `` Venus '' .
After three times the Venus shaver is also not going to cut as good as it did at the first day .

In my point of view people should not invest so much money in advertisemts .
People and many children around the world need financial aid and we should support them and should not support products which we are going to buy anyways .
