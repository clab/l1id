I disagree with the statment that in twenty years will be a fewer cars in use than today .
Cars are important now for humanity and they will be important till we find something more effective to bring us or our goods from A to B , but that will not happen in the next twenty years .
Cars are also important to people because they mean freedom .
With my car I am able to get to every point in the world it makes me mobile and more available to the world .
In the next twenty years the population an earth will increase .
More people also means there will be a bigger need for cars .
People will ask for them because they are available and companys are going to satisfy this needs in matter to make profit .
They statment could be formed by the fact that our fossile resources are getting less but I am sure mankind will find a solution for this problem .
Companys already started to test optional resources instead of the tradional ones .
If our fossile resources are empty we will just switch to another one so that is not a point why there should be less cars in twenty years .

Another fact why i think we will not see less cars in the twenty years is the reason we need cars .
We need them to bring goods to the destination we need them .
Our hunger for resources like water and food will increase in twenty years because we gonna be more people on this planet .
Since we live in cities and not on farms anymore this resources need to come to us .
We have to transport them from there origion to there destination .
Cars are the best solution for this problem because the are the cheapest solution to solve this problem so far and I am sure that will not change in the next twenty years .

I disagree with the statment there will be fewer cars in twenty years because we need cars to satisfy our need on resources on the fastest and profitablest way we can .
Also I am sure we wound see less cars because we dont wanna give them up cars give us the feeling of being free and people do not want to lose this feeling .
