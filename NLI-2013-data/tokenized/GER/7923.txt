I absolutely disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are two points that explain my disagreement .
The first point are the high costs of a guided trip and the second , more important point are the freedom and the flexibility that one does not have on such a trip .

The first reason of my desagreement are the costs .
The costs are always an important part in the plannings of my trip .
If you chose to travel in a group led by a tour guide , the prize will certainly be higher than if you do the same travel by your own .
In a guided group , several people need to get paid for organising and making a trip , for example the people from the office , the bus driver and the tourist guide himself .
By going on my own , I save all these costs and can spend the money on something else .

The second reason why I disagree with the statement are the freedom and the flexibility .
In a guided group of travelers , one has naturally no freedom to do what he or she wants to do .
The guide tells the people when to stay somewhere and when to go , when to eat and when to go to the restrooms .
When I travel , I want to make my own decisions .
I want to have the possibility to eat when I am hungry , to stay at a place as long as I want or to leave it whenever I like to .
Connected to this freedom is flexibility .
On a guided trip , everything is booked and scheduled and there is no chance to change plans during the trip .
However , I prefer to be flexible .
If I like a place , I want to have the possibility to stay there for longer then I planned .
If I travel without guide , I can change my plans whenever I want to and I am opened for knew things .

To sum up , I desagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because the costs are normally to high and because it would mean a lack of freedom and flexibility for me if I joined a guided group .
