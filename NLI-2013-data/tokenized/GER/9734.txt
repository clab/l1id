I agree with the statement that successful people rather try new things and like to take risks than doing what they can already do .
When you already know that you can do something , it 's just normal that you try a new thing .
Everybody wants to try new things .
Small children are the best examples .
When they are able to sit , they want to be able to walk .
They get up and try to do so until they are able to do so .
You 're coming further when you try new things , you get new experiences as well .

There 's another example .
If I 'm able to read a german book easily , it 's just normal that I start to read englisch books .
I started reading englisch books when I was in grade 5 .
I already could read german books and was successful in reading german , so I tried so get some new experience and wanted to try a new thing .

Taking risks is the same .
People who are successful are often also secure .
You only take risks when you feel stable at a certain level .
Successful people always stand on a certain level , so they are more willing to take risks .

There 's also an example .
If someone just built a house and now has many dues at the bank , he wo n't lend his neighbour much money .
He 's unsecure about his financial situation and therefore now is more cautionous .

All in all , you can say that successful people always take risks and want to try new things .
They feel secure in their life because they are satisfied with their situation at the moment .
They therefore can risk something .
It 's easier to risk something when you are secure .
You ca n't lose as much as someone whose situation is insecure at the moment .

Another point is that sometimes you can be bored if you always do the same things .
To get out of boredom , you start to do new things and also take risks .

To summarize , I agree with the statement .
