In my opinion this statement is right .
I think if you always do the same things , that you have done since years you have to work harder to succeed .
This work becomes boring and you can not imagine changing anything if you always do the same thing .

For instance , if you always work in a company checking cars , this can become very boring and monoton even if you earn a lot of money , work hard and you do your job well .
But one day you will feel senseless and hopeless for a better future .
If you do not risk or better take the chance and apply for an other job , there will never be any improvment of your situation .
In this situation , success will be denied .
You will never get a better job with better conditions .
In this situation you should change your point of view and try new things .
With an application you could get a job with better conditions .
But you have to risk that the earning can also be lower .

This fact brings me to my point of view .
In general , it is better to take risks .
If you are felixible and try new things you have the opportunity to alternate your work and even improve it .
These changes leads to new ideas and point of views , which can have positive impact on the work and especially on the personality .

As an example I can mention students who do not want to go abroad but can be convinced , that it is good for themselves as a person and for their curriculum vitae .
This can be called personal success .
Going abroad means to take the risk of being alone at the beginning , of starting a new life in a foreign country and even of speaking a foreign language .
This way they have to learn self-reliance and become more self-confident .
These values can lead to success in application in big companies .
This access can bring them to richness and satisfaction , which can be experienced as success .
People who stayed at home studying well with gaining the best grades will probably not be as sucessfull as people being abroad .
I think this is very convincing for the rightness of the statement .
