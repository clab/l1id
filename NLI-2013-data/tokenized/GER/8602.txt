The University usually teaches the students to work hard .
To read the appropriate books , to listen carefully , to make notes and finally to recollect the learned information in an exam or paper .
But are the needed information only learned by conscious or are they understood and still available in our minds after the test ?

If a course consists only of learning facts and figures , then for sure the students will forget pretty soon what it was about .
But if they need to understand ideas and concepts they will be kept in mind once they 've been learned .

Despite the importance of understanding the information and concepts , in many courses it is still necessary to learn figures and facts to get a background knowledge about the topic .
As long as the balance between learning and understanding is kept , there is no problem with it .
But if the learning overwhelmes , the student might get bored of the stuff and demotivated .
The risk of giving up is high then .

Moreover it is very important that a student can realize how to use the learned concepts in praxis .
That point also stands for understanding ideas .
But if the idea or concept is very complex and the student did n't get it right , he might stay behind and ca n't follow the course any longer .
Especially if the following builds on the known concept .

In my opinion it is indeed more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , because things I 've once understood I would n't forget again .
Moreover it gives me the feeling of success if I understand the way it works .
For sure I also have to learn theoretical facts for my study but I think it 's more important if I can use the facts I 've learned as a base for going further in understanding a concept .

To sum up I would say that a combination of both , the understanding and the learning process is optimal for a successful study .
