In my opinion , the statement that successful people try new things and take risks is true .

My believe is that success and new things are closely related .
I do think so because in my experience I always considered something as a personal success if I was able to overcome old barriers and to reach targets that seemed unlikely to be reached before .
I feel especially satisfied , if by reaching new targets I have to face risks .
On the other hand if something is well known to me , I do not feel great satisfaction in achieving it .
So for me it is part of personal success to try in new things and overcome risks .

Also in a material way I think that it is true that success goes along with trying new things and taking risks .
There are many examples of great personalities who are regareded successful because they were the first to do certain things .
For example Lance Armstrong who was the first man on the moon is definetly considered to be a successful man .
Another example would be a business-man who managed to built up a company that provides unique and new products or services .
If his company offers usefull stuff and is the first to do so , the chances of being successful are quite high .

Of course , there is also another side of success .
If someone has certain targets that are not necessarily new or ground-breaking , you can also be successful by reaching these targets .
You could for example try to play soccer as good as some famous soccer player .
If you manage to do so , you might be a successful person without achieving a new thing .
But in my opinion it is more likely to become sucessful by doing something new rather than just to do like others did before .

In conclusion , even though it is not a necessarity to try new things in order to become successful , I do believe that by doing so you will have a greater chance to become successful in the way you feel about yourself and in the way other people see you .
