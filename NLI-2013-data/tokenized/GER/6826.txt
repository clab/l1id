Since the middle of the 20th century the number of cars on our earth has been increasing rapidly .
But is this trend going to last in the 21st century ( question mark !!! )

There are several points why I suppose that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
Taking into account that the natural resourses like oil will definitly come to an end within the next decades and consequently the prices for fuel will increase drastically , I do n't think that normal people will be able to afford a car .
In addition , not only the prices for fule might increase , but also car taxes and car insurance .
Even today , it is hard for most people to afford a car .

Another point is that in my opinion the puplic transportation in most cities will be more supported by government in the future .
Just think of the billions of Euro the governtment puts into the Transrapid .

Having a look at our cities , the limit for cars on the streets must have been reached by now .
I can not imagine that there is space for even more cars , especially during rush hours .
Traffic jams and endless waiting is an every day image on Germanys roads , the numbers of cars must decrease by any means in the future .

Best example for a car - abbanding policy can be witnessed in Innsbruck , Austria .
There , the innercity gas pollution and noice pollution became too much .
After voting against innercity traffic , the residents of Innsbruck now have the opportunity to sit at the Maria-Theresien-Strasse and enjoy their innercity atmosphere .

In my opinion this example should be a guideline for Germany and the rest of the Western World as well .
If politicians go on to refuse spending more money on the development of more economical cars and the discovering of alternative fuels , I 'm sure that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
If not man is clever enough to do something against wolrd pollution , environment will strike back some day .
