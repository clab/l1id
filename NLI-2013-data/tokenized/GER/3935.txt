Especiallz the elderlz often complain about the younger genreation .
In their opinion the zouth does no longer spend much time of beneficial things to their communitz .
I think that 's true .
In the following I want to point our = t several reasons why .

First , there is a more severe competition among young people on jobs than in the past .
Nowadays the youth has to work harder to obtain their goals in their professional life .
As a result activities that do not reward in the short run , like helping in the community , are no longer on the schedule of the youth .
Despite the honour of politicians and new laws to strenghten the juristical position of voluntary work , many abstain from it .

Second , in my opinion people are now more individual than earlier .
Young persons occupy themselves with TV or video games .
Spending their time alone with no , or little interest in other peoples affairs seems to be more atrractive .
This egoistical behaivior can be found in a current published '' Shell Studie '' .
As the study points out lesser and lesser young peole are enganged in public interest activities like foodball clubs or scout organisations .

Finally , acoording to the study we can assume that more persons are not willing to work hard for other individuals .
As a result , oing something to your commmunity is always connected with some labour .
Most citizens think to lead a foodball club for kids , for example , can be no fun at all !
It is generally thought that having a beer in a pub or at home is more valuable spend freetime .
But is it really ?
I think not , working with children is quite satisfying .
Monitoring their progress and celebrate victories with the team is real fun , as I know from my own experience .

To sum up , a fully agree with the statement .
Besides political ambitions are visible , only view individuals are engaged in helping their communities .
