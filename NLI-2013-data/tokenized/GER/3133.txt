I disagree with the statement , because I think , that older people enjoy their life more .

The problem is the definition of the word enjoy .
In my opinion is `` enjoy your life '' not , to do everything I could do in the less time a day spend .
Furthermore it is to select the important things , that take you further or let you become more lucky .

Young people sleep only less hours and use the time to make party , do a lot of sport or hang around .
That 's their definition of enjoy life .
The older ones have more experience in their life , because they are older and they also were young .
As they were young they tested everything , too .
And now , they know what kind of sport , cultural living , meetings they need to be lucky .

So they can concentrate themself on the real `` funny side of life '' .

I think , that young people not enjoy life more than older ones do .
I think , they are looking for the right answer , of what is the best thing I could do with my time .

On the other hand , older people normally have more money than younger ones .
So they can affort expensive sports , events or other happenings , which younger ones will never seen in that way .

And the main points of enjoying life are the family and long grown friendships !
I heard it a lot of times , that parents and grandparents said , that the greatest , the most amazing gift is a child !
And they never want to change the time they had before .
And they enjoy spending time with their family or friends .

That is an experience , which younger people cannot understand .
