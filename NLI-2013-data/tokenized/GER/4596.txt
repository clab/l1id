I agree with the statement , that most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are .
Industries only want to sell their products .
Especially in TV advertisments the marketing directors of a company only want to show , how positive the product is and that everybody needs it at home .

First of all , companys want to sell .
They want to earn money .
That is why they exist .
What people really need is not nescessary for them .
They only want custumers to buy their own products .

The second point is , that TV Ads only show how positive a product is .
Negative things , like high rated prizes are often not in the advertisments .
Companies onlzx show how positiv a product is .
Thez also sell dreams .
For example : Ten naked girls running on a beach on a boy , who looks ugly and has the product in his hands .
Today that is a normal TV Spot .
With the product of this specific company the ugly guy will get one of the girls for a date .
The advertisment will tell me that , but that is just not the truth .
Companies want to sell dreams , which have nothing to do with the truth .

Marketing directors of companies also wants the customer to tell , that there is a product what they really need at home and for themselves .
Everthing in advertisments is positive .
Faced by this fact , it shows that the products in TV Spots should be better than they are in reality .
The reality do not exist in advertisments .
That is a fact .

All that reasons are important for me , why i agree with the statement , that advertisments make prducts seem much better than they really are .
Somebody who disagree has no idea about companies and their tricks to sell the highest numbers of products , which are possible .
