It is often said that young people do not give enough of their time to help the communities .
In my opinion this is not true because of serveral reasons .
Firstly the workload is steadily increasing and thus the time available is becoming less and less .
It is also clear that young poeple do help their communities but it is just less recognized by everyone esle in society .

Young people often have to make important decisions and steps in their lives .
This needs a lot of time to be put in and it requires the a lot of engagement of the student .
An example would be the university application process .
The selection of university and the time consuming creation of a personal statement .
This is further promoted by the pressure which is put on youngsters by all kinds of different institutions for example sport teams , school , colleges and parents .

Even thouh every individual person is more and more self centred it would be a wrong generalization to disregard any community work which is done by young adults .
Such community work ranges from charity events for local disabled person centres to the actual help done by many people to be a superviser in such a centre .
Often this is done voluntarily and no financial wage is received by the helping people .

Another reason is that such work is often not recognized by the general public because it is incorporated into school activity .
Such an example would be the CAS whcih all students in my school have to complete .
This involves 60 hours of sports , action and service .
Especially the service is often achieved by helping out in charity events or fundraising for local communities but also for bigger organisations for example UNICEF .
UNICEF is collecting money and with this money they are helping people in a different part of the world .
This may as well lead to the conclusion by others that no community work is being done because they ca n't see the results of such an involvement .

In conlcusion it has to be noticed that the work young poeple do today has indeed changed an may even be less than it used to be .
But in general there is still the same effort put into this work and the results can be seen in many examples .
This statement reflects the desintrest of many adults in the work done by young people and wants to compare two different periods of time which is obviously not possible .
