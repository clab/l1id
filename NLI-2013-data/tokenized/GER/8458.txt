In my opinion , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts as only learning facts .
Because learning facts is not the elementary problem .
If they understand the main problem in general , it is easier to learn the facts , because they have enough scientific background .
Additionally , if they understand the scientific concepts and models , they do not need so much help , for example from teachers .
The students can learn in self studies and answering their questions themselves by analzying the problem .
The students have to learn how they can solve such problems .
This is what the universities and schools wants to show the students .
Because in real life are too much facts .
Nobody can learn all these facts , because there is not enough timeand it will be very inefficient .
So scientifics wants to formulate general concepts that are based on an important idea and developing a model , on which they can show the facts of the real world .

These are the basics of research .
The scientific result based on researching activities comes form an idea of the researcher .
If the students learn these concepts and models they can use them for other situations and they will get new facts .

The understanding of these models and concepts summarizes a lot of information and facts .
It is very efficient to use such concepts and models and understand the main ideas they are based .
