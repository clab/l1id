I agree with that statement to a certain point .
Successful people are wealthy in most cases , so they probably have the money to try new things or even take risks .
For example , if you take a look at the business world , you are able to find cases where big businesses put a new article on the market , even though they are not sure if that product will sell well .

that 's called taking a risk .
The people behind the big businesses have the money to make and solve mistakes without having to suffer .
They have the urge do create something new and please more costumers with their products .
If they kept doing what they already know how to do well , they would probably get bored .
It 's in the human nature to try out stuff .
humans are very interested in that .
It 's a kind of feeling that they have inside , almost like an instinct .
On the other hand , i know for a fact , that there are also incidents , where successful people just do n't want to come out of their shell .
They feel comfortable with what they are doing because they do it over and over again .
They also have the knowledge and do n't really feel the urge to put themselves in a situation of risk .

Risk can have bad consequences and could ruin that person 's life .
It may lead that person to a break-down and ruin everything he already accomplished .
Some people are just not ready to put themselves in situations that contain risk .
All in all , I think that it can be healthy to put yourself in a situation of risk , because there are times that this might make you stronger or even wiser .

It is proven that people in risk situations are under tension .
Tension makes you work harder and gives you the opportunity to accomplish more .
At the end , i have to admit that the statement ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well` , can be supported or not , whether it is right or wrong .
