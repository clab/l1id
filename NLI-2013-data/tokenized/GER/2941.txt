In general it is very hard to compare the level of enjoying life between younger and older people .
They live in different situations with different problems and challenges .
Firstly one has to consider the situations in which the different groups are .
Both have an unique profile .
The big part of the young people has only few money , because they are going to school or studying at a university , so the possibilities and the offers are different from those who are older and have relatively more money .

Young people often enjoy their life by hanging around with friends , doing sports , in short activities that cost only few money , on the other side older people go to work and so they have relatively more money which they can spend by eating in good restaurants , visiting the opera or travelling .

By consideration these facts my opinion is that in general no one enjoy their live more .
Because the different ressources which are necessary to enjoy your life are balanced .
To underline this , one can compare a student with a retired person , the retired person has a lot of time , he can decide what he does everytime , in spite of this he is n't in an better situation than a student that has n't a lot of time for enjoying , the student have to prepare himself for his exams , but this time that he use for studying is no waste of time , probably the student is enjoying his matter , else he should n't have choosen it .
On the other side the retired person ca n't fill allwazs all its freetime

In conlusion I disagree with the statement , obviously it is balanced , nevertheless everyone should enjoy every second in his life .
