Generally speaking , the purpose of an academic education is twofold .
Firstly , it prepares students for the labor market in a particular area .
Since most students pursue careers outside academia , this is not a trivial purpose .
Secondly , it should prepare students to conduct effective research applying the state of the art research methodology .
Thus , both purposes of academic education should be taken into account when discussing this subject .

In effect , a broader knowledge of many subjects will necessarily require students to focus on the broader concepts instead of the details .

On the other hand , studying subjects more in depth will allow a student to absorb a significantly higher amount of detail , at the expense of knowledge outside the area of specialization .

It has often been argued that such in-depth knowledge of a subject area and its details is not beneficial , because of a phenomenon colloquially called `` brain overflow '' .
As we acquire new details , we forget the details we have learned in the past .
However , research has shown that the brain is not a container with a fixed size that can only contain a limited amount of knowledge .
Rather , the process of learning and remembering itself expands the capacity of the brain .
Thus , there is no clear cut limit to the amount any one person can learn and remember .

Looking at the labor market implications of this issue , it is important to note that especially in knowledge based professional services , the degree of specialisation is increasing .
Therefore , generalists tend to be in less demand than specialists that are able to cover one subject area in depth .

Similarly , contrary to popular belief , it is still factual knowledge which allows people to put new information in context .
Only those who have a sufficient amount of factual information and a thorough understanding of a subject will be able to process new information .

On the other hand , most people would agree that while the exact limit of the brain 's capacity might be unknown , there must be some limit to the number of data one can remember .

In earlier times intellectuals like J.W. Goethe had actually read all or almost all books published in the three main languages at that time .
This is drastically different today .
Since the knowledge in many academic subjects doubles every ten years or so , it is impossible to keep up with this pace by going into subject specific details .
Scientists thus are condemned to become generalists to some extent .

It is also important to understand that it is the very ability to learn that might be the most important result of an academic education .
Acquiring the ability to quickly identify the most important questions and then to absorb new knowledge is more important than accumulating large amounts of `` dead data '' .
It is not only the knowledge that differentiates graduates from non-graduates .
It is also their ability to learn and process new knowledge faster .
All this would favor a more general knowledge of many subjects .

In addition to this , on today 's labor market , most jobs require constant adaptation to new developments .
The speed with which we are able to adapt to new developments might therefor be more important than the mass of knowledge acquired in the past .
I would therefore favor a stronger focus on general knowledge of many subjects rather than an in depth focus on one subject .
