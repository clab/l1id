Dealing with that statement about the students focus during the time he or she is studying , I what prefer to agree with that objective to concentrate of the the ideas and concepts .

To support my selection I will start with the disadvanteges on learning facts .
Consider and example that I have observed during my own studies , where a student as learned only the things written down by the professor .
He was clearly able to pass a lot of exams but there are a few special exams where it is pariticular important to understand relationships between topics and to achieve a high graded exam by using combinations of facts to buid concepts .

The abilities of creating combinations and to understand ideas are so much common in the real business world after the studies , that it should be the highest focus during the normal education phase not only at the university .
For instance , new products and high valued inventions are not be created by employees who have learned everything that was was written in a text book , they were done by people how are able to see the comprehensive concept including the business aspect as well as the technological background .
But for sure that new product could be supported by facts .
Unfortunatlly the numbers will change over a certain amout of time but the basic concept will stay the same or be improved .

A different important aspect that support the concept and idea focus is the traing of phantasy that is realy helpful to find new solutions and to extent the capability of a person to deal with problems that have not standard ways to be solved .

Summarising all written examples I would suggest to start with the understanding may be of an entire product behavior as early as possible to be able to learn from that behavior , concept or idea .
Combining that with facts you will be able to create products and solutions that could be recognized in your surounding business environment .
