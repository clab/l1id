There are several advantages and disadvantages on this topic .
Some people think that you can only have success when you take risks , on the other hand there are a lot of people who do n't think like they do .

One of the advantages can be that you gain experience of trying something new .
You cannot talk about it when you never made the experience .
For example the last time i went to a restaurant and ordered lobster .
I have never had lobster before , and I was afraid that the lobster would not be good .
But it was not just good , it was great !

Furthermore , there are also disadvantages of being risky all the time .
When you try out new things it can also happen that you get dissapointed .
For Example when you buy a movie on dvd that you have never seen .
After watching it you maybe regret your decision in buying this movie .

But there are also advantages of doing `` already known '' things .
No surprises , no catches , no strings .
La Quinta for example , a well known hotel in the Southern States of America , makes commercial advertisement with this statement .
So you know what the hotel is going to do to make your stay there as much comfortable as they can .

On the other hand there is also the disadvantage that you cannot develop yourself by trying out new things .
Though , you always stay on the same level .

From this , i think there is not only one way to go .
Sometimes you have to be spontaneous and try new things out , but it 's not always necessary .
In my opinion , the best thing is to find a mixture between these two statements .
I think that the `` middle way '' is always the best , do n't go for extremes .
