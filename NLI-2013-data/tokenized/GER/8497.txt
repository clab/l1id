I neither agree , nor disagree with that statement .
I think actually both is important .
Let me give a personal story that helped me getting a conclusion towards this question .

The problem is , if these days somebody is only sophisticated in facts and has not a lot of knowledge about the ideologically fundament among the facts he knows about , he will probably always have big problem to convince anyone else for a project or an idea .
The modern world leaves a lot of small niches to hide for people who pretend to have a lot of fact-knowledge and who in fact `` did not red the newspapers '' .

Both cases are nothing to follow after .
But , to tell this right at the beginning of the sentence , both cases are more theoretical-types of beings that in fact dont exist that way and I only use them to illuminate my point of view .
For example the former German Bundeskanzler Gerhard Schroeder was often called a big actor , a pretender .
A lot of people where concinced , that he did not have much specific knowledge about political programms from his party or important parlamentary decisions .
And in fact , I often thaught similary - until I met him one day .

It was a rainy sunday and some freinds of mine and me where walking through the bars of Berlin .
Than Mr Schroeder suddenly stood at our table and asked If we knew where the toilet was .
It followed what always follows , we drank , we laughed and we where talking about politics , as soon as he was back from the restroom .
But my personally lesson from that meeting was - If somebody is able to make a successfull carreer , where ever that happens , he needs to understand fundamentall ideas and concepts at first - and than he has to know facts .
Mr Schroeder impressed us all absolutely because of his the huge flood of facts , that so called `` pretender '' could tell us about .
