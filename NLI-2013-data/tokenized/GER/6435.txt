With this essay I will try to explain why I disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use twenty years from now .

When one looks at consolidated automobile markets such as the USA or Europe , one finds that even though the number of cars in use has not increased substantially over the last decade , neither has the number declined .
Even though other types of fuel might substitute the gas used nowadays , there is no sign of another , more effective way of transportation .
Therefore it is very likely that the number of automobiles in Europe and the USA will remain constant for the next twenty years .

On a worldwide scale , I think that the number of cars will increase drastically over the next two decades .
Emerging countries , especially in the Asian region such as Singapore are showing two-digit growth rates in the number of cars used .
Even though this development will eventually slow down in these countries , we will still see substantially more cars in these regions in the future .

While only looking at consolidated or emerging markets one can already imagine , that the number of cars in use will not decline within the next twenty years .
There are however countries such as China or India , that will be the major drivers of a stark increase in the number of automobiles .
These two countries alone make up a great part of the worldwide population , while the majority of people in these countries do not yet possess cars .
In China we can slowly observe what will happen in both countries in the future .
Namely an immense increase in vehicles .
The development in these two countries alone will lead to a dramatic increase in cars used worldwide .

As a wrap up I can say that I do not only disagree with the statements that fewer cars will be in use twenty years from now , but that coming two decades will show an increase in automobiles used worldwide .
