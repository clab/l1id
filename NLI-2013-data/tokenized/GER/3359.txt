It is true that the question whether young people give enough time to helping their communities has always been of great interest .
Although many people argue that community involvement is not sufficient , especially within the younger generation , I personally believe that there is much more activity than many people know .

First of all it has to be taken into account that many young people , after finishing high school , spend a couple of month or even a year working for the community .
Indeed , no matter whether it is military or social service , this time is sacrified for their country or for projects abroad .

Second , unlike many people believe , statistics proove that community involvement has even increased during the last years .
For instance , already during high school many pupils spend their free time within clubs or associations .
These activities might be related to sports , within a religious community or even related to political work .
But the growing engagement of young people is especially obvious on colleges .
Indeed , all universities have different kinds of student associations and they are likely to have also one where students deal with social projects .
These may include fundraising for a third world country , helping children with their homework or organizing events for elder people .
There is a large variety of what students do , but they all proove a high committment for other people an the community .

But there is also another reason , that clearly indicates the growing importance of engagement which is not directly related to the acedemic or professional career .
Since a couple of years , it can be noticed , that companies are looking for people to hire who have a proven track record of social engagement .
Indeed , social skills are getting more and more important , and young people are also aware of this .
Therefore , they try to proove their community involvement and thus improve their career opportunities .

To conclude , given the examples described above , there can be no doubt about a significant involvement of young people helping their communities .
On the other hand , there is still potential for more and people in general should always try to spend some time in helping others .
