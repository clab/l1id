The main meaning that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts is generally stated by the students themselves but almost rarely by universities or institutions .
In my student time I made the experience that in exams often detailed knowledge is affordable and not only the understanding of the main concept and ideas .
If one might think about this topic both manners of learning have got its advantages .

For the more general learning as I will call the understanding of the main ideas , the student gets an good overview of the topic as a whole .
Thus he or she has an understanding of the sense of an assignment and perhaps the possible practical applications .

The student does n't could give further details , which often also does not count in the pracise of the working world .
For example for driving with a bus in another country you do n't have to learn specific difficult vocabulary .
l The detailed learning with special facts and additional information to a topic has an advantage for the student if he or she wants to specialize that topic .
Perhaps in case of personale intererest or also because it is needed as an requirement to be taken for application .
For instance a additional qualification in the historical development of polymerase chain reaction , PCR , as special method in molecular biology .
Or also for a job in future you In conclusion it depends on the personal situation and academic circumstances which kind of knowledge is affordable .
For me its more important to learn facts for a subject I am interested in and what is essential for my working experience later on .
But in total I also try to be concerned about getting additional more general information of other general topics , so that you ca n't loose the view for the essential and practical things which are equallz important as well .
