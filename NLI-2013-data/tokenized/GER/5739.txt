I agree with the statement that in twenty years cars will be fewer in use than today .
I agree , because I know that the fossils like oil will be quite rare in the future on earth .
Because of that , the oilprices will raise up , so that not everybody is rich enough to buy the expencive oil for their cars .

Also , I have the opinion that in the next few years lot of laws will found to save the nature and I hope that the people notice that they have to change anything , if they want to live on earth more than twenty years .

I guess that more people will use the train or the plain to get to a foreign country for their vacation .
Because they it will be cheaper than going by car and they are more comfortable .

Also , I think , that the export from food , clothes and other important things will be not do by trucks .
I think that the things will export by train , ship and plane .

My last reason is , that I guess , that people don not need their car anymore because most of the people live in big citys or towns .
In citys everything ist close to you , like supermarkets , jobs , schools and cinema .
So you can do your way by foot and do n't have to use your car .
