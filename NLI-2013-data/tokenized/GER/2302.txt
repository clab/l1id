Since most of our neighbours are pretty old people and since I did one year of social service in a home for the elderly , I think that I have worked with enough old people in my life to state that I totally disagree with the statement that says that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

I think older people enjoy life in a different way than young people do .
So if one compares activities young people prefer to do in their free time to activities that older people like to do during their spare time , one can easily see that old people most probably enjoy life just as much as young people .
Young people tend to go to bars or discos with their friends , for example .
Older people enjoy going to a restaurant with good friends or like to see an opera or a thatre play .
I think that this is not that much of a difference in joy .
It is only the type of activities they prefer that marks a difference .

I would even dare to say that I think that older people have better chances and possibilities of enjoying life .
Since older people tend to be more experienced and therefore time-effective than younger people in many different areas such as cooking , housework , or even tasks at work , for example , they have more time to spare and for this reason more time to enjoy life ( if one suspects that working cannot be any kind of joy ) .
After retiring they also have a lot of time to do what they like or maybe even make dreams come true .
Take some of my neighbours , for example .
After retiring they went on a trip around the world to see a lot of famous places and to experience different cultures for about eight months .
Younger people could not afford such an activity .
They usually have n't saved enogh money and they usually have a job that wo n't allow an absence of eight months .

To sum up , one can see that even when only having a rather `` time-based '' look at the statement that was made , there is no chance of agreeing with it at all .
It would even be unfair to say something like that because it implies that activities younger people do are more enjoyable than the ones of older people .
But this is and always will be subject to personal bias and opinion .
