During my study I learned a lot about advertisements .
Our professor always said that advertising should convince people to buy a product - but not just one time !
This means that if the advertisement promises something the product does not have the customer will not buy the product again .
Moreover he will tell his friends about the negative experiences with this product so that his friends also will not buy it .

Years ago I would have totally agreed with the statement , but with this backround information I have to say that I have a different point of view .
I think that most ads try persuade the customer to buy their product by showing them how the product can satisfy their needs .
It is for sure that they do not show the negative points of the product - but i am of the opinion that nobody really would expect that .
I believe that today customer know how to handle with advertisements .
They know that they have to compare the product-specifications to make a proper decission .
Furthermore I think that not a single customer believes everything which is mentioned in an advertisement , because they know that everybody wants to sell their product .

To sum it up in a nutshell > advertisement is to persuade customers and so they will just show the positiv points of their product - but I am convinced that those are nearly like the product is in reality .
In addition to this all customer knew that they should not belive all the things they see on television , read in newspapers or hear on radio , because no product is perfect - even if they promise it .
And , as I mentioned at the beginning > when an advertisment really promises something , that the product can not fulfil , customers will buy it just one time .
And no one can afford to loose all customer after such a short time .
