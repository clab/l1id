This is a very interssting question .
The answer to this questions is not easy .

After my first thought I do not agree to this statement .
In these days almost everybody has his own car .
It is very confortable driving in your own car , you do not depend on others or on public transportation .
I prefer driving by car , because I can descide spontanious what I would likt to do and where I would like to go .
Sometimes it is even cheaper driving by car , than taking public transportation , like bus or train .
While going on vacation , you can also descide using the bus , train , plain or even your car .
Mostly it is cheaper driving by car .
These are some examples why driving cars are could be better than using public transportation .

We are not allowed to forget : Technologie is rising very fast these days .
At the moment the automobile industrie ist trying to develop a motor , that does not spend gas .
They are looking for different kind of ressources .
The plan is to keep cars , but make them work with electric or solar energy for example .
So if they spend another 5 years on developping a new motor for cars , i do not think they will be able find different sources for transportations besides cars so fast .

Reasons for cars getting fewer and fewer in the future could be the rising prices , not only on cars , but also the oil prices .
Driving your own car is already very expensive .
First of all you must have enough money to buy the car .
That ist not it .
You must also plan the costs that are related with buying a car , like taxes , insurance and gas .
The gas price has been raised since several years and will probably still rise the next years .
This makes car driving even more expensive .
So if people start thinking about their money in a more serious matter , they will think about really buying a car or saving the money .

But maybe there will be some inventions in the future that will change all our expectations .
Maybe we will be able to fly by ourselves in small planes or in some kind of rockets .
The imagination is big , the sky is the limit .
I could even imagine that nobody will drive cars in 20 years , because we will be flying , not driving anymore .

So it really depends on how the development of inventions for the future are .
But if everything stays like it is and we keep using our cars as we do now , I do not agree to the statement above .
Our population is getting bigger and bigger , the streets are getting fuller and fuller and the car industrie is making more profits than ever !
There are so many new cars build year for year , that I do not think there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
