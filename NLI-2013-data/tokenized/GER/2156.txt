When walking on an early night through the streets of any bigger city in european countrys ( especially on weekends ) , you will notice laughing groups of adolescents having a nice time wich each other .
When you think on old people enjoing live , you might think on grandpa sitting in a wheelchair while reading a book , a more comfortable way of enjoying .
But in my oppinion , the younger people are capable of enyoing live much more , due to several reasons .
They dont have so much restrictions on behavior by the society , they expierience much easier new things and they have the better health do to what they want .

At first young people have muss less expectiations by the society about how they should behave .
When a old woman is seen by relatives while she is drunken or she missbehave in other ways , she will do hard by explaining her behavior , because of her experience she should already know how to behave .
In contrast to that , young people are much more free to do what they want , and nobody is blaming them , because everybody should enyoy his or her youth .

Second , first experiences are always those with the greatest impact .
Somebody who , experieriences something , like kissing , for the first time , will enjoy that in most cases much more than the next times he will do the same .
Because of the fact that older people have made a lot of expieriences in their life already , its hard to find something new .
The first things are further these we remember best , because we like them most .

Furthermore , young people do n't have normally any problem with health .
While older people often suffer on several deseases , younger people can live without having to fear anything striking them down in the near future .
An old man may not be able to dance the whole night , simply because his unhealthy heart wouldnt let him .

Of course older people can enjoy life too , and sure they doo .
They have often more free time , and more money than younger people to do the things they like .
Often older people like to travel around , to find the new expiriences mentioned above .
But in conclusion , life is more interesting and enjoyable for young people , because they have to fear less , and fear is the direct contrast to joy .
They are more free , and expierience new things much more easily .
