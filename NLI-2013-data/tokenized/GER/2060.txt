There are many reasons why older people enjoy their lives much more than younger people do .
Of course , some arguments might suggest the contrary , namely that life is more fun to young people : Being young , there are almost no physical boundaries to how one decides to spend one 's free time : all kinds of sports or adventures are possible .
There is no pain in the back and at least less problems with teeth .
Young people are usually less settled , still more open to learn to know different people , different places and travel to other countries .
They do n't have to live with the fear or sorrow of having missed out important experiences or having made wrong decisions at decisive points of their lifelines .

Nevertheless , one must not forget that young people often live in fear of the future , especially nowadays when the unemployment statistics as well as the predicted future of the social system here in Germany are horrifying to many people .
Any kind of possibility is connected to some kind of uncertainty , which is one main reason for me to believe that older people are often more happy than the young ones .
Having seen a lot , having met many people and visited different countries , most of all having experienced the tragedies of life , I think it becomes more easy to enjoy life .
Maybe we even need those kind of experiences to truly value each and every day of our life as something special - an awareness young people are often lacking .
Finally , older people are often blessed with the possibility of watching their loved ones grow up .
I believe that experiencing future generations , especially within one 's own family , must have an amazingly calming effect on mind and soul .
Earning the fruits of one 's life is another experience reserved for older people .
