As it has been shown by history , countries which have been specializing in the production sector , have been growing economically faster and more effectiv .
In my opinion , this can be compared with the differa big range of knowledge in several academic subjects and the specialization in one subject .

Concentrating in more than one subject , always means to neglect some important issues of anotherone .
This causes to a wide knowledge of certain subjects , but always leads to only an average understanding of the material .
An example for it is playing many sports at the same time , and beeing an average player in it , or concentrating and focusing only on one particular sport and try to become as good as possible .
Then you will probably be one of the best in your team , which is in my opinion much better .
But this could differ among various characters .

But the more important reasons why I totally disagree to this statement , are the chances in finding a job after university .
The better a person is in one sector , the more outstanding he will be in comparison to other applyers and so he will increase his chance .
Especially in nowadays people , those , who have not a nearly perfect or adaquat practise and experience in a certain section will not find a higher waged job .

Last but not least , it is much harder to try to maintain a certain level in different subjects , because at least some of the themes cannot be compared among all the classes and have to be learned by hard singularly .

To conclude , I want to claim , that in my personal opinion , not concentrating and sticking on one issue is less effectiv than trying to be good in several academic tasks .
