If someone only knows a lot facts ( like dates , names , locations , time periods etc. ) , he is definetly predestined to be the next candidate on the show `` Who wants to be a millionair '' .
But if he does not know the supporting ideas and concepts that actually connect all the single facts to a logical whole , he is of no greater use for anything else .
In my opinion , it is our understanding of ideas and concepts that determine our ability to think analytically and to develop new ideas and concepts of our own .
I therefore agree with the statement .

Students go to school and to college in order to get prepared for their professional life in the future .
In most cases , their career will not depend on their knowledge of certain facts but rather on their ability to understand and grasp the WHY behind those facts and eventually create something new on their own .

Consider a business economics student : If he is going to work in some business in a free economy , he needs to be able to understand for instance the competitors ' success with a particular product .
It does not help to do that the competitor produces that product and that it successfull in doing so .
Rather it is necessary to understand the concept behind the product , that makes it successfull .
In other words , he needs to know WHY the product is sold so well .
Therefore , it is important that students learn how to analyze facts and situations .
Accordingly , teachers have to emphasize on critical thinking and understanding rather than learning by heart .

Now consider a biology student .
If he wants to work for the research and development department of some big pharmaceutical company , he must sooner or later be able to to improve existing medicine or even invent one himself .
He can only do so by firstly understanding the illness and what it does to the human body .
Or he has to understand how an already existing medicine works and in which ways it could be improved .
The former student therefore relies on his ability to understand a concept in order to improve it or create a new one .
Again , this clearly shows that it is most important to train students to develop a keen analytical sense .

These two examples can only give a small impression of how important understanding ideas and concepts is in contrast to simply learning them .
But I am sure that focusing on understanding will help any student who wants to work in a challenging surrounding .
