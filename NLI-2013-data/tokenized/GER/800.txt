If the given statement is true closely depends on the carreer you are planning to realize .
In my special case , I agree with the statement because I am striving to become a journalist in the area of science .
Of course , the abillity to write scientific texts is a crucial prerequisite to this kind of job but it will be also extraordinary helpful to have a broad spectrum of academic knowledge and insights if you are willing to get a scientific writer .

Therefore , I am studying Molecular Biotechnology which is characterized by its outstanding variety of subjects in order to get a broad education .
But many of my colleagues are very dissatisfied with their education since they are not teached to accumulate special knowledge in a particular fiel .
They fear that we have learned many important things but are not able to cope with problems occuring in the work of a scientist .
In other words , they do not feel capable of doing excellent research in a special topic .
From their point of view , the given statement is not true .

You may conclude that the best way to be educated is a compromise of both possibilities .
In my opinion dealing with a relatively broad spectrum of academic subjects at the beginning of your studies can be well combined with specialized study courses after a few semesters .
There is still the advantage of getting an overview of different parts of your subject and different parts of science first .
But after that you are still able to make up your mind and to choose the topic you will study in detail .
For example , in the United States and in Europe too , it is possible to make a bachelors degree and to go on with further studies in order to achieve the masters degree .
Therefore , after having received the bachelors degree students may consider to change their subject of study or to go ahead with much more studies within the same field .
