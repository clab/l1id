Promotion has become one of the most common annoyance in the wealthy world .
Who has n't already been screaming against all theses numerous interruptions during his favorite TV-program ?

Many pruducts have been successfully supplied for ages .
Shampoos or detergents for instants .
Everey year you can monitor new features , new ingrediants and of course : new ads !
I think ther are n't realy additional advantages for the consumer .
Laundry is as clean as it has been 10 years ago , is n't it .
It 's absolute the same procedure .

Moreover the variety of products increase dramatically .
It 's hard to keep an realistic overview when you go through the shelves in a grocery store for example .
All the socalled improved recipies of e.g. yogurts .
With colourful wrappings and slogans on it .
Does the most appealing advertisement really confirm a better and healthier dessert ?
I think the answer is no .

Last but not least , an incredible compitition takes place in the western markets .
Everyone knows it .
The most offered products particular according to our daily use are available at a sufficiant quantaty and - relevant in this context - at a outstanding quality .
How can suppliers capture and enhance customers attention ?

Logically produtors are forced to emphasize the apperience and description of their suppy to attrack people 's demand .
I assume , to react at this methods is rediculous .

In conclusion I ca n't agree with the statement , because most advertisements rely on a couple of reasons except for improvement of the qualitz .
