In the following essay I shall be concerned with the question whether young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Generally , I agree with this statement but there are some exceptions and remarkable points to be acknowledged before taking a too fast conclusion .
In my case , I 'm 25 years old and I 'm enjoying my life very well .
Im going out on the night , taking long travels in the holidays and other time - and breathtaking hobbies , which are a giving a me a kind of resting and relaxing besides my work .
For doing so , you need the time and a special sense of personal feeling .

Taking all of these examples in contradiction to my parents or my grandparents , which are much older than me , for sure , I 'm able to do go out very often during the week , visiting some bars and a disco afterwards and do not suffer on the next day although if I spent the night in the city till dawn .
In my opinion , this point of suffering will be compareable in some sports situations .
For me , sport is my life and I cannot imagine to live without it .
Therefore , I 'm studying Sports Science and I did several disciplines throughout my lifetime in a way my parents , respectively my grandparents were n't , and especially now are n't able to match .
But these two examples are based on the personal constitution of the human body , which is unique and also changing during everybodys life .

So , it should be remarked , that both of my grandparents and their heirs have different things to enjoy their life , none of which I can imagine to like or to spend many hours by doing them .
Nevertheless , all of those fulfilled them with happyness and make them enjoying their life .

Finally , I think that a basic solution of this question is based whether you are can understand everybodys way how to fulfill and to enjoy his life during the different ages .
