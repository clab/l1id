The question whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to be specialized in one subject is a very interesting question because a good education is one of the most important things in our lifes .
From my point of view , it is preferable to be specialized in one subject than having a broad knowledge in many academic subjects .
I am on this opinion because of a few reasons .

First of all , I think you have to be focussed on one specific subject in our society .
If you are not good in your subject you would not earn much money .
So you have to be very good in some kind of thing to get in a high position in a company .
For example you have to be good in managing to get a job as a leading manager in a big company .
So the more specific your knowledge the more money you will earn .

Furthermore , I think that you should have one specific subject that you are keen in or which is your desire .
To my mind , that is a natural thing .
Every person has a desire in something .
Some people like doing mathematics , whereas other people like doing biological research or like doing sport .
So every student has a subject that he likes and that he is fascinated about .
Therefore you should concentrate and focus on this specific subject .

Lastly , what job will you enter if you have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects but you have not got any detailled knowledge ?
What company is going to hire a student who has not got any specialized education ?
What job title would be the best for this situation ?
Therefore , it is better to have a specific education .

To sum up , because of the mentioned aspects I think it is better to have one specific subject where you are an expert in rather than to have a broad knowledge of many subjects .
