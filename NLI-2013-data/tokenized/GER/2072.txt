Young people often believe that they have the possibility to enjoy their life more than other can and that the quality of their current life is much higher than it would be when they will be much older .

My opinion is totally different .
The degree of enjoying your life belongs to your mentality of managing your life .
That means to manage the good and the bad things that can happen to you in life .
When people are young they know that they have know more opportunities than a child have .
They are discovering many new and exciting events .
And when they attempt to imagine how they can manage all these wonderful things in the age of fifty or sixty , their assumption is that everything would be more boring , because there is nothing new to discover for you .
To illustrate that argument imagine your first time in the cinema .
It will never be the same again , even if there will be produced thousends of new films every year .
But when i take a look at me .
I see that going to the cinema is as interesting as is was the first time .
The point is that now my emphasis is put on the new films and no longer on the cinema itself .

Another strong argument for having a better life as young people is that your body is stronger than it will be in a higher age .
Thus younger people can make various activities such as sports or adventure trips .
My persuasion is that when you become older your body looses some skills not from one to another day .
This is a process of many years and you have time to learn to handle this .
As your body is becoming older your interests will change .
While younger people often like sports older people enjoy sports like fishing or going into the opera etc .

To conclude the previous arguments I would like to express my disagreement with the presented phrase .
It is up to yourself to feel good in higher age and to enjoy life .
If you would ask older people how they think about the life of todays younger generation they would probably not feel well of imagining theirself in this situation .
