I agree with the statement because I think that young people have more opportunities in life .
Three major points convince me that life as a young person has more to offer .
At first the body of young people allows much more stress , thereby offering the possibility for various activities .
For example you can enjoy most sports and other leisure activities without endangering yourself physically .
You are also sound enough to travel for a longer time like for example flying to far away continents whereas you might not be able to do that anymore from a specific age on because of medical problems such as a low blood pressure .

As a second point life as a young person offers numerous options for your future both in social and professional view .
You may have dates and can search for the boy or girl of your dreams unless you have not met a marriage partner yet .
Additionally you can choose the career that suits your personal preferences and even more important , you might try out more than one profession because of your young age .
These various choices may make you feel happy because you can look forward to your future .

The last very important point is that you do not have so much responsibility while being young .
As an older person you might have to care for a family or employees , this may generate stress and makes you dependant to certain places or people .
When you are young , you might move to another city or even country more easily .
You are also allowed to make mistakes because you have time to try it again and grow with the challenge .
Not everything that you do has to be reasonable , for example buying an expensive car or having a dangerous hobby like parachuting or whitewater-rafting .

I am certain that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of their advantages like good health , many options and less responsibilties to take care off .
