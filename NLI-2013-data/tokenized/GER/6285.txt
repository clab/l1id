An often discussed problem in our times is the pollution of the environment caused by carbondioxide , which occured by the great number of cars used all over the world .
So to have a look in our future a lot of well-known scientists try to answer this question for us : How would the situation change in the next 20 years ?
Will there be fewer cars then now ?

To discuss this in proper way , we first have to name some pros and cons underlining this theory .
First of all to have a look at the negative site of this question .
In 20 years the development of the tramsport system will not be far enough to reduce the number of cars used by people .

Furthermore there are so many automotive companies which benefit from the profit made by the car industry and there are also thousands of jobs , so that the government cannot stop the trend of increasing numbers of cars , if they do n't want the unemplyment figurs to rise .

On the other hand there are some facts supporting the idea of a future with fewer cars .
On of them is the great number of giant projects like the `` Transrapid '' ( train ) , which show that a movement in an environment friendly way is possible .
Another , more important fact is : `` We are running out of resources , like crude oil !! '' , which are important for the production of gasolin .
If there is no fuel , nobody can use his car , and the secondary resources like electricity , etc. are not enough developed .

But the most important , and at the same time worrying fact is , that our environment is badly polluted , which means that we have to face a time where the governments of our world have to react , not like the US , in person of G.W. Bush is behaving concerning the Kyoto Protocoll .
There will be new laws introduced to our society , regulating the usage time of a car per person per day .
Or for exemple the regulation that one family is only allowed to have one car .

So to sum up , it will be hard to realize this wish , but with an optimized concept and the co-operation of all countries , a realistic chance exists .
