Personally I disagree with that statement thinking of the global development of the car market .
In order to support my opinion I would like to talk about different kinds of aspects of the development and the importance of cars in the industrialised and the developing countries .

So if we think of the industrialised countries first , for me there is no sign or hint that there will be fewer cars in the future .
First of all it 's still an important status symbol and an important means of transportation .
The second point is probably due to the fact that societies in Europe and the US tend to get more and more individualised .
In this context it means that if you drive your own car you can be all alone and - for example - turn the music on that you want to .

Of course one could say the traffic will collaps very soon but if you recognise the investments of the governements in additional streets and the development of navigation systems making the traffic smoother and more efficient I think this development will compensate a great amount of additional cars .

Another thing is that the production of cars becomes cheaper and cheaper .
Additionally people are able to finance a car a lot easier than in former times due to the upcoming of leasing contracts .

Finally the most important reason why I disagree with the statement is the development of countries like China and India .
More than two billions of people live there and still most of them do not have cars .
And if these countries and the people living there do not cease to gain economical power in the future there will be a huge demand for cars .

A hint that supports this point is the fact that a lot of huge car companies invested a lot of money in the developing regions of the world because it 's obvious that the future market for cars lies in these countries due to the huge amount of people that still do not own cars .
