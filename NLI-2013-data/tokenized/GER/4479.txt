For many companies it is very important to make advertisement .
For example a cigaratte company has a product which has a really small difference to a cigarette of an other company .
So people buy this label because of the emotional link between them and the cigarette .
The goal in this essay is to show that the products in the advertisement seems to be better than they really are .

One possiblity ist that the company tries to create a situations in which we prefer their product .
For example a person after doing sport is thirsty .
So a Coke would be the best solution for the problem of this person .
We can feel with this person because we remember how the feeling is if you are thirsty .
To enjoy a Coke then is a very good feeling , so the simple product seems as something very important .

In addition often the products are in a very good light .
A pullover for example looks very coulurful or a chocolat bar looks very tasty .
This gives the impression that this product is really good .

Moreover the producer works sometimes with the desires of the costumers .
This means for example a man , who would like to be attractive , has the impression that an Axe deodorant must be a perfect product for him , because if he uses the deodorant every woman will follow him .
So this product seems for the man better than it really is .

To conclude this arguments , you can say that there are many diffrent ways of manipulate a person and their decision .
The target of the companies is to win new costumers .
So we should be critical to this form of influence .
It is very important to think clear and logical if you buy something .
