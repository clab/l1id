I do not agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well .
To my mind , it is true that successful people are willing to take risks , but I think that they balance out advantages and disadvantages of an occasion better than people who are not as successful .
They apply their knowlege to the topical situation and know how to cope with it .
Most likely successful people have had many experiences and thus have learned when they can take risks and when it is too dangerous .
Stereotypically , successful people are wealthy and thus have to consider their capital .

As a contrast to these people , I think that people who are not as successful are willing to take more risks , in order to become successful because to their mind it might be their last chance to reach what they have worked for .
In my opinion , they do not have to care as much about any disadvantages or about the risks certain steps bring along .
They do not have as much to loose as very successful people .

However , there is another group of successful people : The successful people who only see the money , the success and the fame and therefore take any risk without considering negative effects .
They are willing to risk a good working climate and even friendships to become more and more successful .
These carrierists are very ambitious and most likely very egoistic , too .
They just see the benefit for themselves and do not care about anybody else .

To my mind one cannot divide people in risk taking successful people and careful non successful people .
It always depends on the situation they face .
If it is someone 's last chance to rescue a company , even the most careful successful person might consider taking the risk .
And on the other hand a non successful person might not take a risk because of any consequences , even if there is not as much to loose .
