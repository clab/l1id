This question is not easy to answer and I think that there is no general answer possible .
Everbody has to judge for himself .

From my point of view , I belief that young people do enjoy life more than older people .
Right from the beginning of our life young people begin to learn .
It starts with fundamental things like breathing , watching , tasting , feeling , etc .
Later on we have to learn how to walk or run .
All these steps go on during our whole life .
This learning process keeps people busy and therefore satisfight .
Even if the learning process does not always succeed immediately or is painful , young people are filled with pride when they have accomplished something .
This feeling is so good that young people cry it out loud `` life is so beautiful ! ''
Do you have already heard an older person crying this sentence ?
I have not .

In the last 50 years of our evolution , life has changed dramaticaly .
Things became much easier and faster for example doing laundry or using the internet today like the Toefl test .
Younger people do not have big problems changing themselves while their envoirment changes .
Although young people always claim that they do not have time left because time runs always out and the world never stops turning , I think they like that way .

In comparision older people have lots of free time because they do not need to work any more .
Or they can tell us from the past and their memories and judge in some case better becasue they know the results but all these points I have mentioned are not strong enough for me to convince me that older people enjoy life more .
I guess the changing world is the biggest problems for old people that they do have some problems today .
My grandmother remembers quite good when the first man on earth stept on the moon .
She was sitting in front of her radio and could not really belief what was happening there .
Today nearly everybody tells you for further informations go on my homepage under www .
My grandmother does not know what the internet is and seh does not want it any more .

So belief that younge people enjoy life more than older people .
