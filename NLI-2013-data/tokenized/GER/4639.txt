The statement that `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' is a quite provocative statement .
In order to analyse this I will differentiate between some types of advertisements .
As far as I think there are three especially effective ways of drawing attention to a product or service .
The probably most effective one are TV commercials .
In second place I see magazine or poster advertisements .
Thirdly I think radio ads are quite effective .

Exactly in the order that I listed these three types I think there is a hierarchy present that is linked to the statement .
TV commercials are extremely powerfull !
The human mind is affected by such commercials in a great variety of ways .
The visual stimulation is obvious .
It is also understandable that the audio affects a person .
But an immense power of a commercial lies in those factors that are delivered to the submissive mind .
Let 's say you have 24 to 30 images per second in a modern film .
If one image per second shows your product in an otherwise `` normal '' film , you get automaticly attracted to it .
Fortunately that way of advertisement is prohibited because the customer might be affected against his will .

Poster and radio advertisements only have an `` honest '' attempt to draw the attention .
But still they can as well include a lot of stylistic devices that can influence a viewer towards the product .

Colors , for example , are extremely powerfull .
Although different colors might have different meanings in different cultures .
In the western hemisphere for example red might represent the wild , blue the relaxed and silver the elegant .
That way a customer might get the feeling of an extremely stylish toothbrush if it is shown in a bright silver light .
That way a special significance is attached to a basicly normal object .
This as well might vary between cultures .

Therefore I agree to the statement .
Personally I think this is the great power the advertisements have .
Commercials play with all the associations people might have and by doing so they deliver a message that somehow praises their product or service .
