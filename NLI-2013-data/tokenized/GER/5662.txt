Newspapers are important for persons to read because in there there are many articles and so they can inform themself about the newest things which have happened in the world around them .
Very often Advertisements are in there and with them the Reader can see which new produchts he can buy in the Supermarket around the next corner .
But most Advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .

Newspaper advertisements are good to sell things because there the reader has a picture and he can see how the article looks like .
In the Shop he can look directly after this article and has a picture in his mind and he knows what he has to look for in the market .
It is very positive for the person who sells the product when he or she can make a newspaper advertisement because then everybody knows that this product is introduced now .
In an advertisement there are normallz information so that the normal person gets to know some details like for which age of a person a bodylotion or a creme is concepted .
When the person is 15 then he gets to know that he does not need to buy this creme that is producted for a person that is over 30 .
When this article looks better in this advertisement then mazbe more people want to buz this product .
Sometime it seems to be better to have an advertisement in a newspaper for some articles because if there were no advertisements then nobody would know that there is a new product on the market .

I agree with this statement because it is right that persons are mostly influenced by newspaper advertisements .
For this the designer of advertisements make the products much better than they are and the product always looks better than in reality .
I think that everz concern has the right to influence the costumer with this advertisements .

A conclusion is that products are praised better in advertisements than somewhere else .
It is alwazs better when the advertisement looks better because then more people want to buz this wonderful and unknown new thing which is praised in this advertisement and laughs at them .
