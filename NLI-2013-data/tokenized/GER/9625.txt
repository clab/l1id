Even though there can be goods arguments found against the statement that successful people try new things rather than stay at the point where they are I 'm of the opinion that this statement is true .
To underline my thoughts following reasons are given : First , if somebody is very succesful it is usually also very self-confident .
So if there is something new a successful person will not say : `` I am unable to manage this new task '' .
It will be rather the other way round : `` I have managed everything to my satisfaction , of course I will also manage this new task '' .
The risk will not be seen at first glance .
So a successful person trusts in its ablities to succed .
In the past everything turned out to be right ; so it will also do in the future .
A failure is not to be seen as a negative experience .
A failure is a possibility to do it better the next time .
There is no fear to lose bo doing the new risky thing .

The second reason in my opinion is that a succesful person would get bored continuing doing the same all the time .
This person needs new challenge to deal with .
Let 's take an example from the field of sports .
A good tennisplayer does n't want to compete with persons playing the same level .
The players has to improve and learn new techniques to be able to compete also with persons of a higher stage .
It 's the same in the business field .
Why stay be assignements already done for many times ?
A new challenge is needed .
New thing have to be discussed , tried even invented .
Otherwise there can be no step forward seen .
The successful person needs to feel the success again .
After having been successful in one field somebody does n't recognise the success anymore .
Sucess is something usual .
So the feeling of having success has to be found in a new way .
This is especially the new risk which has to be taken .

In conclusion , in my point of view successful people do n't have any fear by trying new things .
They even need to risk something new otherwise they would get bored after some time doing the same .
