I would like to dicuss on the question if young people nowadays do n't help enough in their communities .
By thinking about this notion the question arises what is the communitie for the teenagers today .
Is it their household , their family , is it the life at school or their position in the society ?
All these settings changed like everything changed in the world .
In the consequence of new aspects in their life and new influences which affect on them , a new realtion to all of the cummunities , which could exist for a teenager , is build .
So you cannot compare the attitudes of helping in a community from nowadays with the situation 20 or more years ago .
You could juxtapose the societies and communties in realtion to the helping of teenagers at this time .
Before around 40 years all people neede the community to stay alive .
This dependence is one of the mainfacts why the attitude of teenagers with helping in nower time is another one than 40 years ago .
I agree with the position that they do not help as much as around 40 years ago but I 'm opposed with the statement that they do n't help enough .
Everybody will feel if they need to help more than now , but just now our the society is fed up with people who wants to work and cannot work because of the less jobs .
Anther point is the communitiy at home - the family .
It could be that there 're a lot of children and teenagers how do n't care about their family and the staff in it .
I would not mention that the parents have the foult at this situation , the social sorrounding of their children influence them more than any other asepect .
I 'm convinced that something have to change in this .
But for reasons already stated I would suggest that the development of the society is the reason for that .
The teenagers do n't need their parents anymore , or they think .
Because the reality shows that those children who run away from their home , or those who does n't care on their family they will not be succesfull in their future .
They think they can use their time much better that spending time with their parents .
All things considered I would state that there is no problem with the realtion between the society , the state and the young teenagers because at this time they are not used to work or give their power to the general society , but in realtion to their family I totally agree with the given statement .
I is justified to say that there have to change anything to cope with the now situation .
They have to realise that they need their pa
