I partly disagree with the statement because there are several facts every student should know or learn .
For example , in history classes , it is impossible to teach history comletely without learning facts that happened in the past .
How should students know important dates if their teachers leave out the information ?
Certainly you can combine the two methods in your classes but they should be both handled with the same importance .
Moreover , facts are something the students learn in order to understand the ideas and concept behind them .
To set up another example , think of the mathematician fact that one and one is two or maybe even of the theory of relativity of Albert Einstein .
What concept can you learn compared to any of these facts , or what is the idea worth without the theory behind it .
What I want to say is , that one is not able to live without the other in many cases .

On the other hand in addition to that , it is often said that within new methods of teaching , it would be really more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts because if you once understand something you will be able to keep it longer than if you learn it by heart .
That is why a lot of teachers try to help understanding some kind of process by figures or images of themselves .

To draw a conclusion , in my opinion , you can not say that one thing is more importortant than the other .
Learning facts by heart is of course less important nowadays than it was in the past because new strategies have been invented .
I actually think that these fit together really well , because you obviously get the best result if you first learn the fact and afterwards you may try to understand the ideas and concepts behind it .
