Although a good argument can be made that old people enjoy life more than young people do , I think that the contrary is true .
There are two reasons why I have this opinion .

First , when you are young , you tend to have more money to spend than when you are older or even retired .
With the age come the duties and the sorrows .
When building a family , there are a lot of things such as a house and the education for the children that cost a lot .
Altough it may be true that young people may dispose of relatively less money , they have more to spend .
So they give it out for vacations , cars , parties and other things that are fun .
They sometimes even buy things that they cannot really afford .
Without saying this is better , young people think short-term and therefore enjoy every single day .
When I used to work as a trainee when I was 21 years old , I had money but no duties .
So I just enjoyed going out with friends every night and spend the whole money .
I do not think that I will show the same behavior by the time I get 30 .
I will hopefully have saved some money to be able to plan a family .

In addition to that , young people want to enjoy now and today .
From my point of view , I think it is better to enjoy your life as long as you can .
Knowbody knows what tomorrow will be .
I heard about a lot of people who were postponing their trips they wanted to take or their cars they wanted to buy , but due to several factors , suddenly it was not possible anymore .
Not only is it more fun to do a trip with your friends when you are young , but it is something you have done and will always think back and smile .
Therefore , young people travel around more when they are young just because it has more advantages than if you travel when you get older .

In conclusion , despite the fact that older people have fun as well , I think that young people enjoy their lives more because they do it with less reasoning and more joy .
