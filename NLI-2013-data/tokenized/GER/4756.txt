Nowadays it 's clearly impossible to run away from advertisement .
At home or on the street , even when you drive a car you may see advertisement on buses .
It seems to be very difficult to escape from it .
But what are advertisements made for ?
Usually they are made to attract peaple or to get their attention and finnaly to sell the product which the advertisement is made for .
Many peaple complain about the way advertisement is presented .
They see every kind of advertisement as an illusion of goods that in fact do n't represent what is said about them .
But do advertisements make products better then they really are ?

If you consider most of the advertisements you may discover afterwards that they do n't lie but they hide information .
For example in some advertisements they claim that their yoghurt has a lot of vitamins that make you healthy .
Unfortunately the same yoghurt has alos a lot of fat and ohter ingredients that can do harm your body .
This is a big problem for every consumer and for the government as well because it is pretty diffucult to find a solution for it .
You ca n't prohibit companies to do advertisement .
So the hidden information will be existing also in the future .

Furthermore advertisement is seen as everything that appears on screen that is shown between films or series .
So whats about cigarettes ?
In Germany for example cigarettes are shown in advertisment as a cause of cancer and a lot of other illnesses .
This is a kind of advertisment that does n't make the product better .
It does the opposite by showing how harmful cigarettes are .

Nevertheless advertisement is there to get peaples attention to buy a product ..
How can you reach this goal many companies ask themselves .
One option is advertisement , and as there is so much competition companies have to invent facts that make it more interesting .
As we know that most things said in Advertisments are not true we know that this is just a stragey to catch the peaples eye and make them interested in their product .

In my opinion it 's true that most advertisements make products much better than they really are .
Despite the exceptions mentioned above , advertisement uses wrong or different facts to improve their products .
