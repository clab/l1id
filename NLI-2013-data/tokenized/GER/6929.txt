I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , even though many factors would suggest this position .
Even though for us the fact that cars exist is the most normal thing , we should not forget that they have actually not been around for such a long time yet .
People started using cars in the early twentieth century , less than one hundred years ago .
But what did they drive before cars were invented ?
Horse carriages of course .
Those have been used not for one hundred years , but for thousands of years !
So how could we possibly expect driving something else than cars in twenty years already ?

However , maybe there will not be a new invention in twenty years , but people will just use their cars less than they do now .
Perhaps some sort of revolutionary means of public transportation will be created in the near future , which will make the use of a car unnecessary .

Another possibility is that oil prices will rise incontrollably due to a lack of resources therefore causing people to think twice before using their cars or buying new cars .
Scientists and researchers expect the accessibility of crude oil to decrease rapidly in the coming decades , causing people to come up with alternate ways of transportation .
Some car producers try to build vehicles that can use a different source of energy than oil .
So perhaps there might be fewer cars in twenty years due to a lack of resources .

However , other scientists say that oil reserves constantly renew themselves , thus preventing their ceasing .
In my opinion this theory sounds somewhat more accurate , causing me to reject the idea that the number of people using cars will decrease so rapidly .

Another reason for me to support this opinion is that people simply need and like their cars .
Some own cars for fun , but for some they are extremely important .
For example , my brother lives in a suburban area of New Jersey and has to drive at least fifteen minutes just to reach the next supermarket .
This situation is not uncommon in the United States , where most people have living conditions similar to those of my brother .

In big families , sometimes even more than one car is needed .
Perhaps the parents both need their own car to get to work and the children one to get to school with .
In a time when families choose to live in suburban areas more and more , a decrease in the number cars used seems pretty utopian to me .

Some people also own cars because they like driving them .
A friend of mine lives in a metropolitan area , which has an excellent means of public transportation , but nevertheless uses his car more often , because he enjoys driving .

In conclusion , the possibility of a shrinking number of cars in use certainly exists , but in my opinion cars will stay popular and in use for a very long time , unless someone invents something completely new and better .
