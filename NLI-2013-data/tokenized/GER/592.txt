I do n't agree with that statement .
It 's better to have a specialized knowledge about one subject .
I think you can be really good on one or two subjects but if you want to have a very good knowledge for many subject you have lot of work to do and in my opinion it 's just not possible to be perfect in many subjects .
There are not many genius in this world and if you are not one of them you shoul be satisfied when you know very much about one subject .

I 'm a specialist in history and german literature but if you want to know something about biology you have to ask someone else .
Today there are no `` universal genius '' anymore .
Hundrets of years ago there were some guys who knew very much about totally different subjects .
But today it 's too complex , to many informations to know - that it 's quiet impossible .

I want to study journalism and the student counsellor told me that it | s better to specialize on one subject than just study general communication .
Of course it | s very good to have a good knowledge about what \ s going on in this world but the magazines like it when you are a specialist in politic or maybe history .

I also think that it would be easier to find a job when you are specialized on one subject .
If you are very good in speeches you could become a teacher or a translater .
If you are really brilliant in math , physics , geography , history and religion it would be hard to find a job where you can improve all your knowledge .

This theoretical knowledge is worthless if you are not able to work in the praxis .
My mainpoint is that it would be to much work to do when you want to have knowledge in all academic subjects , especially for me ...
