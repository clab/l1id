Yes , I do agree with the quoted statement .
I think success is connected to new things and risks .
As an example you can regard the opening a new business .
If you want to found a company or a new business , you have to take several risks .
First of all you do not know whether your potential customer will like or accept your offered product or serivce .
But you have to invest captial in order to be able to offer your goods .
Of course there is the risk of losing this invested money , if your articles are not requested on the market .
On the other hand , it may lead to success and it will pay off serval times .
Another aspect is the innovation of your business .
You must be better than your compeditors to be succesful .
New products by inventions or imporvements are a must to survive on the market .
A favourable price and quality is also a strategy to reach your targets of success .
A succesful company lays its focus on innovation .
As a matter of fact you must offer something , that your compeditors are not able to .
This can be a new product .
But not only from the perspective of a company but also as a succesful employee you must provide your target group , who ever that is , with something new that other cannot offer .
As I have mentioned before , this takes work and investments before , which may not be paid off directly .
But that is the risk of success .
A too high degree of security does not permitt competition .
I think competition will lead to the highest degree of performance in total .
I can understand why people fear taking this risk because they depend on a direct income , but you should always try to experience new things and try new methods .
The first one with somthing fresh and new has a small number of compeditors and low competition .
If it is requested what you are offering , it will lead you to success .
