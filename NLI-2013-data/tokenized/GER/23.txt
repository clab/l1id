Although for some professions it might be better to have a profund knowledge of their specific subject , in my profession you are dependend on a rather broad knowledge .
So I tend to agree with the statement also knowing that there are strong reasons to think the other way around .

Being an architect my clients not only expect from me to make an excellent design which fits their demands , it involves also at least a basic knowledge of many other professions like electricity , pluming , wood work etc .
So if I would just focus on skills concerning the design , I would not be able to meet the demands in the other fields .
But then of cause I am also dependend on people who know more about specific subjects than I do like I mentioned in the beginning .

There is an other example to underline my point of view .
Surgents often need very specific skills and knowledge about deseases in order to be able to cure them .
But then it needs also less specialised doctors who are able to diagnose the desease in the first place and this might involve more than one field .

But on the other people who are specialized can be very narrow minded as well .
They do n't show interest in other things such as cultural matters like theater and art because they do n't know anything about it .
For some professions it is even necessary to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects such as buisiness man .
To be able to communicate with others in different fields can be a very important factor for their success .

So all in all I think it is better to be interessted in many subjects than just in one , it gives a a better understanding of others and opens up your mind for the `` unexpected '' .
