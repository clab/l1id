I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Just learning facts might be too boring for students and they might lose their interest in the subject .

One reason why I believe that , is that understanding a bigger meaning or cohesion of something may enhance the students interest in the subject .
To get the context of an issue is far more interesting than learning facts and not knowing their meaning in a bigger picture .
Furthermore , students might develop more independence when learning concepts rather than on facts .

A scond reason why I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , is that students tend to forget dry facts quite fast , because they can not relate them to something sensefull .
If they however , understand a whole concept , they might know why it is important and they might be able to connect that concept to the real world and aplly it .
In that case , the students will know what for they are learning in school .

Another reason , why I believe that ideas and conepts are more important for students to learn than facts , is that in general facts are difficicult to apply in the real world , because they are just part of a concept or an idea .
Understanding just a part of something does often make not much sense and is useless .
Understading something in a whole , makes student be more interested in more concepts and ideas , because one idea may lead to another , and so on .

To sum up , I believe that facts should be the base that is to be learnt in order to understand big contexts .
Just learning facts does not prepare the students for the real world , since the real world does not consist of facts , but of ideas and concepts .
