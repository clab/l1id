Acutally , the people getting much older than at older times .
That is a result of the development of better drugs .
But in additon to getting more older the old people have a better life than the younger generation .
In my opinion they can enjoy life more than young people can do , because of some basically reasons .

First older people do not have to go to work .
They had worked for an average of 35 years and so they are getting pension .
They have more free time that mean all the time they have in leisure .
They can sleep 10 hours a day .
I think that can not do the younger generation .
For example my grandmother sleep 11 hours a day .
So she is fit and do not feel tired .
Younger people are often feel tired because they can not sleep so much time because they have to go to where they work .

Another reason is that older people have more money than the younger have .
The older generation had saved money in the time they had worked .
The young people had not saved so much money .

The older generation can buy a lots of things .
All time of the day they can do a shopping - tour because they have enough money .

In addition to this the older people can fly everywhere they want for holiday .
They are very flexible .
In contrast to this I do not think that the younger generation is so flexibil in time .
Another example is that older people have more social contact .
They can meet each other for breakfast , for a cup of coffee or something else .
Younger people have the problem of the flexibility because if they have free time their friends might not have free-time .

As a result of some basically reasons , more free-time , more flexibility and more money I think that older people have more fun their life than the younger people .
