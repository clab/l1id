Although there might be some reasons for agreeing with that statement I prefer to disagree with it .
In the following I will write about three reasons why I do not agree with the statement .

First of all , I have to say that during my time at university I have met a lot of people who really felt the need of offering their help to their communities .
I know that students often are not called young people anymore but I think that they are because they are still on their way of finding their own way of life .
One example of their way of helping was taking part in a project where a house for children whose parents were not able to offer them an approprite way of life was built .
Everybody who helped building the house did it for free .
Another example was offering help by speaking to people on the telephone where again people did not get paid .

Secondly , when you want to apply at a special organisation for financial help it is always a big advantage to be able to show them that you have helped your community .
These organisation like to chose young people who show the ability to offer their help without wanting any money and the ability to interact with people in a social way .
If young people only help their communities in order to get that financial help they probably will get to know how much fun it might be to help others and how good it feels .

Finally there are many young people who make use of the possibility to spend the year after their final examinations at school with organisations that have the aim to help communities .
In England that is called a gap year and is a very good thing to do because young people make experiences that are very important for their life .
Since young people know that or get told about it they take that special year .

As a conclusion I have to say that I know more young people who help their communities than young people who do not .
That experience might depend on the surrounding I live in but even though I am sure that this statemant is not true .
