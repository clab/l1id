Lately a lot of people discussed the questioned if young people enjoy life more than older people do .
And infact this question is not very simple to answer , because there are a lot of views with different standpoints from people in different periods of life .
So you can divide people into a lot of groups concerning their attitude on these question .

If you mention sports for example , I am sure that young people enjoy their life more than the older one , because if you are younger you are more agil and have much more energy to do sports like rafting , base jumping , windsurfing ans so on .
Maybe older people are a little bit unhappy of not being able to do all sports because of their health situation .

Another contrary aspect is working .
Younger people for example at the age of 18 have to make their final exam and maybe want to go to the university for becoming a doctor or a manager .
Then they will have to spend a lot of time being at home learing all day and night to get a job in the future .
They have to concentrate all the time and are not allowed to have fun until they have reached their goal .
If you are older , for example at the age of 40 you are yet working in a company and maybe you are lucky of not having to learn so much because your are doing the same work the whole weak , the whole month or even the whole year .
Because of this reason it is possible that younger people cannot enjoy their life until they finished school or university and are able to do their work .

Another reason why older people could be the happier ones enjoying their life more than younger ones is that they have allready made their experiences with school , parents and so on , that they could benefit from these experiences .

So from a special moment on you can start enjoying life because of knowing what to do with your time , knowing some important secrets of life and knowing how to keep the balance in life .
When you know these important facts I assume that it is much easier to enjoy life .
The most convenient way of making the best out of life would be to know all the important facts from the date of birth on , but I think , then life would not be as funny and enjoyable as it is .
