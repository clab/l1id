I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Examples from academic theories , successful enterprises and real life proove the validity of that statement .

For instance , on stock markets there is a rule that states that it is more likely to get more return when accepting more risk .
Whereas if you invest your money in a secure option , your yield will be fairly less .
This theory of the positive correlation of risk and return can be easily transferred to successful business models .

Amazon .
com , for instance , is a good example of a successful company .
The founders of amazon .
com took a great risk in investing their money in this project .
The idea of selling books online was completely new and no one knew if this business model would succeed .
Another successful entrepreneur is Bill Gates .
Creating Microsoft was very risky , because the use of personal computers was still new at that time and Bill Gates could not be sure about the selling success of his programms .

Trying new things and taking risks in everyday life , will increase one persons ' ability to react to unexpected situations .
It will thus reinforce one persons ' self-esteem and self-conciousness , which are important characteristics in todays society .
A person will more easily succeed in its personal life since that person will be able to face and resolve problems with less fear .

In my opinion , all these examples proove that trying new things and taking risks contributes possitively to success .
