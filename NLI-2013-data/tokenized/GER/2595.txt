`` Young people enjoy life more than older people do. '' , is that kind of phrase ones can often hear in modern , western countries , where enjoyment seems to be one of lifes biggest goals .
Wheather this is true or not it will all come down to the point of defining and measuring `` Joy '' .
But let me approach this matter step by step .

It might seem natural and obvious to believe in this simple sentence because of the physical and mental abilities of young people .
They are healthy , strong , flexible and abitious to conquer the world , make inventions , found families and many more important faktors of life .
But is this really a joy any time ?
They are often fight their hectic and fast environment and get quickly older , visible in burnouts , psychological problems , affection for drug usage and crime .
I would agree that young people have an higher interest in their environment in general , but it does not say if this interest to create , explain and dominate is joyous or a need , meybee genetically predetermined .

How about older people ?
When we hear this we might think of those tied into bed , unable to eat and care for themselves .
But if you think twice you can find a lot of older people , who are happy with a slower live .
My grandparents still travel more foreign countries a year I could even afford .
Others write books and give their experience to the younger generation .
We should not be mislead by the idea of `` maximizing joy '' in terms of spending more money , doing more extrem activities and so on is always desireable .

To summarize it I might be allowed to refence to Kant , a German philosopher .
More than 200 years ago he wrote , it is never possible to define a overwhelming good wich accounts for everybody but everybody shall have the right within certain borders to find his own satisfaction ( quoted rater freely ) .
Therefore I am tempted to say this question is to be answered indivually .
Of course we can discuss it , but the answears tranferred into real politics will quickly show very unpleasing results I assume .
