In general I support the idea that successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing things they already know .
To support this statement you first have to look at the reasons why people become successful in the first place .
You also have to have a look at the word successful and to evaluate its definition .

Successful people - usually we are thinking of people who are successful in more than one aspect of life , e.g. work , family , sports ...
We consider them to be above average .
But what do you have to do to become above average ?
It requires you to go a step further when other people stop , or to use ways and means that nobody has used before you .
A successful scientist , for example , has to abandon worn out paths and try something new , look in a direction that noone has looked before or exploit a field that has been considered as irrelevant .
By this he moves himself on a brink , because leaving the standard routes always implies the possibility of failure .
A manager who has the reputation for being able to fix unsuccessful enterprises had to do the unusual to stand out of the row of managers before him , who all but failed .
However , to reach true excellency you have to take risks and do something new - otherwise you will remain average .

Additionally , if you are already successul you have the monetary or social background that you can risk something without gambling with your bare existence .
If you hardly have enough money to feed your family you will be less likely to do anything that might harm you in a way that you wo n't be able to support them anymore .
On the other hand , if you have sufficient resources at hand you can afford adventures and failures , as they might onlyu set you back a bit but not deprive you of your way of living .

Having said this , it is easy to infer why successful people tend to be riskier or otherwise exceptionnel : They had to have these strains in their character to become successful at all and they have less consequences to fear .
Their ability to cope with failure and their exploratory sense make them more affected to being truly unusual .
