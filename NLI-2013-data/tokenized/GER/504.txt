Since I am attending the final year of secondary school in Germany right now I am about to choose my major for college .
There are many things that I am very interested in .
I like politics and economy .
But I would also like to study history or law and I absolutely love to learn languages .
Now , I could decide to study only one of the subjects I mentioned above .
But since it is more important and more interesting to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to be an expert in one subject I choose to enroll in the major called international relations .
It is a combination of all the subjects I mentioned above .

Firstly , I strongly believe that one should follow as many of one 's interests as possible .
The human mind is able to connect different subject areas which , combined with broad knowledge , results in a better ability to understand complex concepts of the world .
Additionally it is always hard to sacrifice one passion for another .

Secondly , there 's a different approach : What if you suddenly loose interest in what you are doing at your job ?
Is n't it wise to have access to a `` second door '' ?
This way there 's a much better chance of finding a different job which will still provide you with enough income to feed your family .
Or suppose you loose your job ?
If you have a broader education there 's much more jobs that you can apply for .
It makes it easier to find a new job .

Thirdly , studying many subjects at once is more interesting than just one .
This way you do something different every day .
Even if it might be more challenging to concentrate on so many things at once , it will be much more fun .
It makes it possible to combine you 're knowledge from the different areas .
What is more , every subject shows you a different view on the world .
