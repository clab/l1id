First of all I want to say , what the question deals with .
I am asked if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or if it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
There are many advantages and disadvantages for both sides .
On my opinion it would be better if you have a broad knowledge of many subjects .
The reason why this is on my opinion will be written down in the following text .
First i want to say , that if you have a broad knowledge you will be able to work in more companies .
So it would be easier to get a job after you finished your school of academic .
Maybe the company you want to be hired is searching for a person who knows things of every part of a firm .
A reason can be that the firm wants to be more free to hire someone .
Then they can hire you for a work but if a person of another work is missed , you are able to do his work too .

Furthermore I have to explain that it is easier to know something about every academic part than specializing in one part .
You should know everything about this part .
I want to give an example .
If you want to specalize in marketing , you have to know everything about it .
You can only be hired in this part of a firm .
And if you are not be needed in this part of the firm you will be kicked .
But if you have the knowledge of several parts you have the possibility to work for example in the selling part of the firm .

A third advantage of a broad knowledge is that it is more interesting to learn new things .
you can learn new things in all parts of academic .
It would be boring if you do the same things the whole of your life .
A broad knowledge gives yiu the possibility that you can change yor work .
Your life would be more exiting .

To finish the text I want to give reasons why this is on my opinion .
I am studying Buisness .
But i am studying in all parts of buisness .
so I can look with part will be good for me .
Maybe i will specialize my knowledge later but i know many things of other academic parts too .
So I will be more flexible than other workers later .
