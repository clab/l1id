According to the task to discuss wether travelling in a group led by a tour guide might be the best way to travel I would like to say that first of all it is one of the most comon ways of travelling .
Especially Japanese are often seen travalling in a huge group .

Me myself I like to travel alone and disagree because of that with that statement .
When travel alone you are independent and you can make your plan by yourself .
In big groups you have to do what everybody wants to do or if there is a tour guide what he planned .
Most of the time there are no exceptions .
Being alone also means that you get to no other people maybe native people , maybe other visitors .

But on the other hand I like a mix of both like taking a tour guide for a day or travelling with others who are interested in seeing the same things or places .

I already traveled alone by myself and it was the best experience I have ever made .
Although I made trips with friends , groups or my family before I had never so much fun .
If you come to a town were you do not know even one person I will have to talk to stragers .
And besides I am shy I got to know many people which I would have never met if had been travelling in a group .
I made trips with them , what explains that I do not disagree striktly with this statement .

What I am sure about is that you learn much more about the country you go to , as if you had gone with a guided group , if you prepare yourself a little .

Most of the times you can barely find a tour guide which is right qualified to tell you more fact , than if you had informed yourself by books .
Some might say that this is not true , but I just talk according to the experience I made .

`` But is not more safe if you travel in a group ? '' some might ask .
I have the opinion that if you do not take to much risk and if you care a little for yourself , you will travel at least with the same safety .

On the other hand groups of tourist are easier aims of terrorist attacks because the follow a strict plan and are easy to hit .
But in general I just like to travel no matter how !
