The statement that young people would enjoy life more than older poeple is to be questioned critically .
In our society , especially in media youth and beauty are regarded as some of the most important values .
This perhaps is the reason , why this statement is supported by many people .
But reality is not the same that mass media wants to tell us .

Today older poeple have allmost the same possibilities as the young people have .
They have a lot of experience in life and play important roles in many families , in society or in the economy .

The more conservative part of the older generation helps raising the children or dooing the housework .
This return to integration will increase , while our economical system will force young people and also parents to work more flexible and longer .

Other , less conservative seniors still have important jobs in society , politics and economy and do n't seem to agree to the statement either .

The phenomenon of youth as a social vulue was born in our industrialized countries .
But the current developement seems to be a change of view on this topic .
Today people get much older than they did a houndred years ago .
Achievements in medicine and pharmaceutica allow a longer and much more prosperous life for most people .
Further threre are less children born to balance the bigger count of older people in our society .
The big firms allready realized this developement and defined a new group of customers .
They call them `` best agers '' .

I geuss the name itself implies our societie 's future view on the older generation and the older people 's on themselves .

Today and in future the age of a person will no longer determine what to do or how to feel about one 's life .
