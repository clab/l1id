It is often asked , wheter students should get a wide range of knowledge during university or just specialize on one topic .

In my eyes , the specialist is much more appropriate than a generalist .
In opposite to a generalist , who can do nearly anything , but can not do something really good , a specialist is able to , as the name tells , specialiye on one concrete thing .
Therefore , he has a good , deep and great knowledge about this topic .

Like in school , you learn a lot of stuff , you never need again in our life , because you are not interested in this things .
also , you are only good in lectures you are interested in , students are less motivated in this class .
This is why they wont get good marks or points in this topics , and therefor are more unmotivated .

But if you need some knowledge from other academic fields .
Like business knowledge for a physican who starts his own company , you have the opportunity to get this knowledge `` learning-by-doing '' or in an autodidactic way .

Also , if you only provide general knowledge , some students were not able to start at university , because they are not interested in such a wide range .
They maybe visit private universities which support this special things .

The most important thing is , that you will need a very specialised knowledge , to invent and progress things .
so , only a general knowledge is not enough for research and development .
this could lead society into a world without or with only few progress .

For example , if you know , how the engine in your car works exactly , doesnt mean that you are able to build one up by yourself .
or make some thing better on it .

so , Without specialists , a progress of society is nearly impossible .
Because of this , specialiced knowledge is very important .
general knowledge can received from books , but special knowledge is hard to get to know on your own .
