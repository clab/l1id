`` Nothing is better than to be youth ! '' , is somethin that my grandfather is reminding me about everytime we meet .
So maybe it 's something true about it .
I personaly agree with the statement .
There are much more young people , who seem to be confident and happy about their life than in the elder population group .
The biggest fascination about being young , is the freedom you have and all the posibilities that still can be reached .
When your young you can make mistakes and wrong decisions , which does n't mean you have failed for ever .

There is always something new to see or to do when your young .
For example get in contact with people from all over the world .
Travel wherever you want to , and work where you decide .
The life can be so unexpectable and spontanious while being a teenager or student .
If you 're bored by your situation , as a student you have the complete range of possibilities to change your life , and to enjoy again .

In my opinion , to be old , is the absolutly other way around .
If you have an own familiy , which of course can be very nice too , you ca n't change the way of your life immediatly - what young people can do .
Later on , you hardly can change anything , including a boring job you 're put into .
Many old people seem to me frustrated and unhappy about their life - unfortunately there is hardly any solution for them .

To show up the sitiuation even more clearly , I would argue that young peolpe change the world and the rules of life .
The older people just follow the newborn trend .
And I don ; t have to emphasice that it is better to controll others , to enjoy every new development is the plessure of the youth and not of the older ones , do I ?

For many old people their last plesure is to see their relatives achieving and growing up .
They follow the life of others people and not their own ...
truely frustrating .

The option of get new hobbies , or abilities is something exciting .
But this is mainly reserved to the 17-32 yearold group .

I am peronaly very confident and lucky eith my life and in my life , and enjoy every day , all the possibilities and oportunities .
