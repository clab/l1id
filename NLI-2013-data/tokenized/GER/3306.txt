As video games and other modern activities become more and more common , some people think that there is a movement towards a behavior which includes to help their community less and therefore spending more time in front of computers .

I do n't agree with the statement out of different reasons .
Schools and other institutions recently established some projects which are to involve students in social activities .
For example , my school started a project called social internship .
Every student had to work in a social institution for two weeks where he or she had to support ill or homeless people .
These projects strenghten the social skills of the students and I can tell out of my own experience that they initiate a special awareness to help other people in some situations .
Furthermore , there are many groups of volunteers who support the community .
These groups help in various ways .
First , there are some groups focussing on enviromental problems which collect garbage from woods and build some houses for birds .
Second , there are groups of students which take care of old people .
They help them with the daily life , e.g. shopping , and spend their leisure time with reading books out to elderly people who are n't able to read them by themselves anymore .
Third , there are also some political motivated groups .

Apart from that , there were made several surveys which proved that most of the young people today are willing to help .
It does n't have to be a big support , because I think it is better if many people do little improvements than if a few want to change the whole world .

People who claim that young people do n't help the community in these days should perhaps have a closer look on how teenagers and young adults spend their leisure time instead of to believe preconceptions .
