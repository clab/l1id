Nowadays , everyone tries to be successful in his work regardless of what he or she is doing .
Today different statements exist what can be characteristic for successful people .
Some people hold the opinion that doing same things the whole time is the best way to be successful .
However , in my view , it is sometimes much more better to try new kinds of working .
Therefore I agree with the following statement : `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know to do well . ''

First of all , I try to give some examples why this point of view is a good way to work .
To be a successful person I have to improve my work over time .
I cannot realize this task with only working in the same way .
Therefore , it is the best way to try something new .
For instance , I try to improve my skills with trying out some new programs for procucing a website .
Despite it takes much more time to work with a new programm it has also lots of advantages .
For example I am able to use different kinds of tools and perhaps I am able to do things which would not be possible for me with the normal program .

On the other hand , also some disadvantages has to be considered .
First of all , trying new kinds of working can also has some risks .
I am not able to know how long time my work will take .
Furthermore it is not possible to estimate if my work will be really effective .

In sum , it is a risk to try out new kinds of working .
Everyone who wants to be successful should do this not the whole time .
It is important to acquire lots of skills , but when you are doing this the whole time there is not enough time to work effective and to be successful with the results of your work .
