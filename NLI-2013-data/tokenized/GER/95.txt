Enjoying life .

In order to answer the question of who enjoys life more , younger or older people , I think it is vital to look at how each of these groups do actually enjoy life .

Very young kids seem to need very little to have a good time .
An empty paper box , and nice puppy , lot 's of mud or just a sunny day can be enough to make them totally happy and enjoy life .
They might not think about it , or be aware of it , but exactly this carefreeness allows them to make life so wonderfull for them .

This behaviour mostly continues into later stages of life , the teens , tweens and probably the thirties .
During this time people might still enjoy life , but being a lot more reflectory about it .
Some of them tend to worry too much .
It is a time when great difficutlies in life might have to be overcome , such as education , first love ( s ) and work .
I think a lot of external side effects influence the life enjoyment of a single person druing this time period .
Due to it still being in the first half of a normal life expectancy , I would count this life period to the `` young '' part .

The enjoyment of life in the second half of our life is based on two major factors .
One is again the external situation .
Have you found a job or life partner that fulfills you and makes you happy .
Have you maybe made enough of money to now be able to live a dream life that was not possible otherwise .
The second very important aspect during this time is the gained life experience .
Older people seem to have a more relaxed view of life .
They are not scared or worried as easily .
Especially very old people that have survived war and famines , great areas and disaster seem to be able to enjoy life with a lot less .
On the other hand there are those of course that have suffered great hardship by that time , and might even not have a bright future .
Enjoying life might not be somthing they think about at all .

Perosnally I agree with the statement .
I think full and complete enjoyment of life is probably most common and easily reached when we are very young .
Yet , when external circumstances are right , it is quite possible to have a very enjoyable life to the very end , even if there might be a few downs inbetween .
