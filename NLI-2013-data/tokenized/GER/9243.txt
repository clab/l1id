I agree with the statement saying that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
It is more interesting to understand concepts , because it will be a base you can use , modify or widen , whereas if you learn facts , you ca n't go further .

Let 's take examples .
To a student studying history it is very important to learn the facts , which is part of his knowledge .
On the other sid , if he understands the logical connexions between various historical events : what led to them , which are the consequences and how they got resolved ?
He will be more conscious of the subject , and thus will be able to explain it .
In architecture for example , it is important to know some facts , that are milestones in the history of architecture , but what is more convincing , is not the application of facts , but the accurance of you concept when you will present your project .

To me , there is a big difference between `` understanding '' and `` learning '' .
If you learn something , you are only a `` recipient '' that is able to contain and to restitute information .
You will not be able to talk about the subject , once you have quit the sphere of your knowledge .
Whereas if you understand a topic , you do not have a mental and intellectual limit anymore which are consequences of ignorance .
Nevertheless you can widen your knowledge and go beyond the limits once you have understood the ideas and concepts .

In my opinion , both of them are complementary .
You ca n't have a solid base if you do n't know facts , but in the same time , if you undestand ideas and concept , it will help you to learn facts .
But it I had to choose , I would rather understand concepts than being limited by what i have learned .
