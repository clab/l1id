Although many people believe that young people enjoy life more than older pepole do , I disagree with this statement .
In the following , I will give three arguments for having this opinion .

First of all , I want to mention that many older people are retired .
That means that they can organize their pastime as they like to .
They are able to do a lot of activities for which they probably did n't have enough time while working .
Usually , many older people spend their time travelling around the world , learning a new language or an instrument , or are just relaxing .
My grandmother , for instance , enjoys her life in the summers by going to a lake every day .
She loves to be in the nature , to watch the birds and to swim in the lake .

Another point is that many older people already made a lot of experiences in their life .
They will probably not have the feeling like younger people do that they could miss something in daily life .
They are surrounded by kind of a quiet mood and can totally concentrate on enjoying life .
Younger people , by contrast , always feel the pressure and stress that should become successful to be able to enjoy their life later on .
The pressure might be caused by the expectations of the educational system or by the comparison to the older people , often parents or grand-parents , who were already successful in the past .

Finally , older people are often happy abouth small things in life .
They often do n't need a lot of material comfort .
They rather appreciate that they can still walk around , that they are of good health or that they have a family they can talk to .
My grand-parents , for example , do n't have a car .
Thus , they do n't have to worry about higher gas prices .

In conclusion , I want to stress that older people are definitely able to enjoy life the same as younger people do .
They just do it in another way which might be hard for younger people to accept .
