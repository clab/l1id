Sticking to ideas and performing the same tasks over and over again give you the possibility to become more and more elaborate or professional in this task .
Typically , people are getting faster , the more often they do the same job .
If you do the things everbody can do , you have to become better than the rest in order to maintein .
Therefore , doing things you already know means to become more professionel on a specific task .

This `` professionalization '' comes at a risk .
If your environment is changing , a spcialsit may find it difficult to change .
He has heavily invested in his efficiency in one task and will find it difficult to succeed in a new and unknown field .

However , the real opportunities lie in thinking outside the box and doing things in a different and new way even if they may appear simple .
This may open up new areas for growth and development .
You do not have to be the best or most efficient in accomplishing a spedfic task , rather you have to be first to spot an opportunity .

But doing things differently may not be enough .
At the same time you have to be the first to do something .
Once an option is spotted the process of `` professionalization '' starts again .
And a lot of peaple try to do exactly the same .

Thus , it is important not only to spot an opportunity at a given time but also to be constantly able to look for new opportunities .
