In our world are a lot of products and every day more products are created .
They are very big differences between them .
In my opinion most products could be been better as they are and the advertisments show us .

There are a lot of products , which are really good , like different kinds of water .
On the other hand , there are a lot of products , which could be been better like jeans .
I think that in the past the jeans had a better quality then now .
For this there are some reasons .
My first reason is that people buy cheaper jeans in lower quality and the big firms like Lewis had to get also cheaper prices , but on the other hand I think that the new designs had change the quality .
There we can see the problem of the advertisments .
They show us , the need of a new style , but they do not speak about lower quality .
It decrease of cause of chemicals , which are need for the producing .
An example are jeans in white color , because they were produced in blue and then the color is destroid .

An other example is perhaps that advertisments always have the best shower gel .
I think that it was good for a log time , but every new product is a lot of better then the one before .
I can not belive that it is possible to create every few month an other one , which is better than the one before .
Furthermore they show us thinks , which make the product better , but it was always insite .

I think that most products are good , but not so good , as advertisments show us .
On the other site it is there job to show us that we have to spend money for new thinks .
Normally that is a good way , because the firms have to spend money for there research and research is a very fundamental thing in our world .
