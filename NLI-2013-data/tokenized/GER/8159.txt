In my personal opinion it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because in a modern world where access to a large amount of information about nearly every subject , problem , or iussue is quite easy to obtain via the internet it should be the main intention of every learning process to gain the skills necessary to deal with this mass of available information rather than simply collect it .

First off all , no one nowadays will be able gather all the knowledge of the world .
The attempt alone seems to be stupid .
However , in order to deal with all this knowledge and opportunities a student have to develop the ability to select information , to destract the main ideas of a source , and to handle all the useless information .

Secondly , one might say that it is easy only to focus on ideas and concepts while leaving out the effort to gain all the information provided related to a certain theory or source .
This might be true , but the striking point is that only the concept of a theory can be used again on the next source by the student .

Thirdly , a student is not capable of endless learning .
When sombody only stores the facts rather than he focuses on the concepts and ideas behind a theory or a source , than the space for other inofmation is filled with all his knowledge about only this source .

Learning is a process .
You can stop it by obtaining masses of useless information .
To summarize , the first aim for a student should be to learn about the methods , ideas and concepts which enable him to deal with all kind of problems , sources , and theory which may occur in his future c
