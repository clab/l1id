In my opinion young people do not support their communities as much as they should .

I have several resons for this opinion .
Young people today are very much caring about their own free time and the activities they do .
They do not see the community that is around them but only their own benefit .

For example , a lot of young boys use skating rinks to skateboard , however very few of them actually helped building the sites so that the kids of the community can enjoy the rinks .

Reason number two is rather obvious as well .
Doing volunteer work that is an unpayed job and at the first glance boring to do , is not very attractive to young people .
They fail to see the bigger picture and are often not encouraged by parents of other respected persons to help and give some of their time .

I think that it is this lack of encouragement that causes such a low rate in volunteering activities of young people .
At the same time I am assuming that young people also do n't see or get any incentives by engaging in the community .

This problem can be solved by creating special programmes that will spark the interest of young people .
They need to be designed towards the needs and abilities of the youngsters in oder to fully work out .

The creativity of the youth needs to be addressed in possible projects or incentives .
If they can get an opportunity to present their talent , say they like to spray gaffity and get the opportunity to spray a wall legally as a trade off for helping out at a nursing home , I think they are much more likely to consider helping out in the community than they would without this incentive .

In my opinion young people would help more than they are doing now , if the job assigned and the incentives given are more suitable to their needs today .
The problems and ideas I have stated could be a start .
