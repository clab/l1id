Now I want to discuss the theory that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .

First of all I want to define the expression `` enjoying one 's life '' .
All people have got different interests and hobbies .
All people have other needs to be happy .
So it differs from person to person , whether he or she is happy with a certain situation or not .

I want to give an example .
Jimmy and Kelly are on a lonely island and there is nothing else than a football .
Jimmy might enjoy his life because he would have nothing else to do than to improve his soccer skills .
But Kelly on the other hand would be bored and wished to get home as soon as possible .

So one and the same situation does n't create the same mood within different people .
Once a boy 's needs are fulfilled it does n't mean that a girl would be happy as well .
It depends on what each person likes to do .
Of course younger people have the opportunity to go swimming or to go to disco on weekends .
But maybe - when they are old - they do n't want to go to disco anymore .
They might be satisfied by just lying on the couch and watching TV .
This might sound a little bit ridiculous , but I think older people have been working for so many years that they are glad if they are able to relax and just lay down for a while .

In contrast to that any young person would say that this kind of life is boring .
There we see the difference between the needs a pupil has and the needs a grandmother has .

So we ca n't say that young people enjoy life more than older people do in general .
Everyone has to decide on his or her own what he or she would like to do and in addition to that has to take into consideration that he or she might not be able to do so .
So enjoying one 's life does n't only depend on one 's age but also on one 's circumstances .
