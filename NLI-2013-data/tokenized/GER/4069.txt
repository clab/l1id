I strongly disagree with this statement , as i do not see why it would be correct .
It contains no arguements to support its claim .

Young people do give enough time to helping their communities nowadays , as they always have .
I do not see the reason for elders to belive in this statement , or to view our youth in a critical manner .
Yes , the youth might be somewhat different than the generation of people they grew up in , but it does not need to be different in a negative way .
Their criticism merely demonstrates their inability to take responsibility or to adapt to recent events , which would bring about a difference in mentality in the next generation .

Most probably people making such a statement are not satisfied with their own contribution to their communities and will try to ease their mind by making such a claim .
Often pensioneers who have nothing better to do , i.e. make no contribution to their communities , make such a claim .
This statement is in no ways a constructive statement , as it gives no suggestion of changing the circumstancers .
Therefore the person putting forth this statement is not helping his community in doing so .

This statement is so broad , that it is hard for me to think of any specific examples out of my head , but in general , the young people are the people which drive a community and contribute to its culture by their motivation .

This claim is nonsense .
It has no arguements to support it and is terribly broad .
The people who are supporting the community and who are to a large extent the community , by being active , are to a very large extent young people .
This statement is often the result of an elder , not being able to adapt to recent changes in the world , and therefore not being able to understand the youth .
