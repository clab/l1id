Nowadays young people give not enough time to helping their communities .
But there are several points to consider before judging them .

Firstly the expectations to the young people are high .
School requires a lot of learning and working on homework .
The same tasks are maintained at the University level .
That means that `` work '' not always ends in regular time patterns and its hard to reserve a certain time of the week for community work .
Also they might participate in several additional courses of the university , like sports , choir or art projects , which is also a time-intensive hobby .
And therefore , are they not helping a community with these hobbies - they are helping the university community .

Furthermore it is important to register , that many young people do not life in one community and are asking themselves what is `` their '' community .
For examples students might spend a lot of time in university and at home .
In the most cases this are two different communities .
Therefore they can not identify enough with either community and it is hard to convice somebody to sacrifice a lot of otherwise free time to something that he does not consider himself part of or responsible for .

Another aspect is that nowadays maturity and the developement into an adult takes more time .
Many young people still play a lot of computer games and have rather childish hobbies at an age , in which they would be expect to have a work an be more independent from their parents .
And the sozial attitude to help others is rather found in adults

Finally there is the point about family .
The family is also an community and it should be the most important one .
The most young people marry at the age of twenty-six or even older .
So can you expect somebody who is still busy settling his most important , personal community right accuse for spending too less time for others communities ?

So in the end , on first sight many young people may not enough or even no community work .
But if one considers the circumstances of our lifestyle and the expectations of the modern , many young people do enough for their communities despite all their other challenges .
