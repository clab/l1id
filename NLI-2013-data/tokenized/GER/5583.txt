I agree with the statement that the most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

In our days the companies have a lot of possibilities to show the customers all the benefits of their products .
The can make advertisement in TV , radio , in the newspapers , in the internet , etc .
Every potential customer , that actually means every person is confronted with a variety of advertisement every day .

But not only the place where an advertisement is made is important .
Also the kind of advertisement .
That means that there are a lot of visual and auditional possibilities to provide a companys ' product .
For example they can use a lot of colours and voices to create new wishes or dreams for the customer .

And most of the time the companies only show us the benefits of their products .
They do n't explain us the negative aspects or some possible problems we could get with the product .

With all the possibilities of marketing the companies have , it 's nearly impossible for the customer to see how good or bad a product really is .
Until he really buys and uses it .
This seems to be thew main problem .
The customer is not able to control what the advertisement promisses without buying the product .

Especially the internet offeres a lot of people to provide bad products .
There 're so many possibilities to sell damaged or just bad products and nobody can do something against it .

Thus , it is very good that in Germany there are some institutes like `` Stiftung Warentest '' who tests and controlls every month a few kind of different products and recommends the best of them .
Because of that a customer can usually be sure that a product is good or not so good .
