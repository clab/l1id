Most advertisements actually do make a product seem better then it actually is when it is bought and in use .
The question we have to ask is not if this is a positive or negative fact but why do companies do such things .

In todays mostly capitalistic economies with a free market one has a wide range of offers in each segment of the market .
It does not matter if someone is looking just for a bottle of shower-gel or a new TV , the customer has many products to choose from .
An interesting fact in this matter is that with an advancing socity the product-life-span is getting smaller and smaller .
This fact makes strong advertisements necessary to be successful on a market .
Furthermore more we have to think about the way we are thinking as a customer .
We all know the situation where we go out to buy our normal supplies of food and toiletries .
We are standing in front of that huge shelf of shower-gels and are not able to decide which of the hundred choices we are suppose to buy .
Each of them offer us the best skin or the smoothest hair after using them .
We tend though to be buy a product we are most familiar with .
There two way we are getting familiar with a product .
the far most common way of becoming familiar with a product is to use it , if we are satisfied with it , in our example it is the fictional shower-gel `` AWE '' .
We have been using AWE now for month already and got used to buying it at the store with out contemplating in front of the shelf .
Now the second waz of getting familiar with a product is coming into play .
The only way we might leave our satisfying product AWE is if we get familiar with another product , and this is where advatising is coming handy for companies .
While we see ads on billbords and in TV we are getting familiar with it and to go and buy the product we have to think that is better then AWE , so adversiements make us think it is better , so we buy it .

I agree with this custom to an extend .
