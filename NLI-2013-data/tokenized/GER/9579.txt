In my view , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Being successful means standing out of the crowd , which also means doing something different than most of the people .
Many of us like to keep doing something the same way they always have , for example a doctor always gives the same medication because it works and it has been proven safe for the patient .
In contrast a successful doctor might try a new combination of medications to treat a patient .
There 's the risk that this new combination simply does n't work , or worse , that it makes complications and therefore puts a life at risk .
But it could also cure the patient , which the old medication would n't have .
And the doctor would be successful .
There are numerous examples like that in medicine .

Another example is an example of early history .
First people were hunting and collecting food such as plants , then someone must have had the idea to try and cultivate the plants as well and to have domestic animals .
Maby they had problems first , but it worked .
Population size increased because of the better food supplies and people did n't have to move around like they had to , when looking for new hunting grounds .
People who tried that first successfully had an advantage over the hunting people , who were dependent on a good hunt .

Another example are inventions like trains .
Of course , technical improvements were a key factor .
People already had means of transportation like horses , but some people wanted to try something new in order to reach another place in a faster way .
So they invented the train .
At the start most people were afraid , they belived that the great velocity would make them ill .
But after a while they got used to it and trains and those who built them got successful .
Could you imagine our world without trains ?
I ca n't and I 'm happy that some people like to try new things and take risks , otherwise our world would stand still .

In conclusion these examples show that taking risk is a major point of being successful , without taking risks and trying new things everyone would be mediocre and no progression would be made whatsoever .
