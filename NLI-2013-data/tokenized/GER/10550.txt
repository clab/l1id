Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
I can only support this statement , because one will never be more successfull than others , if one does not try out new thinks .
And for trying out something new one has to take the risk to fail , or to get hurt .

This implies the fact , that successful people have to be very confident .
Confidence means in this case to be able to keep your head up and go on , eventhough something did not work .
Because this is what happes all the time when you risk something , sometimes it might work , sometimes you will fail .

Of course being successful does not only mean having a big job career , one can be successful in sports , school , family , organizing life ect .
But in everything you want to succeed you have to be open for new things .
If you always walk the same path like the others you will never step out off the mass .
But walking new paths asks for alot of courage , which people can get when they get older and more experienced .
So finaly I want to say everybody has the chance to be successful , they just have to be willing to take the risk .
