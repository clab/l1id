I disagree with statement .
In my opinion the best way to travel is alone or in a small group of people that have approximately the same degree of knowledge of the region .

There are several reasons for my belief .
First of all , a tour guide will protect the traveller from most interaction with and exposure to the local inhabitants by organising transportation , accomodation , food etc .
This is , of course , convenient and efficient but it often means that the traveller will not use the local language nor will he encounter local customs of communication and everyday life .
Thus , he misses out on many new experiences and cultural insights .
For example , when a friend and I were travelling in Turkey on our own , we had to learn a couple of Turkish phrases in order to communicate with local peasants , and the priceless reward was that we were invited to stay with the family for a couple of days and experience how life in rural Turkey really is like .
This would not happen when travelling with a tour guide , using prearranged facilities and no need to talk to the local people .

Second , a tour guide will have specific ideas on what to show and what to hide of a country .
The traveller will only see what is esteemed a cultural highlight , or entertaining , and he will follow the footsteps of many tourists before him .
If he travels on his own , he has the chance to leave the usual path and discover the new environment on his own .
He is likely to encounter nice as well as unpleasant things but his picture of the local culture will be more balanced and more complete .

Similarly , travelling without a guide might be less effective in terms of `` visited sights/day '' but it will be a more thorough and individual experience .
When travelling with a guide one faces the danger of falling into a passive , consuming position where prepared pieces of information are delivered .

In summary , travelling alone means active involvement , challenge and individual experience as opposed to the convenience and superficial screening of tourist attractions provided by most guided tours .
It depends on the preference of the traveller which form of exploring a new region he chooses but I believe that without a guide the experience is much richer .
