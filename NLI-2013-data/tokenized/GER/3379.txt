Do n't young people care anymore ?
Have they lost all sense of responsability for their communities ?
In recent years it has been often discussed whether or not young people still give enough time to helping their communities .
As I cannot clearly agree or disagree with the given statement , I will , in the following essay , present arguments for both sides before I draw a conclusion that is partly based on my personal experiences .

Unfortunately , it is a given fact that young people are less and less involved in their communities : When it comes to local elections it is usually the young people who cannot be bothered to vote ; when it comes to helping out at social institutions , young people are hardly seen ; and on Sunday mornings usually only elderly people sit down at the local church benches .

At first glance it seems like young people are more interested in shopping , playing video games and partying instead of giving some time to their communities .
Partly , this might be true , but it is definitely not true for all young people .
In my personal opinion the young people often are not properly given the chance to play an active and effective role in the society they live in .
During my internships at local schools , for example , I would often hear the young students make remarks like the followings : `` Nobody cares about what I do , everybody thinks that I am a failure. '' , `` Nobody is interested in my opinion , I am not capable of changing anything anyways. '' , `` Why should I care about others , I need to care for myself first . ''
.
The reasons for these and similar statements probably are very diverse , for example one reason might be the lacking support and understanding of the parents .
If parents fail in teaching their children what it means to be social , it is more likely to meet a young one that does n't care for anybody else but himself .
It therefore seems to me that the community and especially the educational system has to make major efforts to prevent such a shortcoming in social skills .
Communities , for example , should make it easier for young people to get involved instead of complaining that young people are n't interested anymore .
For example , the local animal shelter could go to the schools and let the students know that they are in need for people to come walk the dogs , clean the cages , and so on .
They should also point out that they need very responsable and honorable students to do the job and encourage the students to give it a try .

Likewise , other institutuions should ask for help , also .
For example , I could imagine that places for retired and sick people would have a great need of young people to spend time with the elderly ones and , in my opinion , the institutions should point out how beneficial such a relationship could be for both parties .

Also , the community should offer activities for teenagers and young adults , for example regular meetings where they can get together and perform multiple sorts of activities that train intercultural and social competence .

I truly believe that , if young people are encouraged , they will gladly devote time to their communities and , thus , one should n't complain about the young ones , but support them a little better .
