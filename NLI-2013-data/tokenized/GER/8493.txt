I agree with this Statement .

In my opinion only learning facts will help you to pass an test , and maybe get a good result , but for your later life you | ll not be able to understand relations or processes which are necesary in many fields .

But for areas of knowledge which are not needed in my further life , learning facts and finishing a test is OK , in all other cases you have to know | how it works | .

For example if you | re studying for a technically Grade you | ll have to understand , why physical laws are working and how .
It doesn | t make sense to know the facts , If you | re not familar with the basic understanding you | ll not be able to create new electronic circuits or work in the field of research & development .

Also in mathematics if you not able to understand | phytagoras | ...
or differential-Calculations it makes no sense to goon for deeper knowledge in this fields .
Furthermore there will be no test , which you | ll pass without presenting that you familiar with this things .

Also in my life I experienced , that if I will get a detailed knowledge in some areas I have to understand the simple and basic concepts , without this understanding it | s not possible to go on .
