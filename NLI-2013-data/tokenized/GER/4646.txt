In our modern time of new ways of communication via television or internet it is not difficult to make a product seem much better through advertisements than it really is .

Lets take for example a pencil which is praised to be of very high qualitiy at tele-shopping , of course for a low price .
The costumer will pick up the telephone and order this lovely pencil .
Two weeks later he got the small packet with the little pencil in it and he ca n't wate to open it .
Still he thinks he made a good deal with what he bought on TV , very practical and easy buying .
But what happens in the end ?
The colour of the pencil is blue instead of black as it was shown on TV .
The writing is not that lovely as it was described in the advertisment .
What now ?
Big disappointment .

As we see in this little example the new medias have the power to manipulate the costumer in a way he does not even take note of it .

The composion of the light in which the product is recorded , or the frame in which it is showed can make it seem bigger , smaller , nicer etc .
For the costumer it is hard to imagine how the product looks like in reality .
This kind of manipulation bz making things appear better than thez really are is a profession for itself , in that way one can imagine how effective these tools must be .

Conclusona ; in may opinion in many cases the original product is very different in aspect and quality so that one has to be carefull with too fast decisions about buying a product .

It is always better to put down the glasses of advertisments and look with zour own eyes
