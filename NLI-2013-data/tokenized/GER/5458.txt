In today 's society it is nearly impossible to hide from any kind of advertisements .
Not only TV and radio are full of advertisements , but also the underground tube , the newspaper , the walls of buildings and almost every internet side .

This makes people buy things that do not need .
If they see this wounderful and extraordinary new cheese on the colourful magazine page they cannot resist .
But is the cheese as good as they think ?
Normally not .

Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
That is why it has become a rentable buisiness .
There are not a lot of good products on the market , but everyone wants to sell his products equally if it is good or bad .
So if you produce a cheese and it is the same cheese as everybody knows it over years , but the people do not buy it anymore , then you need a new advertisement .
Most of the products are either new , nor good .
What sells them is the idea of the advertisment .

Another point is the customers behavior and his shopping habits .
In a regularly supermarket the customer may choose between several products .
If he wants to buy bread he has almost twenty breads in front of him .
Now there are two kinds of customers .
First the ones who relate on what they knew - they will always buy the same bread .
Second the people who have no idea of what to take .
They will have a closer look on the different products and in the end choose the bread with less fat or whatever attracted them .
In this case advertising helps to take decisions .
But is the bread better , because it is said so ?
Nobody knows .

To come to a conclusion it can be said that maybe a really good product needs no advertisement and that is how you can find it .
But in the modern society it will be difficult to sell something without any advertisement at all .
The people are used to it and maybe they even want to belive in what it is said on the colourful magazine page .
