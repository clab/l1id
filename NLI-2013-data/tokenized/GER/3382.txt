The given statement sounds to me as it implements that young people have better things do than to spend time with their communities .
In general I agree with the given statement .
As far as I know it was more common to help in the community a century ago .
The society structure those days was different then today .
Not only that the number of inhabitants rised with the time and we have much bigger communities today , also people mostly live in big cities now and not in small communities like then .
At the same time the structure of the communities changed .

Nowadays the work which was done in a community many years ago is done by other institutions now .
The state is much more responsible in welfare-questions or questions concearning social security in recent years .

When communities were smaller , people helped themselves out in times when someone was sick , or needed help because he or she was old or could not work anymore .

Today , I think , people and especially young people are very concerned about their own life .
Time is rare , at least for people that have a job and \ or a family .
They need their time to manage their hoseholds .
But if they have the slightest bit of time that they can determine by themselves , I am sure they use it for their own amusement , for cultur , fun , sports or just to spend the time with their friends and family .

I do n't know anyone out of my group of friends who is somehow involved with community-work .
Neighther am I. The reason for this is for sure the change in society and also in social values .
The interrests changed as well .
One reason people are less interrested in politics , social life or in their own communities might be the increasing anonymity in society .
So many people live on a very small area and do n't know each other .
No wonder that they do not even care for each other anymore .
