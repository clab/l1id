In my opinion , it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .

The first point of my argumentation is that you often do not know which subjects or topics you mainly prefer when you are interessted in many things .
When you want get a broad knowledge you do n't have to chose early in which kind of direction you later get a job .

Another point to support my opinion is , that when you later get a job you can work more flexible with the knowledge in more subjects .
So , you can work not only in one part of a company .
For example , when you are only studying economy you get probably a job in the bureau .
But when you are studying english or any other foreign languages addictionally to economy , you probably work as a salesman or get a job in other countries too and not only in germany .

And if your company needs specialists for some kinds of projects they are going to start , you can get less difficultly this knowledge by going to evening schools or something like that .
It 's more difficult to expand your knowledge when you are specialized only in one subject .
So you are not able to work in this project , because you need too much time to get more knowledge about a foreign subject .

The most important reason why a broad knowledge is more important than to specialize in one subject is , that you more easily secure your job .
When the company has to leave one complete part of the company and you probably are in it , you have no more chance to work for this company in the future .
But with more qualifications you can still work in another section of your old company .
