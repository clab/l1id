The question is if it is important for students to understand ideas aand concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
For many classes or subject it is necessary to combine both that means learning facts and to understand ideads or models .
According to a study many students prefer to understand the idea of the theory , because this is more useful in an exam .

I think everybody have to understand an idea or concept because you cannot write a good mark if you always learn some facts .
Most you must conclude to give an good response and not only list some facts .
Therefore it is very important to understand the topic or theme really .
For instance , a student who studies mathematics he has to understand the algorithmus which is used to calculate something .
For him is it not important to list only some facts , he has to think logical .

Otherwise in some classes it necessary to learn facts for a testpaper .
If you do not learn this you would not pass the exam .
I think only learning facts is not very important for your future .
Everybodey need it to collect life experience and therefore you have to understand what you are doing .
When a student get started with work or a job many companies prefer such students who have a good general education and not only knowledge in their studies .
Mabe Ssudents who learn only facts will forget it after a short time , but somebody who has it really understand will do not forget after the exam .

Additionally it is important to be satisfied with that what you .
Some students are not interessting in learning facts .
Everybody has its own method to learning or understanding something .
A student of medicine has to learn more facts than a student of electronics .

Sometime it depends from the subject .
For the last one it is very important to understand the function of condensator or transistor , but he can experiments in a lab and maybe understand the function of it .

In conclusion , it is very important to combine both methods of preparing for a test .
Some facts a student have to learn but on the otherside he must understand what he is doing in the exam .
In a job everbody train new concepts or maybe he can remember on that what he has leraned during his studies .
