Young people nowadays tend to be less helpful to the community .
I think there is quite a variety of reasons for that phenomen .
Firstly , time nowadays is quite rare .
There is a wide range of persons and institutions that require our time .
From child to adult people have to do a lot of education and gain some practical experience .
At the beginning of a lifetime parents and teachers want us to learn .
Some years later job is requiring additional education .
It seems as if education is always a main topic in a life .
Nowadays things are getting faster and more is being expected .
This prevents young people from investing time in projects that limit their own educational and spare time .

Secondly , especially in cities live a lot of people .
For inhabitants of cities it is not possible to know all or just a large part of them .
But before people deside to help someone , they often want to know at least some details about who is going to have an advantage .
As long as you do not know who is going to have an advantage , you need a lot more of encouragement .
I made that experience as well when I was learning for my exam .
I choose a quite room in Zurich to study .
But I had to find out that a lot of people just do not care about others .
Their first aim was to get their problem solved , which required a talk to other people .

Furthermore , society nowadays does not really expect us to help community and therefore does not honor it if we do so .
Finally , it can be said that a lot of people - as long as they do not get an immediate return on their help - are not ready for providing assistance in any form .
