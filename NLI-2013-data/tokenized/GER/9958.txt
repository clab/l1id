Power , money and reputation are very desirable things , and if you are successful in your job , you probably have them all .
Due to that , success plays an important role in our life .

The question arises , how to be successful .
You could try new things and take a risk , or you could focus on what you already know how to do well .
In my opinion , you can be successful with both strategies .
On the one hand there are lots of companies which improved an already existing successful product .
For instance apple .
They choose the normal mp3 player and improved the storage capacity , the handling , the design and named it iPod .
Due to the improvements and a huge marketing campaign , they sold an incredibly high number of iPods all over the world .
The success of this product was outrageous !

On the other hand , remember the foundation story of the apple company - an almost perfect example for creating a new market .
With the computer for common households , they invented a completly new product and took a high risk .
As we all know , the product was accepted by the market and had an enormous impact on the society .

There are numerous other examples for both strategies and therefore I disagree with the statement that people who try new things are more successful than people who do what they already know to do well .
Because of the high risk , I would rather tend to focus on things which I do well , and where I know very well how to operate .
