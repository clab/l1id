I have to admit that concepts and ideas are often neglected next to all the facts that students have to learn .
History lessons are a good example .
If you know all the dates , names and places that does not mean that you have understood the complex interaction of causes , consequences and motivations .
Sometimes it is not even necessary to know exactly on which day or where something happend .
Important is THAT it happened .
What led to it and its impact on the future may be of much greater interest than its exact date .
Is it not much more important what Einstein discovered than knowing on what day he was born ?
Is it not more important to know that his invention led to the nuclear bomb than to know the place where he was born ?

Of course , without facts nothing works .
You could not teach history without dates , names and places .
You could not explain any concept or idea without the facts that it bases on .
Facts are the foundation to any thinking beyond .
You can only understand why Einstein gave his idea to the americans if you know the fact that he was a jew .

That is why I think that there should be a balance between facts and more .
Students should get those facts that are necessary to understand the concept .
In my eyes they are both equally important .
One without the other is nothing .
If you know all the elements of a computer you still cannot put them together correctly .
If you possess the instruction but do not have all the elements it does not work either .
And even if you have both it is not easy .
But if someone explains it to you you might succeed .
This is what teachers should do .
They should give students the facts , some material about how to understand them and explain the big connections .

I do not think that ideas and concepts are more important than facts , each is important in its own way .
Ideas and concepts are based on facts .
Students should learn both to be prepared for life .
