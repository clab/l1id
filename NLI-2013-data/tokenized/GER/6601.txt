Scientist often make predictions about future changes in society , especially when it comes to technical innovations .
Indeed , it is imaginable that in future years , people use fewer cars than nowadays .
However , I would not fully agree with the statement .

On the one hand , it is true that the public transportion system gets better .
Especially in highly populated areas such as huge cities , the public transport becomes better integrated into the town 's scape , just think of Berlin , Hamburg , London or Paris .
There , it is more comfortable and much faster to take the bus or the underground .

Another development speaking for fewer cars are sinking travel costs .
Over the last years , it became much cheaper to travel by train or plane .
Companies like Ryanair or Vogtlandexpress , a competiting train brand , offer very good travel , even within Germany .
So that it could be a logical consequence that car transport will be used fewer .

On the other hand , do both theories work for areas of high population .
If I think my home town , the public transport system is nearly underdeveloped compared to Berlin .
Since the main part of Germany or other industrialised countries does not live in the huge cities , people will need cars to get from their home to the working place .
I think , that I will not change within the next twenty years , so that in average of the whole country , the car use will not decrease much .
