There are lots of factors which would influence that statement but I think that there will not be fewer cars in use in twenty years than today .

On the one hand , oil prices are getting higher and higher because the resources of petroleum are very limited and so the car as we know it today will be too expensive to afford in twenty years .
The problem is that the resources are limited and getting more and more difficult to reach .
We need to dig for oil in regions no ones ever lived before for example in Alaska or on the ground of the ocean .

The other thing is that the pollution by cars is very dangerous for our environement , the ozone layer is getting thinner , we have global warming and for a big part of this the pollution by cars is responsible .
This has to stop .

On the other hand there is a scientific progress on running cars on water or hybrid cars which need less gas than the old fashioned cars .
They use the energy wasted at breaking to load a battery .
So maybe we do not need any more or much less oil in the future to run a car .
The pollution by cars would decrease too .
If they were running on water the only pollution would be water which is not dangerous at all .

We also do not have any real replacing public transportation system at the moment and probably will not have in the near future .
The busses and trains are a possible alternative in the big cities but in the rural areas there is no such thing like trains running every ten minutes , one has to wait approximatly two hours or more to get a train or bus and the busses are traveling much slower than the cars .
In a time where time is money , most of the people need to get as fast as possible from one point to another .

So as the population of mankind increases steadily there will be more cars in the future , hopefully cleaner and more secure ones .
