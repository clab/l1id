I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
First , the goal of the advertising company is to increase sales of a particular product or service .
In order to achieve this goal , buyers need to be convinced that the advertised product not only solves a particular need but that it also is better than comparable products in the market .

There are a variety of tactics to create the impression of product superiority , including highlighting only select features and providing social proof .
Social proof , for example , is an especially `` sneaky '' tactic to create product superiority by showing a celebrity or well-known organization endorsing the product .
These marketing tactics can leave the impression of superiority that , upon closer examination of the product , often does not hold up to reality .

One of the key problems is that there is no incentive or requirement for advertisers to mention any known weaknesses the product may have .
Frequent recalls issued by automotive companies , for example , are proof of the fact that the shiny new car that looked so impressive on TV may actually have some life threatening flaws .

Many ads also do n't show crucial information or present information in a way that makes it hard to understand the true quality of a product or service .
For example , a homebuyer looking for an affordable mortgage is presented with a wide array of mortgage products in the market , ranging from fixed rate mortgages to products with fluctuating rates .
If the buyer comes across an advertised mortgage product that claims to offer an unbelievably low interest rate , he or she will probably be impressed by the value of this particular mortgage , perceiving the product as superior .
Mortgage companies , however , are not required to fully disclose the details of their products in ads , often omitting important information or showing information in fine print that is hard to read .
Upon closer examination of such an unbelievable mortgage offer , the customer can find out that the advertised 1 % rate is a promotional rate only , scheduled to be replaced by a much higher interest rate with in one month of purchase .
Often , customers do n't have access to this information or are overwhelmed by the complexity of the product .

In summary , many advertisements are designed to mislead customers to some extent .
Advertising information can be entertaining and informative , but it should be read carefully and with a healthy dose of skepticism .
