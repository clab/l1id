That is a difficult question because i think it belongs to different communities .
In some regions i would agree with that statement because there are political problems that helps to let the problem grow .
There you find children who grow up without a father or a mother and no one who cares about the young child .
I understand that these children have no interest to help their communities when they are older because no one helped them .
Otherwise it could be that especially that people search in communities for help and if they find some they are pleased to help the community if the help is needed .
Furthermore often you find good conditions in wealthy regions .
Why ?
I think they have not that problems like people who have to work hard for every little thing .
These people live through the day without thinking how they survive tomorrow .
In my eyes young peolpe spent a lot of time to help there community .
Please do not missunderstand me .
But i think if people have not that all day problems , they are able to spent more time in helping there community of course .
Furthermore there is an other problem .
The television shows how the young people have to live today .
An there you see often that the children or young people work alone or spent more time with other thinks as to help their communities .
On one hand our community wants that we are succesfull in what we make and often that is only possible if we do that alone and if we spent a lot of time for that but on the other hand the community sais that we have to spent our time for them .
i think that is not possible .
Each person has to think about what for him is importent an where he wants to focus on .
If both directions are equal you have the best way to success in that community .
Conclutioned i want to say that every person has to find his own way and especially the young people because they grow into that community with their choice .
