Women and cars are the two mayor topics a man is concerned about .
This will not change until there is no more man .
When I take a look at my friends , everybody owns a car .
You turn to 16 .
What 's your wish .
You want to have an own car .
During the last 50 years a car has became the number one status symbol .
Having a car is also a symbol of freedom .
Driving through an avenue on a sunny day makes you feel good and confident .

I have to admit that our thoughts about the environment became less and less .
What about the air pollution and the fossil energy supply ?
These thoughts are moving in the background .
I 'm convinced that the arabic countries still have enough oil supply for the next 100 years .
Thus , our attitude towards car will not change rapidly in the next 20 years .
The gasoline price will not reach the two dollar border .
Everybody will still not refrain from driving and buying a car .

Moreover the car industry is still growing .
New cars are introduced every year .
For example , the Mercedes ML , which needs more than 20 litres pro 100 kilometres .
Another sign that the oil supply is still huge .

You also have to consider that cars which drive with solar energy or a battery are still cars .
They all will be count the number of cars which will not decline the next - at least - 20 years .
