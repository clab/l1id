I do n't think youg people enjoy their life more than older ones , although most of them think so .
I like to give short examples why young peoples think in this directions and than show it from the opposite side of the elders :

Most of the young people think they are enjoying their live more than older ones because there are so many new experiences they are making when they are young , for example finding a girlfriend .
They are talking all the time about how happy they are .
But after a while they search for a new girlfriend maybe because the `` old one '' was n't exactly what they expected of the `` true love '' .
Older people instead of this already have the experience what they want or what they are searching for in life , so , when they finally find the right partner they stick together and stay together happier and longer then young people , because they know , that they wo n't have their whole life again to cherrish it with the person they love .
And they do n't talk about how happy they are all the time , they just enjoy it more silently .

Secondly young people say , that they could n't imagine a life without a computer or the television .
For them , these things make live more enjoyable .
They do n't understand how old persons could be happy without using these things .
But older persons grew up without knowing things like that , so they never made the experience of TV or cumputers .
They had other things to pass their freetime with .
They played outside or read a book .
And because they did n't know these things they were not unhappy by not having these things .

So , i think it is definetly not true that younger persons have more fun in life or that they enjoy it more than older ones .
Both of them enjoy their lives but in different ways .

But , I , for myself have got to say , that i definetly do n't want to live in another century or that i want to change my age .
