Nowadays , pre-scholars to Ph .
D candidates are confornted with ever more challenging learning requirements .
Therefore we should take the need of knowing facts into consideration .
I strongly feel that it is more essential that scholars learn how to comprehend ideas and concepts than to merely know facts and data , because students have to apply them and knowledge has lost its importance due to widely reachable information ressources .

Firts , students recieve a better , more adequate preparion for college or employment , when they learn about theories , ideas or concepts .
The reason for this is that during studies or post-university work they have to apply what they have learned earlier .
In the engeneering industry , for example , workers apply the concepts developed by researchers .
It would be unthinkable that it is possible to build something complex like a space shuttle , or a more trivial , without konwing the theory of expanding matter in heat .

Furthermore , in our internet-depending community most information has become easily accessible .
Thus , the key qulification of an employee has changed from konwing facts to understanding and applying them , in other words being familiar with concepts .
Imagine you have two decide between two different applicants with various qualifications .
Surely , you would prefer the applicant , whose knowledge about concepts and abilitu to actually apply them is more effective , over the one who is just familiar with data and facts , but find abstract methods abstrusve and fails to apply them , when you in turn can look up most of the infromation yourself .

Though being convenient with ideas and able to use this knowledge brings more opportunities than just knowing details , learning facts is , nevertheless , still impotant to support the understanding of abstarct methods by exemplifying them .
Thus , children should be teached the facts in order to comprehend them via interprataion .
