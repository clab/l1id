Before I come to the statement it seems to be necessary to define success , which often means financial success .
But there is more to success to it than wealth and power .
A person can be successful , when he or she specializes in a field and excelerates in it .
Then the success is measured in new discoveries , new patents , technologies , in the personal development and achievement .

It seems also important to relate to the requirements of success .
To be successful , one has to obtain and se knowledge .
Then he or she must be able to understand what is known , and to differentiate between information which is more and less important in order to succeed .
Another requirement is the ability to realize what you dream of or what you want to achieve .
One needs management skills , a personal drive which is strong enough to overcome obstacles , delays and disappointments .
It needs a determined nature , and strong ( self - ) motivation .
Furthermore often financial ressources are required to stay on the treck .

As I see it , the statement above is too simplistic .
It is not enough to try out something new and take risks .
So many who act this way , fail .
Why ?
What could be underlying reasons ?
The question which come up for me is rather : What do successful people have , that makes them successful , in opposite to their fellow human beings , who fail in their endeavors ?

I believe , that in order to be successful , you first have to know what you want .
In which field do you want to excel ?
Where do you want to specialize ?
First you need a clear picture , what you want to achieve .
As soon as you know what you want , you can make plans on how to achieve your goal .

You will have to obtain knowledge , you might have to study , go to university , or just ask the right people how to start your business .
You will have to outline a plan , how to reach your aim , and it will be favourable when you include and ask people who are already successful in your field of interest .

You will also have to make financial plans and include banks or other sponsors ( maybe memers of your family ) in order to keep on going .
And you will have to readjust your outlines and actions to the reality , which will correct you and help you in becoming more efficient in your efforts .

At the end I want to say , that success means for each person something else .
Where we want to be successful - we will have to find that out for ourselves .
It might not be even noticeable for your neighbors , but you will know it when it happens .
And : small successes are the precursors of greater ones .
