I agree with the statement because to me undeerstanding is the most important factor in learing for univerisity .
The first reason is that if you understand an idea it is easier to remember it and the idea stays in mind longer than than a learned fact .
Secondly I find it important to be able to apply the learned knowledge to other situations and study areas .
One should be able to adopt the learned features and work with them .

Understanding is very important for ideas you have to remember not only for a specific examination but for a long time .
They stay in mind because you can imagine how the idea works .
Although you can be sucessful in an exam just by learing the facts you will not be able to remember them later .

The most important reason why I prefer understanding is that facts which are understood can be adopted to your work .
For example an engineer who knows how to build an engine but does not understand how it works will never be able to invent new feature to the engine , but someone who undestands the priciples of an engine will be able to improve it .
This can be easily transferred to any other subject .
So a psycholigist has to understand the theories of disorders , e.g. a depression , in order to help his patient .
If he does not understand it he can only tell the patient more details on his disorder but cannot transfer the information to the individual .
So this doctor is no real use to the patient because the patient can easily find these information in books .

If you understand a certain technique it is easy even to transfer it to completely different study field .
It can help you to learn and understand even topics which are not related .

The given reasons are only a few reason why understandind is the more effective learning method .
Besides there are many other advantages of understanding ideas .
So for example learning can be a lot more interesting when you understand the ideas .
It can be motivating and learning can be more fun .
