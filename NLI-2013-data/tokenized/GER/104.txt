By discussing the statement , we first have to define what > > helping their communities < < means .
What are the communities ?
The communities may be some of sport , music or religious .
And what is helping ?
Helping may mean helping in the familiy ( which is part of the community ) or by helping direct the community .

There are several methods of helping in communities .
These methods changed along the years :

In former days people were perhaps more friedly and more helpful to each other .
They were another generation and had other living conditions .
I also think that the people have had another familiar surrounding in which they lived and worked .
As young people they had to help the family e.g by going in the fields and doing farming .
They also used to help other families , because they benefits from each other .
The families had not so much money and so much things like we have today .
So helping was very important .
This were a community in these days .

Nowadays the familiar surrounding is not so close as it was a hundret years ago .
There are more singles or more families with divorced parents .
So the surrounding in which the young people live nowadays is completely different to thos who lived a hundret years ago .
But this fact I think is the critical point : The young people nowadays want to have a bigger or a more family like family .
Because of this fact I think , nowadays young people are also engaged in their communities by searching a more completely familiy .

So I disagree with the statement .
My own experience confirms this .
A lot of my friends are in several sport or music communities .
And they help there for non profit .
I am in our religous community in my town and I am helping the pastor for non profit .
