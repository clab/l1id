All people enjoy life , and they show this by participating in many of life 's amazing activities .
People enjoy life in many forms .
Yet , people do not lose this thirst for life as they grow older .
The things people enjoy might change with time , but this does not mean that they derive less enjoyment from them .
Improvements in healthcare have made old people 's lives easier and they have also increased their mobility , allowing them to pursue many activities during their retirement .
People enjoy life regardless of age , and this dismisses the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than old people '' .

Of course there are differences between the young and the old .
The young are typically more active and less patient .
Yet , this does not imply that they enjoy life more .
This merely implies that young people have a different set of preferences , and different ideas as to what constitutes as fun .
Consequently , they enjoy different activities .
Many young boys enjoy playing football with their friends .
Playing football can be quite demanding physically .
Rarely , do we see senior citizens playing football .
Instead , we might see them strolling in a park , or watching their favorite TV show .
These activities are less demanding physically , but old people do not enjoy them less .

As medicine and technology have improved , life expectancy has increased .
Today people live much longer than they used to .
People spend many years in their retirement , and many find these years to be the most enjoying years of their life .
People , who are in their retirement , have the time to do what they please .
They do not have meetings and scheduals to meet , and this allows them to live life at a slower pace .
This also allows them to go on long trips and holidays , and see the places they wished to see during their youth .

Also due to improvements in heathcare , old people are not are immobile as they once were .
This allows many old people to continue to fuction normally , and even play sports like golf .

The statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' is false , because of the many points that speak against it .
Old people enjoy life no less than young people .
True they enjoy different things , but this is due to the fact that they have different preferences and needs .
