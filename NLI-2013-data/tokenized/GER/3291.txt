I do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I think that young people today are less involved in community activities and spend less time there because the society in common became more individualistic .

For instance , a lot of young people today perform individial sports or they perform sports only occassionally .
It is no longer common that such people are organised in sports clubs and take responsibily as team coaches or in training kids and younger club members from their community .
It seems also that organisations like the boy scouts or churches have a problem to attract young people .
And I think that young people were more politically engaged in previous times .
There are only few young people nowadays joining political parties or labour organisations such as union .
In particular , most young people are reluctant to take political positions on a communal level because they can no see any sense in it .

One reason seems to be that the economic situation has changed much over the last years .
The pressure to be successfull in the job is much higher than ever before , and the high unemployment rate threatens a lot of people because of their proffesional future .

Hence , young people are urged to finish their school time time and studies as fast as possible which leaves only very little time for community activities .
In addition , it seems to be more common today to teach competition instead of collaboration , leading to a more egoistic society .
A lot of young people start to learn this early in their careers , leaving the impression to them that is not benefitial to take responsibilites in their communities because of the time it costs .
Finally , the society became more mobile over the last years , which means that in particular young people often change their job and living place .
Hence , these young people can not really get rooted in a community .
But this seems to be a major prerequesite for any community engagement .
