Everyone wants to succeed in live .
The question is only how to do this - does one has to try new things , does one has to take risks to be successful ?

A problem about trying new things is of course the possibility to fail .
Just to try something new garantees by no means to succeed .

On the other hand , it seems pretty obvious to me that one should n't stay inside the given borders if one wants to succeed .

Firstly , trying something new means to have courage .
People who take risks are self-confident .
It is very important to have a certain degree of courage and self-confidence to succeed .
Then others telling you that you had no chance does n't keep you from doing it .
And if you are steadily kept from doing what you acctually would like to do , after some time you will probably develop a certain passive attitude towards life and you will even no longer succeed in things that are n't new at all , that you are familiar too .
Taking risks means to be active and to keep going even if there are obstacles -- what is very important for everyone who wants to succeed .

Furthermore , trying new things means to explore unknown areas , areas where noone or only very few people have been before .
Especially in economics it is one of the most important things to be the first one on the market .
One has to be creative and inventive to succeed and what is more , one then has to realize one 's ideas .
I heard of a very successful woman selling a new sort of bathing shoes , and she was really the first to be interested in bathing shoes as something that could make its way into the Nation 's fashion magazines .
But just the facts that she took the risk , that she started her own business although her counseler probably told her not to do so and the fact that she was very creative in designing the form and pattern of the shoes made her to succeed .
If she would have remained in the patterns of daily life , if she just would have gone on the way she was used to do things , she would never have reached what she did .

So to my mind , successful people acctually try new things and take risks although this should never mean to loose the ground or to be unrealistic .
