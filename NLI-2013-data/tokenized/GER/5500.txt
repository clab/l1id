In general I agree that most advertisements let people think that products are better as they are in reality .

There are three different types of publicity that makes its products better as they are .
The first group of advertisement is the one that simply lies about the qualities of a certain product .
It says that products are able to do things that are not true to make the product seem better .
A product is better the more things it can do .
Today often it is not enough if people can use a certain machine just to do one thing .
Because people need many things today and they do not have a lack of space ( and often also a lack of money ) to buy for everything a new machine .
So today a mobile phone need to have a camera , a radio , a alarm clock and many things more in addition to a telephone .
So often today companies use lies to make the product seem better as it is .
The consequence of this is that the customers are disapointed and do not buy products of this company anymore and do not recomment this firms to their friends .
So the company often is not able to survive a long time .

There is a second type of publicity .
Many companies exagerate when they discribe their product .
One way for exageration is to make the advertised thing seem nicer on a picture or at television as it is in reality .
Many technical products look after a short time of use very old .
In the advertisement a shaver looks very new although the man in the publicity say that he is using it already for a long time , a year or so .
Or often products look bigger or packagings give the impression that they are fuller as they are in reality .
The consequences of those advertisements are not so grave .
People are used to the fact that advertisements exagerate and ofthen people do not complain because of those details if they like the product in general .
Those exagerations are not essential .

The third group of publicity are also lies but this group differs from the second group mentioned above .
Those lies are lies that people do not believe .
A company sometimes says impossible things about a product just to make it famous and to let the people think about it .
A very famous example is a drink that is called Red Bull .
The advertisemet says that if somebody drinks Red Bull he is supposed to get wings and to fly .
But everybody knows that today it is not possible ( or not yet ) to drink something and then be able to fly .
So that is a lye ( it can be called also a white lie ) that nobody believes .
It can be also seen as a strong exaggeration that does not harm anybody .

Finally it think that most companies make products seem muck better in the advertisements as they really are .
But today companies often do not have another possibility as to do so .
Because there are so many advertisements and people just look at the ones which seem interesting and innovative to them .
So there is a big battle of the best advertisement .
