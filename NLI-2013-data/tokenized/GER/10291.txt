I personally agree with the given statement .
In a natural way , everybody tries to challenge himself .
There is always something new to learn or to do .
Life is full of surprises and possibilities .

Most successful people enjoy their life as beeing successful , but they also feel the desire to do something else .
This could be to work on a voluntary base or to do another job .
It is satisfying to them to know that they already achieved a lot in life because of their studies , experiences and their education .

Still , they want to do more , some to gain a higher position within the firm they are working at , others just to challenge themselves .
The reason might be to earn more money , but also to lieve a less stressful life .
Doing the same job every day might get boring with the time passing by .
This way people are open to try something new .

I think that doing another job apart from the main one one is doing , might be stressful and risky .
Doing another job means to put a lot of effort , time and also work into it .
This might lead to stress because there is not that much time left for hobbies , family or relationship .
It is difficult to be successful and parallel to that to live a pleasant and happy life .

Many people who are successful are always in a hurry and it seems that they do not have the time to appreciate little things in life .
In my opinion , though .
they do a lot more than others by doing other things than just doing what they already know how to do well .
Having the chance to try out new things probably makes people happy .
Some like their job a lot but there is also another thing which they do not want to miss doing in their life .

It is also good to show the talents which God gave us .
Especially succesful people are motivated .
They also have the money to afford doing new things .
This is why they should take their chances and feel free to do whatever they want to do .
This might lead to recognition within the town they are living in and also satisfaction throughout themselves .
People who are successful often like to do something that makes them forget work .
Life gets a little belanced and they feel better .

I imagine that successful try new things like sports or voluntary work .
They might have their own business which is connected to risk , because there is not the guarantee that it will go well and turn out to be popular .

Others might lead a sports group or teach older people foreign languages .
To me it would be important to work woth other people and to try to help them out .
All in all , successful people who take a risk in trying out new things feel more balanced and more satisfied .
