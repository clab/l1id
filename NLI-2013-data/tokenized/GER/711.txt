In my opinion , a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than just specializing in one specific subject provides many advantages .

Transfering the knowledge of one academic subject to another can often simplify life .
Good knowledges of mathematics , for example , help in various other academic subjects like Business , Econonimics , Physics , etc .
Other than that , being well educated in many subjects means that you do not rely on other people as much .
You have the knowledge ( `` power '' ) to decide by yourself what is right or wrong ( at least in your opinion )

Having a broad knowledge in many subjects also keeps you away from being a coach potatoe .
If you show your interest in many areas you will see that there are connections that might be exciting .
Then you want to learn more about it , you would to understand how things are working .
Your brain keeps being used .
In this way you are not just satisfied by knowing that your good at one topic and just leave the other topics unregarded behind .
Look at senior citizens .
Many older people that are still interested in many topics also show good physically health .

Our society is changing from a industrial oriented to a more service oriented one .
This implies changes in the job sector .
Jobs in the past will not be needed to be done in the future .
But - going with this - new jobs will be created in fields that we ca n't think of at the moment .

If you just have knowledge in one specific subject rather than in several ones it might get really difficult for you to find a good , satisfying job .
Companies are looking for people that show a big interest in a variety of topics .
They believe that a broad knowledge helps new employees to easily adapt to their new task at the company .
Often , scientist are hired in the business world because they are believed to think in a more logical , structed way .

All in all , specializing in one topic is not completely wrong .
But having a broad knowledge in many academic subjects truly enriches and simplifies life .
