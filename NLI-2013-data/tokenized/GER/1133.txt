Generalism versus specialism is a widely discussed topic nowadays .
In older days most academic fields required rather broad general knowledge with pointed specific knowledge in certain subjects .
With the advancement of society and science the demand for generalists decrease and the demand for specialists increased .
Why is that ?
Let me explain this using the field of medicine as an example .
In the past medical doctors were able to overlook broad fields of medicine , giving them the chance to help patients with many different diseases at a good level of care .
With the advancement of medicine and medical research the complexity of each medical field increased and it became harder and harder for an individual to keep up with the advanced knowledge in each field .
To be able to treat a patient according to the state-of-the-art standards of medicine nowadays one has to be a specialist in his field .
For generalists the field of practice becomes smaller and smaller while more and more subjects are taken and spaces been filled with specialists .
Knowledge in medicine is said to double every five years .
This proves that a medical doctor today cannot accumulate the same level of knowledge in many medical subjects and reach a comparable level of perfection as one could thirty years ago .

Now , is this a change to the good ?
Do I agree that specialization is good ?
It might be usefull and the pace of scientific advancement might not give us a choice , but I personally believe that at the same time something is lost .
What ?
Well , first at all the general picture is lost .
A specialist often has not the same broad idea of the big picture , let 's say - to stick with the example of the general doctor - of the patient 's background , other medical problems , medical problems in different social and geographic groups of society and the influence amongst medical problems .
Second at all the more specialized a person - in this example a doctor - becomes the more likely it will be that he is only neeeded for a small number of duties , investigations or treatments , wich in my oppinion leads to more perfectionism at first , but very easily leads to a lack of compassion and boredom soon afterwards , leaving behind a specialist with no enthusiasm and compassion any more for his job and profession .
In that way I personally do agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many topics or subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
