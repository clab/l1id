I agree with the statement , that there will be fewer cars in twenty years for the following reasons :

The first reason is that the price of petroleum is still rising in the long-term , because crude oil is getting more rare .
So , because the price of petroleum is getting higher , driving is getting more expensive over time .
In twenty years , the price of petroleum will be much more higher than today .
Maybe , the cars then will receive their power of other raw materials , but today , it is not sure that there will be a substitute for petroleum in twenty years , which is as functional as petroleum .

Another argument for the decline of cars are cities .
Because people still migrate from the countryside to cities , they are getting bigger and bigger all over the world .
As the cities are growing , the traffic chaos is growing too .
Today , in many cities it is much cheaper and faster to use the public transportation such as metro and busses .
This effect will get stronger over the years as the cities are growing .
The other point is , that less people will live at the countryside , in regions , where a car is a necessarity for the daily life .

The pollution of the environment is the third reason why the amount of cars will be smaller in twenty years .
As long there is no other source of power invented , petroleum will be used in cars .
But in these days the concern about the environmental changes in the last years are getting bigger and it is proved that the burning of petroleum contributes to some effects for example the lightening of the ozon .
So probably stronger environmental laws will be made , which could have affects on the amount of cars driven if they make it more difficult or more expensive to drive .

Because of the reasons given , I think that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today .
