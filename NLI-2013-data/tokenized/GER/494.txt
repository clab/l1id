It is better to have a broad knowledge of many acadenic subjects our days .
I think that because today , no matter what you do you never know for how long you will still be doing to do that .
Everything can change in just a month today .
If you look back 100 years ago , thinks were differnent , people only learned one job and kept on doing that job for their whole life .
Back than people mostly even passed on that job to their kids but today it is a lot different .
People are not that much devided into classes anymore which gives everyone an oppertunity to do what they want .
Of course it is harder for a person who grows up in a bad neighberhood to become a lets say a proffesor but society and the law would allow him to do so .

I am writing this from a western European point of view , I guess there are countries that might not have this freedom jet .
In Europe or in any developed country the competion for a working place is increasing , that is why I think it can only be helpful to know as much as possible , to be able to compete with others that are capable of doing the same work .

In countries like France or Germany it is getting really important to be well educated because if one is not educated it can happen that he would have a hard time getting a job because since the borders are opened , European Union workers can come from every where and work for less money .
For myself it is important to catch as much knowledge as I could possibly get .
That is also one of the reasons why I am sitting here writing this essay .

I guess people could argue that if one knows something very well he will always find a job but unfortunetly there is no safe job anymore .
I just resently red that even jurnalism is not a safe job anymore because of all the internet pages where everyone can submit his experiences .
