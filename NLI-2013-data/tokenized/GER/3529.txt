In my view it is not true that young people do n't dedicate enough of their spare time to helping in their communities .
In the contrary , I see a lot of young people supporting local projects to help the older , the poor or to help children to grow up und thrive in a more healthy and heartfelt environment .

I experience that a lot of help is given through the local church organisations .
They run a variety of projects - from helping kids to do their homework in the afternoons to supporting the poor by handing out daily portions of freshly cooked food .
Most of the work done by the church organisations could not be achieved without the help of young people .
Although the young nowadays seem to have so many different options to spend their spare time , if you take a closer look , it is not so different as it was in former times .
Sports , friends and other cultural activities may consume now as they have always consumed a part of the spare time .
But just as in former days some of the spare time is dedicated to help others in need .

I am aware of the fact that not all the young people suppport their communities and that some projects may need more help from the youth .
But overall one cannot say , the young do n't dedicate enough time to support worthy causes .

The dedication of young people to community work may be less visible now then it was in former times .
Mass media tend to overestimate other news .
They usually do n't concentrate on the small differences the dedication to a church group , for example , makes .
The help of the young may be largely unvisible to a larger community .
Nevertheless it makes all the difference for the people that experience the help - just as it has always been .
