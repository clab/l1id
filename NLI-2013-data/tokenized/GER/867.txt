The question being asked is whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to rather specialize in one specific subject .
In my eyes this question brings up a very important issue in times of increasing interdisciplinary work .
Many companies want their emloyees to work trans - or interdisciplinary and I personally think for this it is necessary to specialize in one specific subject .

First of all , concerning the fact that human knowledge increases so fast nowadays I think it is almost impossible to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects such as Leibnitz did for example .
Of course , a person can still have a good general education and can be interested in many things , but when it comes to knowing a lot about academic issues there is a limit .

Second I feel that only people who spezialize in a certain field will be able to find a good job in our society .
Especially in science it is necessary to have experts who know almost everything about their subject .
Because only those people will be able to get so deep into the topic that they will eventually find new solutions to problems .

And for getting so deep into the subject I am sure that it is crucial to focus and to specialize in one specific topic .

Naturally it is important to work together with people of different academic fields , as it is wanted by interdisciplinarity strategies , but that does not mean that everyone has to everything .

In my eyes the best solutions for current problems will be found when many experts will come together on one table and exchange ideas .

So , in conclusion I feel that nowadays it is just not possible to have such a wide range of knowledge and as a matter of fact I think that it is not necessary if people of different subjects start working together .
