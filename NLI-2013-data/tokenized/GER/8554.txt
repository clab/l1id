I completely agree with the given statement .
It is indeed far more important for students to understand ideas and concepts in general than it is for them to simply learn facts .
I believe so for several reasons , however , my main argument behind these reasons is the importance of flexibility and creativity for dealing with problems in a changing world .

If students are taught static knowledge , they can only learn a limited amount of facts , which might not prepare them for problems they will have to deal with during their work .
Learning to understand ideas and concepts on the other hand , allows them to gain new knowledge whenever neccessary .
It provides them with a more general skill that can be applied in all kinds of situations and to solve all kinds of unanticipated problems .

I think this sort of general skill and flexibility becomes ever more important in these fast changing times .
The value of knowledge understood in terms of facts more and more decreases .
In the face of contemporary scientific progress , what is held to be fact and truth today may well turn out to be untrue tomorrow .

The preperation provided by university cannot be very specific .
Students of the same subject are likely to work in different sectors later on .
It is often said that learning in fact begins after graduation .
The relevant `` hard facts '' required for a certain work are anyway more likely to be acquired during working .
So , concentrating on learning facts in most cases means memorising a lot of facts which will never be of use .
In contrast , concentrating on learning concepts creates flexiblity for a variety of tasks , for changing biographies , for a changing world .

Flexibility is in the contemporary world a major key to success .
It is therefore a crucial skill of university graduates to be able to find solutions to all kinds of problems which might occur by applying knowledge in a flexible and creative manner , based on the more general ideas and principles they have gained understanding of during their studies .
