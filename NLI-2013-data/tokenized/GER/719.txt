Although i understand people who say it is better to specialize in one specific subject i would prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
There are three reasons why i would prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Firstly if you have broad knowledge you can talk to much more people or students about academic topics .
For example i am studying three subjects .
This is a reason why i can talk with many different people about many academic subjects .
That is why i met and got to know students from different subjects .
We often spend time together while we are talking abuot our or one of our subjects .
I enyoy this time .

Secondly i think it is better for your future when you have broad knowledge of many subjects .
It shows that you are interested in many things or subjects .
For example when you want to get a job it showes better when you can say i am interested in different subjects and when you have different knowledge than having very deep knowledge in only one thing .
Another thing is when you are working in a company and someone has problems with something you can help or give solutions about that topic .
And that is why a lot of people habe a lot of success in their job or in their life .

Thirdly if you have children i think the children have more respect when you can say i am familiar with different subjects than with one deeply .
The children can learn more from you when you have different knowledge .
I think it is very important for children when the parents have more knowledge than one deep knowledge .
To sum up for me there are only important aspects to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and i would do the same way again because it is more important to have different knowledges of many academic subjects than to one deep .
For example in a job or to talk with different peole or for your children .
