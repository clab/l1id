Education has always been concerned with the question whether it is more important to learn facts or to acquire ways of understanding the things that happen around us .
Is it of more relevance to know when exactly a certain war broke out , or to understand how a conflict finally resulted in that specific war ?
In the course of this work , it will be shown that facts should not be the first and paramount source and end of learning .

First of all , facts are something that we memorize .
The human brain , however , does not have the capacity to remember every single fact for an unlimited amount of time .
Things that we learn by heart can just as easily be forgotten when we do not need the information anymore .
A student can revise certain dates in history or certain physics formulas , but when the exam or the school year is over , his brain might erase them in order to make space for new information .

Moreover , students can adapt certain ideas that they have understood to other topic areas .
This kind of potential for transferral of knowledge or ways of thinking is in my opinion highly important .
Facts are only valid for one specific issue at one specific time whereas ideas possess a more universal quality .
Understanding how a politician 's minds in conducting policies work - what factors they have to take into consideration - , for example , is more important than knowing about all the policies they introduced .

In addition , the learning of ideas rather than facts helps you to draw comparisons between certain issues , to assess qualities and shortcomings and to look at the world from a more general point of view .
A student who knows a lot about the main tenets of liberalism will very likely be better able to compare its signifigance in different cultures and at different times in world history than someone who has studied the biographies of philosophers of the past .

To conclude , one can say that the learning of facts is a mere formality , an unreflected acquiring of names , numbers and events , whereas the understanding of concepts and ideas is a process by which students learn to look for and grasp the roots of issues .
Ideas can be applied to various fields and can stay in our minds , shape the conception of how we see the world .
Facts that are hammered into our brains , on the other hand , are likely to disappear over time .
