Sometimes the slogans of travel agencies , malls , public instituations state something like : `` Enjoy your life because you are young ! ''
But what does this say .
Are only young people enjoy their lifes and the younger do not ?

The young generation always tries to enjoy life as much as it can be .
Means their daily life is planned .
And this plans are made to enjoy the life .
This can start with sleeping long , travel to different cities , shopping and having parties .
The young people enjoy this .
Zoung people know what thez can get out of their life and how to enjoy it .

But what about the older peole .
Don t they enjoy their lifes as well ?
Well at least the older people I know enjoy their lifes as well .
The life of the older sometimes appears to the younger generation as not that much excited , funny and just great .
They just enjoy other things about what the younger generation would think of is boring and lame .
For example going for a walk in the forest or playing cards is just fun for them .
When younger people see older ones who are meeting e.g. in a cafe the younger ones are thinking that it would be boring to hang out there .
But the older ones do not see it like this .
They enjoy their time together and appreciate the company of the others .

It can be said that it really depends on your personallity if you enjoy your life or not .
Sometimes young and older people say that do not have pleasant life .
It too stressfull and absolute no fun at all .
They think that their life in not enjoyable .
It can happen that younng people say they wish to be old to have time to enjoy their life and the other way round .

To sum up it can be said that it is not a fact of age to enjoy life .
It just your on attitute towards life !

So , enjoy it !!!!
