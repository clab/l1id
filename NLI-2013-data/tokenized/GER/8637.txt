I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts , as in the future carreere working on concepts is needed .
Only knowing some facts of a special theorie does not help to resolve a probleme , for example !

Example : In my interneship at the company LAVAZZA I receveid a task , namely to resolve a problem in the marketing departure .
Therefore I did need special facts about the problems topic , but the facts were not required from the company .
I had the possibility to look the facts up in the internet if I needed them .
But the important point was to know how it is the best way to form the concept and how to develope the suitable ideas of this problem .
The companz required these factors :

1. understanding the problem task
2. working on the problem task
3. finding solutions for the problem task

Moreover I think that facts are the base for working on special topics or better an advantage for working on a topic .
One should learn facts , but the most important point for students is to learn to understand special ideas and concepts in order to use them in the future .
Otherwise , only knowing the facts , without knowing how to work with them , is not helpful for future tasks .
Sure , there will be people who would be impressed , when they hear that you know various facts about o topic by heart , but only facts will not fulfill the requirements of a company one works in .

As a resume it can be said , that facts are basically important to learn , but not as much important as understanding ideas and concepts , as it is not enough only knowning facts without having the capabality to work with them , for example to make a concept .

The combination of learning facts and on the same time understanding the idea or the concept would be perfect !
