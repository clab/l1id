I am going to explain why I agree that a variety of academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
It is important to know that I am looking at this under specific conditions .
It makes a difference if you are going to work in research where specialisation is mandatory or if you want to work for a company in an other department other than research .
I am now refering to people in the business that would like to climb the ladder in a company .
I am going to refer on one main aspect that highlights the pros of a broad knowledge .

If a persons goal is to have a career and to go up in a companys hirarchy it is better for that person to understand the business as a whole .
He may switch from different departments and will therefore encounter several issues from many departments .
That person will also have to deliver advice and solution for different problems .
Of course he will also need to know where to get missing information on a topic .
If he is a generalist he might not know all details of a solution or might oversee problems but he will be able to get the information he needs from specialist .
As a generalist he should have enough insight to know how to prepare the input of the specialist in a form that can be understood by everyone .
He needs to know how to use the information for his company and how it would impact other departments .
Idealy that person will also be able to connect aspects from several specialist in different ranges and put them togheter in a good way .

As a conclusion I would say , that given specific facts , for example work , that influence this topic , it is better to have a wider range of knowledge than to be specialized .
Wider knowlegde will help carreer driven people to climb the ladder faster since they will be able to understand and handle upcoming issues better than specialists do .
Their general knowledge will make them better leaders since they know the company as a whole and do not only see it with the eyes of one department only .
