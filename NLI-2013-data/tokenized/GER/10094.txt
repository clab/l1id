In my opinion successful people are more related in trying new things but they are not necessarily more atraccted in taking risks .
The reason for my thought is that people who are successful normaly lead a company or are the owner of some kind of business .
Therefore they have responsibility for many employees who are working in the firm .
For example when the boss of a company wants to develop a new , lets say , a new car .
The car works with a new technology which is much better for the environment but is not tested good yet and will probably not make much money .
In my opinion the business leader should not take the risk to develop the car until it has been well known in a country and has reached high interest .
Because if it does not work and nobody will buy the car the company will eventually be lost and the employees would be unemployed .

Nevertheless I think that successfull people are more willing to try new things .
They probably develop new things and also give impulses for future .
That means that they are pre - thinkers of future ideas .

In spite of my opinion I could imagine that there are successful people who take risks .
These people normally are very self-confident and assure of themselves because they do not care of the people who depend on their decisions .

Another topic to talk is the possibility to take risks in there free time , like a hobby .
When something worse happens they will just be risponsable for themselves , expect they have children and wife .

In conclusion I would say that successfull people tend to be more risk loving than others but they should be aware of their responsibility .
