Although it would be a good thing for the environment if there were fewer cars in the future , I do not think this will happen .
Three arguments convince me that there will be even more cars in the near future .

In the first place , most of us rely on their car to easily go to every place whenever it may be desireable .
I am sure that no one will change this behaviour , unless he or she is forced to do so .
I do not think everyone will suddenly use the bus or the train , because most of us would feel as if their mobility or personal right to move were restricted .
Therefore , there will not be fewer cars within 20 years .

Additionally , the number of cars is a global affair .
I recently read an article about the emerging state in the far east , which mentioned the fact that people in countries like China are about to having gathered enough wealth to afford cars .
Imagine a billion persons from this region , who suddenly drive a car !
So , even if the developed countries would reduce their reliance on cars , the number of cars would actually increase .

Quite on the contrary , one might argue that global society will have no choice but to use fewer cars in the future because of a shortage of oil .
But I think that mankind will finally overcome this concern , at least when it is forced to do so , by using alternative energy .
These technologies are already available today , but are not being used extensively for several reasons .
Eventually , when cheap oil is now longer available , car producers will switch , because of the peoples ' reliance mentioned earlier .
Consequently , the number of cars will not drop significantly .

In conclusion , I predict that the number of cars will rise instead of decline .
I would feel a lot better with that , if people would take more care of their environment and use green cars today , even if they are a bit more expensive .
