In my opinion success has nothing to do with trying new things or taking risks .
What is success ?
It 's when a person is doing his best relatively to her or his potential .
Maybe it is not something new it is something what he or she always has done .

Another thing is the learning-effect and beeing successful in that case .
There I agree that you are more successful in the event of learning when you try doing new things .

For example a young guy between his twenty 's , doing always the same thing , let 's say , working as a printer .
It would n't be successful when he would continue his whole life in doing this work in beeing in the same position and the same company forever .
A successful person would try to go further .
Change companies , learn from the best in the field , go to school , trying to take a job in the adminstration .
Maybe he will fail once or twice .
But on the end , he will be successful , because he can look back and say : I have tried new things and I have done my best .

Another way of beeing successful is by taking risks .
It 's usually a small way between beeing risky and beeing stupid .
Most people know they are stupid after beeing risky .
As an example let 's take a gambler which put his whole safings on one number in the roulette .
The number turns , the ball jumpes and takes place in another number than the gambler wished to .
That 's stupid we would say .
But if it had been his favourite number , than he would be immediately successful .
Therefore , in my opinion , to be risky does n't mean you are successful .

We probably can say that the more risk we take , the bigger is the success , but also the bigger we can fail .
Important is not be in a steady positon , where no success ever will occur .
