In my opinion it is not simply to say , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I think it has to be analysed by different views .
Clear , in general the students should understand the ideas and concepts .
Because if they would not understand the ideas and the concepts , it 's to expect that they wo n't be able to practizise the thinks , they should have learned .
When the students get into the job , they have to reproduce what they learned in the university or school .
And if they only know something about facts , they can not be very successful in what they do .
Every student should wanting to be successful in his job or in whatever he does .
If they do not care about what they do , they normally can not expect a life , what other students could have , cause the did a little bit more .

So I think , that it is the better way for all students to understand more then only the facts of an individual topic .
But there is another point of view .
During the time of school or university , there are often time - periods of tests .
Some universities have test - periods , where the students are forced to wright ten tests a week .

In that case , it is not possible for every student to understand all ideas and concepts .
It is necessary for the student to finish all test in the best way it is even possible .
Therefore , it could be a better choice to learn all facts , that you are able to finish all tests .
I think this is a typical problem for students , studying in the first semesters .
Afterwords , during the main semesters , the students have found their special themes , they want to work on .
In that case , it is much easier for them to learn more about the ideas and concepts .
In the main period of studium , it is much more important to understand the ideas and the concepts .

So again , to understand the ideas should be the task for every student but it is to accept , that there could be moments , where it is better to use the facts , to get a better result .
