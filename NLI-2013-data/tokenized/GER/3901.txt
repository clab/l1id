`` Why should I spend my evening with helping in the community center ?
I have to help myself to get to enjoy at least some part of the day after school ! ''

This is the answer of my friend I received yesterday when I asked her to accompany me to help in a kids swimming-class at the community center .
So I sometimes wonder whether it is true that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Life in a community follows simple rules .
One basic principle is the one of giving and receiving .
`` You get as much as you give ! ''
Concerning the special aspect of time in our society today time has become a rare good .
With regards to the tendency of increasing egotism and cold calculations in the sense of whether spending time on certain actions can be beneficial for us .

If the answer to this question is negative we tend no to do it even if the moralicly correct decision would be differently .
In the case of my friend , who I asked to help in a swimming-class for kids it would not be lucrative for her to do so .
In her opinion , the time she is spending at the community centre is `` lost time '' because there are neither advantages to be expected nor is it a freetime activity where she can enjoy heself because it is like a job one does not get payed for .

But maybe there is something else which makes this activity `` lucrative '' .
Maybe we should consider the aspect of love for others - even with the image of an egotistic youth ?
If I respect what other parts of my community do for me , for example drive me to school , I am respecting their effort , the time they invest partly also in me .
Therefore - being driven to school and people investing time in me - I am glad .

And being glad I come to the conclusion that I might not be as glad if the others did not invest the much time .
Concluding this my goal would be to keep others investing time in the community .
Since they will only do this if they also get something back I necessarily have to invest time in the community myself .

And I might also find a task with which I can help , invest time and at the same time have fun myself .

In my opinion this is not an utopia of community life .
I have found such a task myself .
Since I love swimming and have a certain knowledge how to teach it and also adore children I combine both .

I give swimming-classes at the community center every wednesday evening and enjoy this very much .
Finally I suggest to make clear to young people that giving some of their expensive time to the community they receive even more than expected .
And that in the end this moral and communital behaviour can turn out to be very lucrative for everyone !
