Although many people think older people cannot enjoy life as much as younger , I think they can .
Often one thinks that old people are bored .
Almost everyone can talk about Grandma looking out of the window the whole day watching unknown people passing the street .
Of course not all Grandmas do that .
But what about the younger ones ?
Is it not true that a lot of them sit in front of a TV half a day and watch unknown persons discussing in a talk show .
Would not many consider watching TV to be amusement ?
The Grandma at the window might as well have fun and probably she thinks the younger ones are bored because they need to watch TV .
Maybe for her the man that passes by all day at 10:30 and is always in a rush means a big fascination ...

Still it leaves the point that not many old persons are observerd in discos , rock concerts or in the movies .
But the other way round not many young people are seen in theaters , hiking in the nature or in the cinema when the old Western movie from 1950 is shown .
Maybe drinking a tea in a silent undisturbed atmosphere is great enjoyment for the older , while younger prefer to drink a coke with loud Rock music in the background .
There are of course many more examples , but those are rather dependant on the lifestyle and personal likes and dislikes people develope while getting older , than to the total amount of enjoyment they offer to differently aged groups .

In my view it is a bit too general to discuss just old and young , it just does not take into account the many varieties life has to offer .
Each person is individually different and general views might fit for many but not for every single human being .
Nevertheless as discussed above I think that there are different ways of enjoying life and those are quite different , if compared to people at different ages .
But ultimately the level of enjoyment people get from life does not depend on the age and is therefore equal for the old and young .
