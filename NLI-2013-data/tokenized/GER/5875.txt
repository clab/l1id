I do n't think , that there will be fewer cars in twenty years .
Of cause it is unknown what will be in twenty years but everyone of us think about his future and not only when you think about buying a new car .

I believe that there wo n't be fewer cars in future , because cars are an efficient way of transporting not only of people also to transport goods .
That is the reason way so many cars were used today , because it is often the cheapest way of traveling or transportation .
For example it is cheaper for families or even for single people to get from Erfurt to Munich than it would be by traveling by train .
Also traveling by car is often much faster than going by train .
Additionally to the costs , going by car or driving car is sometimes the onliest posibility for treveling .
For example in areas in landscape there ` t drive many busses or train espacially in the night or on weekend , so so get away of these vilages you need a car or someone , who is driving you .
That leads me to the next advantage of cars , it is that people with cars are mor independent than without .

An other reason way there wo n't be fewer cars in the futher future is that there are n't any good substitutes for them , like mentioned above trains but also plans or ships are n't good alternatives because thez do n't can be everywhere or could stop everywhere , because all of these transport-vihecles need an habour .
Thats way cars are good for transportation becouse of the well established infrasystem .
Almost everywhere are roads so that everyone could achive his targets by car .
Furthermore also motorbicycle are n't good substitutes for cars of cause they do n't need as much fuel as cars , but you ca n't tronsport as much things as with car and espacially by motorbicycle you are dependent of the wether conditions .

So all together in my opinion cars are mostly the best option to transport good or persons .
Of cuase fuel gets more expensive but new motor-constructions wo n't erase cars .
Thats way cars wo n't be fewer in futr but they could have changed in twenty years .
Aditionally I think that , I will of cause drive any car in twenty years and when other people think so too , that there will be even more cars in futur .

So let us see what will happen to cars in future .
