Let me begin by stating that during your studies at university , for instance in economics , you will get courses , which contain a lot of theoretical content and it 's hard to understand and remember all those different theories from famous scientists or managers etc. for your final exams .

The first fact to mention is that , if you understand those difficult theories of what your lecturer is telling you during a course , it will be much easier to remember it for learning for your final exams at the end of the semester .
Certainly , you can recap during the last preparation days by using your scripts and papers and keep it in mind .
But does this garantee that you pass the exam .
Propably not , because it is typical that you get asked about the realtions between different theories .
When you have understood , what the main theory is about you can easily answer such questions .

But there is also a point against this opinion .
There are always course contents , which are not understandable .
I know , this sounds unusual .
But for example in maths , there are formulas for which you would need days to get it , how they were developed .
But if you learn them by heart , you can simply use them in different types of excercises .
In this case , it would be very intensive to understand it , whereas you can simply adopt it on several issues .

Besides that , there is another arguement for understanding , instead of just learning these facts .
If you understand all this comlicated theorical content of a model you need to know , it will be much easier to use them in your later life .
For instance when you get a job in a research company , you can simply use your knowledge to fullfill your tasks , you are supposed to do .
Another example would be a other course , in which you are talking about things that are familiar to this special model you have completely understand and in mind .
Then you can use your knowledge to understand the next topic .
You can say , that you incerase your knowledge by using your old knowledge .

In conclusion , I certainly can say that I support this opinion and always have thought the same way like the person , who has said this .
Because if you learn something by heart , i 'm 99.99 percent sure that you will have forgot it completely a week after the exam and as I already mentioned , if you understand the main content of a theory you can manke use of it in every case you have to and you also do n't have to learn it that much ( maybe you do n't have to ) , because you will have it already in mind .
