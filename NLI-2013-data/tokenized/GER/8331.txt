I think both points are equally important in college but in your later life it would be more important to understand the arguments and basics than to learn the facts off by hard .

Nobody can understand a theme just by learning simple facts , it is the complex idea that makes someone understand .
Everybody can learn things off by hard , but not everyone understands the material .
And the understanding for me makes a person grow not only its mind but also it personality .

But still there are some benifits to both sides .
When I had history classes in school for instance , I was always really good in understanding the ideas and concepts that were discussed , but always when I had to write an exam I had problems to remember important dates .
And that is what histories mainpoint is , is n't it ?

The result was that I never got a better mark than a three .
That is just the average mark in Germany .
But when I started to study the dates which resemble the facts in the question .
I suddenly got much better marks .
On the other hand if I just knew the dates I would have gotten a much worser mark , because I probably would n't have understood any of the assignments .

But I also think that there are cases where you just have to know simple facts .
In some parts of biology , chemistry , physics and maths , in all science .
I mean if you have to lable body parts of an animal or human , there is no way in doing that without knowing the facts .
An eye is an eye and not a leg , this is quite obvious .
The same is with mathematical formulas , this are facts you really need to know to get a good mark , because there is no way to get a solution without them , except you are as good as Einstein and you derive the formulas on your own , but I think even for a genious it would not work out right to do that .

Chemistry and Physics are just the same .

Also in this subjects there are big parts where you can not go far without the understanding of ideas and main concepts , especially not in higher level sciences .
I think the the two skills of understanding ideas and learning facts are interrelated .

A good student really needs both .
But in conclusion I would still say that understanding is much more important , because in later life you will not get a job by just telling the pythagorean theorem .
But you have to understand basic ideas .
