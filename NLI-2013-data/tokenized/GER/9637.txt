Some successful people try to do new things and take risks whereas others do n't .
I can really understand these people who take risks , because everyone wants to make a bigger profit even if he or she already has a great income and additionally , life would be too boring if taking no risks and not making any changes .

If I was the successful owner of , for example , a big medical company and I 've already had a lot of success and have made a good profit , why should I stop taking risks to earn much more money ?
In my opinion , it would be the best to get my medical company to be the best medical company in the world .
I and all of my employees would profit from that .
We could , for instance , event a new medicine and would try to sell this product .
And if it works well everything would be fine and if not nothing bad would happen , because I 'm already successful and I 've already earned enough money for me and my family .
Hence taking risks is not very hazardous for a successful person .
In addition , if this successful person would n't take any risks anymore his life would be completely boring .
I believe that everyone must love his or her job and should enjoy his or her job .
But there would n't be any fun when taking no risks and the job of a successful person would be rather boring .
Considering me as the owner of a company , I could try to work on other fields or abroad , maybe even in another department .
Indeed , these changes are riskful , but thus my job would n't be boring anyway and it 's probable that I would enjoy my job .
Another important aspect is that sometimes you need to take risks and make changes not only for your own advantage , but also for the advantage of others .
I could , for instance , try to spend a lot of money of my imaginary company for medical research .
Actually , it 's possible that I would spend that money of my company for nothing .
But nevertheless , I have done the best , because I 've tried to help others who are ill and maybe also poor .
I can afford spending all of that money , because I as the owner of the company would be rich and would n't suffer hard when wasting some money when trying to help others .

In conclusion , I think that successful people should take risks , because otherwise their job would have been boring and they can also afford wasting money .
