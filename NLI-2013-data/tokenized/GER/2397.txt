Although some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , I do not agree with that .
There are three reasons for me to get this opinion .

First , older people have much more experience than younger people because they are simply older .
For example , when younger people make holidays in cities they are often more interested in making party than to get to know more about the city and its cultural life .
Old people spend more of their time by learning something about the place where they make holidays .
I think that older people see much more of a city when visiting it than younger people do because for me it is important to learn about the cultural life of the place where you in .

Furthermore , old people have much more time than younger people because they have seen much more in their life .
In contrast , younger people are often interested in seeing much in a short period of time because in their view they have not seen enough yet .
For instance , in most cases older people take much more time when they visit a museum than younger people do .

Last , often old people have saved a lot of money while their time as employee .
They have much more money to spend and they have not to attach importance on how to spend their money .
In contrast , the younger people are at the beginning of their time as employee and so they have not earned much money that they could save yet .
So they are not able to waste their money as old people can .

In conclusion , this are the three reasons why I disagree with the statement .
