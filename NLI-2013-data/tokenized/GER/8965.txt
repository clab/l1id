For students is more important to understand ideas and concepts then to learn facts because those give a construct that helps them to survive in every situation while somebody who is only able to give back facts cannot cope with real situations like in everyday life .

First of all , facts are created by individuals and their opinion influenced indirect their researched facts .
In other words , every researcher is caught in his subjectivity and facts are only as objectiv as the next researcher who will find another argument against it .
Learning facts is never learning the truth .
Researchers goal is it always to disclaim an argument or a fact .
A learned | right | fact can be tomorrow | false | .
But what should a student do if all his facts he learned over his studies are not worth it anymore to discuss after a couple of years ?
His studies would not make sense without a construct that helps him to adapt as fast as possible new facts and to go with the progress of science in a sense .

More important to a student are his tools which he knows how to use , how to get information .
In addition to it he needs an logical construct of theses and ideas , that established during the history of science , to produce in comparission to all the theories that are already there his own idea and his own theory about a specific subject .
So concepts are like an construct of a house skeleton made out of iron .
The build a house with very wide open glass fronts you need first the skeleton and then afterwards you add the single elements like glass doors , glass walls ...
to make it a complete building .
Concepts and understanding ideas are the skeleton of science and compared to the house facts are only singular elements that can be exchange if wanted .
For example if a glass wall is broken or not contemporary anymore it can be changed like false facts .
But facts rely on the skeleton as well as understanding ideas and concepts , and cannot exist without it , to create in this case a whole construct of science .
While concepts and ideas function as skeleton and can exist without singular elements as a construct of science .
