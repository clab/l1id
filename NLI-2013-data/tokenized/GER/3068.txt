In my opinion you cannot generalize the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
You have to differ on what their pleasure is based on .
Indeed there are certain activities , like sport for example , that receive more intention by the youth rather than the older generations since they are very likely not being able to participate in these particular activities anymore due to their current health condition .
But we should not forget that every older person once has been young too and enjoyed the same .
With the process of growing up , we change and develop into another being that finds new ways of enjoying life .

We might rather even more have to question the definition on the actual enjoying process .
If joy leads us to happiness , we can also conclude that an older person might enjoy being old , because he has pretty much achieved everything he ever wanted and now feels responsible to lead the youth through the same process he has been going through .

Regarding the fact that there have always been people that were n't necessarily able to enjoy life , talking about certain disabilities or circumstances , one can conclude that we might have to offer these persons a chance to enjoy life on a different base .
I can imagine that enjoying life also has a lot to do with healthy relationships that we take and depend on our entire life .

In brief , this statement has only a significant value , if we compare the actual enjoying process between young and old on a particular activity , like sports , reading , etc. , but can not be generalized at all since every person can find its own pleasure of joy throughout every period of life we are facing even under the most terrifying circumstances , which exists for certain people but should be tried to taken by a community as much as possible .
