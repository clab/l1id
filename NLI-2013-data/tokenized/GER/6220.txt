Nowadays , one must consider about the development of transition methods in 20 years .
Will cars be such important than today or will they lose their significance and replaced by other kinds of movements ?
Will it be possible to use a car in twenty years , at all ?

When you take a closer look to that question , you will realize that the human population on earth is growing rapidly and thus the demand for cars will increase , too .
Furthermorem , production costs on cars will decrease because of the growing globalization , so prices for cars decrease and more and more people can afford them .

Moreover , another important fact is that our knowlwdge on new technologies is growing very rapidly , as well .
Maybe a totally new kind of a car will be invented and everyone wants to buy one .
When I take a look on the streets of my hometown I do not see any cars older than a few years .
Thus , the quantity of cars will not decrease .

But there are also arguments which supports the statement above .
Oil is more and more getting shorter .
In a few years there will be much shortage on oil so gas will get more and more expensive .
The poor people on earth will not be able to spend their whole money on gas so the quantity of cars in use on earth could decrease .

Furthermore if there are no inventions which makes it possible to reduce air pollution caused by cars there will be probably some restrictions relating to car production to slow down changes in our climate .

All in all , my opinion is that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use because oil will definitly get short .
There are no signs that the car building industry will make such a new invention which changes our lives - related to cars - significently .
