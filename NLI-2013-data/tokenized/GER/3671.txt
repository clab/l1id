First of all I have to say that I can not give an answer which matches on every young boy or girl .
Hence people , especialy young people , are very different from each other .
But , by looking on most of the young people nowadays , I have to agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities .
Most of the young people were very focused on their owen life .
They see only themselves , nobody other .
The best example is , when you take a regulary bus , which is driving around in a bigger town .
As I was young , my father told me to leave my seat , if an older person wanted to set down her - or himself .
I had to learn that sutch things were nothing special .
At that time it was a normal education .
Nowadays nobody of the young people would do this .
In most of the cases I could watch , they did not take a notice of the older person .

People do only what they have to do , what they want to do or if they think they might get an advantage out of it .
For young people this means : going to school , doing homework , playing computer games , meet friends in the shoppingmall and so on .

But I do not want to give all the mistakes , young people do , back to them .
They did not leared how to do it in a right way .
That is the mistake of their parents who did not done well in there education .
Perhaps becourse they did not have enought time or only becourse they were not intrested in teaching their children .
Most parents think the TV-Screen is a good babysitter for thier children , but in the TV things like helping your community is not shown very often .

Young people have to learn that they are not the only rock on the beach , but trying to explain this to them would like carrying orals to Athen .
