I concede with the point of view , that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I agree , that students have to learn a lot of hard facts to gain a substantial basis of knowledge .
With this gained `` ground-knowledge '' they are able to work in their specific community or surrounding .
Every science has its specific speech and skills that are known by everyone in that community .

But to be able to cope with tasks , that students will be faced in their professional and private life , it is important , that they do understand the idea that are behind the facts .

To point it out , knowledge by hard and learned facts is not sustainable , because you can forget parts of the facts .
In this case the student is not able any more to overview the whole issue .
That means , a student who understands the ideas and concepts behind the facts is able to cope with new tasks , that will emerge .
The student is more prepared if he can adopt the ideas and concepts .
With the ideas he can create new solutions .

In addition it is much easier to forget facts rather than ideas and concepts .
To understand means , that a student is more open to new issues , than a student who can just recall his learned facts .
Also the time , that is spent by students to learn the facts by hard is less effective than to learn the concept .
To understand means also to gain tacit knowledge , that is in your hard and not codified .
Facts are codified , for instance in books or standards .
But if a student understand the ideas and concepts , he is able to gain tacit knowledge , that is just owned by him and singular .

In conclusion it is more effective to understand the concepts behind the facts , because it makes a student better prepared for situations that suddenly occur .
In mz opinion it is really important to be prepared to handle with siisues , that are nor commonly known and therefor the best a student can do is to achieve the knowledge how to do something .
