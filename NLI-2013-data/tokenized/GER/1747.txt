In my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
First of all today 's research - and with it - education has come so far in so much different academic subjects that it is even difficult to be a specialist in one topic .
And because of this , with broad knowledge you do n't have any clue from under the surface regarding any topic .
You would be a generalist in many subjects , but in no one a specialist .

But in nowadays job situation you compete mostly with specialits - especially in research .
And so I think for most of the jobs in economy you have to be a specialist .
A controller in finance for instance .
Or an expert for girafs in a safary zoo .
You would be right to doubt this for jobs in general .
For example a head of a company should also have broad knowledge of many subjects , because he has his specialists working for and reporting to him .
However , for many jobs it is better to be a specialist rather than being a generalist .
That is also one reason , why education changed in the last decades .

Another reason for specializing in knowledge is that you do one subject right and get ` deep ' insider informations and skills in it .
You ca n't do that for a wide variety of subjects .
So you are an expert in one topic , because you learned and trained yourself to a large extend .
That makes you quite useful as an advisor for other people and an interesting speaking partner .
And this also has an positive effect to your psyche .
Because you know you are needed by your friends and customers not just for your personality or personal relationship to those people , but also for your special knowledge and experience .
