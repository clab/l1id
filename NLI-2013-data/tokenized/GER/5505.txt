I do agree with the previous statement .
On television we can always see how great current or new products are or work .
The producers want to make us buy only their products and they present it as the best one ever .
Mostly they also add that their products are especially cheap and that it is necessary to buy it , because without them the customers were helpless .

A very good example is soap for washing the dishes .
In the advertisement the customer is told that the dishes will be extremely clean and shiny after cleaning with that soap .
And usually they compare it to the worse ` current ' and ` usual ' soap .
If the customer is convinced by that advertisement he will buy the product , use it and usually see that it does not work as good as the advertisement had told him .
He could have also bought the cheaper one from the other store .

Another and similar example is soap for washing clothes .
In the advertisement the customer is told that this product will wash the clothes cleaner and ` whiter ' than any other product he can find .
The customer will go through the same process I have mentioned above .

Also a good example is paste for colouring the hair .
In the advertisement is shown how good the product will cover the original hair colour .
The customer is convinced and buys the product , but when he uses it he has to notice that the new colour cannot cover the original one the way he would like to .

One example is also organized tours or holidays .
The organisations offer very cheap tours to nice countries with stays in a nice hotel and flights included .
Thus they want to make customers use there organisation and those are often paid by hotels to bring cutomers there .
But often it happens that the hotel is much worse than it had been described or the arroundings do not look as nice as on the pictures .
And the pool described as ` next to the hotel and very nice pool ' looks dirty and is far too small for all the hotel guests .
Additional to that the food might be bad or the hotel has only two instead of four stars .

Producers use that way of advertisement to get close to the customers and to offer them what those want , but usually the products look much nicer , only to make them attractive to the people .
