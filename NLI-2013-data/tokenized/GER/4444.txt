Advertisements exist to sell people products they do not need .
This idea explains the ambition of modern advertising and marketing strategies .
Our modern society is based on capitalistic and often superficial values , and while making products seem better than they actually are , advertisements do notthing but reflect the social values .

Personally , I would say that modern product managers do not have the choice to sell their products as they really are .
The economy in our so called developped countries has reached a level of saturation and offers more products than people actually need .
Therefore , those who want to sell their products will have to make high investments and develop good advertisement strategies .
This guarantees them a good visibility of their products and good chances to sell them .

I also believe that modern advertisements respond to a demand from society .
Today , we are all looking for the exeptional , the beautiful , the luxuary .
In many cases , we do not want to buy a prpoduct but we want to buy a dream .
This means , that we often prefere to buy an illusion rather than the reality .
For instance , the latest shower liquid from Ralph Lauren seems much more attractive to us than a good soap , which would probably have the same effects on our body care .

Modern advertisement has to make products seem better than they really are , because customers are asking for it .
This is nether good or bad , it is a simple fact .
Netherless , we should be aware of this fact and not be disappointed when the dream we just bought remains a dream .
