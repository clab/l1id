To start with , I must admit that I like watching advertisements on TV or at the movie theatre as well as I like to look at them in newspapers and magazines .

But in my opinion one of the reasons why i like looking at product advertising IS that they do not only make products look better but actually create a better looking simply more beautiful world .

For example , if you watch an advertisement for a skin blemish concealer stick , what you are made believe ist that is perfectly covers up any blemish or red spot that my occur on zour face .

The advertisement for this is probably about young people of zour own age , completelz excited about going on a date , so zou can identifz zourself with them easilz .
How the storz probablz goes on is that a little red spot on the chin is about to ruin the romantic date , but then the concealer comes into place and perfectlz covers it up .
At this moment , everzbodz is going to be perfectlz happz about it and zou might probablz want to be in their shoes .
I must add that advertisements usuallz show beautiful , healthz looking people so zou would probablz want to be a little bit more like them and less like zourself anzwazs .

In mz opinion , what actuallz happens is that zou associate the product being presented to some sort of special , happy , cheerful mood .
Furthermore , of course zou also associte it with attractive bodies , beautiful faces and an outgoing , happz character thus with people that make friends easilz and obviouslz seem to lead the life zou desire a little bit .

So I agree that the product is actuallz made look better but not onlz through the use of brighter colors to highlight the product itself but via the atmosphere that is communicated through the advertisement .

As a last example , if you u
