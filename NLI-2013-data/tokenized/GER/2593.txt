It is a widespread topic of discussion whether young or old people are more capeable of enjoying life .
To compare both oppinions , one first has to review possible advantages and disadvantages the both sides gain from their youth and their already spend lifetime , respectively .
The benefits of youth are quite obvious : A young person normaly has more energy and is in a better physical condition than an older member of the society .
Additionally , they do not have the responses coming with a job , a family and so on .

Older people on the other hand might have a major advantage : experiance .
Though they might not any longer be in a state to do what ever they want , probably due to the reasons mentioned above , they still might be able to enjoy what they are doing much more than young people do .
If you grow older , you might become a little more settled than you are in your young , `` wild '' years , that is certainly true .
But if you are able to get rid of the fear to miss something important , if you do not try to run through your life on top speed to catch every adventure you can , you might be able to make much more intense experiances .
Those might be fewer , but still more enjoyable than the superficial ones of the youth .

So the question to be answered is : what is more enjoyable ?
Many superficial or few intense experiances ?
In my oppinion the truth lies somewhere in between .
It is certainly good to live a fast life in the youth , and it is probably necessary to do so to be able to calm down when you grow older , as long as you do not overstress it .
This way you can experiance both sides .

In the end , everybody has to answer this specific question for him - or herself , there is now overall solution .
Some people might enjoy a life full of parties , travelling and action .
Others will prefer a nice home and a family , which provides hold and support a even during your old days .
Both will tell you , their way is the one to enjoy life most .
