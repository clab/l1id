Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
But I do not agree with this statement .
I will first give some reasons why one could find young people 's life more enjoyable and then explain my reasons to reject the statement .

One could think that the life of a young person is funnier and that young people are happier , because in general young people have a lot of freetime .
They often participate in sports and arts .
In addition , they go to a lot of parties meet a lot af friends .
Furthermore young people do not have as much responsibility as elder people have .
They are not yet compelled to earn their own money and sometimes they even live in their parent 's place and therefore have also less duties .

But one should not forget that while having less responsibility young people have also less rights .
They are not yet allowed to take all their important decisions on their own .
In addition , they have lot of problems to resolve , such as passing exams , discussing with parents , making plans for their life .
Especially the latter might yield a lot of struggles , doubts and fears .
Therefore , one should not forget that also for young person life is not only fun .

In my familiy I have two very good examples of people who seem to be more satisfied and happy now than they were years ago .
First I have to mention my parents .
In my opinion they are very satisfied to see their children succeed in life and they take advantage of the opportunities a life without small children offers to them .
They are travelling much more today than they did when I was younger .
Thus they are also happier in their relationship .
The same accounts for my grandparents .
Since my grandfather has retired they are travelling a great deal and I think that they are really appreciating it .

Therefore , I do not think that people are less happy later in life in comparison to their youth .
Every age has its advantages and its disadvantages .
