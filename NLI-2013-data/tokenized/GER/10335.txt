I do n't think that successful people try new things and take new risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Of course we all no famous examples of people beeing successful in making a new invention , trying new ways of buisiness or starting new directions in arts , music and literature .
But I think this is not the majority of the successful people .
I rather think that the personality of them is usually another one , which is my first point against the statement .
It is always easier to do what people accept somebody to do and to use old methods to become a successful person .
It might be sad , but it is rather likely to become successfull by using old `` tricks '' , your family background or connections .
So I think the personality of most of successful people is rather one , which uses the old ways , than one , that tries new ways .
We only sometimes think that the opposite is true , because people , which were successful in making a new invention for example are more important for other poeple and for us .
So we know them better .
And when a successful buisinessman trys for example a new trading practice , he has a better chance to make good money , because he has already a helfull background .
And once more we will hear about him more likely , althow most of successful buisinessmen would not do this .

My second important point is , that a person , which is working and living successfully has no reason for trying new methods or changing his live .
Why should such a person take a risk ?
The history shows for example , that most of the people coming to America were poor people , which had nothing to lose .
The richer ones usually stayed in there country , where they had a safe live .
