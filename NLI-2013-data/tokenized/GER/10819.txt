This essay tries to provide a closer look to the question if successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

To start with a variation of a common place : There are usually many different roads to success in a variety of fields like life , work , and business , to name the most popular ones .

When being young , people tend to explore themselves and their surroundings by ways different from the others .
Even if they are not trying new things , they imagine themselves as being different from the older ones .
For young people , this imagination can be a strong drive for achievement and enables them to take risks .
These could support them in the end up to be more successful than others .
Nevertheless , success always depends not just on oneselve but on a couple of features and factors , for example , the actings of others , I believe .
The lonesome cowboy who is just doing things his way and being successful by doing so belongs rather to the realm of dream than to everyday reality .
Adapting to the given circumstances by living in a human surrounding means to learn , to understand and to be influenced by the way other people handle things .
Moreover , human interaction and therefore the handling of everyday includes the idea of being organized in systems .
Outstanding or non-fitting elements can be excepted and exist only for a limited time before becoming unbearable .
If one knows to handle things in a successful way suiting the social and natural environment , one surely can be successful by sticking to a particular approach for a long time .
The Coca Cola Company is one of the best examples for people who know how to do well because they stick to the basic recepy of the beverage known as Coca Cola .
At the same time Coca Cola tries to do new things and takes risks by mixing new tasts and flavours .
So success always is a mixture of both , I believe : to learn from others how to do things well and to try new things and take risks .
Sometimes it is wise to tend a bit more to the one aspect and then there are times to lean to the other side - just like Goethe said : Known things and ways have to be preserved in order to see and understand new things and ways .
