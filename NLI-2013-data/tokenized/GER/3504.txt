I do n't think that spending time for this reason is not really important anymore ..
But it 's true , young people do not spend a lot of their time helping their communities .
Should they really do this ?
What for ?
There are other things they have to concentrate on , such as school and work .

A few years ago , it was probably different and it was more common to spend time helping their community , but everything is changing , for example people and life .
Young people really have to do much more than people the same age a couple of years ago .

Young people really have to work hard to finish school , to find the right job and to be sucessful in life .
There are many other things that are much more important than spending time with helping their community .
Young people should better hold on to their dreams and the government should hire people to do the work that has to do with the community .
There are so many people without work , even if it 's not the best paid job , they will be happy to find a job instead of sitting on their ass at home , watching TV without doing anything challenging .

We do n't want lazy people in our contry , the worst thing is that we have to pay for this kind of people and we do n't want that , people get angry when they think about that .
We want them to work , to work as hard as we do and to gain their own money .

I disagree with the statement above because of the facts I mentioned in this essay .
This essay definitely makes clear what I think about it , and that there is no need for young people to help in their community , because we want the government to do something !!!
