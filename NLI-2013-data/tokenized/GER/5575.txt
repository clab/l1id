Advertisments are very influental , they can form somebody 's opinion about a certain product or even change an alreday fixed opinion .
The bad thing about that is , that most often it makes products seem better than they really are .
Advertisment on TV or radio can show products from their best angle .
If you look at food for example , how perfect a hamburger from Mac Donald 's looks on TV .
Makes you feel hungry does n't it ?
Have you ever seen a hamburger look that nice in real life ?

Another example is the realty business , you can make a property , house or flat look really good on photos in magazines but if you would be able to see the house in reality it might not have a back wall !

Another point industries often make in advertisments , is the cheap prize , yellow shoes from Humanic for example , are so much cheaper than the ones from Clarks .
That kind of advertisment tempts you to buy the product because of its low cost , but if you had never heard about the product you would never have needed it at all and could have saved all the money .

Companies manufacturing cosmetic articles , cremes for example , they state what kind of ingredients they add to make your wrinkles show less or even vanish in short time .
But when you look at the laws that the cosmetic industry has to follow , something totally different is revealed .
They are not allowed to use any ingredient that changes the context of the skin .
So how is it the new anti-wrinkle creme supposed to work ?

Of course advertisment not only has bad points , it also shows you new things that have been invented and what product is the cheapest at the moment , but you have to think carefully before deciding what to buy , never believe everything that is said in the advertisments and always decide if you really need whatever is on sale .

Always take what is said in an advertisment about specific qualities of a product as a base knowledge but make enquiries and look in person at whatever you want to buy !
A beautiful gold necklace might be made to fit your daughter 's neck instead of yours !
