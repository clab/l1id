In western societies taking risks is very well known in sports for example .
One of the most risky sport actvity ist high climbing .
There are many reasons why high climbers take the risk to climb for example the mountains in the himalaya which are more than 8,000 metres high .
Some of them are fascinated by the height of the mountains but some search to find new risks because they already have climbed some lower mountains but now look for a greater challenge .
So they are trying to find out to what limits they can come to and to see whether they can handle difficult situations in the high mountains .

Another point that confirms the statement is that an activity you are doing everyday in your life , such as working in an office , sometimes makes you feel boring and you start to find a new job in another company where you can prove that you are able to deal with a variety of problems not only with one you have been working for a long time .

For successful people it is more interesting to have a great variety of activities in their job than only having the same problems for all times !
They have already managed a problem and want to go on with others because they are more curious about how to find solutions for other problems .
The people who succeeded in one task will be more self assured about their abilities and try therefore more new activities that always have the risk of failure .

Thus I think the statement that successful people take always more risks is right and understanding .
