When you ask me , if I agree or disagree this statement my answer would be : both .
On the one hand are many young people active community-members .
They help for an example in sportclubs , take care of older people or are in a political party .
All these activities support the community .
On the other hand many young people do n't care about the community .
They are a kind of egoistic and the reasons vary .
Often you hear from young people that they do n't have enough time to help their community , because they have a lot of work to do .
But I think this is not the entire truth .
Some people are afraid of taking responsibilty for something or ca n't act in teams .
Moreover they are thinking only of time or money and forget that it can be a great feeling to help others .
Mostly these people are great critics but they do n't try to improve things by helping .
My guess is they are lazy too .

Advantages of helping in your community are that you meet interesting people and learn some skills , like speaking in front of a group or teamwork , that no teacher can teach you .
Although it cost you some leisure it can be fun .

In summary I think it `` s good for your community as well as for your character to say yes to a task and help in a community .
