Communities always need help from engaged people .
They look for young people to organize a kid 's club or choirs for example .
But communities nowadays have trouble finding young engaged people to help them with their work , I agree with this statement .

To my mind , some young people are very engaged in community work and are willing to help other people , even today .
But in general , I think , young people are more interested in meeting friends , doing sports or work in a job , where they are able to earn extra money .

To my mind , young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
One reason , why they are not willing to help in a communtity may be , because it is a lot of work , but they usually will not get money for their work .

Another reason why young people are not interested in doing community work is because they may seem boring and less exciting to their peers .
Young people nowadays have to risk something and have to do fun things to be accepted from their peer group .

In my opinion , not only the young people nowadays play an important role in not helping the community , but the communities themselves have to become more interesting for young people .
They could make the jobs they have to offer more appealing to young people by honoring their work in front of the whole community with certificates , for example .
Another point is , that communities could organize more meetings for young people who help .
They could offer trips to those and they could try to engage a lot of friends to do the work together .
So , not only young people have to be more engaged , but also do communities have to be more creative in order to get young people 's attention .

All in all , I can say that on the one hand , young people have to show more respect towards their community and be willing to help , but on the other hand communities have to make their work attractive to young people .
