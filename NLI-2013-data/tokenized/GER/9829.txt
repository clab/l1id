I think that it 's not always possible to generalize on psychological topics so , personally , I would neither agree nor disagree with the statement .
I would rather say that it depends on individual situations .

Take the case of a successful enterpreneur who built up a business in a steady industry without taking risks , and maximized his profits this way .
From his experince he learned that things go well without changes .
It is unlikely that he is inclined to change his mind after having success with not taking risks .
Although he 's successful !

Or take the case of someone speculating on stock prices .
He has learned , that if you hesitate too long , your profits will be below expectations since stock markets underlie extreme fluctuations .
Such a person would take risks if he is successful .

On the other side there are people who are inspired by their success to try out new things .
They are not satisfied with the goals they reached so far and thus think of themselves as capable to reach enw horizons .
Also , as they reach a certain degree of excellence , and build up stong basis of existing business relationships they become more confident to make a risky decision or try to walk a new path .
There will be always that `` net '' to catch them if they fall .

However , as personal relationships are concerned , I think that truly successful people who are happy with their partner , who have found someone they love , someone to rely upon , are unlikely to take risks unless there are desires buried deep inside of their minds .
But it such case those people are n't exactly successful but rather hypocritic .

In fact , success is often based on learning from mistakes made in the past .
The only way to make mistakes and gain experience is actually taking risks and trying out new things .
This would support the idea that successful people are more open to risks since they know that the best learning is often learning from mistakes , sometimes your own .
