I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Herefore there are several arguments , which I would like to present as following .

At first we have to keep in mind , that technology is a rapid process .
Every day there are new inventions and new possibilities , which are offered to the consumer .
The consumer sees these new inventions and comes to the conclusion , that he must have this product .
The automobile sector is a every day growing sector which offers these new inventions in form of faster cars or intelligent navigation systems for the driver .
There is nowadays even the possibility to watch tv , while using the car .
These new inventions lead to the impression , that a car is not only good for transportation .
In the contrary , it is used as a status symbol .
As a result more people want to posses such technological advanced cars for represanting their status to their environment .

Another reason might be , that people want to be independent while they are voyaging or driving to work .
When using busses , trains or planes delays occur , which cause an insatisfaction and lead to the impression , that public transport possibilities are not as good as the own car .
With the own car people can decide when they want to start the voyage , without being dependent on bus schedules or routes .

Of course , the decrease of using cars , has and will have a big disadvantage .
The pollution of the environment .
The more cars are used , the more it is effecting on the enviroment .
Trees , animals and plants will not have their special environment any longer , which they need for a perfect growth .
The air is polluted and the life expectancy of the people declines as more cars are on the streets .

Nevertheless cars will never disappear from our lifes .
