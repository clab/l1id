A guided travel group seems attractive to many people , and for obvious reasons .
You will , if all goes well , travel with likeminded people , you know ahead of time what you will be seeing and that your hotel will be reasonably clean , you often pay less for group travel than if you plan individually , and you have fewer safety concerns .
Finally , you expect to have a knowledgeable guide who will not only know the local language and provide extensive information about the area you will be visiting but will also help navigate the gritty organizational details that crucially affect whether you will have a good travel experience .

However , travel groups have their problems .
There may be clashes between group members , and if you are not extremely lucky , you will have a lot of forced socializing .
There will be little discovery or surprise to your trip , most likely you will learn nothing of the foreign language , and it will be virtually impossible to change your itinerary once you have started out .
Often , group travel will limit your exposure to foreign cultures because package deals are streamlined , usually not for authenticity but for profit .
Maybe the most critical issue is the guide .
You do not know what kind of person you will get ; if you are unlucky , he or she will be insensitive , ill-informed , and generally badly organized .
Tour guides are not well paid , so the chances to get one with a passion for good guiding is rare .

I think the decision which to choose depends very much on the personality of the traveler .
If you enjoy meeting new people and do n't mind the streamlining , then group travel is a nice way to keep your budget low .
On the other hand , if you 're a hardcore individualist , you will not want to consider it .
That is more or less where I stand : I love wandering off into side streets and being face to face with the unfamiliar .
I also like exploring new languages , even if I have to improvise .
I would travel in a group only if I wanted to go to a country where safety , for me as a woman or generally , would be a serious concern for an individual traveler .
