I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
There are many reasons why young people enjoy their life more

One reason why young people enjoy life more than older people is that they do n't worry about everything .
Young people mostly only think from one day to the other and do n't make any future plans .
Like getting a stable job to feed a family .
Mostly they wo n't have a family until their mid thirties .

Another reason why young people enjoy life more than older people is because they are independent .
Their entire thinking is different from old people .
They do n't choose a job only because of the salary they also want to have a fullfilling job which is challenging .
A job which offers further options maybe to work in a different country .
Nowadays young people work to live on - older people live to work .
While older people think about security young people sometimes just quit their job if they are not satisfaied anymore .

The third reason why young people enjoy life more than older people is because the have more options to enjoy themselves .
There are plenty of free time activities they can go to .
There many clubs , bars etc. which meet young people 's interestes .
Whereas there are only a few clubs or bars where old people can go to without getting stared at .
Young people are able to go almost anywhere they want to without any age limits .

All together young people have plenty of reasons to enjoy life more than older people .
