The `` fun generation '' has been critisized a lot in the recent years .
Elderly people complain that young people do not care enough for the community as a group of people living together in one place .
Young people are often told not to spend so much time in front of video games or in the internet .
Indeed , interaction on a local basis has decreased though it will never cease to exist because people will always be physical .
So there will always be some kind of involvement in local communities interactions .
But there is one aspect that elderly people easily neglect .
The ways that young people nowadays get involved in communities and work in networks .
Parts of the lives of young people have become virtual .
There are these gamers on the one hand who built the image of the fun seeking kids and young adults that do not seem to care for anyhing rather than killing people virtually .
But one the other hands there are obvious communites in the internet that communicate and help each other .
These most often use the virtual community to get involved in stuff like promoting their sportsteam , building websites to promote ideals , setting up agendas appointments , discussing political issues in certain online coummunities and of course to chat with each other .
The internet has become a tool to make physical live easier and much more convinient .
People do not became self centered lonely people .
In contrast many of the younger generation helped their family members to become part of network communities or even showed them how to use these new technologies properly .
I do not know how often I advised my parents how to work with computers .
Lifestyles have shifted due to new working requirements and technologies that made this possible .
Young people do not fear new technologies while older people do .
This has always to be considered when judging this topic .
Thus the question should not be if young people do not give enough time for their local communities but `` do older people accept that the lifestyle has changed ? ''
.
