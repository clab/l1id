No Risk , No Fun !

I believe that the statment `` Successful people try new things and tak risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do '' is a very wise adice .
It seems that people with a new business tend to play on the safe side , instead of taking risks .
It is often argued that if one makes changes in a slower manner , one 's business will be safe and success will be guaranteed .
It may be a slow process , but it is safe .
Unfortunately , people that have such thinking also tend to forget that playing on the safe side , will not guarantee success .
There is not one method or formula that leads to succes .
Such thing does not exist .
With every decision we make , we take a risk .
If one truly `` plays on the safe side '' , there are no changes made .
Every single time that we make a choice , me make a risk .

So , if even playing on the safe side , turns not out to be so safe after all , why sould one not go for the whole ?
Taking risks and playing with new ideas and sturctures , can be very helpful to a successful business .

The odds of failing by taking a risk , can high or low , it depends completly on a particular situation .
You should not forget that the outcome of someone who is taking a chance , and is succeeding , will be much more valuble , than from someone who took the `` easy '' and `` safe '' way of making very small changes over time .

If you would graph the failures and success of two different businesses , one who makes small changes , or even none , over a long period of time , and then of another business who is making constant changes and is playing with their possibilities and the freedom they have available , you will see that business one will have a postivie rising curve , and that business two will have a line that in - and decreases from time to time .
But eventually if you would compare these graphs , business two will be the one with the most success .

If you want to have a successful business , you have to go beyond your knowledge and experience and be willing to discover new , and perhpas , even better methods and structures .
