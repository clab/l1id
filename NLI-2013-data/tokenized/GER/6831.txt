I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Cars come along with people .
So I think the best way how to approach that topic is to startt with the population in 2026 .
We will have to face dramatic population changes all over the world .
While in Europe and the United States the population density will decrease , Asia and Africa will grow to an , till now , unbelieveable size .

Talking about Africa and Asia , we talk about a mainly poor part of the world .
Growing up in Europe and having had the chance to work in Asia extensively , I experienced first hand the fascination of cars on poor people .
Having cars getting cheaper , and if you consider the latest products from China , it will not take long to have a big part of the Chinese changing from bicyle to car .
India , that is following right after China will be next , followed by African countries etc .

To actually reduce the number of cars , an environmental awarness has to take part .
This already started to happen in Europe and the US and seeing the great increase of ZIP/Cars , car sharing and the efforts cities undertake to provide a convenient and reliable network for public transportation , we are just entering the right way .
A recent survey from BMW makes clear that the number of cars in the US and Europe will pretty much stay the same , only the environmental performance of the car , like alternative fuel vehicles etc. will get better .

In Asia and Africa this point is far down the road .
First the desire for wealth , that mostly includes a car , needs to be satisfied .
After going through the whole process of thinking about the environmental impact of cars on the world of our children , this may change to a `` better city , better life '' which is also the theme for the Expo 2010 in Shanghai .
We only can hope that Asia surprises with the high speed to get on less cars as it does in the current high speed urbanism .

You also need to question yourself where the old and worn out cars from Europe and the States go to .
Not all end up at a junkyard .
I remember that the old Volvo of my father has been sold by the car dealer to Namibia because there are no regulations and technical checks required by any authority .
So in some way with our behaviour in the Western World we contribute to the increase of cars in the world .

We only can hope that the postfossil time will bring alternate and more social ways of travelling and transportation and that one day we have to go to a museum to explain the word `` car '' to our grandchildren .
