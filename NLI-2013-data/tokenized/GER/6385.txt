I do n't agree that there will be less cars in use in twenty years comparing to today .

The history of car production and of ownership of a car shows that the amount of cars is rising and rising .
Ok you can say : `` But the bad enviromental situation will lead to less cars and more to alternativs like public buses and subways ! ''
But in my opinion this is not the way people will think .

The most highest values for most of the modern people living today are mobility and flexibilty .
You can go where ever you want , when ever you want !

Further than that : you HAVE to be flexible .
It 's important for your job and to catch up with the speed the world is running .

For example : I 'm working as a cinematographer since several years for different broadcast stations .
The medium of television became so fast during the last 15 to 20 years because there were such important inventions like mobile phones and the internet .
You can react on certain news much more faster than some years ago .
When the medium is becoming faster the people who are feeding the medium have to become faster .
Following this line it is important to be flexible .
One way to be flexible is to have a car .
So at the end the circle is closed .

On the other hand it is a must for the people to think about alternatives next to the using of cars .
The raising of the amount of cars on the street will lead to a traffic-collaps .
In this case the gouvernment is also in charge to support alternative ways of transportation .
This can be in spending money on traffic research projects or in supporting scientists who are developing new ways of energy supplies for cars .

At the end it will lead to more cars but with alternative ways of running them .
Fuel - and diesel-driven cars should be reduced and instead of this solar , hybrid - or hydrogenic-based vehicles should be supported .
