An argument can be made for both of the opinions , to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects as well as to be specialized on one single subject .

Having a broad knowledge offers you the possibility to talk and debate with a lot of different persons about several topics .
This is a nice way to communicate with people and , doing it , even to gain additional knowledge .

Furthermore this shows that you have a good general knowledge , which is valued highly in our well-informed society .

Finally , if you have an overview and the knowledge about several academic topics , it is easier for you to decide what interests you the most and , consequently , choose this subject as your specific subject .

However , a case may be made for the opposing view , because if you were perfect informed about a single subject , you are able to concentrate on it and gain more knowledge in this main subject .
As a result you will have the possibility to become a master in this specific subject .

Additionally it would be much easier for you to learn the subject you specifiy in , because choosing it as your main subject you have to have a special interest in it and if a person is intersted in something it is much easier to gain new information on the topic .

Another advantage is that you might have better opportunities to find the right job for you .
Since it is easier to look for a job in the newspaper , which suits your specific abilities , you might have a better opportunity to find the perfect job for you and to impress your later supervisor by presenting the exact capabilities he was searching for .
You simply know on which strength you can relie .

In conclusion , I believe that both is very important .
In my view , you should have a broad knowledge of a lot of academic subjects but in the end and referring to job opportunities it depends on what you are able to do very good in a specific direction .
