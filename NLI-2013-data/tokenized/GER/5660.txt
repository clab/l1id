I certainly agree to the statement and there are conspicuous examples which make me believe this way .

Firstly it is anchored in the `` nature '' of advertisements that they make products seem much better as they are .
You must only ask yourself some quite simple questions .
What are the intentions of the advertisement making people ?
Why are there advertisements in nearlly every places all over the world ?
and so on .
The explanation can be introduced by only one single word : `` Money ! ''
.
Do n't belive advertisements have been evolved to inform people about the best products , they have been evolved to make you buy a product without regarding its quality .

There are several examples .
For instance if you want to buy a fat-burner you will find a lot of different products all promising achievements in a very short period of time , but if you try them out there will be nearly no achievement at all .
Moreover the advertisement has fulfilled its purpose , because you have bought the product .
An other example is advertisement for cigaretts .
Think about the notorious Marlboro-Country and ask yourself if you really feel like a cowboy enjoying the lonelyness and endlessness of the prarie when smoking a Marlboro .
This example leads to the next paragraph .

Advertisements want to present their product in the most typical way with refernces to the consumer .
Let me explain this a little bit more .
Would a company which sells tuning parts for cars let play the main role of there spot by a gay guy .
Definately not !
There would by promiscuous women as well as `` real-men '' representing the product because it would be more convincing to the people buying these products than a gay guy .
So the advertisement exists in a reciprocal relationship with the consumer .
This is necessary if the advertisement making people want to reach their goal .
To make you buy their product .

As a conclusion I would like to assert that the advertisement which represents its product objectively does not exist .
