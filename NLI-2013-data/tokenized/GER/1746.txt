The point at issue is to discuss wheather or not it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specefic subject .
So the question is , if it is preferable to have a broad common knowledge in order to be prepared for a wide variety of issues or to have special knowledge in a certain field .

I disagree with that statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than of one specific subject .
I disagree , because I think it is essential to figure out where someone is especially talented and then to support this quality .

I think it is important to focus on a specefic subject and the knowledge which is connected to it .
Most people have some common knowledge about several topics but only a few have a deeper understanding of a broad spectrum .

As I mentioned in the beginning I think it is better to focus on a specific subject and try to improve in this area .
People are talented and advanced in different fields of life and so it is important to improve where one is good at , rather than trying to develop skills that someone else might have by nature .
For example , when someone is very skilled in mathmatics i might be good for him to specialize this object , rather to try to improve in a field that differs completely .

In conclusion i would say , that it is good to have broad knowledege in general , but for academic reasons I think it is important to be aware of specific deep understanding in one subject .
