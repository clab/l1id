In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
I am not able to support this point of view , ` though I wish I were ( for I do not only have no use for a car myself , but I also cars as being one of the major factors that cause the greenhouse effect and global warming ) .

I will ( try to ) mention several possible arguments supporting the assumption that the number of cars will decrease , opposing each and evry one of them right away .
After that , I will try to establish further arguments emphasizing my point of view .

A traditional argument for the vanishing of cars has always been the worry about sufficient fuel supply .
Considering the need for oil on the planet and the fact this natural resource is a limited one , either the number of cars will have to decrease ( for there will soon be no more fuel to run them ) or there will be new inventions in the field of motor vehicles ( such as hybrid or solar cars ) .
The latter has been a great wish of ecologically-conscious people .
Nevertheless , car lobbies ( trying to maintain their traditional market ) as well as oil lobbies ( trying to sell their last barrels of oil before they have to look for other occupations ) counteract such developments - with great success .
There has not been a considerable evolution regarding motor vehicles which could end the dependency on oil : hybrid cars , for example , still use fossil fuel ( for otherewise they were ` pure ' ) ; solar cars on the contrary do n't have the ` performance ' which is demanded an wanted from a car .
Still , the former alternative may be relevant : The end of oil .
Opposing this argument , one has to mention that oil companies ( as stated above ) will attempt to sell all the oil available on the planet , which will take another 50 years approximately .
Therefore , until oil 's gone , the cars remain and they 'll remain at least another 50 years .

Another argument is that of the development of public transport , which is very easy to answer by referring to the countless remote places and regions on the planet , which will hardly ever be supplied with public transportation vehicles such as trains or busses .

One rather sophisticated argument , the one I consider the most rational one , is the reference to the social ( infra ) structure of large cities , which makes cars often aviodable , e.g. by using subways or monorails .
Yet , there are more than 6 billion people on the planet .
Not all of them can inhabit such highly-developed cities and are therefor dependent on cars .

To my very own mind , a very decisive argument is that cars do not only fulfil a purpose of trnsportation , but tey are also considered as status symbols .
People want to ` show off ' with their cars .
This need hav made ecocologally-poor companies like GM so successful , and in my mind must be a major argument for cars maintaining a plague on our planet .
