I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people because I think that the definition of `` enjoying life '' is very subjective and changes during life .

At first let me talk about the subjectiveness of enjoying life .
There are so many different kinds of people all over the world .
Enjoying life can mean to have a great job and a carrier rising up .
But there are also people who think that nobody can enjoy life while working .
Another example are children .
On the one hand there are couples who never want to have children , on the other hand a family can consist of the parents and five children and everybody is glad to live within such a big family .
What I wanted to say is , that enjoying life cannot be putted into a definition to test out if somebody is enjoying his or her life because it matches this definition .

Another point is , that certain feelings or activities which could be defined as part of a joyful life , change during life .
Young people who are going to school or university like parties and dancing and most of them doing a lot of sports .
They have hobbies and activities they are participating in and friends they meet with .
These things help them to enjoy their lifes .
Older people for example between seventy and eighty years enjoy their lifes in a different way .
They are glad if everybody is healthy , they maybe like watching television and drinking a glass of wine in the evening .

What I wanted to point out is that people enjoy their lifes in many different way .
What way it is depends on their personality and their age .
That is why I disagree with the statement .
I do not think that young people are happier than older ones .
They are only enjoying life in a different way .
