I do not agree to the mentioned statement in whole that young people nowadays do not spend enough time to help in their community .
I have made different experiences .
On the one hand there are these young people who do not spent a lot of time or no time in a community at all .
These people are self-centred about theirselfes and their lives because they have everything they need by now and are happy with that .
A lot of them do not want to join or help in community because they think it is too much work and they like spending their free time on other things .
A negative thing is that the most of them do not know that helping in a community is not just work but also fun because they never experienced it or heard it diffenrent from others .

But on the other hand there are those young people who are helping in communities and also join them .
These people like to be in contact to members of their community and like to work together and make experiences together aswell as having fun and a good time together .

There are various opportunities in a community where you can help at if it is in church or in school or in vacation trips and many other opportunities .
These youngsters like to spend their time , also their free time , with a lot of people that have the same interests .

They want to improve things or make things like church to other people more interesting .

In my opinion there are about the same number of people that are helping in a community and not .
I have this opinion because I know a lot of people who are active in a community but also know a few that are not even member in a community .

In my mind it also depends on the size of the city .
In smaller cities young people are probably more interested in community than in bigger cities .
