To answer this question I will first give you some ideas from the business area , as I think that this is the ideal environment to prove that successful people try new things and take a lot of risks .

As you can see on daily news , a lot of people invented successful new products for example like the google founders .
But these people also had a high risk in not succeeding .

So , I think that you can only have a lot success if you try new things and take all the risks this might include .

One reason why I believe this is , because consumers are all looking for new not already existing things .
They want to be more and more unique and seen as individuals so you should not copy an already existing product but create a real new one .
If you take the Tamagotchi as an example , the developer had some producing costs , but he took this risk and was successful , because he developed a completely new product which people looked for .
Therefore , by trying out somenthing new he was really successful and generated a high return on investment in his new idea .

Furthermore , I think that by trying out something new you will learn a lot about how things work .
Of course you will make mistakes , but you will not do them again if they occur the next time .
For example , if you take a baby that has touched a hot oven , you can be sure it will never touch it again , because it has experienced the negative effect of burning his or her hand .

Finally , your life will be more interesting if you always try something new instead of doing all things in the same boring way .
You might gain a lot more life experience and you will develop into a real interesting person .
For example , on parties you can always talk about the things you just did and you will be respected by the other people for the courage that you demonstrated and therefore , you will be considered as a successful person .

In conclusion , these are the main reasons why I think that successful people try new things and take risks is the better option .
