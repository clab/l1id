I disagree with the statement that successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks .
If I ran a business , I would not take risks because I think it is not worth losing money .
The possible loss would probably do bigger harm than a gain of money would do good .

In these days it seems to be crucial to know which risks to take and which not .
Yet it is my belief that sticking with a good technique , maybe one inherited by a family member that hat run the company for a long time , can be more efficient than blindly putting everything at risk .

Always changing strategies to the newest model will not work as efficientlz as will a good plan that is realized over a long period of time without interruption .
Of course , this way of managing will not make a company rich quickly .
But in my opinion , it is better to start slowly and work thoroughly , than risking not only money and time , but also jobs and finally the most important of all , the company itself .

An other example is education .
I could have gone to school less years , compared to the rest of the family .
I would have tried something new .
But with this new and very risky move I could neither count on the support of my peers , nor would I have an idea about what to do .
I would be helpless .
Chances are , that probably other people could succeed in such a situation , but I am absolutely positive that for me , the `` safe way '' is the better opportunity .

All together I find it more logical and mature to stick to known procedures that do work in everyday life .
If somebody risks something , he or she can gain a lot on the one hand , but on the other hand , it is also possible to lose a lot .
And losing a lot cannot be called successful .
