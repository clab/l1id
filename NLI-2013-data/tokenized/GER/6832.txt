Talking about the future is always a very difficult thing to do .
So to decide wheter there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years one has to discuss several aspects that may influence this gesture .
Firs step , there is the definition of cars .
If cars have to have an engine that uses fossial sources , I am sure that there will be fewer cars in the future , even when talking about such a short point in the future as twenty years .

If also other sorts of powering a car are within this definition I will need some more steps .
Second step is the aspect of population .
Up to now the growing of the world 's population is said to maintain the way it does .
If that will still be true in twenty years we will definitely have fewer cars .

As an example take Vienna , the city I live in .
Roads and cars , and parkings spaces need that much space in the city , that the space for houses and people walking is limited .
So if there are more people , I suppose they will need more space , and therefore this space has to be gained by abolishing , or at least deminuating roads .

Third step is to think of other sorts of transportation and their progress .
Undergrounds are already part of almost all big cities and their positive influence is obvious .
If there is no negative trend , thinking of security within public places , caused by sustaining terror threats , this means of transport will have its effect to decrease the number of cars .

Trains also may become much more important than they are today .
I suppose this since I think of the growing size of the suborbs .
More people need more space , which results in longer distances to the working places , which have to be passed by faster .
So if technology mangages to control higher speed and can ensure this by a higher security standard , trains will overtake the car 's function for taking people from and to their working place .

So as an conclusion I suppose that in twenty there will be fever cars than there are today , since at least on of the aspects above will become true .
