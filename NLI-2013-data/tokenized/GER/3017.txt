First of all , there has to be a definition of `` young '' and `` old '' .
A twenty-year old person will consider himself as being `` old '' when he compares his age to that of a newborn .
On the other hand , a 70 year-old person will think of the 20 year old person as being `` young '' .

I assume that the statement on the left thinks of people in their twenites or thirties as `` young people '' and that seniors at the age of around 60 are referred to as `` old people '' .

I believe that it is impossible to make a `` Yes '' or `` No '' decision on that question .
Of course , the general idea of `` enjoying life '' is that of having parties , drinking alcohol , making new friends and not having any concerns about the future .
All of these activities are much more typical of younger people than of older people .
Younger people simply do n't spend too much time thinking about the future , they `` live for the moment '' .
In that regard , the statement on the left is right .

Once people have grown , they tend to take on more responsibilities and duties in their lifes .
Older people have to supply some financial income , maybe not only for themselves , but also for their family .
They have to take care of their social life which seems a lot more complicated than in the younger days , and they might also have growing concerns about their health .
All of these factors do n't really make it `` fun '' to be older .

On the other hand , being old also means being wiser .
When you 've reached a certain age , you are able to define the true values of life .
And generally , these values are not parties , alcohol or superficial friendships .
The true values are much more intimate .
They are in things like having one best friend , being rewarded at work or just being loved by your partner or your kids .
Having a loving wife for example can be the best `` fun '' you 'll ever have in your life , although people normally would n't call it `` fun '' , but `` fullfillment '' instead .

But this detail would lead to another discussion about the definition of `` fun '' .
My conclusion is , that - just as life does - the definition of `` enjoying life '' changes during the years of a lifetime .
