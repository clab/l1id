I can not really agree with the statement .
In my oppinion it is better to be specialized in one specific subject than to have a knowledge of many academic subjects .
I think in todays world companies want people to know everything about the area they work in .
What should a company do with someone how knows from everything a bit but does not really have fundamental knowledge about a certain area .

That is also a reason why I decided to study a specialiced subject .
I for examble study international finance which is a small part of the big economical area .
I think for myself that this decicon the best was I ever did .
Because their are so many people who study economics I mean good they may have a broad knowledge about all areas but at the end they would not be able to understand the financial sector as good as I can .
As far I know companys are looking specially for people from the financial sector which are specialized in that field .

Which advantages and disadvantages would it have ?
On the on side with a broad knowledge you might be more flexible .
Because those people could work in all economical areas they want .
On the other side I am not sure if a broad knowledge is enough to fullfil your aims and make the big money .
You can work in all economical areas but to became at top manager you should know about the fiel you are about to manage .

That is a advantage me with only a specialized knowledge .
I would know about the area I am about to manage and would know how to handle the problems which might occur .
A disadvantage really is that I am really stucked onto the financial sector .
If I want work I am not that flexible like I would be with a broad knowledge .

But If I add up all those disadvantage and advantage it is still good for me to be only specialized in one subject .
I may only have this oppinion because I am very interested in that area I am study .

But figures do not lie companys at the end prefer specialised employees .
