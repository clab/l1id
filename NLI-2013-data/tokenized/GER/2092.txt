I would rather agree with that statement .
At the beginning I better define what I mean by saying `` young people '' and `` old people '' .
Young people are in the age of 15 to 30 and old people could be considered as older than 50 years .
Of course there is a gab in between , but like in most discussions there is not only a black and white scheme , but also a `` grey '' in between .

Well , first of all , in my perception young people are simply more active than older people .
This is truly a obvious argument , but why is that ?
Young people are more curious and less experienced .
Because of this they feel more demand to go out , discover , making new experiences .
They are still more in a process of personal development than older people are .
Speed is a signifacant reference for that .
An example - young people fell in love more often and probably have more relationships than people have in older days .
They discover much more streams of the `` Zeitgeist '' , which means they develop new forms of expression like new music styles , fashion , computer gaming and new kinds of behaviour like flashmobbing or exchange via internet .
Despite the fact that young people have less money to spend than older people , they are trying out new ways of travelling and doing party .
Older people are in general less open to new developments .
They are often not able to keep up with all new streams and developments in society .
They are embedded in their normal day situation which often only consists of business and family .
Their social activities and sport activies more or less follow the same patterns .

Of course it is possible to older people to enjoy their lifes too , but they often wait too long until starting with that .
In their older days they are often handicaped and unable to to what they always wanted to to , to go out and feel young again .
This might be quite frustrating .

To sum up I would clearly argue that young people are doing much more activity than older people .
and they are less defined by their jobs , a family , a duty or handicaped by their physical abilities .
