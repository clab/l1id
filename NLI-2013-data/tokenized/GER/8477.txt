I think it is more important for a student to understand conceots and ideas then to learn facts by heard .

This is because of some simpel reasons .
It might be better for a student to learn facts , dates and results because thats the teacher askes for .
But in real life , this means the life after school , the time you need to work for your money to survive , it is better to undestand things .
A person not able to understand what she or he is doing is not able to develop an idea to find mistakes and eliminate them .

A person who is able to do this would be much more succesful in her/his job , just because of being able to make the way of working more effective .
In school this kind of understanding and finding solutions on problems should be teached .
Another point of why a theme should be understood is because of fun .
Fun motivates to go on , to do more .
For some persones it might be perfect to lern by haert , but most of them get bored .
The more effective way is to support the wish of people to understand ( who deos not know the most frequently asked question of a child : `` Why ? '' )
.

While supporting this whish , by it is more easy to motivate someone for some topic even if it is a theme with a lot of facts .
I my self support this fact absolutly .
In school I had in 2 years two differnt teachers in physiks .
The first one was not realy motivated and asked us to work with the book and in exams we had to summarise what we have read .
My second teacher was round about the same age , but totally differnt .
1. he loved to teach and his methods were much different .
He did experiments and so on .
The first teacher gave me 5 points ( max15 ) the second one is still my teacher and made me choose physiks as the subject I like to study , just by motivating me .
The result were 15 points in the final exam .

These two points show and my small story show why I think that it is really important to make students understands what they learn .
