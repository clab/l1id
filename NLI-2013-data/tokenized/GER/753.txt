A broad knowledge of many academic subjects is surely useful and to a certain point also necessary .
However , I do not think it is better than a specialization to a certain field .
I think a mixture of both points is the best way .
In other words , a trade-off between broad and specialized knowledge is necessary nowadays .

The basis of a broad knowledge is already made in school .
All the children become the same eduction and have to pass the same test .
By doing so , the students are prepared for different future scenarios in life and they also become an overall picture about the world .
For example , the students at school do not only learn maths and language , but also biology , chemistry , histroy etc ..
Thus they get a good understanding about the relations in their environment .
Consequently , a broad knowledge is very important and also necessary .

On the other hand , the information input increases with the age .
Hence , after a certain stage in life a human being is not able to gain all available information .
Additionally , each job requires specialized knowledge .
Consequently , a person has to choose which information is more important and useful for his future life .
For example , after school a student has to decided what he want to do with his life and he has to answer several questions .
What kind of job I want to do ?
What are my main interest ?

To sum up , I think that it is import to have both , broad and specialized knowledge .
The broad one to get a overall picture of the world and to understand its important relations .
The specialized knowledge is necessary and not less important .
