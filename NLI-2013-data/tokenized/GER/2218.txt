The comparison between the life of two different generations is always difficult , but it is possible to find reasons enough for living in both ages .
I think , that the youth has more advantages .
First there are physical parameters , such as the use of muscles , which allows young people to do much more than older people .
Furthermore older people have usually more deseases and are not strong enough to do what ever they want to do .

Another interesting point is the way of thinking .
Young people have not to think about money or insurance .
They have their mothers , who buy the food , clean their room and their clothes .
The only problem for people at this age could be possibly the school , but it weights less if I think about older people , who have to get jobs .
Older people have to think about money every day because their responsability for their family is extraordinary .

A third point is the possability for adults to make what they want .
For example they can study what thezbuy what they want .
Simply they have much more choices than younger people .

Finally if I could choose , I would like to be young because I like it to do some activities , which I cannot do when I become older .
