I can assent this statement due to several reasons .
The purpose of advertisement has ever since been the attraction of e.g. a potential buyer of a product .
In the first resort , the advertisement has to gain the attention and subsequently the interest of this person for a certain product .
Consequently , it has to be special in any way , e.g. concerning the pictures or the text used in it , and to receive a positive evaluation from a mass of persons since this is one of the reasons most products are made of - to sell as much as possible .

Especially in the two last decades an advertisement industry has been developped and constantly grown up to it 's huge influence nowadays .
Apparently no products are introduced and positioned on the market without an advertisement strategy - this claim is easily verified by just watching TV a few minutes or by a gaze into the newpaper where advertisement is omnipresent .
On account of this omnipresence and requirement of advertisement , the product industry spends a vast amount of money for the advertising of it 's products .
The advertisement industry , whose basis of existence is the extraordinary advertisement for a certain product as already described in the first paragraph , thus tries to depict the products they advertise as good as possible , which is definitely reasonably .
But the problem lies in the system within : the quality of a product will inevitably be exhibited as almost unequalled and it 's deficincies as solely a kind of drop in the ocean and not worth mentioning in the advertisement .
Thus , potential buyers are easily lured to a certain product and not cognizant of it 's flaws since these are nowhere shown .
For instance , if a model like Naomi Campell makes an advertisement for a mascara , millions of females would probably think : `` Oh , if someone like Naomi Campell , this beautiful model , uses this mascara , I definitely can rely on her judgement and buy it because it must be wonderful . ''
What most people would not take into consideration is the fact that Naomi Campell does not advertise for this product on account of her convinction of it 's qualitiy but rather due to the money she is paid by the industry to advertise it .
