Frankly , as long as we will not develop little spaceships to fly around - which I do n't see happening within the next twenty years - I do n't think there will be fewer cars on this earth ever again .

It is a proven fact that the amount of cars we use , and most of all the emissions those cars cause impose a big threat to our environment .
And although there is a lot of misperception today I am sure that there will be a much higher concern about environmental issues in twenty years .
But this is , what will mainly happen in industrial states .

We should not forget about the devoloping countries that start to take off now .
I personally hope that they will manage to thrive further on , and increase their economical potential as well as living standards .
But this usually implies a technological advance .
People in India , China and eventually Africa will need to get to work , will want to travel and will demand cars .
Lots of them .
Even if they do not reach western standards , where it is normal to keep a couple of cars per household , their mere number of inhabitants will boost car demand .

I do think though , that in twenty years there will be a difference in how cars work .
I am sure that environmental concerns will be high , that people will have seen the importance to get independend from fossile fuels , and that cars will be developed that need less energy and additionally run on electricity , solar batteries , hydrogen , water , biological waste - or some new idea .
They will be cleaner , more efficient and probably even run silently .
There might also be an attempt to foster alternative means of transportation , like public means , bikes or trains .
But this developement I rather see in industrial states .

To put things in a nutshell , I think that in industrial states there will be less as well as cleaner cars .
While developing states catch up there will be a much higher demand for cars , and also the necessary wealth to purchase them .
This , I think , leaves us with an equal or rather higher amount of cars in twenty years , than we have today .

I do hope though , that there will be better and cleaner cars on the market than the ones we use today .
And I also hope that people in todays developing countries will be able to move along and start with the new technologies , and are not turning into a huge graveyard for our old , polluting cars .
