I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

In my view there are a variety of arguments to support this statement :

First of all young people do not have as much duties as older people have .
The do not really have to think about how to feed their families or how to raise and educate their childs .

Consequently in my opinion young people have a lot more flexibility .
For example when I want to go on holidays to visit some of my friends in Spain and can do it .
As a unmarried student I do not have to ask a wife or a boss for the permission .

Furthermore young people have more leisure time .
You can not compare the time people spend at work with the time young people have to be present in school or university .
Even when preparation time is added a regular job takes far more time .
According to my personal experiences my leisure time and especially my holidays are twice as long as those from my father .

Moreover young people are often in a better condition than older people .
For me it is important to do as much sports as possible .
I really enjoy to keep myself in shape and to train a lot .
With regard to my father or my grandfather I noticed that older people are often injured or can not accomplish their own expectations .
I recognized that this fact is every disappointing especially for my grandfather who had been an excelent sportsman .

Taking everything into account I think that my years at school and university would propably be the best of my entire life .
Therefore I am a little bit scared of growing older and be confronted with the presented disadvantages .
