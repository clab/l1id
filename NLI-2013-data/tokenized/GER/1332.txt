If one considers the question of whether it is of more advantage to have a broad spectrum of knowledge in many different areas or whether it is more advisible to concentrate it in one small field , one important distinction needs to be made .
The answer to this question is different depending upon whether one considers a person with the ultimate goal of pursuing a professional career in business or whether the focus is on someone that intends to stay in the academic field in order to perform research and teach .
The answer to the former case is that yes , for the businessman it is more advantageous to have a broad knowledge ; for the latter subject , the academic , a more narrow focus is preferential .
The reasons for that shall be illuminated below ; the two types discussed shall be referred to as the `` professional '' and the `` academic '' , respectively .

For the professional , it is crucial to have a broad knowledge in different areas since in his everyday life , he will constantly be faced with situations involving very diverse topics .
In order to understand these , and more importantly , to link these together , that wisdom will duly serve him .
Imagine for example an executive at a multinational company : how is he to understand the needs of his customers ( and his employees ) of different nationality if he does n't know about their cultural background ?

The second main point where his broad knowing will assist him is in general problem-solving .
Whenever one learns about a new subject , no matter which field is concerned , one is subconsciously exposed to the techniques of attacking problems in the respective field : the more different fields one has seen , the broader the base from which one can choose the tactics to solve one 's own problems .
When a CEO of a large company makes a strategic consideration , the process that takes place in his mind subconsciously was obtained in some random academic area he had once studied at school , and that structure of thought serves him very well in that situation .

However , also the professional needs to excert diligence : if one exaggerates the amount of different subjects studied , one will end up with unconnected , loose , random facts that serves neither for common knowledge nor for problem-solving .

The second type under consideration is the academic : his or her ultimate goal is to perform successful research and thereby create entirely new scientific knowledge .
This process is conducted at such an immensely high level nowadays that everyone wanting to have widespread success in a field needs to know absolutely everything about it .
At the same time , the subjects have reached such complexity that an occupation with a different field simply is n't possible for the ambitious researcher : in order to only even stay up to date in his own field , he will have to invest well over fifty hours a week .
Due to this , in academia this focus on one specific subject is an absolute must .

For the sake of completeness though , it should be mentioned that also for academics it is advisible to first gain some more spread-out knowledge : if for example a quantum mechanics physicist wants to apply his principles to biology , he needs to be able to already refer back to some existing knowledge from his own educational process in order to see the basic connections .

In conclusion , it was demonstrated in this text that depending on the work of the person under consideration , the answer to the introductory statement differs : the prefers a broad knowledge base , whereas the academic goes with the narrower one .
