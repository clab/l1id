In twenty years the number of cars in use will not have diminished by a large number , I believe that rather the opposite will be true .
The number of cars will increase during the next twenty years .
Due to population rise and the development of different fuels the number of people able and willing to afford their own car will increase and so will the number of cars in use .

In countries like China or India , that have a large rural population without the means to buy a car today , the continuing growth of the population and the fast economic development will lead to more people being able to afford a car in the near future .
The prices of cars will go down in comparison to the income and this will lead to more cars being in use .

Another reason for my belief that there will be more cars in use twenty years from now is that new fuels are currently under research and will be on the market in less than twenty years .
For example the hydrogen powered car is already in use today , though it is not ditributed at large .
This development of alternative fuels will restrict the impact of the decrease of the resources like oil and gas has on the automobile industry .
That way nobody owning a car today will have to get rig of it because of fuel shortage .
These people can just as easily buy a car powered by alternative fuel , when their current car breaks down .

The alternative fuels , that are being developed today , are also cleaner and less poisonous to the environment .
This means that maybe people not willing to use a car today because of environmental reasons will change their mind and buy a car when the use of a car is no longer a hazard to the environment .

These reasons support my belief that the number of cars in use in twenty years will not be lower , but higher , than the number of cars in use today .
Population rise , the development of alternative fuels and the rapid economic development in countries with large populations will contribute to an increase in the number of people able and willing to afford their own car and thus to an increase in the number of cars in use .
