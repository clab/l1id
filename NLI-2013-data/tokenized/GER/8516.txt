Generally speaking I fully agree with the statement that students should focus on grasping the underlying bases of a concept than to know all facts by heart .

My main reason for having that opinion is because today 's strucure of information flow is fast and constantly changing .
Today there are masses of information available through new technologies e.g. via the internet .
New findings are constantly published and replace information that has previously been accepted .

Therefore , to me it no longer makes sense for a student to memorize all facts by heart .
It is rather necessary that basic knowledge about a studying field and related investigating methods are taught in schools and university .
As stated above facts are subject to changes and revision but with a profound basic understanding students will be able to absorb new facts and integrate them in their knowledge of the world .
This way they are able to successfully face challenges , that find solutions to problems that have not been addressed to yet .
If one needs to refer to facts , students can look those up in lexicas or consult internet sources .

These are the main points why I think it is crucial for students to have a basic understanding and how different topics are related to each other , to know aspect that they have in common and where they differ .
It 's more a net of knowledge .

However this does not imply that fact knowledge is worthless and I can think of areas where it is crucial to have the information instantly available .
To illustrate this thought one can think of a doctor in the emergency section in hospital .
This is a situation where time is a limited recourse and seconds might decide whether a patient lives or dies .
Here the doctor should know all facts about medicine and consequences of action when treating the patient .
The same is true for pilots and other critical professions .

To sum it up as stated above a general understanding of a field is more important for students , considering later challenges in life , than to be able to recite information an failing to come to the core of an idea .
However as the example of a doctor in the ambulance shows some basic information need to instantly accessible in situation when time is scarce .
