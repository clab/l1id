I fully agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In my mind advertisement is just the invention of some smart business managers who wanted to increase the money they make through the selling of their product .
Of course advertisement is also a possibility for a company to present their product to a wide range of people through television .
But I am of the opinion that , if they would tell the truth about their product less people would buy it .
They have to make people believe that their product is the best product that they could buy , and that it would improve their lifes .
I think especially products such as washing powder seem much better in the advertisement than they really are .
Do we not all know the advertisement about the `` new incredible washing powder '' that is able to clean all our clothes and make them look brand new ?
There are so many of the advertisements that claim that they have found the solution for our daily problems .
Honestly , I have to say that none of these products ever worked as good as it should work .
It is a well-known fact , that most of the people believe in the advertisements .
The companies use the belief of the people that it is not allowed to lie .
Everybody knows from his parents that it is not polite to lie and so the people think that the advertisement cannot be wrong .
I also noticed that the people who produce these clips use the lack of knowledge of the people .
In Germany there is a clip for yoghurt with sugar from fruits .
For the people who do not know about fruit sugar , this yoghurt seems much healthier than a normal yoghurt does .
A lot of parents want to give their children something healthy and therefore they buy this kind of yoghurt .
If my mother has n't told me that fruit sugar is almost as unhealthy as normal sugar , I would also have believed that this product is much better .
Especially this information from my mother made me believe that most of the products seem better in the advertisement than they really are .
