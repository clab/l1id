Some students put a higher value in understanding the ideas and their concepts , rather than understanding the facts .
The fact that I graduated with a major in International Business , has exposed me to different elements , all taken in account when questioning myself , which of the both statements I agree with .
However , both can have equal advantages that are quite different in many aspects .

As far as I am concerned , understanding a subject 's ideas and concepts is more critical than studying the facts .
For instance , the overall idea will stay in a student 's mind for a much longer period , sometimes even for ever .
Furthermore , these ideas and concepts can be re-used in the future in various situations .
For instance , those I had learned in my Business class helped me to open my own company a few years later .
However , putting higher importance in studying the subject 's ideas and concepts only , can have equal disadvantageous elements .

Understanding the facts can be dramatically important , depending on the chosen subject and career field especially .
For instance , a history student is likely to study the facts and dates of a historical event because its required .
If the facts are used on a regular basis , the student might be able to remember some of them for an eternal period of time .

In conclusion , learning about a theme 's ideas and concepts was very beneficial for me with regards to my major .
However , each student should be able to make an own decision , when questioning himself what is more essential for his studies .
Furthermore the student 's chosen career plays an important role , when answering this question .
