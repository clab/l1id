You often see old people on the street who are either angry , annoyed or very sad .
By contrast most of the young people I know are very cheerful and relaxed .
Apparently , most of the young people are much happier than older ones .
Therefore , I personally believe that young people enjoy their lives more than older people .

Evidently , older people have more maladies and painful physical problems .
The body gets weaker when you become older and often causes horrible pains .
Generally speaking , children and younger people are healthier and consequntly fitter .
My grandfather for instance , had belly cancer and therefore did n't relish eating anymore .
Being traumatized by horrible memories , many old people get more and more depressed in their old age .
This causes difficulties that force old people to renounce many pleasures in life .
For example , it becomes more and more difficult to travel .

In addition , younger people still have a lot of wishes and ideas of what they want to accomplish and experience in life .
Whereas old people tend to be frustrated because there is nothing new to discover .
They have experienced nearly everything in life and do n't have any future plans .
Young boys and girls can look forward and are still full of hope , whereas older people must look backward .

In conclusion , I personlly believe that it is much easier to be happy when you are young .
On the one hand , being young and fresh normally leads to a happier life because the body is generally fitter and painless .
On the other hand , a child or teenager still has the opportunity to discover many things in life .
Given all of these reasons , I recommend everyone to learn and experience as many things as possiple during his youth , since for most of the pleasures in life it will be too late one day
