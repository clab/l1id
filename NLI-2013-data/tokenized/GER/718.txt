In a way , I would agree this statement .
In my opinion , it is essential to have a wide range of knowledge to state in this society we live in .

For example when you discuss things with someone or when you have to write an essay you have to be pen for arguments which may stay in conflict with your personal opinion .
Then you have to know how or why this argument is coming up and how you can built a new argument .
This is a lot easier if you can see the linkings between all the the subjects .
This implimise that you hava to have a certain level of knowledge about several academic topics .

Moreover , the linking often gives you the oppurtunity to create own and especially new aspects or theories of an issue .

On the other hand , I assume that it is n't possible to be aware of everything in this world .
As things and especially knowledge are changing that qucikly in our society , it will be hard to bring yourself at the up to date level of knowledge in each academic subject .

Another problem is that people always have a special field of interest .
This might be because they gained experience in certain topics in their childhood or their parents introduced them in a special academic field .

For example , a lot of cildren would like to be an astronaut .
As a result of that , they will probably concentrate on issues like astrology , stars and so on .
I 'm sure that this concentration on one field can change in your personal life quite a lot .

Therefore , I suggest that you will become a specialist in certain academic topics which are most interesting for yourself .
But you should always try to keep an eye on other subjects because knowledge can influence eachother and could give the movement to new aspects of knowledge .
