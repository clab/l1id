I disagree with the statement that nowadays young people do not spend an appropriate amount of their time to helping their communities .

The first reason why I disagree with the statement is that the world we live in chnges fairly quickly .
As a result of that , a sound education is the most important point that younger people must follow .
Education is a very time-consuming issue .
Therefore , the time young people have to spend for helping their communities is generally limited .

Furthermore , I do not believe that spending time for their communities is a special task for the younger people .
There may be some objective evidence that the willingness of people to help their communities became smaller .
However , I strongly believe that this is a dilemma of the society we live in .
It is no choice to argue that the younger ones must use more of their time for helping their communities .

Finally , I do not believe that the amount of time which is used by younger people for helping their communities has significantely changed from the past .
I assume that it might be a problem of visibility .
If , for example , younger people organise computer lessons for children or guide children in the internet , it might look like some kind of game to some observers .
However , teaching children the correct use of new media is a very valuable helping for communities .

As a result , I believe that younger people do not need to use more
