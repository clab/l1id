I would like to answer this question by introducing what that means : enjoy life .
If people enjoy their lifes or not depends on many things .
Firstly , it could depend on your hobbies , like playing basketball or fishing .
Both are completely different and you might say that fishing more fits to older people whereas basketball more fits to younger people .
Secondly , it depends on your social circumstances .
This means some people enjoy spending time with there family .
Others like to go to parties whenever possible .
This also can be related to the age .
Additionally it could depend on the education .
Higher educated people maybe would like to visit an opera rather than hanging around in a bar .
Today a lot of people think education was much better in former times .

Nevertheless I believe younger people enjoy life more for several reasons ( but this answer is somehow biased , because I think I am young ) .
All the reasons mentioned above cannot lead to an adequate answer from my point of view , because that are personal things .
Younger people enjoy life more , because they have less responsibilities .
So younger people have more space to be spontanous than older people have .
Furthermore younger people are in average healthier , what gives them the possibility of doing more things in shorter period of time .
In addition there is a lot of stuff to discover , what older people may have discovered already .
The advantage of older people is that they have usally more money for enjoing life , but I believe that caused by todays globalization it becomes less important .
Everything becomes cheaper and money is not required for enjoying life .

To conclude this essay I would say that younger people can enjoy life more because of the reasons mentioned above .
But what does it really mean to be old .
Just few people would call themselves old .
You are just that old , how old you are feel .
