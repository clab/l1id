Although it is important to gain knowledge of many basic facts , I think that it is really better to acquire understanding of concepts and ideas which are given in lectures and classes .
There are three reasons why I agree with this statement .

The first point I have to mention is that you can look up every fact which you want to know about in books or the Internet .
In addition , this process does not take a lot of time .
For example , when you are asking about a special date , you can use a history book or an Internet site which deals with historical dates .

Second , it is very helpful for your future profession when you have understand the concepts and ideas which are often used in the professional life .
When a special problem occurs you have to solve it using your abilitites you have learned during your studying time .
Think of an instance in mathematics .
When you try to solve an equation to finish the calculations which are very important for your company it is absolutely necessary that you have understand the concept of solving such equations in order to avoid mistakes .

To continue , there is still another reason for my opinion .
When you are confident with the underlying principles of any topic you are , as a result , enabled to unterstand and , probably , to solve new problems .
Imagine the case of a special problem which only emerges in your section .
This problem has to be solved but no known way of approaching this problem is appropriate .
So your combination abilities are very important .
You have now to combine concepts and ideas you have already learned and the new .
Consequently , when you have acquired a great variety of principles to solve problems you will probably be prepared well in creating own , new ideas and concepts .

In summary , from my perspective , it is better for students to gain knowledge of many concepts to be successful in their future professional life .
