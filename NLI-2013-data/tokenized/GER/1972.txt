Forever young !
This is what every of us want wants to be .
As a young person life is easier and related with no problems .
Young people seem to have more fun and enjoy life more than older people do .
But is it really so ?
In the following essay I will to try figure out that older people can more enjoy their life !

I want to state that many young people are wasting a lot of their free time .
They think they have to be `` cool '' , hang around or just `` chill '' .
In that time they could do much more importand activities .
The youngster are often of the opinion that they need n't to hurry up , becouse their whole life is in front of them .
The older people act just opposite .
They are aware of the fact that a large part of their life has past by , and they know that every minute is worth to enjoy .
They try to plan a day as tought as it is possible , just to make the most of it .
As an example you can take people , who need n't go to work anymore , because of their age .
That persons have the whole day `` freetime '' , but spend hardly a minute for rest .
They went out for shopping , visit their families or spend time with friends .
That people have gained a lot of experiece through their life .
Cosequently they know that time is very costable and should n't be wasted .
Todays youngster will also make that experience when they get older and older and will in future more enjoy their freetime .
That `` s the normal way of life !
