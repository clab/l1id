Imagine the earth has nearly 7 billion inhabitants .
Almost 60 percent live in Asia , which is a growing market for the car industry .
Yes , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

According to the market in Asia let us assume that almost every citizien has a car down in Asia .
The car industry is going to be as happy as they were never before .
For instance they are going to raise their annual income to a never forseen hight .
Which is good for the economy of the whole world .
Because the rate of unemployment is going down enornormously .
And every person who is working for the car industry will benefit from that boom .
Firstly the employers live more savely because they are going to have more money to spend for luxury .
But what is more the surrounding economy like the travel branche or the apparel industry is growing too .
These are just two examples I like to indicate .

On the other hand all these cars are going to cause havoc to the environment .
Most importantly to the air because the cars producing a lot of chemical stuff like CO2 which will harm the atmosphere .
According to the atmosphere which is our weather kitchen .
It produces rain , snow and even oxygen , without these elements we are not able to live .
To put it in a nut shell even if it rains the rain is not free of chemical combinations .
So the rain causes harm to the forests and animals and yes even to the whole mankind .
Unfortunenatly none of our well payed scientists have discoverd a system to prevent acid rain , which is the main problem to the environment in which we live .
So it is our task to save the nature for our fellowers .
To ensure this task is going to be succesful we have to put more money into education .

Let me sum it up , more cars of course , but not with more danger to the environment and mankind .
Let us build even more environment friendly cars , like hydrogen cars or with solar power .
Than there will be no harm the the atmosphere and everthing is okay for our future genarations
