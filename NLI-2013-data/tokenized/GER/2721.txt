Personally , I disagree with the general statement that young people enjoy life more than older peolpe do .
It is of course difficult to make a general decision here and there may always be exceptions to the rule , but I would even say that - in reverse - older people enjoy life more than young people do .
There are various reasons for that .

While young people often tend to prefer a lifestyle which implies a lot of partying and going out to have fun , older people usually have gained enough experience to be able to estimate what really counts in life .
That is : not going out and getting drunk but basically things like a secure job , a house , family and friends you can rely on .
Older people have learned about characteristics that are really important , whereas many younger people may still stick to superficial ideas .

In making hard and difficult decisions , older people may have an easier time than younger people .
Adolescents will approach a difficult situations differently : they may be more naive , simply because they have never faced a problem like that .
Older people can relz on their life experience and see more easily which would be the best decision .
They can evaluate situations better and are more sure of themselves .

Moreover , older people can look back on the accomplishments of their lives and see what they have done .
They do not have to worry any more about career things and - hopefully - about money .
They have worked all their life and earned enough money to be able to travel where they like to .
With their partner , they have now the time and opportunity to see the countries they used only to hear of and read about .
Young people have to think of their education and career .
They have to think about their income .

Older people have the possibility - and should - transfer their knowledge to younger people in order to help them getting on with their lives .
