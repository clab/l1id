This is an interesting question .
I do not realy think , that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than today .
One of the reasons is , that earth population is growing every minute .
More people need more cars .
Today a family with four persons has typically at least three cars and that will not change in the next twenty years .
Maybe we will not have enough place and streets for all the cars , but than we will have to find new ways were we can drive our cars .
That could be streets above our cities or in the underground .
An argument against my oppinion could be , that we will not have enough energy for all the cars in twenty years .
This has to be considered .
Oil is getting fewer and fewer and therefor more expensive .
In the near future nobody can affort driving a car with gas .
But I think the human beeing has a lot of ideas to keep the comfort of driving cars .
Maybe we will use bio cars , or oxzgen cars but I am sure , we will use cars .
Another argument is , that car production is a hugh industry worldwide .
Millions of people are working in this industries .
What would happen to them , if we would produce fewer cars .
I do not realy see an alternative to cars .
Using the underground train , or a bus is not as comfortabe as driving with my car from door to door .
If I go with the train for example I have to take the bus to come to the train station .
At my destination I again have to take a bus or a taxi .
Such a short journey to an other town could take a lot of time and also could be very expensive .
With my car I can use my navigation system an go from door to door in half of the time .
