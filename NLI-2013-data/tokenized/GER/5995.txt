Fewer cars in twenty tears ?

Only time will show if the statement that there will be fewer cars in the future might be true .
Nowadays this seems more like wishful thinking .

During the last twenty years the number of cars has surely increased causing traffic almost to collapse and polluting the environment in an alarming way .
The way this situation has been developing , it is clear that it could not go on forever .
Happily , people become more aware of the damage the traffic and the pollution are causing and have started to rethink their relationship to their beloved car .

Since people realize that changes have to be made , they try to build groups and drive together in only one car or make more use of bikes or other transportation options such as busses and trains .

Also the government has been trying to encourage the use of other means of transportation by raising the taxes on gasoline and supporting the train or admitting tax refunds for cars that meet higher ecological standards .

Another point , that might even be the decisive one , is that the reserves of gasoline will not last forever .
Ther will come a point where there will be no gasoline left .

Despite all this , the car industry is also adapting to these problems , building car that use less gasoline or can burn hydrogene or even alcohol .
This would indicate , that there probably will not be fewer cars but different and more ecological cars .
On the other hand it would kill thousands of jobs , if the automobile industry would produce fewer cars .

As for the traffic problem , new streets and new traffic systems are beeing planned .

There are godd reasons to believe that there will be fewer cars in the future but ther also are the same amount of reasons to doubt this .

I Belive that there will not be fewer cars but it would make me happy to see that peole get more aware of the damge they can cause and use cars less than today .
I also belive that there will be a improvement on the ecological effects fo cars diminushing the polllution und the use of gasoline
