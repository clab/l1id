It is a must-have !

Who of us has not been influenced once by a photo or a spot that leaded him/her to buy a product ?
I think everybody was blended once in his life and bought something that was not that good than he/she has supposed .

In my opinion this is a normal trick by the marketing section of the companies letting things look better than they really are .
But why do they do this ?
The cause is that if you want to sell a product that you have designed or produced you want the attention of everyone for that product .
It should be a must-have for the whole world .
This is only possible when it is praised as a phaenomenal thing .
Because now the people are attracted to that and want to buy it .
What could be more distinguishing than having a product that could work perfectly but noone wants to have it because it is suggested as a boring thing in an advertisment .

Showing products as very interresting should work better for rising your selling numbers and that is what it is all about - selling things for a higher profit .
An other thing is that you must have a more specialized product that the other companies have because noone would recognize yours if it is not supposed to be the best .

A problem with making produkts ` shine ' is that these untruth information should not be too extreme because this leads to a bad picture of the producing company and the people that had made a wrong decision because they beliefed in the advertisement are not willing to buy future products of that company Making things better is a normal way of selling but the suggested information of the advertisement should not be so far away from the truth because this will not help you in the future .
