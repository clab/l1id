The statement can be seen from two sides .
First , it is very important for students to understand ideas and concepts within lectures because without this understanding the context of a lecture would not be kept in mind of the students .
In my opinion the lecture has the task to help the students understanding ideas and concepts of the topics they are taught in .
On the other hand the lecture at university can not be compared with a lecture in school .
In school the teacher has the task to work so long on one topic until the whole class understood everything .
In university the professors or lecturers have to help the students getting the ideas and concepts but the students have to keep in mind that they have to work at home additive for the lecture and maybe the lecture only helps them to understand ideas and concepts .

Second , it is also very important for students to learn facts because in business they need these facts daily and to have a profound knowledge hard facts have to be included .
Herefore the problem is that the facts can only be used as a tool when the students know what the meaning of these facts are and which topic belongs to which learned facts .
It makes no sense to learn facts without having any idea for what topic they are useful .

I think that this statement is controversial because understanding ideas and concepts and learning of hard facts belongs together .
It is necessary to understand ideas and concepts but the facts needed to underline the argumentation in a special case must be learned as well .
On the other side the hard facts can be learned but without the background of ideas and concepts the facts are useless .
It only makes sense to learn facts when concepts and ideas are already understood because than the argumentation can be underlined with them .
