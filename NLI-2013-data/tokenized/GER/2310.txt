I disagree with this statement , although I was thinking the same way when I was a teenager .
When I was about sixteen , I regarded my grandmother sitting in her little kitchen and thought that she was not admireable because of her old age and health problems .
In my opinion in these times , only young people were able to have fun , because they got the body fitness which allowed them to swim in lakes , ride a bike and dance during the whole night at a party .

But today , I oppose this opinion very harshly .
Now I know , that every step in the human life has its advantages .
When you are young , without doubt the ability in enjoying life is based on sports and fun , as I just mentioned .
You do not care about any sorrows or any severe plans for future .
So this seems to be the only time in life , where you are able to live without fear .

But when you grow older , you are able to regard problems in life from a more abstract or distinct point of view , you are wiser and able to differ between severe and unimportant problems .
When I talk to my grandmother today , I learn that the joy in her life is linked to the joy of her famliy , especially with her children she raised .
Instead of taking care of her children , she now is able to see her efforts and has more time for herself .
Now she travelles to her sister several times a year , which she could not afford in times when she was raising her children .

It is true that the responsibility for ones actions grows parallel to the growing of the age , but also the joy in taking this responsibility grows .
As an adult one is able to deal with responsibility , which offers lots of new challenges .
These challenges not only are important milestones in development , but they can also be a huge joy .
For example , to found a family , marry a wife and raising children with her , without doubt is a huge responsibility , but it can also be the greatest fun in ones life .

To draw a conclusion , young people do not enjoy life more than older people do , the only enjoy life in a different way .
