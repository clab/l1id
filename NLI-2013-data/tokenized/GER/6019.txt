I do not agree with the statement that in twenty years fewer cars will be in use than there are today , because of the importance of cars as a means of transportation .

In a globalized world cars have very much influence on our whole life .
They are an important means of transportation in trade as well as a means of a flexible lifestyle .
Without cars the exchange of goods in a globalized world would be much more complicated .
Also the exchange of people , in the sense of employees and workers , would be much more difficulty .
Many people depend on their car to reach work .
For example people who are working in Frankfurt or other big cities are often forced to drive many hours to their place of work , because they can not afford appartments in the cities to life in .
Without a car they would be forced to move houses or to find work next to their home , which is in many cases because of the high unemployment not possible .

Without a car people would not be flexible any longer .
They would be forced to take the bus or the train , which are often overcrowded , late and in the case of train in Germanz very expansive .

The limitation of cars would have a deep impact on the whole society .
If there would be less cars it would be necessary to replace them by other sources of transportation , like trains or busses .
Today many cities lack the financial capacities to finance such a big project .

Because cars vary in their prices and are therefore also accesible for people with a smaller amount , many people will keep buying them in the future .

To come to a conclusion I would say that today cars are an important means of transportation as well as a status symbole , and will therefore increase in the future .
