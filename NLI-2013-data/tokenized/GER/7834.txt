Some may belive that travaling abroad or locally is best when one travels with a group and accompanied by a tour guide .
I however completely disagree .
In my opinion , the whole purpose of traveling is to experince a new place , culture , and lifestylfe for how you perseive it not how a whole group of tourists belives it to be .

Althought led by a tour guide or leader who is well informed , brochures and private tour guides are just as useful and much more convenient .
Also traveling without a whole group enables you to have more privacy and completely enjoy the new environement and surroundings .
It is very possible that when one travels with a group and a guide , all the people can distract you from the beauty that you are supossed to be experiencing .
It is also possible that in a new country or environement , a group of tourists with a tour guide is not the safest way to travel and site-see .
Many locals may see the group as a very convinient situation to steal , or also known as pick-pocketing when in large groups .
Not only do some locals find it lucrative to steal but a new business of kidnapping and human trafficing .

In todays societys , violence is spreading faster , farter , and in increasingly more brutal ways .
If one were to travel in a group with a guide , it heightens once chance of being kidnapped or what is known as trafficed .
Although it many sound far fetched and unlikely , I have personally done a study on this topic and growing problem .
Statisticly , people are more likely to be not noticed when kidnapped if they were traveling in a large group because so much can be happening it at one time that peoples attention can be captured .

Depending on the destination may also affect the travleing circumstan .
If one were to travel to a larger city , It might be wise to have more protection like a private guide who knows wher they are and the local people .
Still , i belive it is better to travel without a group .

No matter where one travels and what one sees , the best and more enjoyable way to experince and new environement is not in a group , but with only a small number of people , for example 2-5 but nothing larger and accompanied by a private tour guide .
