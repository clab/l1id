This statement is in my opinion a bit to wideranged .
So I think that the people in our society are split in two groups : the ones who never help somebody and the ones who care about the well beeing of others .
I will elaborate this in this essay in two paragraphs .

On the one hand , I think that todays society of young people becomes worse in helping each other because they tend to be more and more sellfish .
The kids prefer to stay at home alone to play computer instead of going out in parcs and play football with others in the same age .
Meeting others is the beginning of creating a community : share free time with others .
Then , in school , many of the pupils do n't want to help their classmates because of the fear to loose something .
After that , when the young people begin to work , they want to earn always more money .
At the same time , they do n't want to spend a bit of their spare-time to those who could need it .

On the other hand , there have been done many things to get people more involved in helping their communities .
Often they are in form of voluntary work and many people do n't hear about it even if they would like to help .
In Germany , they have introduced a `` civil service '' .
It was made up for those who do n't want to make the military service , so it is obligatory .
Since it was created , they are many young people who work in hospitals , houses for older people , for handicaps or drug and alcohol ill people .
Today , the government thinks about putting the military service away and instead of that make the civil service obligatory for all , boys and girls .
This would be great , because so everyone gets an experience in helping others so that these people would give help next time easier .

I think most of the people do n't go and help people by their own , but with a little experience in social work , they will change their minds on that point .
