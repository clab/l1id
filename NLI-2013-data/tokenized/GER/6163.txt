Fewer cars due to increased use of public transportation

I fully agree with the given statement that the number of cars will reduce within the next twenty years .
Firstly , a lot of people will not be able to afford gas anymore .
By virtue of the exploitation of natural resources such as petroleum the price of those products will increase even more than it already did .
A car will become something like luxury for many people .
This causes a natural decline of the number of cars on the streets .

Besides , the world population will raise enormously .
In twenty years will propably have almost ten billion people living all over the globe .
As a result , traffic will increase .
Not only in cities but also in remote areas because you need more space for all the people .
Traffic jams and more accidents will occur more often especially in cities .
In order to avoid this chaos many people will have to use public transportation like bus or subway .

Another reason for my opinion that there will be fewer cars in use is the lack of parking spaces in big cities .
Every huge town in the world as a problem with providing enough room for the cars .
In Manhattan the cars have to be stacked and in San Francisco the prices for a parking lot in downtown are hardly affordable to keep the people from parking there .

In addition to this , state governments will have to pass laws which will restrict traffic .
Due to overpopulation and enviromental pollution owing to heavier traffic , the number of cars allowed on the streets at the same time will have to be regulated to stop further destruction of the planet .

Last but not least , we will have new technologies concerning public transportation .
I am pretty sure we will have faster trains , new inventions to travel and the prices will decrease .
A reason for lower prices is that more people will use public transportation out of the reasons I mentioned and explained above ..
