Nowadays most of the young people care a lot about their own problems .
They do not worry , if they can help an old lady to cross the street .
Focusing on their own aims is very important .
In additon they only live , because they want to enjoy their lives .
They do not look for people , who need help .
I think , that young people should be asked or even forced , if they do not want to help other people .
On the whole most of the young people does not spend enough time to help their communities .

Working in a hospital for a low sale can help to remind especially young people , that they will become older .
For sure , they are forced to see a lot of deseases , for example if their grandfather suffers from a bad illness .
This experience can help to persuade younger people to spend more time to help their communities , especially their own one .
Young people can change their mind , because they see , that it makes older people very happy , that their is somebody , who visit them .

Secondly parents have got less time , because they have to cook for their childen , make the whole housework and they also have to earn the money .
Even because of this fact , most of the younger students do not help their own parents .
That is really scaring .
Once they will become parents and than they look back and see their bad behavior .

Changing their behavior can help them to improve the general situation .

As a conclusion I can agree with the statement .
I hope , that young people change their mind .
The general situation of the society can really be improved , if people think more about each other and not about their own problems .
For sure that is a really hard change .
