I would agree with the statement , even though I must admit that the question if young people enjoy life more than old people do , is certainly very difficult to answer , because you have to compare people out of different times and social structures , with very different problems , options , possibilities and wishes .

Let me first shortly explain the background , out of which most - if not all - older people that I know come : Most of them experienced war or the time after war ; a time full of scarcity and poverty .
Everyone had to work very hard for his life .
When there was money left , it was seldomly simply spent for something like holidays or having a fine dinner or theater .
It was rather saved for bad times that could probably come again .
They preferred - or perhaps were forced by society and expectations put on them - to go on working rather than enjoying life or doing something for themselves , just to be secure .
Over the decades , life got easier of course and also those people learned to enjoy life .
But I think that in most older people there is still always this feeling of first work , then enjoy their own life .

On the other hand , life for young people today is also certainly hard and not easy , since they have a lot of pressure to bear , implied on them from school , study or job .
But I think they grew up in a society in which enjoying life is something other people make money with .
Its a business - enjoying life is something like a symbol for wealth which is highly promoted in advertisement and marketing .
Furthermore , it is socially accepted to enjoy life , to go on holidays , to visit bars , restaurants , cinema or to subscribe for a wellness-week .

For these reasons I think its easier and more common among young people to enjoy life than for old people .
