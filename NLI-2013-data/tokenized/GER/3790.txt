The issue at hand is wheter young people work enough for their communities .
This issue is important because working for the community helps to develop social skills .
I believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

First , young people nowadays are more interested in having fun than in helping their communities .
For example , young people like doing a lot of sports or going out with friends .
Beside these activities , there is no more time for community work .

Second , young people have to work hard in their jobs .
The competition has become harder and harder .
To keep your job , you have to be focused on it completely .
Community work would keep you away from your work .
Many of the young people avoid this kind of activity for this reason .

Thrid , many of the young people are a little bit selfish nowadays .
John F. Kennedy said once : `` You do n't have to ask what your nation can do for you , you have to ask what you can do for your nation ! ''
Unfortunately , a lot of young people are more interested what they can get from the society rather than contribute themselves to the positive development of their community .
A good example for the changing attidtude towards community work is the Swiss army : By law , every Swiss man has to join the army .
But , in fact , more than 40 % of the young men are released from military service .
Many of them just do not want do military service because it is inconvenient .

Finally , the image of the community work has changed in the last few years .
Whereas in earlier times people working for the communities were regarded as very respectful members of the society , a lot of people are laughing at them nowadays .
Today it is much more important to have a lot of money and to be very succesful in the job .

To sum up , I believe that the young people nowadays do not help enough their communities .
There are different reasons for that , as I mentioned , but I do not think this development
