I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only do what they already know .

I have specific reasons for my opinion .
Which mainly support the idea of success and development .
The first an most important reason is , that I strongly connect success with challange .
In order to have a success I need to have a challange .
You can imagine a man who is responsible for opening a door or gate .
He is doing this every day , without any change .
Therefor he has no challange , because he has done this several times and knows what to to .
Without the challange he can not show a success and wo n't be recognized by anyone .

The second point is that you need to stay open minded and learn to be successful .
Everyone recognizes someone as successful if he does something spectacular , new or difficult .
In order to do new and difficult things , I need to know my capabilities .
These capabilities will need training .
Hence if I do stay with the well known and do not train new capabilities , I have less possibilities to choose of .
Therefore I am limited in the things I can solve .

In contrast staying open minded and learning new things will train my capabilities and give me more tools to solve situations which leads to be more successful .

The third reason is that you have to prove yourself to be successful .
For example your boss will test you before he promotes you .
He will give you things to do that are new for you .
For that you will have to take risks to solve this problems .
Therefore you need to be able to take risks to prove yourself and be successful .
I had this often in my personal career .
My boss tested me and gave me difficult tasks .
He was not mainly intrested in the result of the task , but how I did it .

In conclusion , success needs people to take risks , move to unknown territories and try new things .
Without this there would be a stillstand not for yourself but also in the recognition of others .
I do encourage everyone to take risks and try new things whenever you can .
