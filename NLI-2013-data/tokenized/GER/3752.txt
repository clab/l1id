I wether do or do not agree with this statement .
From my perspective and I can only argue in the case of Germany , the truth lies somewhere in between .
Because , on the one hand you can support this opinion by stressing effects of globalization through which young people do not have time to engage for any kind of help for their community .
One can say , that the pressure of worldwide competition increases the freetime for every young individual .
But on the other hand , one can respond that the personal demand after social relationships and altruism included still exist in a similar way like centuries ago .
If we are looking into hospitals or other institutions , which are aimed at helping other people , we can still find a lot of people with very different social backgrounds who are engage in social work , e.g. for old people .

Here one can oppose , that the number of people who are engaged in those insitutions increased very much .
For example the engagement in political parties .
The German social-democrats loosed around 600000 members until the 1970ies .
But are those numbers good indicators for the engagement of young people nowadays ?
One can say , that especially younger people do mor often use new technologies to engage them for their community , e.g. they are organizing events in their hometown or something else like that .
So young people do not need to be `` physically '' engaged in their community .
Often they are members of other internet based communities or just handle things through this new medium .

But one can at this point argue , that this is an evident developement nowadays .
Unreal communities were founded through new medias and the modern kind of community is not important anymore .

I think this discussion is endless and depends on age and experiences .
From my perspective younger people are thinking in other more postmodern ways .
This is way an answer to this question is really hard to give .
