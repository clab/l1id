In television , papers and magazines a lot of people discuss , how our streets will look in twenty years .
A lot of these discussion focus on the amount of cars .
Reasons for this discussion are the changes energy supply and the pollution problem .

The main reason , why there might be less cars , is that the petroleum resources are decreasing .
Some experts say they only last about ten years .
Another reason might be the increasing pollution .
Politicans might introduce stronger laws or raise the tax on fuel to reduce the pollution .
This could result in a decreasing amount of cars .

A seldom focused reason migth be : Several people are going to share one car .
This development can already be seen in Germany .
In the last years the amount of car shareing stations has raised .

A raisuig usage of public transportation might also decrease the amount of cars .

On the other side , there are a lot of reasons why the amount of cars will not decrease .
The amount of cars has been raising through the last century and this trend may continue .

There are also a lot of new engine techniks .
These techniks allow cars be driven with solar power or hydrogen .
These resources are not expected the be lass availible .
Even an combination of an fuel engine and these techniks is possible .
So the amount of cars will be constant , because the prices for these new technologies will fall .

I think , the amount of cars will not fall .
There will be differences in the type of cars .
I think the cars will need less energy and produce less pollution the current cars .
But since the car always has been a status symbol , a lot of people will want a car .
The public transportation will not have an big rule in the future , because most goverments do n't have enough money to support this .
