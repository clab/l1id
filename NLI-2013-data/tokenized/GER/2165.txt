Some people may think that younger people enjoy their life more than old people , whereas other people might find the elder part of life more joyful .
Mainly because youth in our hedonistic society on the eve of capitalism is often seen as the ultimate good , most people may tend to agree with the first opinion .
On TV , in the newspapers the fun that young people have is shown .
Not just the so - called stars of Hollywood or elsewhere try to stay forever young , is it through fashion or the benefits of plastic surgery .

So after all , there must be something about it .
And , yes , it is definitely fun to be young .
Your body is healthy and maybe beatiful , you are free and everything is new and exiting , the book of life is not written yet , everything seems within your reach .

So youth is , frankly said , a wonderful thing .

But the problem is , that in a society where youth seems to be all , being old seems to be the odd counterpart .
Who wants to think about being old , not able to move properly , maybe dependend on medicine and not able to think in new ways ?

But in my opinion , their can be certain benefits in the later ages , too .
You maybe have a lovely wife or husband and a familie that gives you all the fulfilment you have dreamt of when you whre still young .
Whereas youth can be a big struggle in the dark , the age brings the advantage of experience with it .
Furthermore one can maybe afford nice things like big sports cars , houses in the provence or younger women young men just could dream of .

So after all I think that both ages could be great fun , it certainly depends on your personal situation and the personal ideas about every age .
According to this a pure culture of youth is doubtlessly a mislead in cultural development , especially regarding to the demographic changes that will turn us soon into a society of elder people .
