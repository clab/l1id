I cannot agree .
There are many reasons why there will be more cars in twenty years than today .
In the follwing , I try to explain three reasons that will have a major impact on the growth rate of personal transportation and therefore on the number of cars in the future .

Firstly , many poor countries have the potential to develop their economic power and rise the wealth and income throughout the country .
China is a good example .
The government in China managed to establish more or less substantial laws and condition for prosperity .
When people get richer , they often have significant more urges than before .
Affluent people , or people with a considerable income , want to own cars as prestigious objects .
Due to all these reasons , it is very likely that especially poor countries will experience a high growth rate in the number of cars .

Secondly , the production of cars becomes cheaper and cheaper .
High end roboters can produce cars in a very cost efficient way because they work very efficiently , quickly and almost perfectly .
On the one hand , it is not necessary to pay roboters for their work and on the other hand they can produce 24 hours a day .
Moreover , engineer 's knowledge has accumulated during more than 100 years and they are now able to produce cars that are very cost-efficient in their planing and designing process .

Thirdly , new technologies make it possible to run cars without emissions .
In a few years , cars will no longer consume gaz , but they will need a mixture of water and oxygen .
This mixture does not harm the evironment and will be very cheap in the near future .
On account of this , care about the environment is no longer a reason the refuse the use of cars .
For instance , the car make BMW already runs test cars and even sold them to customers .
They run without major complications and are very cost-efficient in their usage and maintencance .
