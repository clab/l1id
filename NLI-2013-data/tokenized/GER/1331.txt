In my opinion the statement is true .
Actually everybody should have a wide knowledge of a lot of academic subjects than to specialize in only one field .

First , if you have a wider knowledge it will use yourself a lot because it supports you in the admission for the universities or in a future job .
A lot of people will know after talking to others if somebody has a wider knowledge or not .
And if you have an interview for a job or an admission interview at university , your knowledge can lead you to your goal a good job or admission .

Second if you have a good knowledge you can understand much more subjects and world problems than if you would not have it .
And that will make your world more interesting .
Also can you assist by questions from your friends , parents or relatives and that gives you more self confidence and makes you more and more a respected partner .
Also will it develop your logical thinking and this point will lead to a greater knowledge again .

Futhermore , a good and wide knowledge will rest you a live time .
And I think the more and more people learn and know about academic subject , there life becomes more interesting and they will also discover new interestings .
Like the museum , theatre , read the newspaper , books etc .
This will make your world more colourful as if you only would live in your four walls , with your sole specialized subject .
What if you will meet other people who do not know anything about your specific subject , which interesting discussion can you lead .

To sum up , I prefer having a broad knowledge of many academic skills than just be specialized only in one specific academic subject .
I think it is the better way to lead your life .
Because your knowledge can help you anywhere and in any situation .
