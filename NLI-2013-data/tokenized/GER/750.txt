What is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject ?
In my point of view this is a very controversial topic and I will explain you why .

On the one hand you can say , that a broad knowledge is very important and it is good to understand many things and If you know a lot you will be able to learn new things faster .

But on the other hand there are many disadvantages .
Fist , it takes a lot of time to get a broad knowledge .
For example you have to study longer and so you have less time to earn money later .

Second , you only take an overview of the topics , but you do not receive a deep understanding of them .
That is not a problem for easy discussions , but it is very depriving for really big problems like in scientific understanding .

Moreover , companies want to employ specialist , because they are often confronted with very difficult tasks , which can only solved by an expert .
So in a society , where knowledge is becoming more and more important we need people who are the best in their subject and not people , who only know a little bit about everything .

In addition to that you are unique when you are an specialist .
So you are better than the rest and therefore you are in a very comfortable postition .
For instance if you apply for job , you will have no problem to get it , because there are not very many other applicants , who are so fit as you .
As a result you get the job and you can earn a high salary and live a pretty good life .

To sum it up there are more andvantages than downsides to specialize in one specific subject .
Deeper understanding of the subject and work are only two points , which show you that specialist do better than people , who have a broad knowledge .
