Many peolpe have one or even more cars .
In todays time they have become very important to many people and they cannot miss them anymore .
I do not agree with the statement : In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

In my oppinion ther will not be many disadvanatges of cars in the future anymore .
There will be other sources of energie for cars that neither would be so bad for the environment nor would they be so expensive as energie is today .
As a result , many people would like to drive their car just because it is fun .
Because driving a car will be extremly secure in twenty years , there will be other types of cars invented that will be used just for fun .
Even poor people will be able to drive a car just for fun .
Driving in a car would be much more comfortable than it is today .
In addition to that there will be a better system of streets ; as a result , there will not be so much traffic anymore .
So all in all there will not be many disadvantages left .

In twenty years the peolpe will be more bussy than today .
Therefore they will need the car to move fast from one point to another .
It will be very important to have a perfect time-management .
The peolpe also will use the car in other ways as today .
They will use their car for meetings with other people or to have a braek and eat something in the car .
In my oppinion the car will play another role in the whole live of the people .

All these arguments support my oppinion , and show why I do not agree with the statement .
The car is very important to many people today and because of the development of the problem , not to have enough time , it will be impossible to miss the car for the most people .
As a result , there will be many cars in twenty years .
