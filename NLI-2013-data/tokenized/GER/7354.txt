I disagree with the statement that traveling in a group and with a tour guide is necessarly the best way to travel .
I aconsent that there are benefits of traveling with a group , but I view these benefits as being very dependent on the type of person you are , the destination of your travel , as well as the actual purpose of your travel .
If - for example - your travel objective is to experience the peace and tranquility of the German Black Forest , it is very unlikely that you would appreciate the constant company of your travel group members .
If on the other hand , you are seeking to party at a ski resort , having a group with which to participate in the numerous resort activities may make your trip especially memorable .

Likewise the benefits of a tour guide need to be viewed in context of the trip you are taking .
Tour guides might help you to learn more about the historic and cultural facts of your destination , but they might make you complacent in exploring for yourself and interacting with locals .

Personally I prefer traveling with fewer people rather than with a large group .
Also I prefer that these people comprise a small group of select friends , whom I know well and with whom I will generally share the same travel objectives .
I also prefer traveling without a tour guide and explore the places I am visiting without the confinements of a pre-planned tour , as I tend to value the opportunity for spontanaety , that vacations present .
( After all , is n't part of the joy of vacation being free to do as one feels ? ) .

Obviously this preference of mine does not exclude the option of hiring a tour guide for select parts of a trip .
For example on a recent trip to India I did apreciated the little gems of information provided by the tour-guide as he led me around the Taj Mahal .
Nonetheless , I was very glad not to have a tour guide constantly talking to me while I was exploring the beautiful back-waters of India 's Kerela .

Hence I think the expressed statement can be true for certain types of people , at certain times and in certain situations .
As an absolute statement , however , I would have to disagree .
