I do agree with the statement , that advertisments make products seem much better than they truely are .

But do the producers of the products really have another option ?
These people want to sell their product as often and as efficient as possible , which of course is understandable because this is what they do for living and also our modern century offers possibilities to make a product look perfect , such as TV or the world-wide-web .

So why should n't they make their product look brilliant ?

We all have experienced the following situation in one or the other way once in our life .
Imagine yourself coming home from a strenous day at work and all you want to do is relax with some good food in front of the TV .
You switch the TV on , and there is a commercial about teeth whitening toothpaste and additional material .
The commercial shows a beautiful woman , which is now , after using the bleaching material ONCE , even more successful in her carreer and private life since she has bleached her teeth .
Throughout the entire commercial she is smiling and having a good time and so the person watching this scenario naturally wants to indentify with her and wants to get the life she has .

After buying the entire bleaching material that is offered in the drugstore around the corner and going trough the ritual of testing everything , you will soon find out that it does not work out quite as well as it did with the woman on TV .
So you do it over and over again , and than after a while you notice that whenever you eat something cold or extremely heatened your teeth start hurting .
And there you have it .
This is not what they tell you in the commercial .
White bleached teeth and hurt go together .
Every dentist tells you that bleaching and exaggerated bleaching can and will harm your teeth .

I think this story is perfect to show that a product at first sight might seem perfect to you .
It concentrates on wishes and plays with desires you naturally have , for example , the wish to fit in a certain way of life , the desire of having a successful carreer and finding the love of your life .
The products promises more than it can really give to you , so of course you are disappointed if you do not get , what it has promised you before .

So my conclusion is , look behind the advertisement and do not believe everything because the real word differs from human dreams .
