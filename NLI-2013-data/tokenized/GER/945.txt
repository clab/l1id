The question which is discussed in the following passage is wheter a broad knowledge of many acadmic subjects is superior to knowledge specialiesed in on specific subject .

The idea to specialize in one activity is supported by the economic theory .
The idea behind this theory is that the efficiency increases as we specialize in doing something .
For example if we start playing an instrument we are getting better and beter the more we practice .
The more we do something the better we can do it and the better we know which way it is done best .
This theory can also be applied to education .
A student who studied a subject longer and more intense than another is likely to know more about it .

On the other hands side , there are also many advantages in having a broad knowledge .
Everything that happens , no matter if it is a ecological , sociological or another issue is somehow linked to other academic field .
A broad knowledge helps to see an issue in the whole context which is in my opinon very important .
If you are running a business for example , it is important to be aware of the ecological effects you cause .
If you would just concentrate on the economic side of this business and neglect other factors this could drawback on you in the future .
For example think of fishermen who want to increase their profit by fishing more in one year .
This behaviour could cause that in the following years there are to few fishes .

Another advantage i see , is that it is easier to communicate with other people if you have some idea of his main interest .
A broad knowledge can also be an inspiration .
You can adapt ideas from other subjects .

I personally prefer a broad knowledge because I like to undestand many aspects of one problem .
I see a lot of chances in it because of the interaction between the different subject .
But I also undestand if someone prefers to focus on on subject .
