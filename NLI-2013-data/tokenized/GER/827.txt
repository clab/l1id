The given thesis is highly controversial , especially when we take into consideration that the German academic programs were recently reformed towards that direction .
Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects goes hand in hand with an extraordinary wide spread education which is useful in various different ways in everyday life .
Knowledge in terms of biology , for example , can be easily applied to everyday experience during a walk in the near forest .
Questions posed by children may be answered appropriately and correctly in an enormous amount of fields .
On the other hand , today 's economic and societal development of our society results in an increasing differentiation concerning work tasks and work skills .
It is required to adapt to these new circumstances in a world which is on its way to become a global village .
In order to cope with this high-speed development , it is important to specify on a very small aspect of an academic discipline .
In order to bring my point across , I would like to give a short example : Small knowledge of economics in general is less asked for in today 's globalized world than knowledge concerning the solar energy markets in China .
From this it follows , that I do not agree with the given thesis .
At least not with the way it is formulated .
From my point of view , a good general education and knowledge is the basis for more differentiated and specified knowledge in a certain field .
Whereas the first helps in the private sector of an individual ( for example when it comes to his social status or social prestige ) , the latter is necessary in the public sector , namely the field in which the individual is working .
It is absolutely essential , to be an expert in that particular field .
Otherwise , a high-quality performance is not provided .
To sum it up , a broad knowledge and a very specialized knowledge concerning a certain topic should go hand in hand and lead into a compromise .
