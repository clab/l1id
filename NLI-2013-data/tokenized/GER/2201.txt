Well i think it 's very difficult to claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
The first quesiton is , what are old people , and what are young people ?

It mainly depends on the person .
Let us say young people are between 18 and 30 and eldery people are about 60 years old .
In this case , young people have other interests than eldery people have .
For example , young people are visiting discos or concerts with loud music , whereas eldery people are enjoing a good dinner in a calm and relaxed atmosphere with classical music in the backround .
But i have to mention , that i also know people who are about 60 who still attend concerts with loud music .
For example the generation who grows up with rollingstonse or ACDC still goes to their concerts .
The only difference is , that young people normaly are in better shape then eldery people are .
The older you are the more problems your are getting with your physical condition .
For example , young people can make more sports .
Eldery people have to care more about themselve .
Maybe young people are often more flexibel but this is also a stereotype .
After my opinion this is not very important to enjoy life .
Usually , Eldery people can do the same things like younger people can do if they are carefully .
They even have one important advantage , because they usually have more time and more money to enjoy their life than younger people have .
If they have enough money , they can fly or travel to each place where they want to , whereas the younger ones have to go to school , to university or to work .
The young people either have n't enough money to do things or they have n't enough time .

Like i have written at the beginning of this text , how you enjoy life depends on your pesonaltiy and on your flexability .
If you stay in life and if you stil have fun , the age is n't so importan for enjoing life .
