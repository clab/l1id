in twenty years there probably will be a much better system of alternative ways of movement , like the train , in the most industrial countries .
so people there wont need their car to go to vacation or even to their jobs .

also there will be a big raise of the oil price in the next 20 year and , because of the growing enviromental-pollution , a lot of restrictions on car-driving , which means car-driving will be much more expensive than now , so people will try to minimize car-using .

but there are also many reasons why the nuber o cars will grow up in the next 20 years .

first of all , mobility is getting more ond more importent in the buisness-live .
the distances between the workling-place and the place you are living will expend , so more people will use a car going to work .

second , the number of cars in the countries of the third world will raise extremly .
nations like china or india , where most of the people dont have cars by now , will become more wealthy .
so the people living in these countries will be able to buy cars .

and remember , the number of people living there is much bigger than the number of people living in the industrial nations .

cuncluding , i think the number of cars in the industrial countries , like the usa oder germany , will decline in the next 20 years .
but in the same time , the number of cars in the third world countrise will raise much faster .
so , all in all , i disagree with the statement in the question .
i think , in 20 years there will be more cars on the earth than now .
