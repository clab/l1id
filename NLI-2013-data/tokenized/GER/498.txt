I do agree to the statement that it is better to know many things briefly rather than knowing only few things in detail .
There are so many different academic subjects that hardly no one is able to have a deep knowleadge of all of them at the same time .
Knowing a bit of many subjects is more worth because it makes you look at things more widely .
Also I think it is more worth because you become open minded .
You do not only focus on few things but consider many different aspects you have learned about .

Another argument to underline my opinion is that you have better conversations with people by knowing many things briefly .
On the one hand it is great to have a deep knowleadge of something and of cause it is also very impressing .
However on the other hand I think as that kind of person you can only have a good conversation with specialists like you .
You are not able to see things in a big picture .
To my mind having a brief knowleadge about many academic subjects is more worth it .

To give an example imagine you are having a conversation in a train or another public place with a person you have just met .
The chance that this person has the same knowleadge and same interests you do so you have somehing to talk about is very low .
But if you have lots to talk about because you know a lot , does not matter if it is just a basic knowleadge or not , the conversation would be very good .

To sum up it is just more worth and helpful in life to have a brief knowleadge about academic subjects because the chance you find somebody you can talk to is very high .
Also very important is that you experience a lot and become open minded which to my mind you can only become if you have a wide knowleadge .
