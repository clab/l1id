To talk about successfull people makes it neccessary to define success itself .
Per definition success is the ability to adapt to life circumstances that will grant to make them or life better than others or to open better opportunities for themself or their families .
So success goes definately along with new things on a special field nobody ever did before .
Every day people take the risk of trying new things .
If in the past , there was no one who attempted to try something else than the routine , there wo n't have been people , who developed the tire .
A tire was in the ancient times only for material transport , where trees could be transported form one place to another .
Nobody around that time thought of beeing successfull .
It was an idea that made routine and life more easy .
After some thousand years Karl Benz developed the first automobile .
The people were afraid , as they are ususally with upcoming new inventions .
He took the risk with investing money in an idea , that collected some allready existing good ideas ( tires ) .
He made something new that today people cannot think to life without : the car .
He was successfull , he took the risk of failure for implementing something new in the society .
Another example is the carreer of the mobile phone , computer and many other electrical devices that nobody believed in but that under construction of several years went out to be a great success .
And that is the same for people .
People doing the same thing the same way during all their life wo n't face any kind of development .
Some people change in small steps others in big ones , depending on their social experience and their family background .
But of course not everybody can be the risky one .
That is why nature made all varieties of expression of such a behavior .
If all people were doing the same , and for example that could be an error or disadvantage , the whole planet would be gone .
So only some people try to be extraordinary or in some kind different that the rest .
And the others can use their inventions as well , when it is sold as a product , that system is called merchandising .
And the others can pay with their abiltiy that brought them that amount of money so they can join the progress that the others went through without a risk .
So I think successfull people trz new things but thez do not have the full response of beeing successfull , it is , additional what nature and life gave us with them .
It 's chance and luck .
