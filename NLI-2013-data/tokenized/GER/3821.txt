Many people say that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I definately agree with that .
That the statement is true , could easily be shown by any cientific research comparing what young people in general do now and what they used to do in earlier generations .
In my opinion different reasons let to this .

One reason is , that , compared to the past , people live in a more individualistic way .
Most people grow up in a small family , often not even with both but only one parent , and family ties become less and less strong .
While in the old days there where always uncles and grandparents etc. to play an important role in the upbringing of a child , nowadays often there is no relationship at all because being a family member is not enough of a reason to keep in contact .
This has an important impact on a childs development .
If you shouldnt even care about your family , why should you care about your community !

This change of the way how people grow up came along with a shift of values .
For our parents generation for example it was normal and looked upon as very positiv for children to help their mother with the cooking , to look after their younger brothers and sisters , to visit and spend time with their grandparents .
Nowadays , these actions are just not rated very highly .
If a child exeeds at sport , is very smart , very beautiful or anything else related to it as a single human being , in society this counts much more then just being nice and helpful .
It is all about being successful yourself and not about how you interact with others .
So it is no wonder that young people tend to put their own interest first before they consider anyone elses interest !
It is only logical that children or young adults choose to do things that others will find attractive and important .
