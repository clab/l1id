I agree with the statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
Let me begin by saying that time has changed .
In former times most of the people live in small villages and everybody knows each other .
It was common that young people help in their communities .
Nowadays , for example in big cities nobody really cares about the others .
They often do not even know their neighbours .
So it 's difficult for young people to help .

Secondly in former days parents were stricter than now .
Young people had to help in their communities , because their parents did it as well .
They had no choise to do other things they might prefer .
And in my opinion this is a good system , because people at this age often do n't think of helping in their communities .
Today parents let them decide theirselves if they want to help or not .
And if it was not expeceted to them , only a few people at this age are kind enough to help .
I think parents play an important role at this question .

Last but not least nowadays people might have n't enough time to help their communities .
They have to go to school and after that they have to do their homework .
Today this could be a lot of work and in some areas schools lasts till late in the afternoon .
After finishing this most children or teens just want to relaxe or do some sports .
It might sound egoistic but they do not really care about their communities .
Because they are still young I think they need to play after work and they do n't want to help anybody .

In conclusion I agree with the statement because times have changed and people really do n't spend much time to helpnig their communities .
