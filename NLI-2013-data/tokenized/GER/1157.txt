I am not sure about this statement .
I would say it depends on the focus you put on your life .
I will start with the business part and illustrate that with a few examples of my life .
I am studying english and politics at the university of Wuerzburg .
In the english subject it is very important to know all the specific terms for words of the subject .
you have to be very into literature , culture and history of the countries where english is spoken .
Mainly of course such countries as the United States and Great Britain .

In my other subject , politics , I have to read a daily newspaper and to know what is going on in the world .
Thus , you see I need a broad knowledge of daily life .
But I also have to be specialized in my subject , I have to know various political systems for example and I need to have informations about political regimes and history of countries others surely do not know ..

For my career I need to be specialized in mz subjects , but also have to have some broad knowledge of other academic subjects .
For example if I talk in a presentation about the political situation in Iraq I should also know at least where Iraq is geographically .

Whereas in social life it is better to have a broad knowledge than to have the focus only on your specific subjetc .
I give you an example : As a student you sometimes get an invitation to a party .
It can easily happen that you get in contact with unknown persons .
In order to get a conversation started you should have a topic you can talk about .
This topic should be something your partner can easily get into .
If you want to avoid a boring converstaion about the weather it is better to have some knowledge about something else .

Nowadays manz people go to television game shows , there it is also important to have a broad knowledge , if you want to win a lot of money .

In the end I think I can say , that it is important to to have both if you want to be sucsessful in life , wether its in the private sector or in the business one .
