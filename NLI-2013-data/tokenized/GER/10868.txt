In my opinion , there are both , advantages and disadvantages about trying new things and taking risks .
Some people might feel relunctant to change methods of a successful company , others might feel more open about it .
I used to be the person who does not take a lot of risk in the past , but recently my attitude has changed .
I think that being successful in life , just can be achieved by trying new things and taking risks .
For example , a member of a football team .
If he just reacts and plays safely meaning making no faults , he cannot get a better soccer player .
He just stays at his level , but does not become a professional player one day .
A soccer player who wants to achieve someting , has to take risk .
This risks can be changing the soccer team where he has stayed for five years to a successul , better team where he does not know the members , the coach or the surrounding of this team .

Taking risks and trying new things can also have some negative aspects .
If you take risks , there will always be the opportunity to make it wrong , to loose something .
But if you do not make faults , you wo n't learn about things and decisions you made .

An example for a sport where you cannot take any risks is the formula one .
The race drivers cannot take risks , because every fault can cause death for them .
So , the level of taking risk for car pilots in the formula one , is very low .
They have to drive successful , meaning driving fast , but it is very important for them and their team to drive safely .

To sum it all up and to summarize my opinion about the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than onlz doing what they already know how to do well '' , i would say that successful people have to take risks , but there are some situations or some jobs where zou have to do what zou have learned .
