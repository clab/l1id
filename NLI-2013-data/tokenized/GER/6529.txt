I do completely agree with this statement and think that there will be indeed fewer cars on the street than there are nowadays .
First of all , there is our problem with the ressources of fossil fuels that are rapidly coming to an end .
Whereas coal , according to todays calculations , will still last for another fifty years , oil , the most important ressource for the fuel for our cars , will get rare in already about ten years from now on .
And since there is no other material which has a comparable energy density - I cannot tell the exact number but I know that the energy density of oil is at least a factor of about 1x10 to the power of 2 higher than the energy density of coal or gas - and is available in the necessary amount it will be very difficult to substitute this ressource .
And energy density is a very important factor since I think everybody will rather like to drive with a 50 liter tank of oil instead of pulling a one cubic meter coal car behind him or having to go and get a new gas filling after every 100 kilometers .

A second reason why there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is that the public transport systems are steadily improved .
In smaller cities the people can use buses and trains to get to work or to do freetime activities and in larger cities they even have street cars , subways and other possible transports for the people to get around .
Moreover , with fuel prices increasing rapidly due to the decreasing oil ressources it will become financially more efficient or even necessary for many people to use public transport systems .
Also the companies of many public transport systems offer special offers such as the so called `` Vorteilscard '' in Austria which makes it possible to travel by train for half of the normal prize .

Finally , we also have to consider the world wide problem of pollution and the greenhouse effect .
If we want this planet to be a comfortable home to live on we need to do something to stop global warming which is mainly caused by the CO2 emissions that are for a big amount generated from the cars .
Therefore , the governments will issue special new laws and regulations which will force people to search for other possibilities of travelling or they will offer incentives to the people that will encourage them to take public transport systems .
Again an example for this comes from Austria but I am sure that there are comparable programs in most other nations as well .
In Austria the government offers tax reductions for people if they take the public transport system to go to work .
