I disagree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their communities . ''
I believe that there are a lot of young people right now , that contribute to the benefits of our society and/or communities .

In the course of the last fifty years , young people have gained a lot of independence from their families and from their communities .
We have more freedom , of course within the bounds of our parents rules .
But with independece comes responsiblity and I firmly believe that young people take this responsibilty not as a burden , but as a chance .

In Germany there are several volunteer based organisations , only led by some staff members , but made effective by their large volunteer basis .
Church - , as well as Non-Profit - and Government-Organisations .

In these organisations most of the volunteers are young people .
They can contribute the time and are willing to contribute the effort to improve something in their community .
Because of my experience as a volunteer in the AFS ( American Field Service , the world-leader in student exchange ) and another Church-Organisation I take the freedom to discuss the motivation of young people to engage in these activities .

It is a plattform to communicate and connect with other young people , while improving your own `` soft-skills '' and helping a worthy project .
That seems like a very good oportunity .
Young people know that they are helping , but in my opinion there is no reason not to have fun while doing it .

The discussed statement implies an older speaker , a grown-up , who believes that in his time , young people were doing more for their communities , that he in his youth was doing more , than young people do today .

Maybe the kind of work changed over the course of years as well .
Today these volunteer organisations make food ralleys , fundraise money doing car-washing or make benefit tombolas , while in the past , `` helping your community '' was maybe more like collecting trash from the community garden .

Helping your community has become more attractive over the course of time for young people and there are a lot of young people doing this kind of work , but maybe the areas of this work have changed so that for a outside viewer it looks like less is done .
