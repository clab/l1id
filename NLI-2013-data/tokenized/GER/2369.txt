The question if young people enjoy their life more than older people is hard to answer generally .
I would not say that this is always true , but for most of the cases i agree with the statement .

I think that young people are more free in their thinking in the way that they are often not think about the consequences first .
They put many things not in considerations .
They just do it .
My younger brother for example , he is 19 , is often going to travel without beeing worried about what comes next .
I think he is a quite happy person who really enjoys his life .

Older people , in contrast , see the same things often with different eyes .
They have much more life experiance and another view on many things and I think this is often a more negative view .
Older people thinks about consequensives first and are often more worried about what could happen in a negative way instead of how could this be enjoyable for me .
My mother for example was grown up in the communist system and was treatend badly .
Nowadays she is a very pessimistic person and has mostly bad oppinions about things which i see actually positive .
Sometimes I think she is not enjoying her life that much .

My brother and me are grown up in another environment than my parents .
We were grown up in a surrounding of freedom and had less worries in our young life then my parents had during their youth .
This is one of the reasons that i agree to the statement that older people enjoy life less than younger do , in most of the cases .
Surely i think that in other cases older people are enjoying their live as same as younger do or even more .
