I am convinced that it is beneficial to specialize in one specific academic area once a general understanding of other areas is achieved .

If we look back into history , we can find many scientists that were great in a wide variety of subjects .
Today , this cannot be achieved anymore .
While back then , there were still many things to be discovered and it was possible to have a broad knowledge of and do research in different academic fields , today 's scientists have to specialize to be able to do research on a specific topic .
And this research can be very important to society , leading to a better understanding of topics .
For example , without research it would be impossible to find cures for diseases .
Now nobody could do medical research before specializing in this specific area .

I agree that it is important to know about a variety of things .
In fact , the public school system should provide a core understanding of science , arts and humanities .
But on a professional level we need to specialize in order to be successful .

This is easier to explain when looking at music .
Would you rather listen to someone that can play drums , the guitar , the piano and the violine , but is not great at neither of them or listen to someone play one of these instruments with perfection ?
One person also can only play one instrument at a time .
Look at the Dave Matthews Band , `` America 's greatest band '' , as the Rolling Stone magazine judged .
All members know their instrument to near perfection .
That is the main reason for their popularity and their sold-out tours year after year , not the fact , that they are able to play all instruments equally well .

This also applies to many other areas .
Another great example are sports .
A football team needs players that are specialized in throwing , catching , running , blocking etc ..
Of course it is important and even necessary for every player to have a basic understanding of the game , but if you want to be successfull you need to have players that are great at their assignments .
Overall , a linemen put into the position as place kicker would most likely lead to a catastrophy .

All these examples show that , while learning about the basics of different subjects , it is important to find out where your special talents are , to pursue them and specialize in them .
