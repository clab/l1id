I agree with the statement .
A successful person might take a risk instead of doing what he or she already knows .
A successful man is a person that knows nearly everything about his work .
His knowledge is the fundament of his good work so he might be successful .
The question is if such a person would take a risk to gain maybe more money or more success .

If a person knows everything about a topic he or she might be better in speculating about the futur .
A successful owner of a store must know how to lead the store .
Because of his knowledge he might know how much money he could invest in making the store more effective or more successful .
It may be a risk to invest a high ammount of money because the owner speculats that there will be buyers that will buy his products .
But if the owner is right , and in the next time is something like an unseen event that makes the place where his store is more atractive to the people he will be more successful .
Not only the ammount of money but even the time of investment must be right .
A successful person must know when the time might be rigt to invest .
If this person knows the system the risk is more transparent to him or her , so he or she might take the risk .

A successful person might be also creative , thats one of the faults he or she is successful .
A creative idea is always something within a risk , but the difference is that a successful person might know the risk better .
Another point is that a person that never failed with their work does not know how it is to be wrong or to be not successful .
This person might feel save in every action he or she might take , so this person will try something new without fearing something bad .

A person that is not so gifted might not have investment ideas or any ideas of improving the situation so he or she would continue their work as the already know without any risk .
So from my point of view the statement given in the question is correct .
