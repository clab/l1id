As a response to the question `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars that there are today '' , I strongly believe that this statement holds true for numerous reasons .
Firstly , the production of cars increases annually due to the increase of demand all over the world .
Hence , the emission produced by the higher number of cars present will endanger the environement causing health problems for animals as well as human beings .
When this problem arises , countries from all over the world might decide to restrict the emission output of every country to a certain number , with the goal of controlling and therefore reducing the emission output of cars in the world .
This will lead to less cars being produced and hence , fewer cars being present on the roads in each country .

Secondly , from personal experience in Istanbul , Turkey , I have noticed that the amount of cars have increased on the roads and highways in the last three years , causing long traffic jams and more serious accidents .
As this will become more frequent in the near future , I believe that the Turkish government will take control of the situation , limiting the amount of cars sold thus reducing the number of cars used in Turkey .
In this respect , I think that every country will go about the same procedure if similiar problems arise in their country .

Another reason for supporting this statement is that the political and economic situations in many of the westernized countries have become more critical in recent years .
Germany , as an example , has difficulties in their economy as it has been declining for years causing the living standards to drop .
In a few years time , many people will not be able to affort a car .
Due to similiar problems slowly spreading over many western countries , it will also affect their economy causing people not being able to afford a car .
This will result in less cars being used in the next twenty years .

The recently increasing petrol and oil prices due to the crises in the Middle East , has lead many people in numerous countries , such as Germany , to stop using a car .
They rarther use public transport as this is a much cheaper solution for them .

In conclusion , I strongly believe that the amount of cars used in twenty years will be much less due to the above mentioned reasons .
