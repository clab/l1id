Since this statement is not very definite it is not easy to say if I agree or disagree .
What I am saying is that not all young people are the same .
Neither old people are .
At first , I asked myself the question : Who is young and who is old - how old is old , how old is young ?
If you ask a teenager he will propably tell you that everybody over 25 is old and if you ask a 40 year old he will say that 60 is old .

In the following part of my answer I will thing of young people beening up to 30 years and old people are all the persons beeing older than that .
And there is still one big problem : Not all people under 30 are the same , neither are the people over 30 .
I think young people always had fun .
Young people go partying , they enjoy `` sex , drungs and rock'n roll '' , they travel the world , they play sports and enjoy their lives .
Young people always have done such things .
My generation did , my parents generation did , my gradparents generation did my kids will probalbly do too one day .
It is different with old people : In past days the people worked a lot and once they retired they died soon .
They somethimes went on vacation , but that was it .
Today old people start to enjoy their lifes , too .
Since the population gets older and older there are so many old people who can spent their remaining time with nice things .
Some move to a nice warm place in the South , some travel and do cruses , others start going to university again .

In todays time people of all ages have the chance to enjoy their lifes .
There are always people who do n't know how to enjoy life , but that does n't depent on their age .
In the mainstream both , young and old people , enjoy there lifes .
I cannot say who does more because they do it in a different way .
