I think it is pretty hard to say this in general .
Maybe it is true for some people but false for others .
But for the first part in life it may be true almost for everyone :
Let us start with the childhood age , usually the youngest one can remember .
Apart from several people , that go through rather harsh times during childhood ( divorce of their parents , deseases and so on ) usually people enjoy life to the fullest in that period .
You have a lot of spare time , school is not so important to you and you do n't care about the future too much .
So normally , you life a live that is free of sorrow and worries .

After that , during teenage , it gets more complicated :
Many people get a little bit depressive , it is not called the difficultest age for nothing .
In that phase of life , people usually do n't enjoy it that much .
But there are always others , who go to parties a lot , and fall in love for the fist time and all that , so these ones will enjoy that time a lot , maybe even more than childhood .
I am not sure which one of these is the bigger part , but I think , in general , most people would say , that this age was not as good as childhood .

Then , after graduating form high school , one either starts to work or begins to studiy at college .
Both ways of life have in common , that your free time gets more and more limited .
Either you have to work from nine to five , or you have to learn and pass compicated examinations .
Many people in that age are getting concerned about future .
They may have fear of losing their job , or failing in some tests at college .
Besides that , in that age , you have to organize your personal life at the same time .
There I think of founding a family and raising own chidren .
So more and more your time gets less and your worries increase .

But maybe there is light in sight at the end of the tunnel :
There is a whole lot of people who start to enjoy life the most , when they are retired .
They then have plenty of time again , and they do n't worry too much about the future anymore .

So basically I would for most people it is enjoyable at the start and at the end of there lives .
Maybe like walking through a valley .
But of course there might be very much exceptions to the ways of life I mentioned above .
For example some people are either lonely or very sick at the end of their lives .
In that case , there is no doubt , wheather they enjoyed life more when they were younger .
