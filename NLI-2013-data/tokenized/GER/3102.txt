It is difficult to answer this question .
Young people have all their lifes ahead , everything is new .
They have their dreams that they hold on to , and they are , usually , full of hope .

Older people on the other hand , have learned a lot already , and acquiered some wisdom .
They see life and certain things like love less complicated .
They had their experiences and are much cooler than when they were young .

But young people have the advantage to be healthier and full of power and strength to live their youth and to make experiences themselfes .
Older people are more likely to get sick and to feel tired and weak .
So maybe their bodys are not what they used to be .
But the expierences they made and what they have learned about life and about themselfes helps them to take it easy .
Their mind is stronger .
A old man laughs about this childish young guy who is so desperatly in love that he is not able to eat or to think , because he can only think of his girl .
But he also envies him for being so strong and active and to have such intense feelings .

This is something he lost on his way becoming a mature man .
Being young is an adventure , and you may enjoy it or you may regret it .
It is full of action and impressions , but for me , maybe because I m young and have not experienced being old , i still believe that the future , in wich i will be old , offers me plenty of happyness .

It will be different , though .
I am quite sure it depends on every single person whether they are happier when they are young or old .
But I have to admit , that even if I think that it only gets better , most of the old people miss their youth very much .
But it can be joyfull to remember to !
I think you should enjoy every age .
But as the youth is more intense , I think that for most people the youth is the part of their lifes that they enjoy the most .
