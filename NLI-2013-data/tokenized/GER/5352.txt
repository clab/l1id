The statement infers that advertisements often make products seem much better than they really are .
On the one hand I believe that this suggestion often might be true .
On the other hand you have to consider that every enterprise wants to make the best of his product and advertisement is always a good way of addressing customers .
The enterprises are doing great research work to produce the best possible advertisement for a product .
They pay other enterprises to make studies on what customers are attracted by .
Of course they have to present their product in an very attractive way .
For example the advertisements for body - lotions often include very good-looking women .
The customers are firstly attracted by the advertisemnet with the beautiful woman , then they relate the woman to the product , they buy the product and then they might be dissappointed because they do not look as the woman on the picture after having applied the lotion on to the skin .
It is understandable that the customer is dissappointed but the enterprise has reached its goal and has sold its product .

At this point I will come to the other side .
It is not fair that the customer has spent so much money on something he believed in but was dissapointed .
Of course an advertisement has to be attractive but nobody is allowed to lie .
The customers often loose their confidence in the enterprises and will never buy anything of this enterprise again .
I believe that it is more effective to stick to the truth .
The customers would not be dazzled by promised results and might buy the product again .

Additionally advertisements are not only been made on TV or on the street but in conversations .
People tell each other of somenthing new they have tried and they give good reputitions so other people might try this product , too .

Sometimes it is in my opinion even more effective to make advertisements in form of promotions in supermarkets where a real person talks to you and lets you try the product .
Having tried the product and having talked to somebody who knows more about it is in my view better than having unpersonal advertisements on walls in the city .

In conclusion I would say that there are much better ways to present a product than to overrate it and lie to the customers .
