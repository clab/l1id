Today , we are facing serious environmental threats resulting from the excessive use of cars .
Passing a gas station demonstrates us daily that gas prices are increasing tremendously .
Also on a day-to-day basis , the media tells us about political conflicts mostly resulting from oil issues in the Middle East .
Thus , it may lead us to the question if the invention of the car was a good idea .
Moreover , it is intersting to think about the question if there will be as many cars as today in twenty years from now .
I do not think so for the reasons I would like to give in this essay .

First , oil resources are deminishing very rapidly and statistics show that we will eventually run out of oil and gas .
This , of course , depends on the pace we are using our oil .
But it seems very obvious that the vast oil reserves will be totally gone in twenty years if we use oil as we us it today .
Thus , as there will be no fuel in the future there will certainly be fewer cars as well .

Second , the car as we use to know it now is probably going to dissappear .
Technology develops at a such quick pace that there will be new facilities which will transport us and our goods in the future .
Twohundred years ago , people thought that the train is going to be the new vehicle of the future .
However , as the car was invented , trains were not the only transportation means anymore , thus resulting in a decrease of trains being used .
In the same way , it might be happen with the automobile .
Even today , cars are not used that often anymore when cheap airplane tickets become more and more available .

Lastly , I believe that the need to get from one point to the other will be not as high as it is today .
In twenty years , computer technologies will have advanced in such a tremendous way that almost everything will be possible to do from home .
This trend can already be seen today , as many companies are offering jobs that can be done from home using the Internet .
Thus , people will not leave their house in the future as they do now and can leave their car , if the vehicle is still named as such , in their garage .

In conclusion , I feel that it is obvious from the arguments given above that there will be tremendously less cars in the future .
Moreover , it is impossible to say if such a vehicle will still exist in twenty years from now .
