In my opinion it is better to be specialized in one subject .

The first reason for this is that nowadays it is important to be specialized .
You need to be unique .
When people are looking for a job it is much easier to find one if you are an expert in your area .

Today many people have a broad knowledge of different subjects , but I think that these knowledges are unimportant and wo n't help to get a job .
Why I 'm thinking this ?
Well , most of the things people with a broad education know are only basics to an expert .

Another reason why I belive that it is better to learn just one subject is that it 's much easier to concentrate on it .
You start with the basics and the topic will involve more and more details as you keep on learning about it .
If you are studying many different subjects instead , you only get to scratch the surface each time .

I know that supporters of the statement would say that it is necessary to study many subjects because today many areas are linked .
In their opinion somebody who has a greater variety in academic subjects is therefore able to find conculsions in complex matters .

I disagree with that because I do n't think that you will learn enough to solve a complex problem linking different areas all by yourself .
A group of experts on the other side should't have a problem with that .

Also , if you 're an expert , it is not that easy to replace you .
But if you 're not an expert , it 'll be easy to replace because there many people having the same knowledge .

All in all , I think to be specialized has more positive aspects than having little knowledge of different subjects and should therefore be recommended to students .
