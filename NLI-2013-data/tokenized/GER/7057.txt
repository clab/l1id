First of all I would like to define what a car might be in 20 years .
For me it is possible that cars can fly in twenty years .
Thus , the traffic will extend from the ground into the air .

The world 's population is increasing every year , which means that there will be more customers , who will need a car .
China , for example , is becoming economicly more and more successfull .
There will be an increase in the employment rate , which leads to a higher qualified personal and an increase in the individuals income .

Basicly , people can afford more , and one of the first thing someone buys when he can afford it , is a car .
At hte same time more poeple means more logistics to sustain the basic necissities of life .
There will be an increse in public transportation as well .
If there will be rescrictions on the total number of vehicles on the planet because of pollution , I simply say that fossil resources will be exhausted in twenty years , anyway , and that engines will run on electricity from sunlight or other clean energy sources .

Cars are the cheapest choice for transporting , next to trains of course , but they are much more mobile than trains and therefore more frequently used to transport goods .
I guess that the car producing industry will although have a word in that matter , because it is an ever newe inventative section of industry , which provides may working places all over the planet .
The car industry can count on governmental aid should it ever come to a point when no more cars are neede , which will never .
Ever !

Therefore I totally diagree with the statement , that there will be less cars on the road than there are today .
Human society and the world wide trade would crush down without a agil and cheap transportation systam as cars .
