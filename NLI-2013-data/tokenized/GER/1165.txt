I think there are two kinds of people :
The first kind is good in knowing general topics and so this kind has a good broad knowledge .
The second typ is good in knowing specific information about one topic .
We need both kinds of people to manage the living on our earth , because experts are needed to make new discoveries in science , nature or anything else .
Without this experts our technical evolution could n't be continued .

The human beeings who have the general knowladge are good to `` tidy up '' our world .
They can create a system in which we can put the lot of information we get every day .
Such men or women are also neccessary for our culture , way of live and organisation of the live .

Without the experts we would n't be so far in technique and social status , probably we would live with the dinosaurs , but without the other group , we would n't be able to understand all of the new things that are invented or discovered or die under the mountain of ideas , new topics and inventions .
The most specialists are not good in explaining new things , because the most speak in their own language .
Every Topic has its ' own language so you are not able to know what 's going on ...

We need a good balance between specialist and people who have a good broad knowledge .
I ca n't say the one is better than the other !
I think that I 'm am specialist who knows one or to topics next to another realy good , but not the rest .
And my brother knows much more topics , but not so deep like me .
Together we are a really good team wich can solve a lot of problems in a very efficient way .
So this is a good example for what I ment in this essay .
Everybody only have to know what he wants and maby a little more and nobody should be discriminated because of his knowledge or unknowledge .
