For a comunity it is really imporpant that a lot of people help for free otherwise a community can not exist .
To clear what I am writing about I will state first different possibilities where young people can help in thier communities and then answer why they do it or not .

In every community there are churches where young people can help .
A church contains people of all ages and young people can help seniors in a variety of filed as for example carry home their borrowed things or drive them home .

Young people can also help thier communities by partizipating in a party and try to change the politics in a new more effective direction .
If young people can identify themselves neither with a church nor with a political party the can partizipate in social activities in general .

At first I would like to stress that not all young people do not give enough time for activies helping the community .
On the other hand I am sure that there are too less young people helping thier communities .

A problem for most young people have is that they have to focus on school or university in order to get a job in the end .
Many young people do not partizipate in the three possible ways stated above because they do not see consideration .
They are working for free and giving away a lot of time and in the end most of the time no one pays attention for these performed activities .
It is a huge compenporay problem that what countes most is the degree from school or university and social activity does not get attention .

I learned it by me own that another graduate pupil got a certificate for good marks without havong done any social activiety in his communities .
The other pupil who had nearly as good marks as he had did not get a prize for that .
The society should honour more social activities .
Even when applying for university the students should have the possibily to show the social activities they have performed in the past .

The circumstances which may led to the situation why too may young people help are that do not know where to go to when they are willing to help .
Church and political parties do not attract everyone .
Most of the young people may not just go to a hospital and ask there if they need any help .
I think the schools and universities should offer more possibilities for young people performing social work like installing a socail day where all students work together for the communitiy .
The parents should wake up the social side of their childs as early as possibly .
When the children see that the partents perform social activities for the communities it will engage them to partizipate more .

The last possible reason why too less young people help their communities is that the older people think that the young people are not reliable enough for socail activities and do not give the young people the possibiliy to work for their communities .

A change of society wil change the young peoples ' behaviour an will bring us to the best We should start the change .
