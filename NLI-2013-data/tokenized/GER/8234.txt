Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts ?

By learning facts it is possible for the student to get access to lots of information .
Huge topics and their contents can be passed in a minimum of time .
But certainly the students will forget a lot of information as fast as they have just learned them .

If students have mainly to understand the ideas and concepts of a theme they need more time to pass the same quantity of information but they do realy know it and will not forget it as quickly as they do if they would just learn it without understanding .

So both sides has their positive and negative arguments .
The quantity of information on the one hand , the long time argument on the other hand .

Is it better to have a lot of information in your brain you do not realy understand or would you be better of with some information you can handle and understand ?

Well , the best way is surely the intermediate way .
Every student has to find his balance between learning facts and understanding ideas .
There are certain things you do have to know but do not need to explain and the other way around .

If you study science for example you have to learn a lot of facts and there is no chance you will ever understand all of them .
The topics are just to huge and for instant every process you learn is so complex that it is just not possible to fully understand it .

So one should not concentrating on just understanding ideas ( this would take a lifetime ) neither one should just learn facts .
You would not know what to do with them .
It is just dangerous because if you do not know what you do and something occurs what you have not learned , you are helpless .

Referring for the question of the essay , there is no `` more important '' .
It is as important to learn facts as to understand ideas and concepts .
If students go to an extrem they will find out that this does not work .

Today society is complex , the human nature and a lot of processes are complex too .
If you study you try get in to a certain topic , a topic which is also complex .
Just if learning and understanding are combined in balance a student can be long time successfull .
