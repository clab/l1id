`` Everybody back to the bus please ! ''
The voice of the tourguide was as distressing as the shrill sound of my alarm clock on a monday morning .
We had had only five minutes to look at the exibited Apollo rocket , when we were called back this way , off to the next sight .
The short drive was made unpleasant by the overly obese neighbor , who spilled into my seat and pressed me against the glass of the window .

This is , how I remember my trip to Cape Caneveral in Florida on a guided tour , one of a group of 24 tourists .
Not an enjoyable memory .
Some people like to travel that way .
I think that traveling in a group led by a guide is almost a guarantee for a regrettable experience .

First of all , you have to do what the guide tells you .
The plans were made under consideration of the special logistics and economics that a group brings with it , by people you do n't know .

On a trip to spain I took with a group , I was not able to visit a church I had read about and which interested me .
Instead I had to go to a so-called `` spanish evening '' ( in spain ! )
to see mediocre flamenco dance and eat less-than-great paella .

Then , of course , you are constrained by the time table that was set for the group .
You can not linger around a sight that fascinates you .
No , you have to rush off , in order to check off another item the agenda .
A friend of mine told me how he was rushed through the Tower of London by his tour guide , although he really wanted to spend more time there to connect with the circumstances of the prisoners which were once held there .

And , above all , you do n't chose your travel companions .
The behaviour of other group members is sometimes the straw that breaks the camels back .
The perfect example herefor is maybe the movie `` Trains , plains and automobiles '' .

All this should make it clear , that it is better to travel with people one knows and likes .
And to make one own 's plans .
