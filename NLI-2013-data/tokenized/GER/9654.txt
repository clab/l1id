I would agree with the given statement , but only to a certain extend .
I consider it true that in order to have success , one has to try things that are new and innovative in at least one aspect .
But , on the other hand , one has to apply such skills as he posseses in order to get the best outcome possible out of his actions .
There are examples of people trying new things , not achieving anything .
Vincent Van Gogh is one of these .
He did something highly innovative , according to standards and taste of his time , without having any success in his life .
On the other hand , there are examples of people merely copying an idea or a product who are enjoying immediate success .
`` StudiVZ '' , the german version of american `` facebooks '' , an internet domain where students and other young people create an internet profile of themselves and share friends , is a perfect example : The inventors of `` StudiVZ '' copied the whole idea of facebooks .
The only new , innovative thing they accomplished was transferring it to Germany , where it had immediate success .
Of course , there is a new aspect added to the original idea in transferring the concept to a different country , but it is by no means a genuine idea .
To my eyes , these two examples show that the given statement is rather general and superficial , implying that successful people are innovative whereas the unsuccessful ones are not .
Success is certainly dependent on a variety of factors besides the idea being new , such as fashion , skill , fundings , etc .

I doubt there is a formula , a certain way to success .
Nonetheless , the given statement 's truth lies in stressing the importance of new ideas for being succesful .
In my opinion , the key to success is to be innovative , but not necessarily by trying a completely new thing or do something that surpasses one 's own skills .
Rather , one should carefully consider options , wait for the best moment to come forth with a new idea and think of the best way of issueing this new idea to the market .
