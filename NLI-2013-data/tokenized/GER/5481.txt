I totally agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Today , advertisements and marketing play more and more a decisive role in business world .
As the competition is considerable , the firms are obliged to sell theirs products .
Therefore , they have to create a brilliant advertisement convincing the customers and sometimes they invent advantages of theirs products which does n't exist .
In order to enhance the market position and to stay competitive , the firms try to present their product as an ideal product .
It is obvious that several customers are disappointed after having bought the product due to the fact that the product does n't fit to the features made in the advertisement .

The globalisation is certainly one of the reasons why the advertisements become more and more irrealistic .
The firms and the products are pressed to compete not only with firms of their own country or their continent but also with firms from all over the world .
The advertisements are distributed and shown in several countries so that the pressure increases .
The world is become one huge market .
Thus , one can even understand why the firms change the product features .

In this context , it is necessary to mention the role of marketing .
The budget of the marketing departments are in general very high .
For this reason , the firms are able to create sophisticated advertisements which comprise special effects and sometimes even coincide with films .
Because of the perfect advertisement , the customer could believe that the product is perfect .

Nevertheless , I think that the advertisements should reflect the real caracteristics of the products .
The firms should be fair and respect theirs customers by not making the products better than they reallz are .
