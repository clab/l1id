In the following I shall give my opinion about the question of whether it is better to have a rather broad but not so deep knowledge of several academic subjects or whether it is better to be an expert in one specific subject .

Honestly speaking , I do not think there can be a general question to this answer .
I believe it depends on the aims and professional goals a person has in life .
For some people it might be better to focus on one thing and become really good at it and for others it might actually be smarter to become familiar with a variety of different subjects .

Speaking for myself , I think dealing with a broad range of academic topics is the better choice .
This is due to the fact that I still do not know what job I will work in later .
I do not feel ready to already specialize in one specific subject .
What if I am making the wrong choice ?

Another reason for me to prefer a broad knowledge of academic subjects is that people who know about a variety of things appear more educated to me .
Whatever question one might have , they always feel ready to answer -- at least most of the times .
Now imagine you are spending time with a person that is specialized in one specific field but does not know anything else .
If you do not happen to be specialized in the same area as he or she is , what are you going to talk about ?
It could become quite a boring as well as frustrating experience .

Furthermore , I am of the opinion that people who have broad knowledge in a variety of subjects are more likely to have a very successful career .
We just have to look at high executives in the business world .
Many of them did not specialize in business in university but they studied a variety of topics including `` art history '' or other subjects which do not necessarily have to do with the job they are doing now .
What companies want today is people who know about many different things .

As I said in the beginning this might not be the correct way for everybody , but with my personal goals it certainly is for me .
