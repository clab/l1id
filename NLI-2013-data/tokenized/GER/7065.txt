I will be honest , I never thought about such a topic if there will be fewer cars in use in some years .
I cannot totally agree with this statement because therefore the other possibilities are too bad that so many people will not use their car anymore .
More or less , the only thing here in Germany is the `` Deutsche Bahn '' and a lot of people are not so happy with this company because you never can be sure if your train arrives or not .
In comparison to this , there are a few companies where you can come to work when you like to come and not everyone is able to change the house for the job .

As well , i cannot totally disagree with this statement because there are steps which will offer you better possibilities to get from point A to point B but this have to be cheap In addition , the new trend from people is to live for the nature and future .
Furthermore , it stops the pollution if there are less cars in use and you do not have to spent so much money in oil , gas and security .
Not everybody will be able to pay for a car in a few years .

Because of never thinking about this topic , I was a little bit confused but I think there will be less cars in a few years .
If f.i. the Deutsche Bahn get it und will be more punctual and have special offers that means that it is cheaper than having a car , then it is possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
In Germany there are more and more offers to get to another place f.i. there is a page in the internet where you put in the date , time and place when you want to go anywhere and there are people who catch you and take you with them to your place for not paying a lot of money .
