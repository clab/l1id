Before giving a straight answer to this question , I need to state that it depends on what the specific person intends to use his academic education for .

In my opinion a solid basic knowledge of a variety of subjects should be obligatory to everyone , who seeks an academic degree .
But as this should be content of the school education and somehow a foundation for the decision , which subject is choosen at university , the goal to be perfect in everything is not a useful and not a realistic one .
To understand the last aspect , one should regard that the knowledge in the world is doubling every four years and speed of this process is even increasing .
An all-around genious , like da Vinci or other great characters in the Renaissance , do n't fit in our time .
This means not that I do n't see the importance to link knowledge or to have a broader horizon to deal with academic problems .

Nevertheless I prefer to get an education that gives me the chance to specialize in my field of studies and go as deep into the topic as possible .
The main reason for this position is the fact that most of the students , including me , will once enter the market for well educated and highly motivated working force .
To get an advantage in this competition is essential .
And it wo n't make me special and important for a potential employer that I know a bit about biology and art-history working as an accountant in car industry .
To have a realistic or even good chance in this field of industry I 'd rather rely on my abilities in business administration and knowledge about this kind of industry .
Therefore it is , in my eyes , important to make an early and specific decision , what you want to achieve in your academic studies and - if possible - where you want to work in the future .

The same is relevant for students , who are occupied with for example law .
Most of the students I know , who made a degree in law , needed to focus on one specific sector of this field of studies .
Otherwise they would have had serious problem to get an appropriate job .
Because , the rest of the students with no vision end as taxi
