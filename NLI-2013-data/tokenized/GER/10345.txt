This statement does not offer a definition of `` successful '' - unless success consists solely of doing new things and taking risks regardless of wether or not one succeeds in these new things and risks .
This is to be doubted .
Trying to find out if I can fly makes me daring , and probably a hopital inmate at the least , but not successful .
Therefore , I would have to disgree on a formal level .

More importantly though , I would like to challenge this statement in regard to its meaning as well .
By not offering a definition of what `` success '' means , the sentence is not only malformed , but furthermore appeals to a kind of common sense universality .
Immanual Kant proved that the only maxims that may be universal imperatives or truths must be rationally applicable to any thinking being .
If we now try to formulate this statement as a maxim - that is : If you want to be successful , you have to try new things and take risks - and see if it holds true for any given rational being - let us say Immanual Kant - we find that it is false : Immanual Kant lived in the same city his whole life , never changing any of his habits ; he positively did not take any risks regarding his work either : He worked an entire decade on his major book before publishing it , just to be on the safe side .
But Immanual Kant is undoubtedly one , if not the most successful philosopher in history .

His speculation on maxims can help us further along in solving the question of success : If a maxim cannot be proved universal , its scope needs to be smaller .
Thus , if we enhance the statement by saying that people who try new things are successful if trying new things is important to them , we end up with an applicable maxim .

As a conclusion , I would like to suggest that a more appropriate statement on successful people would be the following :
Successful people do what is important to them , rather than doing what they think they are supposed to do .
