I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

I am sure that the only way to learn is to try new things .
People have to learn their whole life to be successful .
We start learning on the day that we are born and after university this process should not stop .
In the modern business world there are always many competitors who want to have the same position .
So you have to have some skills which make you special and these skills you can not get if you are afraid of new things .
If people want to be successful they need to be brave and take responsibility for their actions .
In addition , they need to have the power and strenght to fail and stand up again .

In my opinion , the reason why so many people do not want to change a situation or to try something new lies in their mentality .
I think that many people are afraid of trying new things because they do not want to fail .
They think that it is easier , more comfortable and better for their image to stay in one job position than to try something they are not an expert in .
I think that people sometimes are rather lazy and do not see a reason in changing a comfortable situation .
In my opinion , the only way to reach higher positions and success is to leave this comfort behind for a certain period of time and to be brave enough to accept the possibility of failure .
Otherwise you always stay in the same position .

Nevertheless , there are more aspects of success .
I think that luck , networking , social skills , the ability to work in teams and continuity are extremely neccessary factors for success .
