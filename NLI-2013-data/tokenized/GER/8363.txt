For the most students it is most important to understand concepts and ideas .
To learn facts is not so important for them .
I think if they understand what the concepts and ideas are about it can be more useful for them .
Because if they understand the main idea of something they can also use it on other topics .

For example if they understand how the human mechanism works they maybe also compare this with animals mechanism which are in some kind like the humans .
So if they only learn facts about the human mechanism they can not compare it with other mechanism .
And if students only learn the facts they may not understand them .
This is a disadvantage if they for example need to compare the fact with another situation .
so something like this would be more easily if the person really understand the topic .
Therefor I can understand the students who say that it is more important to understand the concept than learn facts .

Another point is that the students need not learn so much if they understand the main idea of something and maybe have learnt to compare this with other themes or situations .

But it is also important to know different facts about the concepts and not only understand their meaning .
Because the more facts someone knows the more can this person explain the idea and the more easily he can compare it with other things .

So I agree with the students but alsoI think it is very complicated to say what is more important maybe it is the solution of any single person .
The ones are better in learning facts because they find it very diffecult to understand an idea without the whole facts about it .
The other person for example can understand every concept without problems .
The third person may not understand the idea at first but thinks understandig it is more important than knowing everything about it .
