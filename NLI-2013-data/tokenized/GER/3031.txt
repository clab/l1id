That young people enjoy life more than older people is certainly a highly unqualified statement .
One can almost never make such broad and sweeping generalizations .
Having said that , however , I do believe that younger people on average tend to have an easier time enjoying life than older people do .

I epmhasize the words `` on average '' , since there clearly are examples of vivacious , joyful elders that are much happier than glum , dejected teenagers .
Therefore , being old does not necessarily mean being incapable of enjoying life , whereas being young does not guarantee happiness .

However , I have reasons to believe that being young makes it easier to enjoy life .
The first and most obvious explanation for this is health .
Younger people are bound to be healthier than older ones : their immune systems tend to be stronger , the time that it takes for younger people to recover from wounds and diseases is shorter and their motoric abilities are stronger .
Young people can therefore engage in a variety of activities that they characterize as fun , whereas the elderly are prevented by their aformentioned disadvantes from doing so .

Take my grandmother ; she used to be an active hiker .
She would stop at nothing , and even conquered one of the highest mountains in Europe , the mont blanc .
However , with increasing age ( she is 76 now ) her bones and joints would no longer support any such activities : she decided , therefore , to abandon hiking .
Of course , this did not plunge her into a depression ; nonetheless , it represented a sacrifice and deprived her of one source of pleasure .

I cannot overemphasize , however , the risk of jumping to conclusions based on this example ; the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' still remains unqualified .
To come back to my grandmother : with her resourcefulness , she managed to find sources other than hiking that give her enourmous pleasure .
She found out , for instance , that she loved playing backgammon and even joined a club .
She rediscovered her love of reading , an activity that she has n't pursued intensively due to her many distractions .
One could say that she as just as happy now , at age 76 , as she was when she was still young .

It is clear from these examples that ones happiness ultimatley depends oneself , rather than on one 's age .
Nonetheless , old age does impose restrictions that require one to be resourceful and vivacious if one seeks to retain happiness .
Not everyone can muster these things .
My conclusion is , therefore , that young age does make it easier to enjoy one 's life even though one 's individual character is the ultimate factor .
