To answer the question if there will be fewer cars in twenty years is not very simple .
There are various factors which might or will play a role in this development .
In the following I will try to explain my point of view on this topic .

If the useage of natural resources and especially oil will continue in the next two decades there might be a lack of petrol quite soon .
But using up so much oil would also mean to continue wasting our environment tremendously .

A lack of oil would probably cause an increase of the fuel prizes up to the point where only very few people are able to even afford it .
This development might lead to a thinking away from the philosophy that every household needs at least one car to a more money-saving one of using public transportation systems instead .
In this case the number of cars would of course decrease .
But I think it is more likely that other resources will be used to provide energy to run a car ( for example gas or electricity from renewable resources ) .
This would mean that there will be no considerable change in the number of used cars .

Another posibility is that due to the polution of our indespensable air the people 's awereness of their environment will increase .
This could possibly have the effet to make people think more sustainable about the question whether they need a car or not .
If people are aware of the causes polution has on our atmosphere they might be willed to find different - maybe more uncomfortable - ways of transportation .
But in my opinion I do not think that this mental change will take place - at least not in the next twenty year .

To sum it up , I think that the number of cars used is hardly going to change unless it gets either unaffordable for most people - so they are forced to use public transportations - or an awerness of our nature arouses in the peoples mind which makes them willed to benfit their environment not regarding their lose of comfort .
