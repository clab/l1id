In my opinion , history shows that people that take risks and try new things are more successful that those that prefer to rely on their existing knowledge .
There are several reasons and examples that support my point of view .

First , in our globalized world , knowledge and technological innovations are rapidly increasing .
Ten years ago , nobody used the internet .
Today it is almost impossible to be successful without knowing how to write an email and how to surf in the internet .
Therefore , it is necessary to be open to new inventions and changes in societies in order to make progress .

Moreover , inventions have normally been made because people started to try new things and to take risks .
A musician that only plays the songs he already manages quite well is n't very likely to invent a new song or to improve his interpretation .
Only by trying out alternative interpretations , even though it may sound odd in the first place , new ideas may come to the musician 's mind .
Consequently , his interpretation of the song can be improved .
Therefore , by taking the risk of leaving behind old patterns of thinking , previously unknown concepts can be found out .

In addition , people that take the risk of starting a business with a new concept may have more success than those that sell established products .
Although franchising , for example , gives the shopowner more security , the possibilty of making huge surpluses is lower .
Enterly new and creative concepts , however , can help you to become really successful .

In conclusion , taking risks and trying new things contributes to make people successful .
Due to globalization , society changes rapidly , so that you are required to broaden your horizon in order to succeed .
Furthermore , the possibilities of making a new discory and to run a successful business are higher .
Thus , I prefer to do new things and to take risks .
