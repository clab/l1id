In my opinion , the given statement is right on the one hand , but it is not able to be used to every specific subject on the other .

Classes of different subjects have always been different and will always require different strategies to handle the material which is taught in them .
For those subjects who tend to be in the technical and scientific area , understanding the main way of working is far more important than any detail .

In general , understanding the facts of how something , e.g. a motor of an entire power plant works is more important than learning and knowing any single detail without really knowing what purpose they are for .

In my opinion , especially scientific subjects like chemistry or biology and technical subjects like engineering will get along wonderfully with that statement .
For those kinds of students , it has to be important to understand the function of techniques they are confronted with while attending their classes , omitting minor details ( which are often omitted by professors and teacher themselves ) .

After university , being confronted with your job , there is no use for those who learned by heart any single detail of a machine they are confronted with now , but not knowing the way this particular machine works in general .
In addition to that , minor details are also often described right on the machine , but their general way of working is not and should have been understood earlier .

Moreover , I think ideas and concepts are were and still are the basement for development and research .
With monotonously learning and repeating facts , it is far more difficult to understand and without knowing about the core concept , there is no possibility for progress and new development , e.g. in the medicine and biochemistry .

But nevertheless , understanding the concepts is not always the one way to success .
Being very helpful in technical subjects , I still think that you should not use this method in subjects like History .
In these specific classes , detailed facts of our past are equal in importance as understanding the concept , e.g. the concept of communism invented by Lenin .

To put it in a nutshell , I am convinced that the given statement , which is to concentrate on an idea than to the facts , can be very useful for everything concerning development and technique , but it should not be used to those classes that deal with the past .
In these particular subjects , you should spend half the time for the ideas and the other half for the facts .
