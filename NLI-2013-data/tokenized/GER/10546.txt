I agree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . ''

Successful people like for example singers or actors always have to try new things and take risks - in other words reinvent themselves - in order to become better and stay competitive .
Let us take Madonna as an example .
When she started her career she looked very different from what she looks now and the kind of music she produced was also a different one compared to her songs now .
This example indicates that you have to adapt to the time in order to stay successful or to become even more successful .
You have to take risks to stay competitive .

In this example Madonna has to take the risk that her fans do not like her new look or her new songs as much as the old ones .
But she has to try it and produce new songs in a different way otherwise she would be out of fashion .
Because of her permanent reinvention she is still today after being many years in the show business a superstar .

One the other hand , one could also say that doing things in which you are already good will improve your performance .
But I think that you reach a point where you cannot become better without trying new things which means reinvention .

In conclusion , my point of view is that one can only become successful by reinventing oneself and taking risks .
