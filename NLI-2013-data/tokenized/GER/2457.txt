Enjoy life while you are still young - this is the programmatic statement of youth culture .
It builds on the general believe that young people enjoy life more than seniors .
But I do not think that younger people enjoy life more than older people .
Examining the question along three dimensions of joy - social interaction or friendship , physical condition or health and a person 's own perception or his or her mental attitude towards joy - will show that both , younger and older people do enjoy life .

A first important dimension on which a person 's enjoyment of life could me measured is the degree of his or her social interaction .
As homan beings are ` social animals ' , satisfying social interaction is vital to them .
This is why circle of friends and relatives as well as satisfying interaction is necessary for a person to enjoy life .
Young people certainly spend a lot time with their friends or partner .
Enrolled in university or work they have a lot of possibilities to meet new people and to communicate to a large number of different individuals .
Older people on the other hand often have more limited social interactions .
Their ciricle of friends and relatives might have reduced over time , the do not have the opportunity to meet people at work and partners often have already passed away .
Yet , older people often have deeper , more valuable relationships with their social circle : friendships that have been shape over a long time replace in quality the larger social network younger people have , as there social networks are often of less quality .

A second important aspect for an individual 's joy in life is his or her physical condition and the ability to be versatile and take part in acitivities resulting from it .
Surely young people have by far a health advantage over older people .
And they are not only fit and healthy but normally also in good condition that allows them to do `` fun activities '' like snowboarding or surfing .
But on the other hand , seniors are not completely banned from satisfying physical activities by their somewhat worse physical condition .
Many older people nowdays enjoy a great varity of senior sports that actually provide lots of joy and happiness to them .

Last but perhabs even most important for a persons happiness and joy in life is the persons mental status and attitude against joy .
It 's the simple question if a person FEELs happy and takes time to enjoy life .
While youngs people are often stressed and too much in a hurry to actually enjoy what they are doing , older people take their time to enjoy what they have lived and still can live in life .
This is why = even though seniors might be limited in their sources of joy - they are often even happier than young people .

To summarize , I think that both young and old people can enjoy life by the same degree .
It is more in the way that these two groups injoy life =
