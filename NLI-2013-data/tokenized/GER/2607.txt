Enjoying your life is very crucial because you only have one opertunity .
Some say that they enjoyed life more when they were young and did not have any worries .
Others say that only in age could they realize what they really wanted and could enjoy their life to a full extent .
I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older ones .
To explain my view I will give an exaple of an unhappy young person , who was not able to enjoy her life and then I will give an example of an older one who did .

A friend of mine who finished school together with me was just as clueless as I was when deciding about what we wanted to study .
We both decided to take a year off .
This year was supposed to give us the oppertunity to discover more about ourselves and realize what we wanted to do .
I took this seriously and pushed myself to make a lot of new experiences , which have now helped me to decide about my future .
She wanted to enjoy her life .
She partied and drank as much as she could because she thought that this would be the right way of satisfing herself .
However , she was wrong .
She now realized that that was not what she needed .
She had not been mature enough to see what she really required to make her happy and to enjoy herself .
In this case more maturity would have been of great benefit .
One the contrary to this in the last couple of weeks I had gotten to know many old people who did know how to enjoy themselves .

I started to work in a nursing home for older people .
There more than anywhere else I have aquainted people who are in really bad situations but still know through their lifelong experiences how they can enjoy themselves .
One specific example would be a 87 year pld woman who had a stroke and consequently had to lie in bed the whole time .
Most young people in this situation would be terribly unhappy .
She lives with her fate and any time you enter her room she smiles at you .
It is easy to watch how small things can make her enjoy herself imensly .

The two example that I have made show that enjoying yourself has nothing to do with being younger .
I do admit that not all old be know how to still enjoy their life .
However , they are ofthen in a far worse situation than any young person is .
In general I think that the more experiences you make the more you learn about yourself .
This brings on a process of maturing , which shows you what is important to you and how you can enjoy yourself .
