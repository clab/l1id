It is often said that young people would not spend enough time to helping and supporting their communities in our society .
I disagree with that opinion .
At first , I do not think that interest in policy has decreased over the years .
The most important reason for that is that our system is democratic which means that people have the ability to vote and can influence policy which is not possible in a dictatorship , for example .
Another important factor is that every citizen has this right from a certain age on .
In the past , that often depended on the income and women did not have suffrage at all .

Today , nearly every political party has a youth organization , as well .
That would not be neccessary , if young people were not interested in policy .
Furthermore there are a lot of poltical independent organizations which concern about the interests of the communities .
In the past there were neither political youth organizations , nor independent poltical youth organzitaions In spite of the decreasing number of people to vote , I think it would be exaggerated to say that young people do not put enough effort or time in helping their communities .
