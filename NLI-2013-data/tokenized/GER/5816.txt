I do not aggree with this statement .
There several reasons explained in the analysis below which will indicate the opposite .

First of all , the historic development of the automotive industry has to be taken into account .
In the last 30 years the number of cars sold worldwide increased year after year .
In Western Europe an the United Staates the number of sold cars might not have increased at the same speed it did in the 1980s or 1990 , but it still has been growing .

Furthermore , the statement claims that the total number , not the number of sold cars , will be reduced .
That means that people whose cars are demaged will not buy new cars , which certainly is unrealistic .

Emerging countries like China and India and also countries in Eastern Europe seem to develop the same way countries in Western Europe and the U.S. have a few years ago .
Therefore , the demand for cars in those countries will rise year after year .

When anayzing the location of production sites of the automotive industrie it is obvious that they currently focus on these countries .
This shows that they expect to sell huge a amount of cars in those areas .

Other countries in Africa have not even started to develop to an industrial country .
In 20 years those countries will properbly have began their development and consequently their need for cars will have increased .
The growing population in the develloping countries and in the whole world will go hand in hand with the growing number of cars .

At the moment the importance of the environment becomes obvious to people in developed countries like Germany .
This might make people think that the number of cars will be reduced .
But , the conclusion that the will stop buying cars is wrong .
It is possible to invent environmental friendly cars which only need a little amount of gas .
At the same time the first prototypes of cars using differnent materials than gas have been develloped .
This gives people the opportunity to drive a car and to protect the environment .

The argumentation above shows that it is very unlikely that the number of cars will decrease in the next twenty years .
