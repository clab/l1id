I do not agree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

It is getting more and more affordable , even for younger people who have just gotten their driver 's licence , to own a car .
So there are much more , rather young people driving than in the past and I do not think that this will change .
So this is a constant in my considerations .

Not only that more young people possess cars , also people that are older will still be driving when they are at the age of 75 or 80 , because people become older but will stay mentally and psychologically fit even in higher ages and will not give up on driving since it will - in twenty years like nowadays - be important for humans to be flexible and be able to move wherever and whenever you want to .

Regardless of high car-densities that can already been found today , people will not give up on their cars because they have gotten used to the convenience of driving .
Some sort of exploring-mentality will force human beings to even drive further than today .
With new car technology that will probably been found in twenty years that should not be a problem .

Another important fact in this consideration is the role of countries like China and India .
They are about to step up as progressive states in which industrialization takes place .
Of course there will be high demands of cars in the upcoming years .
With its billions of people these two countries will have a tremendous impact on the usage of cars in the future .
More and more people there will be able to finance a car and - with the course of industrialization - will buy one .

Under these circumstances it will be important to find new solutions for avoiding high-traffic in urban areas and pollution of the environment .
