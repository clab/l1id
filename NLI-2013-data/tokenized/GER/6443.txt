In the past , the cars had developed from a luxury skill to a usual material .
Now , there are a lot of cars getting more modern .
Also , there are many car companys and factories which build more cars .

Now , there is a statement claiming that in twenty years there will be a fewer cars in use than there are today .
But I disagree with that .
The car developed in more than a hundred years to an usual thing , from 1886 to now .
And it 's still developing in this time !
Many factories build more cars to get more money , because everyone has a cars or more than one .
For some people cars are like friends and they them need them for a show-off .
When people want to go to another place , they use their comfortable car to get there .
So , the factories cannot stop building more cars in the next twenty years , because they want more money .

Because of the polluted enviroment more modern cars are build which need liquid gas what does n't pollute the air .
So , this is another reason for the factories who cannot stop building new cars , because they have to design new ones , too .

I think , to have fewer cars in use on the streets we need more than twenty years , because in this time people still need their cars either for a show-off or for comfortable moving .
Also , it took more than a hundred years to develope and when it will go back , it cannot go faster , in my opinion .

If the statement claims that in sixty or seventy years fewer cars will be in use than today , not in twenty years , then I would agree to it .
