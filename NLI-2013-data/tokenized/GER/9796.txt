Success is a word that brings the glance in people 's eyes .
I might say that alomost every person in our system tries to get successful .
In the end success shows the ability to stand up for something or against something and earn the `` applause '' , what mostly appears in money .

One one hand there are people who understand the word `` success '' in a collective luck .
Many of these people help other people to get to know the word success .
Imagine a kid in today 's Africa .
Probaly he just tries to survive the night .
And in this point people see their on sucess , in helping others to live on and get to know what success could mean .
No doubt , it is one of our major problem we have to solve .
We must help the people in Africa to show them there is an other life than starvation .

On the other hand we have people that understand success only for their own benefit .
They do things , taking risk just to have their own soul in a good mood .
And no matter what , they going to try as hard as they can to achive their goals even if they take other peoples chances and luck .
Let 's say , that today 's `` bad guy '' are these guys .

Personally , I think , someone who wants to be successful must have a little bit of both sides .
I just can relate from myself .
As a former Tennis Professional I was - and maybe still am - an egoist .
Starting with tennis I had no choice but to focus on myself and win against my oponent .
There is no help from a team mate or a coach during the matches , it is only you .
This fact made me somehow an egoist .
But it does not mean that I have not learn to think about the others around me .
I trz hard to do both ways .

However , I had to take risk to achive my goals even if everybody around was laughing at me .
On that way , I fully agree with the statement .
Because floating with the mass is not a way to achieve something .
Fighting against the mass is the way to become successful .
Most people are successful if they to something special , somthing noone has done before .
If everybody does the same it is hard to outreach the mass , because so many are doing exact the same thing .

So , the only way to be successful is , to take risk .
