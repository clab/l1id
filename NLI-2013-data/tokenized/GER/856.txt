I absolutelly disagree with this statement , because you can turn it around and this will change the meaning of this statement : You know a bit of everything but you ca n't do anything really good .

Of course if you are not specialized , you can talk with everyone about everything but when a couple of specialist have a conversation , you come to a point where you do n't understand a word anylonger .
You never will understand the really important facts about a subject , that 's why you are hard-speaking not really usefull .
I have a medical disease , for example , then I will ask a doctor and not someone who knows a bit about the human body .

It also comes to my mind that it is a difficult situation at the university .
For example you have to write an essay then it 'll be pretty hard to make high-qualified researches , because you do n't understand the important and complicated things .
That 's why your grades will properly be worse than the ones of a specialist .

Further I have to think about the job market , e. g. the one of germany .
We have many people who are unemployed and search for a work .
If a company needs a thatcher , than they do n't need someone who can work a little bit with wood , who knows a little bit about the law and last but not least has already made the roof a house .
They need just a specialiced thatcher .
That means if you are not specialized you are n't often interessting for companys , and it 'll be hard to find a job .
Of course there are exceptions , but to speak in general it 's just harder to achieve the goals in your life .

All in all I really would recommend anyone to specialize on something , because then you are able to put all your effort in this subject , it 'll be easier to earn earn good grades and last but not least to find a job , that fits to your interests .
