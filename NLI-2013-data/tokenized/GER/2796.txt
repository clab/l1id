I do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

There are some reasons that might suggest this as for example that younger people are normally more healthy then older people .
Of course if an old person has to use a wheelchair he is going to enjoy his life less than a younger one without wheelchair .
Also younger people might have less obligations and responibilities than older people .
Studying is assumed to be mainly fun .

But this seems to be a popular illusion .
Today , through the advance of medicine , older people are healthier than ever before .
Also , today students are aware of the fact that their future depends on their success in studies .
This means that they have a lot of obligations and responsibilities too .

And old people can also choose a life with only minor obligations and responsibilities .
Actually they can live like young people .
Older people have made their experiences .
According to their experiences they have chosen how to live .
They have all opportunities like young people plus experience .
Young people have to spend their time to their education .
They ca n't build a family for example .
For most people having a family is still the most satisfying experience .
Also they depend during their studies on the money of their parents .
Older people however earn their own money .
They have more money to spend and they can decide what to do with their money .

Another point is that enjoyment of life does not depend on age .
The differences mentioned above are mainly dependant on the person .
You can enjoy yeour life when you are young and you can enjoy zour life when you are old .
Most things you can do in both stages , like meeting friends , visiting concerts and so on .
The important thing is how you take life .
You are always going to face problems whether you are young or old .
The decisive things is how you cope with the problems .
