Cars are freedom and independence !
That 's what many people think about cars offering them the opportunity to travel individually everytime and to whereever they want .
I think that therefore in twenty years there will be at least as many cars used in the world as there are nowadays , and I 'll try to show some more reasons for that in this essay .

First of all , people are very slow in changing their habits , so even a new technology would not suddenly stop them all driving cars .
And there is no technology to expect in the next few years that could challenge with that flexibility of a cabin that can be freely driven by one person , in other words it seems that there will be no alternative to cars for years .

If you think about cars in the future you should definetly take a closer look at Asia .
China and India develop quickly and will soon use a lot of cars , and remember that we are talking about nearly one third of the world 's population !
Noone could stop them from using that easy and quick transportation technology , so they will be happy to start using it like the western world was in the middle of the last century .

Some people say that there would not be enough oil for future use of cars .
But experts predicts that the oil would last for at least another 50 years and in addition every year more fields are discovered .

To come back to the first and most important point , the flexibility of cars offering independence to their drivers , it has to be asked if you would be giving up that opportunity just for saving the environment or stop the traffic and noise on the streets .
While everyone knows that cars seriously pollute the air noone would stop using them for that reason , because they are not able to see the consequences of that pollution directly or do not recognize them .

All at all , there wo n't be fewer cars in the future and in twenty years we have to expect an even bigger number than today .
