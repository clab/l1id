From my point of view it is right , that people nowadays do not give enoguth time to helping their communites .

I have the impression that the world we live in is a world of individuals .
Everyone just seems to live next to each other but not actually together .
In the past people , were forced to do certain things together and help each other .
Nowadays the technolocial change has made many thing easier and less harder .
Thus we have become lazier and concerning many things we do not have to rely on each other any more .
That 's the reason why we became more selfish and lazy .
Many people choose to spend their time in front of the TV instead of helping their communities .

As an example the amount of young men who do civil service decreased over all .
Most men neither go to the army , no do civil service : they just do not do anything .
But without civil service our whole social system would not function any more .
It is extremly important , that the young people take care of the old people and help them with their basic needs .

In the end it comes down to a discussion of values .
I am convinced , that there has been a moral change .
Nowadays for many people it seems to be most important to look after their owns , to focus on their live , sucess and wealth .
Regarding this helping others in the community does not seem to be relevant any more .
Everyone is responsible for his own life and luck .

Moreover it might be a problem that people do not indentify and related enoguth with their community any more .
This lack of identification hampers them to play an active role in the community .

Due to immigration people with different cultural roods and with different kinds of religion live together in one community but do not feel connected to each other .

In addition the problemes we have to face as a community todaz have become more complex in the process of globalisation .
They are no longer as limited as the might have been in previous days .

But especially regarding this , I come to the conclusion that even more help in the community is need
