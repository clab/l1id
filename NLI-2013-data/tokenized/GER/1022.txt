You can not know everything , that is a fact .
But should we try to get a widely spread knowledge of many different topics rather than be a specialist in only one certain subject .
In the end it depends on which solution is the best match with your personality .

I am a medical student and I spend really a lot of time studiing but there are so much things to know about medicine that I can only learn a small part with my limited brain capacities .
Hence , I try to be at least a specialist in a certain area with determined outlines because a doktor who knews a little bit of evertything but nothing exactly is absolutely redundant .
So in order to get a job I am inevitably forced to concentrate on a few certain topics .

By contrast , I think that beyond the job , it is very important to have a widely spread knowledge of lots of different things .
An urbane person should know many different things about other cultures , histories and literature , because in that time we are living in so much information and knowledge is offered to everyone .
Specializing would be insular in my opinion .
As far as the knowledge beyond the job is concerned it does not make sense to try to know everything about one topic , because if you have a broad knowledge you have many topics to talk about with other people .
For instance , I will try to teach my children things about world history as well as different languages so that they know a little bit of everything and can deepen their knowledge of these subjects they are most interested in single handed .

In conclusion , I propose to specialize whenever it is neccessary , for the job for example as I already mentioned .
Beyond the job I prefer a broad knowledge of many different things , but that is a matter of personality ...
