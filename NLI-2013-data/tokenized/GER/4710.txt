I agree with the statement .
In my opinion it is common knowledge that advertisements make products seem better than they really are .
For verifying the statement you just have to think about what advertising is for .
What is the sense in advertisement ?
This can be answered quite clearly : Companies use advertising to sell more of their products .
Consulting a psychologist or taking surveys is quite common nowadays for understanding what the costumer wants or expects from a product .
Companies try to fullfill these expectations or at least pretend to do so .
They know what the costumer wants to see or have and they are more than willing to give it to him .

So , actually , advertising is mostly about illusions and psychological tricks .
The colours , the music , the script of a TV spot ...
everything was set up before .
Even the colour or the shape of the product itself .
Advertisements are often so exaggerated , that it really becomes hard to believe , e.g. whine stains on a white carpet which dissapear within 10 seconds .
These are high standards being raised !

One might say that it 's the quality of a product that counts , but how often do costumers actually buy a product , because they had seen it earlier on TV or in the newspaper and `` just want to try it '' ?
I guess it happened to everybody at least once or twice .
Some were dissapointed with the result , when the product is not at all as it was announcend in the media .
No matter if it 's the quality of clothes , the taste of some new ice cream or the sound of a new CD .
Often , the product ca n't reach the standards raised in the media .

Of course , if you want people to buy your product on a regular basis you have to add some quality .
It justifies the higher price and can convince the costumer of your product .

But , nevertheless , it is extremely important for people to make themselves clear that advertisements do n't show reality , but are trying to persuade them to buy a certain product .
