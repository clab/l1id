It is a fact that cars are parts of our daily lives .
And you cannot deny that we do need them , but if we will look in the furture ; are there going to be more or less cars used by human beings in twenty years ?
I would say that there wo n't be many cars left on streets worldwide , for the following reasons .

Firstly , technic and its experts constantly develope new technologies .
Who knows which transport possibilities are there going to be in twenty years ?
Nobody of the nineteenth century had ever dared thinking that humans are going to fly or even fly to the moon in the twentieth century .
May be all people are not driving anymore in the future , but they are flying with little u-boats ?

Secondly , as our environment is nearly totally damaged due to pollution and cars , I do hope that people will recognise how important our environment is , and will forget about using cars .
Without any doubt it is the car industry which is mostly responsible for the damage made on earth .
If people do n't stop polluting our environment , there wo n't be an earth left where we can life .

And thirdly , cars are expensive .
They are even so expensive that people can hardly afford them .
And the cars industry is definetly not making cars to be good for the environment , but to make profit .
And this situation is not about to change in the future .

On the other hand , we need our cars .
Without having a car your daily life will turn into chaos .
We are completly depending on them if we want to go shopping , go to work or even if we want to go on holidays .

The argument of people being lazy does support the idea of cars being part of human lives , even stronger .
Nobody really wants to walk , if there is a change of driving to a place .

Finally , a car is simply a symbol of wealth .
Most people do own two or three expensive cars just to show that they , in contrast to others , can afford having expensive cars .

As a conclusion , I am convinced that cars are helpful and will always be helpful in the future .
But what consequences might there be if we do not reduce the use of them ?
