`` Young people nowadays '' , this is a dangerous expression to start a thesis .
It carries a negative tone , a musty `` In my days people knew how to behave ... '' flavour , older than ancient Greece .
It is hard not to disagree with anything starting that way .

Refering to the statement as such , one has to differenciate .
There are a lot of young people engaged in activities dentrimental to society .
This certainly should change .
And there is never enough time spent in helping the community , most social organisation are working at the very limits of their resources and barely scratching the surface of the problems they try to remedy .
But that is true for all age groups .
Furthermore social engagement is not considered very `` cool '' by most young people .
But there are notable exeptions and a lot of sport groups , boy scouts or Christian ( or any other religion ) youth organisations wo n't work without the time and efforts devoted by teenagers and people in their early twenties .
So I think the main problem is to recruit more people into social engagement , regardless of their age .
Society has to change it 's attitude towards helping the community to achieve this , not just the young generations .

Therefore I do not agree with the statement as stated above .
