The mentioned statement discusses the number of cars in the future and thus , it needs to be critically considered .
When the production of cars started they were only luxury things for people that were able to spend a lot of money .
But after a couple of time scientists developed cars that were available for everyone .
From there on the industry for cars was growing and growing .

Today cars have material and immaterial values for human beings .
Some people only need the car to be flexible and they love it for its comfortness .
Other people love the cars for their special surface etc .
Cars are determining human beings in so many ways that no one could imagine to live without them .
But cars have also negative effects , especially on the environment .
Because of the air pollution the governments want the people to reduce the car use .
Some cities have an alarming air pollution caused by the cars .
Thus , in the future a restriction should help to decrease the pollution .
But would this cause a reduction of the cars in use ?
In some ways this will be practicable because some cities do not allow its citizens to drive within the city .
This surely reduces the cars in use .

But not only environemental reasons can cause a reduction of the cars in use .
Especially the booming development of airplanes and fast traines decreases the use of cars .
Today people are able to get cheap flights which bring them faster to another point in the world than a car would .
Airplanes and fast traines offer the customer to travel a long distance in a short time and furthermore , in a comfort and cheap way .
As oil prices are contantly rising a normal human being has great costs to travel by car .
Thus , airplanes and trains are accomodate alternatives to cars .

Concerning the mentioned arguments I can support the statement .
In my opinion there will be fewer cars in use due to the alternative mediums - airplanes and traines .
But this will not cause a reduction of cars , but only a reduction of the use of the cars .
