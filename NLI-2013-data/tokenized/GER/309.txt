It is widely believed that successfull people try new things and take risks instead of concentrating on something they already know very well .

On the one hand people who want to be successful should rely on their skills they already have .
It is very important to take an advantage of the qualities a person already has , so that this person is sure to do the right things , which means that the person is self-confident .

But on the other hand a rigid behavior could influence the work in a negative way .
For example it is very important for managers who run their own business to stay flexible so that they can react to every change of the customers choice .
The customers choice could change every day , so the manager has to adapt his procuts in order be successfull .
Otherwise he will not sell enough products .

A good example could be advertising .
You must have new ideas to impress the people seeing yor advertisement in order to push their attention to your product .
Sometimes it is also essential to take any risk in order to improve your business , because it could be a chance to multiply your success .
Of course such decisions are very difficult and you have to think about them very carefully .

All in all I think that it is a big advantage if a person has enough courage to take risks or to try something new because in most cases it is worth it .
In spite of short-term negative impacts it is important to be innovative in order to be a successfull person .

Rigid behaviour causes disadvantages in nearly every part of life .
In my opinion it might be helpfull to stick to the well-practised skills a person has , but everyone can improve these skills and learn new thinks in order to achieve his aims .

That is why I think that this statement is right .
