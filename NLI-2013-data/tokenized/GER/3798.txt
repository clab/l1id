I disagree with this statement .
This statement is n't true for all young people .
In my church community there are many young people beside me who enjoy helping .
I have been being a scout leader for four years .
I give my free time to care for children , to think about games which I can play with them and to help them if there is any problem .
I dont get any money for this , I do this because I like it and have fun almost always .
Of course there are situations where I am nerved and tired of entertaining children , but all bad emotions vanishes if you could make these kids happy .

So it depends on the education and the surrounding of a young peolpe wether he ( or she ) is willing to help his ( or her ) community .
Not all peolpe have this social ambition that I have .
I can imagine there are people who only want e.g. to get a high paid job or to be the best in the class etc .
They want to obtain their goal without careing for other peoples .
But I think that there were always such people who dont care .

When I read this statment , I wonder what enough means .
Who determindes what or how much help is enough ?
I think there is n't a right answer .
Everyone should find out for theirselves what time to help they would like to spend .

Considering jobs which are paid there are other points .
All men who dont want to go to the army have to do social work for one year .
They have to care for disabled humans or very poor people .
My brother has to do this at the moment and he does his job at the social meeting point of the main railway station .
He tells me about the different kind of people and lives he was get to know .

I think he is doing enough for the community and his work is n't easy .
In my opinion people who have never done a piece of social work indepent from the kind of work missed some important , character-forming and great experiences .
