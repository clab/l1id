The issue at hand is whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic fields or to specialize in one subject .
This question is not easy to answer , because I am convinced that this question is not able to be answered generally .

I believe that there are several points which do not support that knowledge of many subjects is the better option and there are several ones which do .
A disadvantage of having broad knowledge is that this sometimes means , that you are less familiar with each subject .
Sometimes in working life it is really important to have a subject you are really good at and not several ones you are less good at .
If a company is searching for a new translater for English , it does not help that an applicant is also able to speak French and Italian , if the result is that the English skills are only good instead of very good .

But I am also quite sure that specializing on only one subject could be disadvantagable , because it is always important to be interested in and to have skills except your specific subject .
Some jobs require skills in many different fields .
Teachers are a good example .
For being a good English teacher it is not enough to speak English very well .
A teacher should also have knowledge about didactics , psychology and pedagogics , because he must be able to teach , to communicate and to handle students in a appropriate way .

Additionally , there are some skills , called soft skills , everbodz should have and which is more important that acedamic knowledge .
Being able to work in a team is a good example .
It does not help you to know everything about a knowledge , if you are not able to work in a project group .

In conclusion , I am quite certain that a mix of both , specializing in a subject and also having a broad knowledge is the best option .
