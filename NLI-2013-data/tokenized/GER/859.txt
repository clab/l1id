To answer this question , we must carefully look at the advantages and desadvanteges of either a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or a broad knowledge in one specific subject .

Let 's look at the major advantage of broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
If one has a broad knowledge of different academic subjects one has the power to draw connections between different academic fields which often leads to very creative solutions for complex questions .
In a world that gets more and more complex this is a very important skill .

However , broad knowledge has also a big disadvantage : It is obvious , that the knowledge of every single academic subject ca n't be very profound , because usually there is not enough time to get a broad and profound knowledge about many academic subjects .

On the other side what 's the major advantage of having a specialized knowlegde in one specific subject ?
If one has a very profound knowlegde of a specific academic subject one can concentrate fully on this subject and try to get more knowlegde about this subject .
One has the possibility to push the science on this subject forward .
One can develop new modells and solutions on this specific field .
That would not be possible , if one tried to get a broad knowledge over many academic subjects .

The most important disadvantage in specializing in one specific subject is the lack of survey .
There is a big danger that one get lost in looking for a solution , that could have been found much easier by taking a glance of other academic subjects .
One stops to look over the boundaries , which can be very helpfully - as pointed out at the beginning .

Looking at these advantages and inconvienients I am drawing the following conclusion .
Because the world is getting more and more complex it would not be intelligent to just concetrate on one of the two possibilities .
In my opinion it is absolutely necessary that in academic fields there is a good combination of people who have a broad knowledge of many academic subjetcs but also of people who specialize in one specific subject .
That is the best way to encounter the multiplen and complex questions and problems of the future .
