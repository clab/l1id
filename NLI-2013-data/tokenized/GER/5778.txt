Sadly , I do not think that in the future there will be less cars in use than nowadays .
Although , I would really appreciate that , I really doubt it , because the possibility that people all start using the train or even that our government will prohibite cars in the cities , is quite small .

Still , I think it would be a huge achievement to reduce traffic on our streets .
The horriblest thing in cities are the overcrowded streets , the noise of the traffic and the pollution cars cause .
Still , I am sure cars will not get out of favour , because people are obsessed with them .
I know several people , who buy very expensive cars , they cannot even afford to buy .
Just because it is an huge status symbol and everzone loves to brag about it .

People may argue , that oil prizes will increase so much , that the ordinary man cannot afford to keep a car , but I think that the industry already has good alternatives .
Natural oil , a gas or solar driven cars are alreadz developped and fully functioning .
But these cars are still so expensieve or weird looking that people do not want to buy them .

In conclusion , there is no reason why there should be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Furthermore , several third and second world countries ( like China and India ) are developing to industrial states and therefore , they will even need more cars .
In an utopian world there would not be any cars and all people would have access to trains , which would provide the transportation .
