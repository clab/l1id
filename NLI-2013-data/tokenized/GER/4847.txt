The business of selling products is quite hard .
The decision making process of the customer depends on the usage and the price of the product .
So you have to be the sheapest one or you have to provide an innovation .

If you are not one of these you have to find a way to be noticed by the customer .
One possibilty is to show the customer a product which differs from the real one .
The illegal tuning / upgrading of advertisements with non-real informations or visual parts could be defined as `` lying to the customer '' , but it is a possibility to increase your current selling amout .
The problem of this difference between the advertisement and the reality is , that the customer will realize these normally after the buying process .
As a result the customer will not buy any product of your company in future because the think that you are not providing the products which you offer in your advertisements .
So you are able to increase your current selling amout by `` tuning '' your advertisements , but on the long run you will decrease the selling amout of all your products ( not only the product you have communicated in the advertisement ) .

Marketing is becoming more and more important in the business of management a company .
But marketing says , that you should have a look to the customer to find their needs and to provide a product which helps the customer to solve their problem .
Marketing doesent mean , that you should sell a fridge to the north pole .
The importance of the companys brand is increasing all the time because the customer doesent have the time or the knowledge to evaluate a product .
So the customer will decide on subjective criteria if he will buy a product from company A or company B. Because of this you have to take care of your advertising decision because they will infect the future of your whole company .

Further it is illegal to tell the customer facts which are not true .
So the customer or your competitor can hire a lawyer which will be fight against you in front of a judge .
This is not really good public relations for your company .

In my opinion you should not lie to the customer because this will infect your company negative on the long run and you are not only responsible for your margin , as well for your employees .
