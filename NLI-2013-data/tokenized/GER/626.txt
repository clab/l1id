There are several advantages as well as disadvantages of whether an individual posseses a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects or merely one specific field of study .
To my mind it is necessary and helpful to gain , at least to some extent , a bit of each of this two opposing kinds of knowledge .

To conclude this would enable each type of knowledge to benefit from the other and give the individa
