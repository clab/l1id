People all over the world often discuss , wheather young peoole spend enough time helping the communities .
I think that lots of young people are concernd about community and also hlep them a lot .

First of all I think this already starts in school .
In every class the pupils elect one of them to be a speaker for the hole class .
You have also pupils doing that for the complete school .
So they learn early about being reposable for class mates and training their social skills , which is very useful for being a person who helps others and so the communities .

But I also think that you can help community if you get yourself a good education .
Because you might help better , if you have a huge knowlege in managing thinks or organisation .
So I a high education standard is a big help for comunity , if the people have better jobs they will be more likely to hlep than an unemployed person who thinks that it is the communities fault that he has no job .

Moreover ther are lots of young people envolved in different organisations .
They help in sport clubs for example , by organize trainig sessions or they help planning activities for the members like campings or visiting pools or cities .
So they help to avoid that smaller children spend to much time by their own .

Morover I think young people also help community by doing their civil work .
After finishing school the male persons will be able to do social work instead of going to the army .
So lots of jobs could not be paid to be done by professional trained employers so this people help that this work is done .
Lots of young people also participate in organisations as first aid or the free fireworks .
So they help in their free time rescueing other people , which I think is very veluable to communities .

All in all I think there are lots of young people who care about and help communitiy , but there are also some who do not care , which is often see by more people so that they think all young people are that way .
