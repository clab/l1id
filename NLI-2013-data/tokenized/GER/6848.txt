Nowadays cars a the most important medium of traveling large distances and therefore they are used often and regularly .
Nevertheless , the developement of technic could lead to fewer cars to be used in twenty years .
For that , however , political and social circumstances still would need to change .

First , due to the fact that also in future people still will need to travel , it it very important that the governments of today support other mediums of mass transportation like trains or buses .
If financially supported from the politics , traveling by bus would be cheaper than traveling by car and people might change their habits of using their cars every time they need to go somewhere .
In case a person wants to visit a friend , living in another country , and the less expensive way to go there was by train , I am conviced that he or she would buy a train ticket instead of new petrol for his or her car , That is why politicans could change the cirucumstances of transportations and therefore the number of used cars in the future .

Second , also the social circumstances concerning the attitude of people towards their cars would need to be changed .
These days a car not only represents a medium of traveling but also shows the character and the social situation of its owner .
The car of a very rich man , a BMW with a chauffeur for example , differs completely from the car of a poor family father , who has to pack his four children and his wife into an old mini-van .
If a car quited to be a part of a persons reputation and of a way of presenting social welfare its meaning and its use would change likewise .

However , altough I would appreciate these circumstance to change for the better , I do not believe that neither the politicians nor the people will change their attitude towards the use of cars .

In addition to that , changing circumstances always demands a lon periode of time .
No political nor social developement in the last ten years , however , indicates a similar change in the attitude both politically and socially .

In conclusion , that is the reason why I do not believe that fewer cars will be in use in twenty years .
