In Germany the education is based on a fast variaty of subjects you can learn .
In the so called `` Gymnasium '' it is very important to teach the students as many subjects and topics as possible .
So that every student recieves a broad knowledge and general knowledge .
But is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize on one specific subject ?

In my opinion a misture of both is the best solution .
On the one hand it is very important for well educated people to have a very good general knowlegde concerning every topic and subject .
It helps you in everyday life to understand certain things better and to improve the situation within the society .
For example there are news on the the Iraque War on tv .
To understand the situation you have to have background information on the situation in Iraque and the reasons for the war .
On the other hand it is not always possible to know everything .
Maybe you have good qualities in languages and social studies but you are not very intrested in science or mathematics .
You can share your knowledge in certain topics with other and you can profit from the others .
In class for example , my friend is very good in mathematics and I am not .
So I can learn from her and she can profit from knowledge in history .

I think you should concentrate on one certain topic that you are very familliar with but should not leave other topics out .
Then your knowledge gets to one sitted and you may loose track of other important things and happenings .

All in all I think it is good to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than just to specialize on one but in addition you can specify on one so that you can share your personal knowledge with others .
