Many academics believe that it is more important for students to analyze and understand concepts and ideas rather than to study facts .
In this essay I will examine whether the benefits of just understanding the ideas outweigh the possible advantages of learning facts .

Firstly , one argument that many people state in favor of the above mentioned opinion is that if you know the idea then you will be able to adapt to a different situation and to apply it to new circumstances .
In other words , only if you analyzed the concept then you will be able to use it to new situations .
The mere knowledge of facts does not help in this case since they are only characteristic of a certain point in time and cannot be applied universally .

Secondly , it could be argued that only the knowledge of ideas enables you to develop new ideas .
Facts are static whereas ideas are dynamic .
You can look at ideas and concepts from different angles and play with them .
Out of this dealing with a concept a new , further developed idea or system of ideas might be generated .
Mere facts are not open to such a proceeding , they can only be acknowledged .

Thus , because of these persuasive arguments the opinion of the academics seems to be correct .
However , the importance of the knowledge of facts cannot be underestimated .
In most of the time an idea can only be understood if you know the facts on which it is based .
Most of the ideas are born out of a specific situation which is essential for the understanding of the idea .
Furthermore , an idea cannot be further developed if you do not know anything about its origin .
You would not be able to apply it to a new situation and surrounding .

In conclusion , although there are several strong arguments in favor of the opinion mentioned above I believe that the knowledge of the idea and of the facts are equally important .
Both ideas and facts are intertwined with each other and cannot be separated .
Thus , in my view students should study concepts as intensely as facts .
