The development of mass media was the beginning of a new era of avertisement .
Virtually all companies make use of advertisement using the possibilities given by the new forms of mass media as for example the TV or the internet .
I agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

First reason for my point of view is economical .
Given the fact that firms take their decisions on the basis of rationality there has to be an economical icentive for them to invest in advertisement .
And so it 's quite obvious that the firms intend to increase their sales by the way of advertizement .
And the consumers are now buying more from the firm 's product for one simple reason .
The firm 's product seems to them much better than it really is .
And the firms knowing this fact make use of this by advertizing .

Another argument is psychological .
I personally have made the experience that the way one consider the value of certain objects is highly influenced by the way that other people talk about these objects .
For example , once most of my friends bought a new video game .
And whereas I had n't liked this certain game a short time before , from this moment on getting this game seemed to be the most important thing in the world .
And this process is now linked to the effects of advertisement , because the advertisement for a lot of products is made by very popular people like a tennis star or show master of an TV show .
And this effects how people think about the products .
The product seems in most cases much better than it really is .

Even if advertisement often conveys true information about a product awakening the interest of the people .
I believe that there is mostly a strong effect influencing the people in a way , so that there is difference between the true value of a product and the value the people think .
And this means that there takes place an alienation of the peoples preferences .
And from an economical point of view this ca n't be good for the welfare of the society .
