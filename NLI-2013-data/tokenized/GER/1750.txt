The topic of the essay is wether generalization is better than specialization .
If you are familiar with many academic topics it is easy for you to discuss with lots of different people about their academic preferences and interests .
You are not limited to only one specific subject .

Furthermore , you might understand academic problems faster than others because of your wide basis knowledge .
Another point that supports generalization are better possibilities in work life .
The student who is able to deal with a lot of different subjects is more interesting for big firms .
He can be charged into nearly every department of these firms .
So he is really flexible and has a lot of different possibilities .

On the other hand , as a generalist , you are one among lots of people who have a basis knowledge about several academic subjects .
You have no special interest that makes you a kind of unique between all the others .

Your career stops on a certain level and the specialists overtake you because of their better education and the fact that they concentrated on one subject .
At this point the generalist cannot compete with the specialist anymore .

Additionally the generalist is changeable .
There a lot of other generalists who can make the same work as good as you .
In contrast , the specialist is not changeable because he has a perfect knowledge of the subject he works in .

In conclusion I would disagree with the statement .
I think it is better especiallz for your work life to have a perfect knowledge of a specific academic subject .
It is also better in social life to be specialized in one specific subject because you get better reputat5io
