I could imagine that this statement might become true .
Several reasons lead me to this conclusion .

First , in the future jobs in agriculture will be replaced by more technology .
As a consequence the people will move into towns .
There are trams , subways and buses , so a car is no longer needed .

Second , in future times will be ( hopefully ) more conservation .
People will try to reduce emissions , so they will share buses and will use trains .

I could imagine that globalization will contribute to a reduction of cars , too .
A better connection of cities , countries and continents will be neccessary .
More flights , for example , will exist .

Because I live in Germany , let 's look at my country .
If I live in Berlin and have to work in Munich , I have the choice to go by train , plane or car .
The advantage of the car is that there is no specific time when I have to start from Berlin , I can decide on my own .
Today , the plane and the train have fix times of departure .
The disadvantage of the car is the long traveling time .

But imagine , in the future more and more people have to travel between Berlin and Munich because of the globalization .
Much more trains and planes will be .
Then there will no longer be the question `` Will I go by plane/train or by car ? '' because it simply takes too long .
As you can see , here the car is replaced , too .

Another reason for fewer cars might be a raise of working time .
In the future people propably have to work more than today , so they will have less leisure time .
A a result they will have less time to drive out of the city to see the nature , for example .
A car is not neccessary any more , because in town they will , as already mentioned , have trains and buses .

In conclusion I can say that I can imagine very well that there will be fewer cars in use in future and I really do hope so because then there would be less emission which contibute to the depletion of the ozon layer .
