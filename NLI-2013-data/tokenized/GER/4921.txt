I totally agree with this statement .
In fact , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but this is necessary .
I do not think , that it is right to cheat buyers in this way , but I also can understand the reasons for these behaviour .

On the one hand , the firms had to attract people to buy their product .
They want to make as much profit as they can to establish their enterprise .
But they have to be better than other firms , who sell the same products .
So all of them have to made their product look like the best product off all , to give the buyer confident in this product .

A car is a product , which has got a lot of advertisement on TV , or anywhere else .
When the people see those beautiful cars on TV , driving through nice - looking streets and with an entire family sitting in there , all smiling and laughing , it is normal , that they get the feeling of an unbeatable , ultimate product .

The voice on TV tells you , how cheap it is and that you must get it , if you do not want to miss anything in your life .
In this situation , everyone , espacially those , who already has the intention of buying a new car , wants ` this ' new car .

But also younger participants of the family are lured by the beautiful made - up products on TV .
For example any kind of potato chips or ice creams .
Seeing the people in the advertisement , eating those well smelled and nice - looking potato chips or ice creams , the smaller ones even cannot get away from the television .
It seems , that the ice cream tastes so good , that they also want to get one of them instantly .

But in reality , when you are getting the product shown on TV , it is not so good as it is shown .
Often the buyer gets dissappointed even by seeing the car in front of them .
Sometimes it does not really look as the same on television .
Of course it cannot be the same !
The firms only show products on televion , that have been corrected with the help of computers to make it look better .
In real life , no car in the world will shimmer in this way .
But it can also accure , that the product does not contain all the opporunities , which are promised in the advertisement .

So , to make a conclusion to all off this above , it is really unfair of the firms to cheat people , in order to attract them , to buy their products .
But as we all can see , it works .
Perhaps , we should not always believe things we see on TV instantly , to avoid the feeling of disappointment , after buying the product .
