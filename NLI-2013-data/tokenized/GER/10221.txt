People who have success in their lifes , very often try to push their limits to the test .
Having had the sweet feeling of success , they tend to know that else is possible .

Like so many people in our material society , they first wanted to have success .
So , success automatically comes along with money or respect .
Being an individual member of this society , but still seen as someone special because of his achivements , the successful man ( or woman ) tries to stay on top , proving to himself and the mass that he could achieve everything , being someone special .
So , the things he used to do are n't so special anymore , what means that there must be new , more exciting challenges waiting .
So , knowing that he is a `` winner '' , the successful man has the power ( wherether it is money , influence or popularity ) and can do what he plans , which is giving him the kick he needs .

I think you could compare successful people with junkies .
Not in a selfdestructive way , but in the way they always need more and more to be satisfied , which is a phenomena that can be proved by looking at the worlds ' top managers nowadays .
Earning more in one month than an average worker would earn in one year , still not satisfied and greedy .

I have the opinion that successful people often do not specifically realize that it is greed , what is driving them to push their limits .
They tend to ignore that fact and take risks more easily than a `` normal '' person would do .

In the end , I do n't agree with the statement above , for I think that trying new things and taking risks is just a needed prove for these people , that no matter what they do , they will always be someone special .
These people are just bored by what they achieved so far and need to find something more satisfying for theirselves .

But everyone for himself is special , so there is no need for taking the risk to prove it .
