Of course many people might think , that the youth has become more egoistic and at a certain point I agree with that .
If you take a look on the big cities , you see everyone living on his own , maybe additionally caring about his parents and his girlfriend , but that is all .
In my opinion this is just an brief impression .
If you take a deeper look , you would find out , that there are still a lot of beneficial clubs , who do spend time helping the community even without being paid .

And that 's why I think the situation has not changed in the recent years , there are just more youths living in the cities and the people tend to see only that ones , that do not care .
Especially in smaller towns , there are a lot of young people , who want to help others for example in sport clubs or at church .
I know a lot of people at my age , who are interested in these things .
Concerning myself , I am member in the football club in my town , where I do the train for almost 20 kids together with a friend .
Sometimes this is very hard and exhausting , but it is just such a fantastic feeling to do something for the kids .
Especially because I know , how I appreciated the football train the time I was in their age .

Moreover I am also member of a youth group , that belongs to the church .
With this group we often organize trips for younger members to the zoo or bike-tours .
Once a year we have a one-week camp , sleeping in tents .
This is really exciting , because instead of shopping or watching TV , we are singing or playing games in the nature , which is really something totally different from the dayly life .
Sometimes we also organize something for the older people in our town , like drinking coffee or playing cards .
In my opinion there is nothing better than a simple `` thank you '' or even just a smile on the face of a young boy or girl .
So in addition , especially in smaller cities or towns there are still young people , who are encouraged in helping others .
