I definately agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I have to admit that I am not the type of person that watches a lot of television and I am also not paying too much attention to advertisements I see on newspapers or magazines .
However , it happened a few times in my life that I trusted in what I saw on TV , but I do not want to mention all the disappointing moments I had , trusting too much what I have seen on the advertisements .

So let us try to imagine what is in the `` company 's mind '' .
Since it is the aim of an advertisement to make it look great and to make it seem like you , the customer , really needs it , the company has to do everything in order to make you believe that the product is great .
The consequence is that marketing plays with pictures , sounds , words , and emotions so that the customer gets appealed to the product .
If this mathes with reality or not does not matter at all .
Even the last `` finish '' on the computer makes the product look a thousend times better than in real life .
What matters is that the product sells - and that 's why it has to look great .

In order to sell the product the company has to make up an image that really makes you think that there is no better product available on the market .
- That 's why we think we have to spend money in detergent that makes clothes whiter than white or in tooth paste that makes teeth cleaner that clean .
Sometimes you sit there and wonder how it can be possible that you are fooled that way .

looking at the facts , it is widely known that companies spent thousands of dollars in market research for the purpose of finding out how the breaking of a cookie has to sound in order to be sold or what color the tomato on the Big-Mc-advertisement has to have so that it looks appealing to the buyer .

Maybe it helps us , as the consument , to view advertisements as a plain product information , just to find out what is there on the market and not rely too much on the opinion , the value , the image it is trying to come across .
Then we do not have to worry whether the product is better or not , but just make up our mind on our own .

It is obvious that reality is not as colorful , tasty , clean , white - whatever you want to take as an example - as the advertisents make you think in the first place .
However , if you as the customer keep that in mind you do not get too disappointed and still can enjoy your Big-Mc .
