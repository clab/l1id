Some pupils often claim about the fact that they have to learn so much facts on things that they are not really interested in .
But this problem is sometimes only based on the thing that pupils just have not understood the ideas of the theme .
Therefore I think it is more important for pupils as well as for students to get clear with the ideas and how these ideas are developed than just to learn about the facts .
I agree that theory is important but all the other things should be then strengthen by practising .

The most important argument is that without having understand the idea or the concept of the special topic that is being worked on in class it is just useless for the student to learn the facts based on the topic .
In a certain test the student may can list all the facts that he has learned but does absolutely not understand in what context they are .

Secondly , I think it is more important that the students learn about the theory in the lessons and than practice it in the world .
If there is for instance a student of medicine who has always learned very carefully all the factors that have something to do with anatomy it is the best way to strengthen his skills by giving him the opportunity to have an exam on a real dead body .

Lastly , Students may just be overwhelmed by all the facts they are supposed to learn and can therefore just forget the real content of the idea .
Looking behind the facade is very important for a student so that eventually he can really cope with all the factors and of course also the problems connected with this concept .

In conclusion it is absolutely more important for a student to understand the ideas than to learn the facts , because practise is more important than theory and students should not be overwhelmed by the facts of a certain topic .
