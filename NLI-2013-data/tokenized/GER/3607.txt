I agree with that statement .

There are several reasons for young people not to take actively part in their community .
The main point is the missing education of children and young people .
Today many of them are n't well educated in behaviour .
Families do n't spend enought time to affect the children 's behaviour , because they think it is the teacher in school who has to do that , but he is n't .
A familie has to provide social rules to it 's young members to make them known in the importance of relationships and communitive life .
To me , religion also plays a role in this education .
Many young people are n't religious for several reasons , but religion can have an important effect on the peoples communitive thinking .
It teaches equality and understanding and it tells that every single person is important and a good relation between each other is one of the most important thing in life .
Most of my friends who are members of the christian church are highly interested in our community and participate actively .
Another reason for the missing helping is the influence of mass media on the teenagers .
Advertising implies that everyone is only next to hisself , no one else matters and it finally suggests that one is the middle of the universe .
Young people who have n't a working familiar background , are left alone with that suggestions .
It is no surprise that they ca n't cope with the influences and that results in missing interests of the community they life in .
So as I mentioned in the beginning the main thing is education in the familiar background to increase the number of actively working young people within communities .
