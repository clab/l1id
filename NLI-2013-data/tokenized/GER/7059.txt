At the moment their are just enouth cars on the street .
The streets are overfilled and it is more and more difficult to find a parking place , esspacially then you are in trouble .
The citys are poluted by the cars and the air becomes more and more dirty with every day .

Furthermore it becomes more difficult to pay the car and petrol .
The `` hobby car '' , is like a very expensive hobby and in future only rich people will have the comfort to use them .

As a conclusion , the costumer will look around for new products which are more atractive and the provider ( the car-producer ) have to react quickly , if they want to servive on the world market .

The big car producer like BMW , Mercedes , Porsche , Chrisler , Ford or Peugeot must change their production and their products .
When their are no costumer for the cars , they have to change the products and built new vehicles with other engins .
The car provider have to creat a new , clear , modern and cheap vehicle which is run by gas , electricity or oil .
So the image of the `` powerfull '' and fast vehicle with many ps will change .

( Additonally , metal gets more and more expensive on the world market .
This is why car-producer have to look around for new and cheper ways to bild a car . )

Another fact is , that their is no more place for streets , petrol stations or highways .
The population is growing rapidly , and their are other vehicle , which do not need so much place and can transport much more people in a shorter time from a to b like a car .

( The new transrapid for example is over 450 kh/h fast , des n't need petrol and is also quieter than a highway with its cars . )

So , in my opinion many things will change over the next few years .
Their will be a big number of new , quieter and clear vehicles .
Petrol will be still very important in industie , but cars will have other typs of motor / engine .
