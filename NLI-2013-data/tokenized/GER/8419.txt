I fully agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than it is for them to learn facts .

Of course , facts are important .
It is essential to know certain basic facts in almost all fields of study : for instance , a literature student must know about the main epoques of literature through the centuries , a science student must know certain formulae by heart .

Yet a knowledge of facts that goes beyond these basics is not as important as having understood the underlying ideas and concepts .
Facts may be changing .
New styles of literature will develop , new engineering techniques will evolve .
Yet the main concepts underlying these new developments will not change .
They can still be applied , be it in an academic environment when writing an essay or sitting an exam or be it in the workplace when new methods or production techniques will have to be understood and assessed .
I am a lawyer and therefore know very well that no scenario resembles the other .
Every case differs from the other , at least in nuances .
Therefore , in order to be able to find a solution to a case , one must have understood the rationales behind legal doctrines .
Only then will one be able to apply a doctrine to an unnknown set of facts .

Moreover , facts can be looked up in books or are available online .
Facts can also be digested fairly easily .
They may be complex , but they are hardly ever incomprehensible .
On the contrary , concepts cannot easily be looked up in a book .
They are often hard to understand .
They will often need explanation and in-depth reading .
That is why we actually study them , often for years .
This is why attend universities .
Understanding concepts and ideas is the key to organising the myriads of facts there are .
Human knowledge has multiplied over the past decades .
Facts are readily available over the internet .
Therefore I believe that it is even more important to understand ideas and concepts nowadays than it was 50 years ago .
Otherwise we are running the risk of being inundated with facts not knowing how to handle them .

It is for these reasons that I am convinced that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important for students than to learn facts .
