The statement `` most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' , is partly true .
The things they present in magazines and on television are always presented very well , not showing a single flaw of the product. a product that is often presented better in advertisements than it actually is , is food. a lot of companies , such as Burger King , Wendy 's , or Subway , always present they food products very well .
The burger that we might see on television or in a magazine looks delicious , with its meet grilled to perfection , and the grisp `` homegrown '' tomatoes , the freshly baked bread .
But when actually having bought and tasted the product , the customer might experience a suprise and a dissappointment .
The so delicious , golden fries seen on television , might actually be pale , potato stumps , fried to almost perfection in very very very old oil .
The burger , so tasty looking in the magazine , might in reality embody a piece of grey old meat , between 2 almost fresh tasting pieces of bread .

Make-up for example is always presented very well in commercials on TV or in magazines .
The skin of the model looks super soft and pure , the lashes so full and long , the lips perfectely shaped and full .

But what most of the buyers do n't know , is the way a picture and the model are prepared before displayed in a magazxine or shown on television .
The lashes are fake , the lips are reshaped with the help of of photoshop , and the skin purified with tones of thick make-up and powder .
The result of super volume mascara in reality is most often very disappointing , and instead of having those sexy long lashes , one finds herself having short clumpy lashes .

Nevertheless , those are just some examples that appear to be high quality products , but the crucial fact is that the buyer has the choice whether to believe the incrediable presentatiopn of the product and thus buy it , or not to believe it and not buy it .

the problem that arises is that one can never be sure of what he or she is buying , because one will always be affected by the inevitable laws of money making , and the price a customer has to pay for it .

i believe that those are some major flaws that influence our lives greatly , but i also believe that we , the buyers , can not do anything about it .
we as customers simply have to accept that we either have to pay an incrediable amount of money or to pay for less quality cheap products .
