Yes , I agree with the statement that only people who take risks will be successful .
It is important to know what I can and can not do .
The most important thing is to be good at what I do and to concentrate on one specivic opject or part .
In the modern times there are so many people that for example work as designer that it is not possible to work just as such .
Everybody needs no have a certain speciality like interior designer or as a designer for cars .
Success only comes with individuality .
There are so many designer there is no way of beeing successful when you just do what everyone does .
Like because everyone this season thinks red and length sripes are trendy that should not make you only design red and length sriped chairs , skirts or what ever the provetion is .
It should make the person make green skirts with pink points on it .
That is shourly risky because maybe no one will buy them but maybe because of everybodys having red , some individuals like having green .
As soon as a person looses the thrill of beeing better he has stopped to be good .
Success comes and goes and only thous how keep on working on their own knowlege can keep on beeing successful .
Bringing new ideas and finding spots on the market that have not yet been discovered is the most surten way to make something big .

Therefor only beeing good at what you do , does not make someone autmaticly successful .
But taking the risk of going one step further then everyone else can will make the differnec .
