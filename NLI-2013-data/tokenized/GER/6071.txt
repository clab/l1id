On of the big topics in this new century is the pollution of our world , especcially of the air .
To give our children a chance to live healthy on this world , the are some possibilities to the air pollution : one of the most factors causes air pollution are our cars .

So a lot of states and countries think about strategies to increase the sum of cars in the next 20 years .
They invest money in new and more economic bus - , train - or tube-systems .

To use this transport system in the future has got a second advantage , too .
In every bog city , there is a parking-problem .
But the cities are rising , too .
And so every month a parking place chances to a new building .
In future more and more people wo n't have an other possiblity for arriving their jobs than to use this public transport systems .
So the cars will be less at our streets .

Another reason to disagree with this statement is the oil .
In some years , there wo n't be as much oil as today at our earth and therefore the petrol price will rice to regions much people wo n't be able to pay for .
Ok , there are inventions for non-petrol cars .
But nobody really support that because of the big influence of the oil industry .
So a lot of people will sell their cars and move with public systems or trains .

A third reason to disagree is that there will be new kinds of transportation-systems in 20 years .
Perhaps everybody has got a small plane .
We wo n't have any streets .
Only fly on the magnetic field of our earth without any petrol or electicity .

Or we get beamed to every place on earth like in `` Spaceship Enterprice '' ?
20 years , that 's a very long time , and looking back to the last 20 years , a lot of things , nobody thought about , has been invented .
We only need someone who invents this kinds of transport system , and then , I 'm sure , nobody wo n't use something like a CAR !

Because of this main reasons , I must disagree with the statement and can look hopefully into the future with clean air for us , our children , ...
