This statement deals with the very controversial question if younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
With regard to this general problematic two positions may mainly be brought foreward and hence need to be discussed in a dialectical way .

There is a first group of people who certainly agree with that statement .
To sustain the substance of their position they allegate that first young people have generally less sorrows which is perhaps in part due to the fact that they did not know war times and times of real economic depression .
That is the reason why they are not afaraid of loosing their jobs and not to be able to nourrish their families .

Second if youing people still go to school they dispose of more leisure time in which they go out , they got to know people , they do sports and so on .

Third young people dispose of much more opportunities than the older generation to communicate with friends , to organize vaccations or to travel at low costs .

On the other hand one cann not generally say that older people do not take profit of their lives .
A person that worked hard all life as that has had a huge professional success will easier be able to afford whatever he or she likes than ayounger person still depending on their parents from an economic point of view .
Money can be a limiting argument for young people like aslo the lack of a driving license for non adults .

In my opinion there is no general possible anewer to such a statement because to many factors need to be taken into consideration ona item-centered perception basis .
The answer to this question clearly depends on the values an individual gives high priority to .
If you are young you perhaps dispose of more time and you are less subject to professional constraints , but you are perhaps less a well-of than an older person .
The latter one may perhaps suffer from diseases restrainig its mobility .
The determining factors to my understanding are time , social flexibilty and money .

Nevertheless I would align myself generally speaking rther with the people that agree with this statement
