I think it 's more important for students to understand ideas and concepts instead of learning facts .
First of all if you want to understand ideas and concepts you have to do a lot of research .
For example Galileo Galilei had do a lot of research before he understood that the earth is not flat and is instead a ball .
It took him about twenty years .
For normal students to understand some physic problems , we have to do also a lot of research in our book or on the internet .
If you start doing research it gives you the opportunity do think about the idea and learn something about it .

Another reason why I think it 's more important to understand ideas then fact is , that fact sometimes sem really clear .
We know for a fact that Adolf Hitler killed himself .
If you would study the facts you woul study only his dead .
Instead if you are studyieng ideas and concepts , you will learn why he killed himself and why he all did this .
For me a fact is something short wich we do n't have to study , but an idea or a concept is something big you need to do some research on .

Finally , if you are learning to understand the idea and concept you can use your studies in live .
If you studied the idea how a car is working you can work at a carshop and repair cars , but if you only learnend the fact that cars have a motor you will be not able to build a car .

When you study to understand ideas and concepts you learn way more about life , then if you just study facts .
Facts do n't give the background were you can ask `` why '' .
A fact is a fact and nothing changes about that , but you can discuss about an idea or concept .
