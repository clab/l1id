We all know the common advertisements in the media .
No matter if they appear in television , in magazines or in the radio .
Do hamburgers really look so much bigger and so much more delicious in the TV ?
In my opinion , they definately do .

In the different marketing lessons I took part in , I 've learned that this effect is a widespread marketing tool to sell more products and according to this a bigger profit .
The marketing bureaus of big companies are working hand in hand with designers to make their product looking the best it is able to .

Let us have a little review about the example with the burgers .
In the advertisements the burgers and french fries look so incredibly delicious that you might have a bite directly from your TV .
Furthermore they even seem to be very huge .
But when you step in an fast food restaurant you will face the truth .
The burgers taste awful and in addition to that you will , still hungry , leave the restaurant unsatisfied .

There are plenty more examples than only the look of a product .
For instance , most people think that the cars of Daimler Chrysler settle the leadership in safety .
By using the only good results out of some safety tests , Daimlers marketing bureau implements the reliability of their cars .
But the real leader , when it comes to safety , is Toyota .
So , when the first problems with your air-bags occure , you might recognize the truth .

The quality of some clothes gives us another example .
Regarding the very popular clothes company H & M , you know what their type of advertising is !
In their ads they tell you that you get their clothes which so trendy and fashionable for an extremely low price .
But you might get to know why this piece of fashion is so cheap when you put it the first time out of your washing machine .
The colours have been bleached and they wo n't fit anymore .

To sum up , I really have the opinion that the most advertisements make the products seem much better than they really are .
