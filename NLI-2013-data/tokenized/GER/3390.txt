I sadly have to agree somehow to the statement and say that it is true .
Most people my age prefer to do senseless things in order to get engaged in their community .

One could say , it is a kind of responsibility and duty we all have for our community .
Instead of helping at some festivals or meeting with old people , thez hang around at some place smoking cigarettes or even take drugs , they play computer all day long without noticing that it has become spring or sit in front of the TV watching how a mutant hog shoots down a man in order to get the power over the Earth .

This is not reality .
On the other hand , even if it is true , I would not have given a better example .
The youth nowadays has to much to do with herself .
There are friends they need to talk to , movies they have not seen yet , magazines they need to buy , besides other unrelevant trash they have to spend their money for .
There simply is to much to do for them and no time left .

Another problem are their parents .
There is nothing thez would more prefer than seeing their kid in an organisation that helps the community .
Even if could be fun , no young person would bz himself participate in such an organisation , because it is what his parents would like him to do .

Somehow , the youth always want to rebell .
Rebell against the parents , the commercial , the government , the law .
The youth is contra , what is left pro and vise versa .
I know that because I have been such a kid .
Against everything .
But soon I found out that there is more than what the TV shows , what the friends say .
I suddenly realised that it is a wonderfull feeling to help , to engage yourself or just to be around .

I found out how much there was to see in my own town and community , and if I would prove myself active , what could be made better .
At least I would like to give an opportunity of a solution .
If they themselves offer the youths some activities interesting for them , like parties organized for the youth in some place in the city , they even could earn some extra money and have their youth involve
