Some very successful people are the commonly known risk takers .
For example , somebody who opens a new business and tries to run it by himself with his own ideas , is more likely to be successful than an employee of a company who has the same job throughout his entire life .
But also it is more likely to be unsuccessful for an owner of an unexperienced company than for the employee , because success can never be guaranteed .

The one , who tries new things can gain very important experience for his future life .
There are people who quit their job to go abroad , to study a new language or to make an internship in an other field .
This can be very advantageous when returning into the area where they worked before .
It could also be unfortunate for others , when they do n't find an adequate job when returning home .

Others might say , `` why return back home , I could life on a high standart in the other country '' .
This aquires a lot of time to adjust to the different conditions they encounter in the new country and is a challenge .

On the other hand , there are successful people who have never taken any risk to accomplish their goals .
Sometimes people have extraordinary skills that can help them to make a good career , like athletes or teachers .

But still I think , however , that most of the successful people , if it is in their job or in a social aspect , have to be born with a special talent .
They should be risky but they should also see where they have to get back to a more solid ground where it is not too likely to fail .

With the statement I do agree , because I think that you never lose anything when you take a risk , even if you fail .
You gained experience and you will never forget what your strengths are and where you can go back .
A successful person is somebody who has done something out of his life without having to say , `` I have n't done all the possible things . ''
