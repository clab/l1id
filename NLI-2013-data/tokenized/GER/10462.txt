I can not fully agree with saying this statement is true nor false .
I think that there are a lot of successful people with different opinions about the business they do .
For example am I imagining a man who made billions of Euro trough selling shoes .
I can not see the point why this man should stop producing and selling shoes for something else , something he is not experienced in .
Why should he risk his money and business trough trying something completly new ?
On the other hand he maybe just should spend his money in something new .
Being a successful salesman did not just teach him how to sell shoes but how economy in general works .
He could use that knowledge to build up a completly new business .
The better he can handle his money , the more risks he can take .

I think it greatly depends in which category or area someone who is successful takes risks .
If I would be rich trough selling shoes , I would not mind producing a completly new kind of shoe no one has yet .
Because I would be used to the economy and the business , I would not be so afraid to take this step , even if there is the danger I would not earn any money for my new creation .
On the other hand I would not spend any money or risk in some business I have got no clue about .
For instance am I , as shoe-producer , not used to anything about food-business .
The danger I could lose my money trough investing in food would extremly be increased , compared with the rate of losing my money with remaining selling shoes .
What I am trying to say is , that there is , in my opinion , no general answer for this statement .
I can not fully agree or disagree with it .
