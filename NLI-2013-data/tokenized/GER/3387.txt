Although I can understand why some peolpe have the impression that young people today are not engaging themselves enough to helping their communities , I disagree with this statement .
I have three reasons for my opinion .

First , in my view , young people have to dedicate most of their time to their education and career .
As the unemployment rate in most countries increases year after year this is the only way for young people to asure themselves a job in the future .
For example , young people have to attend college or university , they have classes during the day and usually homework to do in the evening .
Some students also have to work part-time to be able to afford the university fees .

Second , a lot of young people are planing their own family when they are still young .
When you have children on your own you need time to raise them .
Children need a lot of attention as they always have so many questions about the world and a lot of reasearch papers state that the intellectual capabilities of children are influenced most at a very young age .
So parents should take all the time they need to raise their children and explain everything to them .

Finally , I am convinced that even though young people do not have a lot of free time , still many of them do engage themselves to helping their communities .
I would like to give two examples of the community I live in .
In our community especially young people are part of the First Aid Team of the local Red Cross .
They spend their time doing different volunteer services , like medical help or entertainement for older people .
Furthermore , the Fire Department of our town has a special youth organization for people aged below 17 years .
For the last five years the volunteer members of this youth organization have increased steadily .

Concluding , I think that young people today have a lot of important activities and obligations like their own education or the founding of their own family which prevent them from giving more time to helping their communities .
But I also have the impression that young people still engage in their free time as much as they can to improve their communities ' conditions .
