From my point of view this statement is only partially true .
Through my studies in the area of management and entrepreneureship I know that the typical successful entrepreneur is not the crazy person many people think .
Quite the opposite is actually the case .
A successful entrepreneur thinks his ideas and plans through very carefully before acting .
Even though it is of course true that there is always some risk involved , risk-taking should not be confused with carelessness .
More over , I believe that a person who really knows where his or her strength lay , can be very successful .
For example , if a person has a passion for and the ability to building guitars , it will probably be best to exploid and build on this ability , rather than try to build many different instruments .
Specialization is the kye here .
So , if someone is good at something and likes what he or she is doing , improving the skills in this area will be more successful that starting to experiment .

This of course does not mean that a person , who focuses one his strengths , can stop learning .
It only means that the energy for learning new ways and methods should be focused on that one particular area .
For the guitar builder , for example , this would mean to every now and then try something new to improve his procedures .
He could maybe invent a machine which helps him to be more efficient .
Thereby he would be would try something new but the risk involved if the machine does not work is limited .

Another way to try something new without carelessly taking risk is to transfer experience .
A person who has gained expertise in a particular area might find a new and different way to use this knowledge .
Using the same example , the guitar builder could for example begin a cooperation with a violine builder and exchange knowledge .
The processes involved are similar but neither of them would have to actually start building the other instrument but both could still profit from the experiences .

After all , I would rewrite the satement as follows : Successful people try new things but carefully estimate the risk involved .
