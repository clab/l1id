I agree with the given statement that modern adverstisements do not reflect the real quality of a product .

Since advertising is known it had the purpose to get the comsumers attention for a product , then cause interest for it which should end up in demand for the product and finally in the action of the buying process .
So it is no wonder , that a company offering a product wants it to be presented in the most favourable way to raise the amount of people buying it .
In only a very few cases the company and its advertising company care about the product shown as it is .
From an economical point of view this behaviour seems apparently right , but from a moral point of view it is very debatable .

A supporting role plays the development in the field of digitalization and technical progress .
With contemporary techniques it is possible to refine pictures or movie clips by digital means .
So in an advertisement for a lotion which proclaims clearer face skin , the picture of the campaign protagonist 's face might have been enhanced digitally .
So it seems , that the lotion is effective because he or she has very clean skin in his facial area .
That the picture does not reflect the true situation the consumer will get to know after he has bought the product , when the adverstiser has reached his goal - a sale .

In my opinioen this emphazises the nowadays problem that the population - the consumers - are not critical enough towards information they receive via television or media in general .
They believe in what they see without a critical attitude to it .

As a conclusion I want to say that from my point of view , its true that advertisements often make products seem better than they are , but thats okay because the advertiser acts in economical purpose .
