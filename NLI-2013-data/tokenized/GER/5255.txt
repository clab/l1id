I agree with the statement that most advertisings make products seem much better than they really are .
It is obvious that the world of advertising is not the real world .
One may ask , why this business is still running so well , although everybody seems to know that all these advertisings are fiction .

In my opinion it is not worth discussing this particular circumstance stated in the statement .
Much more interesting is the fact that the advertising industry is such a lively and successful industry .
To question that , will lighten up the reasons , why the untruth of advertising finally does n't bother us .
Everybody knows , that there is a lie lying in advertisings in general .
But I think , there is something like an agreenment going on in modern societies , an agreement between people and the advertising companies .
Advertising satifies longings of masses of people and it became a space or a tool to express , exchange , consume and play with ways of lifestyle .
And this is the keyword for explaining this whole situation .
In my opinion people enjoy to get informed in this way .
This can be seen from different views .
On the one hand it 's a way of freedom , based on his or her own responsibility , on the other hand its a subtile way of leathership that te advertising companies were able to grasp .

So there is a world that consists out of longings and desires and there is no point to discuss the fitting between the advertinsing and th eproduct itself .
This industry cares about lifestyle and that it .
