I disagree with the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , because that people have more self-confident than others .

For this statement , there are a easy reason .
When you do something successful , you are glad and you know that you can do something well .
So you have more self-confident than other people who try to do something well but it doesn ' t want to be as they want .
And this must be a reason in my opinoion , why successful people have to search a new challenge .
Often a new challenge brings some risks with it .
But successful people shouldn ' t be worry about that .
For them it should be nice to have a risk and to do something new .
You can compare it with the words `` No risk , no fun '' ...

Perhaps for some successful people it could be boring to do the same all the day .
In my opinion , they have to test something new .
It is too easy to do what they already know how to do well .
The problem is that these people can ' t improve their-selfs anymore in this way .
This is bad and don ' t help them in their lifes .
And for me , the life is only interesting that when you finish something that you have to find a new challenge in your life .
Than you have something in front of you what you can reach .
I think that is important and not to do only things , yo already know how to do well .
That is too boring , I think .

But perhaps , successful people only do something they already know how to do well to not become problems , because they aren ' t so good at the beginning like before .
Perhaps , these people are afraid of doing something new .
But this can ' t be a reason to stop of doing something new .
I think , it is too important to look for new challenges that you can ' t never stop it ; never now and never in your whole life .
