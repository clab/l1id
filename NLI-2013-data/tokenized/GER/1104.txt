This statement is , in my opinion , incorrect , since i do not belive that someone with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects could compete on a specific subject with someone specialised on this subject .

In today 's society a great field of experts , specialized into certain academic subjects , exists .
So it will be hard for somebody with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects to be more effective in fulfilling his profession , than someone who specialized on this subject and is perfectly trained in his profession .

Of course some basic knowledge of many academic subjects is neccessary in order to make connections between different fields of study and to spur developement and improvement of subjects .
This occurs especially in sciences where for example calculus and physics are very closely related and could have never been developed as far as they have been without scientists having a good knowledge of both .
But without specialization into one of these subjects , or even into subfields of these subjects , no more improvements could have been made at some point since it is not possible for the human brain to take and work with all the information that exists on the two fields of study today .
So it is also not possible for anyone to gather broad knowledge of even more subjects .

So i believe that nowadays it is even better to focus on one subject only , but therefore to study it as perfectly as possible and then form research groups with other experts in other specific subjects in order to develope new inventions , then to try and cope with all the existing information and to accquire a broad knowledge of many accademic subjects .
