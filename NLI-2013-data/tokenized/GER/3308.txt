`` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . ''
I disagree to this statement because of the following reasons .

First , there is a problem in defining the term `` enough time '' .
It remains unclear how much time any given person should spend helping the community .
Furthermore , who decides what is helpful to the community ?
Which things that have to be done in a community should be done by volunteers and which should be done by professionals ?
These questions arise when accusing young people of not spending enough time helping their communities .

Apart from these terminological problems , there are so many young people doing voluntary work for the community .
I experience that they spend their time working for the Red Cross , helping at home looking after elder family members , getting involved with the scouts or at church .
These are just examples of the many places in a community where you easily find young people helping the society .

The impression that young people nowadays do not help the community can arise , because today , a lot is expected of the young : During the morning , they are at school .
In the afternoon and at night they are busy doing their homework , having a job to earn extra money or they have hobbies ( e.g. sports or music ) .
Due to globalization , competition between young people has become more .
They have to work harder in order to be prepared for their future .
Nowadays , in a lot of professions , one does not only have to compete with people from one 's own country , but with people world-wide .
Modern means of communication and transportation have made the world a very fast-paced and competetive place .

In order to be able to compete , young people nowadays have to be succsessful in a lot of areas : school ( to acquire knowledge ) , hobbies ( to show diverse interest ) , jobs ( to earn extra money ) , and community work ( to help the community where they live ) .

As shown in this text , I disagree with the hypothesis given .
First , there are problems with the definition and quantification of `` help '' and `` engough time '' .
Second , there are so many young people who work for the community .
Third , young people have to prepare their own personal future .

Did young people in former times spend more time to helping their communities ?
