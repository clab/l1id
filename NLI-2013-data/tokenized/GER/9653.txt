Doubtless inventions were and are still the motor of the developement of mankind .
What would the world look like without fire , wheels or iron ?
Inventions are made by people who try new things or improve things .
But despite all positive effecs also dangers have to be considered .

Today the know how of many firms is their most valuable posession .
If you invent something and get a patent for it you might become wealthy because everybody who wants to use your idea has to pay for that .
Moreover the history teaches us , that knowledge can determine about winning or loosing wars .
Just think of gun powder and fire arms which led to success in wars at the end of the middle age or the famous enigma-machine in the second world war .

But inventions are not the only form of trying somthing new .
A famous saying says : `` There is nothing that ca n't be improved ! ''
For example if you have already working marketing strategies ; why not try something new ?
Perhaps new ones might be more successfull and you will b able to sell more goods .
A friend of mine worked in China .
He saw workers manufacturing something quite slowly because they combined its parts in the wrong order .
When he suggested to change the order they were afraid of trying something new and take the risks .
So their output kept slow .

In other words when you take the risk to try something new , you will be unique in a certain way , because nobody had done this before .
This is a clear advantage in competitions for instance between two companies .
But going along with that everybody shold be aware of the dangers .
For example when nuclear energy was first used for building bombs .
Despite they were built to kill there was another aspect some scientists were afraid of .
They predicted that it might be possible that the heat of the detonation will initiate a chemical reaction which will completely burn the atmosphere .
Today we know better , but what would have happened if they were right ?
Better not to imagine !

In other words to discover new things will nomally create advantages for people , firms and the whole mankind .
But make shure that you know the dangers and that you can handle them .
