I ca n't make a clear decision wether i agree the statement or not , because it depends on the product and especially on the brand .
I think that products and brands being popular and well known wo n't cheat with their advertisment .
One reason is that the quality of most of this products is so high that there is no need for the enterprises to lie .
A second reason is that the enterprises harm their image if they promise something their product ca n't fulfill .

But on the other side new or unknown brands which will conquer a market ca n't survive if they wo n't get humans attention .
That 's why many enterprises have to make big promises to attract the consumers view .
Examples can be seen daily in TV or in the written media .

In our days I think I tend a bit more to the fact that I wo n't agree with the statement .
In the time of internet there is a high transparancy concerning the quality of goods .
Statements of people who used the product could be looked up and so if one product has bad critics the enterprise could be kicked out of business .

Furthermore there are several institutions like the German `` Stiftung Warentest '' which test products to give a neutral statement , and people give much upon their opinion .
Last but not least the legal situation for businesses is more difficult .
So there is only a small path between what is legal exageration and what is illegal cheating .
So the risk to harm the business , for an enterprise , is big enough that most of them wo n't make their products better than they realy are because there is a lot of danger in being punished by the state or even the consumers .
