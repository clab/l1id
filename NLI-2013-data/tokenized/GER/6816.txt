The question wheter or not there will be fewer cars on the road in the future has been discussed by many articles .
I do not think that in 20 years there will be fewer cars in use than today .

The reason why I think the number of cars wo n't decline is based in the function a car has and the benefit of a car that humans apprecciate about owning one .
It has to do with the attitude most humans seem to have , concerning cars .
Many people love their car and have almost an emotional relationship with it .
They think of it as prestige and status symbol and use it for expressing themselves and making a statement of who they realy are .

Other poeple like the most about cars that they give them the opportunity to be flexible .
A car gives the freedom to visit a place whenever the driver wants to and also gives the freedom to leave a place when wished .
People reach freedom through cars .
Freedom is one of the most important values of western society .
It is something that we do not want to give away .

When we think about reasons why there could be a decline in cars on the street in the future , we often think about the often mentioned oil-scarcity or the dependency of western countries on oil-producing eastern countries .
I am aware of the fact that those things are important and difficult to solve .
But what makes me sure that the number of cars wont be reduced is the faith in new innovations .
I believe that one day we realy need to find something new , there will be a new invention .
One example for this can be seen in the case of the VW Lupo , which is a car model that only uses up five liters of fill on 100 kilometers .
This model was released shortly after oil prices rose up high .
Some articles sayed that VW had the car ready and was just waiting for the right opportunity to bring it on the market .
I could imagine that car manufacturers also have the right idea of how to make driving possible in a true clean way , without pollution-causing engines and without using regular fill .
Furthermore , I think that once such cars are invented and accepted by a bigger part of population , they will be produced on assembly lines and in high ammount .
This would make them available for many people .

Concluding , I think that the number of cars wo n't be reduced because people dont want to give away their cars , which gives new innovations the room to create a new car that can be driven without negative effects .
