Good marketing strategies and a lot of psychology are placed in advertisements .
They want to make the costumers thinking they buy the best product on earth , but sometimes the companys are cheating .
In my opinion it 's true , that most advertisements make products seem musch better than they relly are .
The big bosses of the economy want to make the big money by selling a lot of their products .
To reach their thoughts , they would nearly do everthing they could do .
There are many reasons why the managers try to reach much more money .
One is per example the stock market , which opens many people the possibility to be a shareholder of a company .
They invest their money with the thougth to get more money back in an future time and so the put the manager under big pressure , because he 's the man who has the investments of the shareholder in his hands .
I think that many managers do n't want to be unemployed and so they starting to find the best ways of selling .
Some make their products without good quality , so that the costumers need a new one after using it a few times .
The disappointment of this is , that the products are presented like unbreakable wonders which can change the world .
This strategy gets a lot of monez for the company , but only the first time , because the costumers are not stupid and after buying one or two times this product they wo n't come back to the company with such a bad quality .
So if the company wants to have success it has to improve the products , but they only do small changes and sell them the same strategy thez do the first time .
In my opinion a lot of companys do it that way and that makes it very difficult to separate the good products from the bad ones .
The costumers have to test the products even more clearly .
Has it become that worse case ?
I do n't think so , because the state has to improve the laws and give more rights to the costumers .
