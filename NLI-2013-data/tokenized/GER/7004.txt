Today , the environment continues to play in increasingly important role in world politics .
Although , first steps have been made to reduce globl warming , the issue is still not treated with the earnesty and conviction it deserves so far .
Sadly I need to stress the fact , that this may pose a greater threat to civilisation than terrorism .
Cars contribute to global warming by emmiting CO2 .
Consequently , the question wether there will be fewer cars in use in 20 years is of vital importance to us all .
I would like to answer with a definite yes .
However , I think otherwise .

One of the main reasons for this conviction is , that people have known about global warming for a long time , but that consequent action , such as driving less has been taken only by a small minority .
People love convenience , and cars are very convenient .
Moreover cars are very important symbols of status for many people .
Feelings have a greater influence on most people than rational thought , and this is why they will not give up their cars if they don not have to .

Another reason why I think that the number of cars will increase , is that large numbers of people in the so called third world , especially in China , who did not have cars so far , are starting to buy them .
Ony a drastic increase in petrolem prices could slow this developement .

Less pessimistic reasons for my view , are that new cars are beeing developed .
These cars use less fuel , cosequently , they will be affordable , even if fuel prices should rise significantly .
What is more , research has been trying to invent cars that do not use combustable fuels at all for quite a while .
They will surely succeed in the near future .

I do hope that if I am right , and we do have more cars on earth in twenty years , than we do today , that they will not emmit CO2 .
