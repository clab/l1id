In my opinion it is more important to understand the main ideas and principles of what you are supposed to learn than to learn some facts by heart .
If you only learn some procedures or facts by heart , you wo n't be able to tailor your knowledge to a new task .
And I think you will forget this knowledge very soon .
For example I have learned very much for the final exam in history by heart , but after that exam I have forgotten all these facts very rapidly .
But on the other hand I have tried to understand everything in maths and I still can rememder most of the knowledge I needed for the final exam .
And the grade in maths was by far better than the grade in history .

That is the main point why I think understanding the ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts by heart .
Nevertheless , there are some things you have to learn by heart , because without some key facts you cannot understand some ideas .
One example is that you cannot calculate a maximum of a function , that is to illustrate profit figures , without having learned what the definition of profit is and without knowing how to find out where the maximum is .

As one can see from the examples given in my text , learning facts by heart has a very limited usability for new problems but there are some occasions in which one cannot avoid learning key facts by heart , because otherwise one cannot understand certain concepts .
Nevertheless , I think it is clear that understanding the principles and ideas is superior to stupidly learning facts by heart .
Another important advantage of understanding the ideas behind a certain fact is that you can easily find a perfect solution for problems that are based on the same ideas in notably shorter time and that you do not have to learn every scenario by heart , because you can derive it from a `` basic '' scenario .
So you have to keep less in mind .
