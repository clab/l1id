I think that I will have to partially agree and partially disagree with the statement that young people tend to not give enough time helping their communities .
To answer the question accuratley though , and to fully explain my personal opinion on the topic , first of all we need to define the word ` community ' .
A community is not only the place where you are living .
It might just as well be a certain group of people you spend a lot of time with , like your sports team , your school , political parties , your church or a local band .

All these are communities .
Sure there are young people who just like to hang out with their friends at home , watching television or playing videogames .
But teenagers are starting to wake up again , they have begun to be more active and participate in group activities , in communities .
There are festivals and street markets organized by teenagers , they sing in their churches or help raising funds for charity projects .
It is the young people - and not big companies or mighty politicians - who are struggling for a job and a future and therefore go through a lot of effort like organizing conferences or meetings with those in charge to change something about the situation .

Clearly they cannot do all this on their own and need help from adults like parents , teachers , mayors and company bosses .
But young people are up on their feet again , they are trying to make a change for the better .
Of course it is very easy to get the impression that in our society everyone only thinks of his - or herself anymore and is not willing to volunteer for a higher purpose , especially when you think of teenagers .

However , this impression can only be right if you look at individuals .
Many young people are only concerned with their own future and their own well-being , excatly like many adults do .
But there are just as many great teenagers I know that spend a lot of time helping their communities and the people surrounding them .
