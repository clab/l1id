The question whether traveling in an organized tour with a guide is an enjoyable enterprise depends very much on the travel destination , the personal travel companions , and the physical fitness required for a certain trip .

If I wanted to go to a destination , where I do not speak the language , do n't know the local customs or where there are specific regions to avoid , due to , e.g. , civil unrest , I would prefer traveling in a group .
The protection of a larger amount of people and a , hopefully , well informed and capable guide can make the journey much safer and more enjoyable .
Also , if I would want to travel with someone who needs a certain degree of comfort and protection , such as an aging parent , a group might be a good idea .
And then there is of course the company and ease a group can provide when you travel either alone or with a difficult companion , because there are always people to share your thoughts and feelings with .

However , a group can never offer the sense of adventure and indepedence an individually organized trip can infuse you with .
Also , it may be much more exciting , pure , and romantic to see new places without the filter of the group experience and opinion , and the pre-determined judgements a travel guide may confront you with .
Would n't it be wonderful to visit a Buddhist termple alone or with your best friend or your spouse in the moonlight , to see the golden buddha gleam , and feel close to the spiritual world ?
Imagine how disruptive the chatter of a group or the insistent lectures of a guide could be in such a moment .

All in all , the decision whether to travel with a group or alone depends on a whole number of factors and expectations , and the success and enjoyment of a journey can certainly already be decided by this initial choice .
