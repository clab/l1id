Since ever there are dicussions if young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I would say that this is not true .
If I look at my parents or even at my grandparents I can recognize that they still enjoy their life .

Fist of all , it is clear that older people enjoy their life in a more different way than younger people do .
They do not want to go out every night or weekend .
But for them this is not so important .
They had the possiblities when they were young .
For them it is more important to spent as much time with their family as possible .
This is enjoying life for them .

Moreover older peolpe have much more things to do every day .
They have the responsibility for a house , they have a job to do , and many other things .
When you are young you do not have all these problems or jobes to handle with .
So from the eyes of young people our parents life might be seen as not too excited .
But I would say that is is not true , too .
For older people the things mentioned above are very important .
They are pround of all these things and reaching is a way enjoying their life .

Another point I want to mention is that older people have made much more experiance in their life .
Most of the thinks me and my friends are doing now my parents have already done .
So they enjoyed their life as they were young nearly in the same way as my generation does it now .
So you never cannot say that they do not enjoy their life .
They enjoyed their life as well as we do it now .
But unfortunatelly this most of the younger people will understand when they get older .

To come to a conclusion , I would never say that younger peolpe enjoy their life more than older peolpe do .
As you can read above I completly disagree with this statement .
