Although I can imagine reasons why people would consider learning of facts as the most important task of students , because in some situation a specific knowledge is a great advantage and all that counts , I totaly agree with the statement named above .
I do share the opinion that the understanding of general ideas and concepts is more important for several reasons .

First , this ability is transferable to many situations and subjects .
For example even if a person changes her major subject of studies , it is still possible to use the accomplished knowlege of methods and concepts in the new subject .
On the contrary , the simple facts of the previous studies are most of the time no longer usefull .

Second , human brains are only able to provide a limited number of facts at the same time , so people will not remember details of facts after a few months or years and need to relearn them anyway .

According to my opinion , another reason to judge the learning of facts less important is the current way of living .
Because of the fast technological development in our century , a reasonable amount of facts which you learn today might be toal useless very quickly .
For example some programming languages which were commonly used only a few years ago are now not up to date any longer .
This technological environment also enables people to get to know specific facts very fast by starting research in the internet , which makes the knowldege of facts even less important .
But it is necessary to be able to distinguish the quality of web pages , which leads again to the argument that a general knowledge is important .

Because of those reasons stated above , I came to the conclusion , that the knowledge of facts is time limited and being capable of using general concepts and ideas will last longer and are therefore more efficient than facts .
