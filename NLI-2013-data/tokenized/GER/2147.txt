I disagree with this statement because even if old people are n't healthy anymore they can do a lot of things and have as much fun as younger people have in their lifes .

The first reason for my opinion is that not all old people are so weak and ill that they only can lie in bed .
And even if they ca n't to sports anymore or maybe ca n't walk at all they can do other things that bring a lot of fun to them .
For example they can learn something in courses especially offered for older ones or they can read amazing books or looking good films .

Another reason why I think that old people can have a lot of fun is that they have much more time than young people have , because of not beeing forced to go to work eight or ten hours every day .
Because of that they only have freetime , and can spend it with their family , or travel in foreign countries for example .

Finally old people can have maybe even more fun than younger ones because of their increased level of experience .
The long time old people have already been on earth causes they have a lot more knowlegde about how things work in life .
They connected a wide range of different charakters , solved a lot of problems and so learned much about themselves .
So old people know enough what kind of activities they enjoy and what kind of people they like .

With that knowledge most things are easier and cause less trouble .
For example a weekend trip makes more fun if you 're in a group you fit in .
In conclusion experience and a lot of free time let have old people have a lot of fun , even if their ill .
They just have to visit groups or courses for old people or spending their time together with friends or their family by doing things they enjoy .
