My grandmother survived World War II .
She saw the soldiers fighting on her parents proberty and she saw relatives getting killed just for fun by these soldiers .
I think the biggest question is , how to defin an `` enjoyed life '' .
What is an enjoyed life ?
Is it to be thankful for surviveing a war and still being able to breath even though with all these images in mind ?
Or is it going out for party every weekend , drinking alcohol and taking drugs ?
Is n't it more worth to enjoy an opera by Mozart or Beethoven than listening to house or rap ?

I totally disaggree with the statement because I do not think that most of the young people really know , what life is .
They never had to fight for it , they get the benefit of free education , at least in the western world , and they have never seen the reality .
Yes , I agree , that younger people enjoy there life more by playing computer games , meeting with frends , going out for party et cetera then older people do .
But that is just a life they are able to enjoy because of the hard work of they parents and grandparents .

Younger people do not have to work on the fields of their parents any more because they grow up in a city .
They do not have to serve in the military like their fathers and they do not have to see all the dirt that is present in this world if they do not watch CNN instead of MTV .
Younger people do not appreaciate their free time like olders do .
That is why I think older poeple enjoy their life more .
Their experiences and their history makes them enjoy it because they know , that the life they can live now is much better much saver then it was a couple of decades ago .
