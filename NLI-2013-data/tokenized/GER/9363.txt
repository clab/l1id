I agree with this statement .
It is more important to understand basic ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
If someone does not understand the idea behind a concept , it does not help to know all the facts .
facts are normally written somewhere and it does not take long to look them up when they are needed .
But if the whole concept is not understood , it is impossible to realise it .

That shall not mean that i believe that learnig facts is unimportant , the believe of the bigger importance of understanding the idea is just bigger .
I would like to explain to you where this believe is based on , on a practical example .
Emagine you sit in a restaurant .
You are obviously hungry and have pleased the waiter already to hurry .
He seats you , hands out the menu and starts explaining what all is new in this menu .
You look at him , begging with your eyes , while he starts to present the specialmenu for the weekend and the actionmenu of the month and so on .
That waiter definetly knows all the facts , but still you will be unsatisfied because he did not get the point .
You are hungry , and all you want is that you get good quality food in a fast time .
He should have suggested the daily menu and you would have been pleased .
