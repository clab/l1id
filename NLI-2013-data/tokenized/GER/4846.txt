To answer this question , it is also important to know about the intentions advertisers have .
For sure they want to spot their products into a brighter light , because they want to persuade the customers to buy their product .
Generally you can assume , that a good manager does not want to make his product better than it actually is , but he wants to picture his product relatively better than the competitors ' products .
Therefore an advertisement sometimes make products seem much better than they really are , but it does not have to be .
In cases advertises exaggerate , it will arouse negative dissonances at the customers and they will be very unsatisfied .

On the other hand the statement depends a lot on the interpretation of the potential customer 's behaviour .
If he interprets the advertisement in that way , then it is absolutely unimportant what the advertiser wanted to express with the advertisment .

Due to this two points of view ( advertiser or manager vs. customer )
I do not agree to this statement entirely .
Maybe , because I am tried to be both .
A manager as well as a customer .

Nonetheless if this statement is true or not , you should always make the assumption , that an advertisement does not reflect the reality correctly .
If you do not make this assumption , you possibly get disappointed , when you buy a product , many times .
This probably will happen , because not every manager takes into account , that negative dissonances can have bad consequences to the consumers ' behavior .

Additionally you should not forget another party , which is involved into the process of developing an advertisment .
It is the advertisement-agency .
The always want to exaggerate and put everything into nice and beautiful colors .
Many times the have so much influence into the ad Finally , in short words , I do not agree to the statement , but I would tell everybody , that an intelligent customer always takes this possibility into account .
Otherwise you eventually put your money into the wrong investment .
