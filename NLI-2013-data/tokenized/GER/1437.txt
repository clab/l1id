In my view , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many acafeimic subjects .
Of course there are some disadvantages of broad knowledge because it means a greater investment of time and tuition .
Howvever , there are even more compelling advantages that I want to explain .
I think broad knowledge is effecticely for many areas of the life .
First , you have a common core of knowledge with other students .
If you are an international student you need to communicate in many parts of life .
Broad knowledge makes it easier to have an intellectual exchange with other people .
In opposite , specialization leads to a narrow view of things .
This people are not informed about a lot of things so they cannot share their knowlegde with other people .

An additional point is that broad knowledge increases the opportunities of careers that you can choose from during life .
From the beginning of their studies , people often do not know what they want to make in their futures .
Therefore , broad knowlegde of many academic subjects offers more career opportunities than specialization .
Perhaps , it helps or shows you a direction in what their job should be in the future .
Of course , people often change their jobs in their entire lives , maybe because of their own decision or other circumstances .
In this case , broad knowledge can find another interesting job .

Finally , you get more opportunities for leisure time .
This means , that you are interested in a lot of things because broad knowledge provides a lot of aspects of life .
Later , educated people , when they are older , they will retire their jobs so they can spend their time on their hobbies that they have developed during their studies of many academic subjects .

In short , I think it is good to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
First , you get exposure to a lot of things .
Second , you can choose between many careers .
Finally , you get a broad view of leisure time .
