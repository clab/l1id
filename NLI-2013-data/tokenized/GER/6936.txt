Nowadays nearly all of today 's cars depend on petrol , either in form of gasoline or diesel , in order to run .
Because worldwide petrol ressources are limited , one could easily assume that in the long run , for example in twenty years , gas will be so expensive that many people can not afford it anymore , thus there will be fewer cars in use in total .

But on the other hand gas prices , especially in Europe , nearly doubled within the last five years and nothing happened .
Customers are getting angry at polititians and the petrol industry , but commute to work by car nevertheless .
Also the industrial demand in transport is steadily increasing due to globalisation .
Packages and goods get delivered all over the world and one of the cheapest ways to do that still is by trucks on the road .
Furthermore huge new markets for automobiles , like China or India are still on the rise .

Concerning the petrol problem there is also hope in technical development such as electric drives for cars and trucks or solar technique .
Even though there are still a couple of problems to solve these new techniques may one day , lead to much more economic cars or maybe even total independence of the world 's petrol ressources .
That could weaken one of the most powerful arguments not to drive cars with combustion engines : the limited petrol ressources .

Personally , I believe that in twenty years there will be even more cars worldwide .
I 'm sure that the technical evolution will provide a good environmental friendly alternative to today 's gasoline driven cars .
Last but not least , people simply love the convenience of their very own personal vehicle .
