Today we life in a tremendous global change .
For many years or decades a few things of daily life had change .
Look for instance over the situations of transporting possibilities for comodities .
During earlier times people manufactured the goods where they were used afterwards .
Today lots of products are constructed or build up in a complete different area .
They will be carried after producted by car , truck , railway or even aircraft to the places of consume or just were they will be need .
This change leads to another way of thinking .
In order to stay with the example I gave above , we have to think more like spidered .
That means all decisions that are made have to be connected with each other .
Such a process cause an other way of studying and thinking .
It requires another learning background to understand how things have to be developed .
A good help from this side is the use of the world wide net , the internet .
First develped for the belongings of the army in order to give them some advantages against the enemy , it becames over the last few years the importanst tool of communication around the world .
One can state , it has becomming a key of a better understanding of what is going on on of what is changing on the earth today .
and furthermore it gives us the possibilities to predict what we have to wait for in the future .
For example : What happens if the global warmness still increases in such velocity as it does now .
In order to manage and controll these processes it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn no more than facts .
Students have improve the knowledge of all the changings around us .
The world habitants included humans , animals and plants as well are adictted to such a behavior .
