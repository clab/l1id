Although there are reasons to disagree with this statement , I agree with .
Indeed , successful people try to do a lot of new things .
There are a lot of reasons I will support this opinion .

First of all , if you want to be successful you have to be better than other people because that is the definition of success .
In order to be better you must actually behave in another way than other people .
Then you have the chance to succeed .
If you hope to be successful without doing things in another way than other people you have to be better than most of them .
This is a very tricky task .
That means that probably more people are successful who are risk-loving .
A famous example is Bill Gates who was a highly talented student .
However , he was not only better than other students he took also risks rather than the other students and founded a small company with the name Microsoft .
Today , Bill Gates is the richest man allive .

Second , if you take risks it is highly possible not to reach the personal aim and you may fail .
However , if you do not take risks it is not possible to reach high aims at all .
Maybe the possibility to fail is higher but it is also higher to reach your personal aims .

Finally , you must have the attitude to improve you characteristics all the time .
That regards technical skills , for example to handle computer-problems , as well as social ones like the behaviour in groups .
The willingness to improve yourself together with the the personal claim searching always the best alternative increases the probability to be successful .

In conclusion , although there are a lot of risks trying new things and to behave unusualy , it is the only possibility to be successful , if you do not only trust in winning a lottery , because you have to be better than the others .
