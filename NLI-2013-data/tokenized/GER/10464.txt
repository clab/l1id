Concerning the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they know how to do well , I agree to a cerain extend .
While certain people can achieve a certain level of success by only drawing on old knowledge the majority of the people who have success , do so because of their willingness to break out try new strageties .
The first part of my essay will give arguments for this fact , while also providing examples .
The second part will draw the attention on the fact that experiences and old strategies can still be usefull , while only partly .

If one looks back in time the most people that can retrospectively regarded as successfull have taken risks and tried now stregeties .
The willingness to break out of fixed patterns of society and try new approaches has mostly resulted in success .
This applies for various fields , such as natural sciences , humanitarian scineces and especially the business world .
To give an historical example , Gutenberg invented printing as a means to reproduce texts in the 15th century .
With this he risked the anger the clerus , who had a monopoly in this field .
However , he was successful and changed the way of publishing forever .
Also today we can find similar examples , which can also be much simpler .
For example the Starbucks inventor had the simple idea to sell standadized coffee to go at various places with a brand name that stood for quality , as opposed to the classical behauvious of drinking a cup of coffee in a cafe .

However trying out new things is not sufficent to be successful .
It is important to have draw on a certain knowledge and certain skills that exstist already .
Without those skills the development of a new idea can easily result in faluire .
For example the building up of the starbucks empire , which was founded on a new idea , would never have been possible without the knowledge of olod established economic principles and business knowledge .

To conlude I want to draw aon the importance of the two elements that are important when trying out new things .
It is important to use long established skills and knowledge in order to develop a new a idea and realize it as a porject .
This approach is only logical because old knowledge and skills have once been new ideas that people fought for .
It therefore behoves us to use those old methods to realize new and daring projects .
