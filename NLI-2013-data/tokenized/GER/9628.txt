First of all I think it hardly depends on your business wheter you should try new things and take risks or only do what you already know how to do well .
So in some jobs it is just important to be good at like for example someone who works at a bank and has to check the financial situations of a company .
Therefore you do not have to take any risks or try something new because there are strong rules you have to keep .
If you are reliable and doing this job well you can be very successful .

On the other hand for example if you would like to get a successful architect you have to do something that differs you from the other architects .
Thus you have to be willing to take risks by for example developing some new type of styles .
But that is very difficult to handle because just a really small number of inventions are also done in reality .
So it costs you a lot of time to develope new things not knowing wheter you will have success or not , but if you are able to create something really new and fabolous you will normally be much more successful than a person who does not take risks and try new things .

Accordingly I think you can say that everyone should try to increase his focus of view and stay in touch with new developements because nearly everyone has to learn his whole life .
You will never be able to learn everything and new aspects come to daylight every year .
So everyone has totry new things more or less .

In conclusion I would say that you should try new things and take risks if you want to become a very successful person but you can also have success if you are just well in what you are doing .
So it depends on your job and what you are willing to do .
