In my opinion this question needs to be dealt with in a differentiated way , there are pros and cons .

A significant argument in favor of the statement is that certain developpments which currently take place , lead to a higher degree of egoism among the people .
We live in a world , which globalizes more and more , there is more competition and everything becomes increasingly busy and difficult .
One has to face unemployment or lower wages unless you are better than others , one has to dominate others in a certain way .
I think this quite general phenomenon gradually leads to a change in social behaviour , which expresses itself for example in a lack of young people , willing to help their communities .

Furthermore young peoble are in many cases not willing to help in their community for the simple reason that other things are more entertaining .
Why should they help older people or do some cleaning job when they could alternatively spend their time playing computer games , watching a series in television or hanging out with friends .
Young people are n't sufficiently taught that it can be far more interesting to help others and to improve the community experience .

On the other side there are also some argument against this statement .
The existence of a considerable number of organizations in ther welfare-sector and the fact that young people are integrated in these organizations serves as a proof against the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .

There are religious organizations , sport clubs and political parties which dedicated themselves to the duty of helping in their community and the y have many young members .
Apart from that the civil service is the Germnan alternative to the militarz service .
For the period of one year young people can help in there communities .
