I will be discussing the question whether young people do enjoy life more than older people do .
I do think that this question can be answered on a variety of levels and I will try to state my opinion on this topic .

Young people have a lot of possibilities in life .
Most of them have a lot of friends , quite some spare time and a lot of different hobbies and occupations .
They can always travel to new places , move around with ease and connect to other young people fairly easily .
Also , our society offers a lot of different ways for young people to enjoy life , they can be with their friends , they can go to the disco or visit concerts and a lot of media such as computer games and current popular music are designed specifically for younger people .

For old people however , there are n't as many viable opportunities .
They tend to have fewer friends and a very different style of enjoying themselves .
A lot of them have to work quite a lot , not leaving too much time for themselves .
They are also usually bound to their hometown , it is where their house is , where their work is and where their children might go to school .
All of that does n't really enhance their flexibility too much .
Nonetheless , they can still enjoy themselves and they can do so on a different level .

It seems just by comparing what is offered today , that it is much easier to enjoy life when you are young , but that does n't necessarily hold true .
A lot of young people feel the constant need to go to different places and to always have something going on around them .
While older people can deeply enjoy a nice glass of wine and a good conversation with a friend , young people often have trouble enjoying anything very deeply .
Since there is always a lot going on , they also ca n't really appreciate what they have and what they can do .

Young people also have constant worries about their own future , about relationships and about what will happen to them in their life .
All of these worries do in a way prevent them from truly and deeply enjoying something good that happens to them .
Older people are often a lot more content with their own life , have accepted their fate and can therefore enjoy their pleasures in life more deeply .

So in conclusion , young people seem to have endless possibilities and seem to enjoy life a lot more on the surface , but since they have a much harder time to really enjoy what they have , I would n't say that older people have less enjoyment in life .
Of course it always depends on the individual and there are many cases where a such general rule simply does n't apply , but overall I do n't think that the amount of enjoyment can be evenly compared .
Both sides can enjoy life a lot , but they do it so differently that I feel this statement can neither be agreed to , nor proven to be wrong .
