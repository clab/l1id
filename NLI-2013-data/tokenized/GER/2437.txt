In this text i will discuss the question `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
At first I have to say that everybody will be old at one day and this is my first argument .

When young people think `` I will be old sometime '' they often think on `` but not yet and I have anough time to enjoy my life ! ''
.
Then the young people often do something forbiddin or something `` freaky '' .
For example I read about parcour .
Parcour means that you run accros a city and always run straight on even if there are cars , garages and houses .
You just climb up the wall and than jump down and that is what many young people do .

For older people enjoying life is often spending time with the family , go traviling and reading something in what they are intrested .
For example cannot everybody remebres his grandmother or grandfather doing something that your parents would have never allowed or something like that ?
And most people think that only older people have got the money to travel to hotels ?
Older people most just enjoy their life .
But the young people are often not allowed to do the things they want to do and often the parents are the reason for that .

So the real question is who actually can enjoy his life ?
but this would take to long so i will write my oppinion on the question `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' I think that young people enjoy their life more than older people do .
I think that , because i often hear storys about oler people beeing very ill or having pain everywhere and like this you ca n't enjoy life .
Young people often do forbidden things and that gives them a kick and the thing with girlfriends is although giving young peoples a feeling of enjoying their life .
So i think Young people can enjoy life more than older people do .
