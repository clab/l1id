In twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today .
Although cars manufacteurs have increased their production the last decades , there is strong reason to assume that there will actually be a lower number of cars in the future than today .
This effect will mainly take place through various political measurements .
In addition environmental issues , as well as economic considerations will lead to this development .

Politicies of goverments around the world will lead to a decrease of the number of cars .
On one hand goverments will still oppose taxes on petrol and cars .
In addition to an contant increase of oil prices cars will become more and more expensive .
Many people will not be able to effort a car and instead use public transport .

The environmantal issue will become more of a problem and urge people not to use cars as they used to .
I am confident that awareness for the problems of the environment will change the way of behaviour worldwide .
The need for governments ( and other institutions , such as NGOs and also the UN ) to make environmental-friendly polities will become stronger .
This in particually will lead to measures that support public transport , which will make it more attractive to use these means of transport .

Instable economical developments will also lead to a decrease of total numbers of cars .
We will see economical difficulties and even crises .
These will have an effect on the distribution of wealth .
Wealth will be less shared among many people in the future .
Many people will have a low income .
At the same time fewer people will be rich and be able to pay for a car .
Due to economic uncertainty people will invest less in luxury items , such as a car .

Because of politcal , environmental and also economic reason there will be fewer cars in twenty .
This total number of cars might not change significantly , but still there will not be an increase .
