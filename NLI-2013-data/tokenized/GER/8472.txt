The sentence `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , '' opens a wide field for discussion .
Asked whether I agree or disagree with it , I must say that I agree .

I want to explain this opinion in the following .

What does `` to understand ideas and concepts '' mean ?

Understanding ideas presupposes the capabilty for analytical thinking .
This is something students can acquire by discussing arguments , by asking questions and listening to other arguments .

This is of great importance within processes of competition .
Also , the delineation of arguments , describing facts and processes is better done if students have a comprehensive knowledge of their subjects rather than learned pure facts .

What is needed for understanding of facts is the context .
The meaning of a fact in most cases only becomes clear if the fact is contextualized .

Being critical of something also is a very important precondition for research activities .
Being critical is only possible if
