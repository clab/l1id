Today every fifth person in the world has a car which he calls his own , that 's what the statistic tells us in the daily news .
To have a car means not necessarily to have a drivers licence but a high number of car owners have one .

At the moment we are in 2006 and the price for one liter of disel petroil costs about one Euro and eight cent in Germany .
Let 's switch to 2026 , 20 years later , the question which will be asked is , are there fewer cars in use than there are today .
What could be reasons for driving no more cars in twenty years .

In 20 years the petroil prices will be raised enormous because oil gets more and more rare .
And if it gets rare it gets more expensive .
Only less people could pay a much higher price for petroil than they do today .
Where do we get petroil from .
New inventions like the solar car would be great to have at that time .
No more petroil , only sun .
I think that will be a great opportunity to drive cars in 20 years .
But does it work .
If the climate changes as fast as it changes at the moment you ca n't be sure that this theory works well .

Cars get more and more expensive .
New inventions , new designs , new colours , new sizes , new models ...
How could we pay for that .
In Germany people have less and less money to pay for cars .
Cars will get more and more a luxury product and only people with an high income and with less children or no children can afford a car .

The unemlpoyment rate grows more and more , in 20 years we will have a lot of unemployed people around the wold .
On one hand you have poor people who never can afford a car , on the other hand you have unemployed people who will get poor after a short period of time , so it 's a vicious circle , loose your job , have less money , get poor and we are at the point where you ca n't afford a car .

In my opinion we will have a great barrier between those who can afford a car and drive a car and them who ca n't buy cars to drive .
Those who have money will be able to buy the new luxury good like a car will be at that time , but these people show a minority of the world 's population .

So as a result I would say that in 20 years there will be fewer cars than today because of prices of petroil , the stronger environment rules , the unemployment situation and the not available people who could buy cars .

In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are tody !
