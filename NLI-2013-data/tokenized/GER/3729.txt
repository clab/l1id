Helping in communities

Helping in communities is very important four young people because it makes them more reponsible .
It also can help them to find their sense in life and to feel useful .
On the other hand , I agree with the statement that young people today do not give enough time to help their communities .
They have not enough time to do so , they do not identify with their communities and the work is not sait to be fun .

Firstly , there is very much pressure put on young people to be sucessful in school .
In our society , it is often more appreciated to have good marks than to help other people .
Mostly , colleges do not care about the privat and social life of students but about their marks in school .
Therefore , it seem to be more important to students to work for school than to help other people .
Due to this , there is not much time left to spend on helping other people .

Secondly , young people often do not have a very close relationship to their communities .
On reason for this is that people change the towns thez are living in quite often .
For example , if parents find an other jod in an other town , they will take thier children with them and the whole familiy will move away .
If this happens often , the children cannot devellop a close relationship to their communities .
For this reason young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .

Thirdly , young people want to have fun in their free-time .
If you ask a young boy whether he preferes spending his time playing football or to go out with frinds or to help an old woman , he will surely answer that he likes to play rather than to help .
We live in a sociaty that supplies having fun .
I believe that this is an other reason why young people do not give enough time to help their communities .

Due to these reasons , I believe that young people do not spend enough time on helping in their communities .
I hope that this fact will change in future .
