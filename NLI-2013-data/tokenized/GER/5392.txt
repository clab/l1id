I agree with the statement that advertisements often make the product appear better than it really is -- but I would claim that this is hardly surprising if one considers the function of advertisement .
Basically , advertisement serves two purposes : to inform the consumer of the product 's existence , and to motivate him or her to purchase the product .
The advertiser 's intention is to sell the product , not to provide comprehensive details about pros and cons .
Thus , advertisement will aways focus on the positve aspects of a product and omit any negative ones .
Truth-in-advertising laws and consumer protection organizations will prevent fraudulent claims and gross misrepresentations of the true product , but advertisements usually still take a few liberties .
A famous example is a scene from the movie `` Falling Down '' in which the main character is enraged by the fact that a fast food restaurant depicts a hamburger as large and succulent , while the product he gets is flattened , mushy and disgusting .
Of course , the film exaggerates , but seldom does one find processed food to look as appealing in reality as it does in adverts or on boxes .
Usually , small notices such as `` serving suggestion '' exempt the manufacturer from liability .

Another means by which products are made to look better in advertisements is the modification of context .
For example , many car adverts show the car driving at high speed through a desert or such , with the driver being completely relaxed and casual .
While this makes the car look more appealing , reality with its speed limits and heavy traffic makes it unlike that one will actually max out the vehicle in such a manner .

This all might seem like a consumer watchdog 's nightmare , but one must always bear in mind the function of advertisement , as I have already mentioned .
It just is , by definition , a one-sided view with a certain purpose -- selling .
To assume it to be something else -- a valid , unbiased source of information -- would be fallacy .
It remains the consumers ' responsibility to compare and evaluate , based on independent reviews and the like , when choosing a product .
