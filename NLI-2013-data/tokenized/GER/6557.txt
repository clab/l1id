The mobility of society is a topic which is often discussed : in newspapers , in politics , but also among friends .
Should there be less cars to decrease pollution ?
Yes , there should , but in my opinion this will not happen in the next twenty years .
On the contrary , I think that the numbers of cars in the world will stay the same or probably even increase .
Different reasons such as the need for mobility , improved road conditions , a better economic situation in developing countries and the growth rate of the population will lead to a constant or even higher amount of cars .

First of all , mobility is one of the most important points for modern society .
Also in twenty years , this wish for mobility will still going on .
People still want to be mobile , to reach everything within a shortest time period .
As it is , cars are the fastest medium of transportation , at least for short distances .
Thus , the majority will not be willing to give up his or her car only to decrease pollution .

In Switzerland , there is a lively discussion about improving and extending roads to absorb all the traffic .
Also in other countries , these measurements are of high interest .
If there are more and better planned roads and therefore less traffic jams , even more people will think about buying a car and using it to reach for example their work place .

Considering developing countries , they hopefully will have improved their situation in twenty years at least a little bit .
Less poeple will live in poverty , and more will be part of the middle class .
This positive development also leads to a higher demand of cars , because a car is a symbol for having enough money .
In developing countries it is even more important for people to show how much they earn and therefore to climb the social ladder .

Finally , the simple fact that the world population in the whole is growing indicates that there will be more car owners in the future than now .

The growing demand for mobility in Western countries as well as the longer the more in developing countries leads to a higher number of cars in the world .
This development is supported by the fact that a lot of countries are thinking of expanding their road system .
Thus , it cannot be thought about a decreasing amount of cars in the future .
