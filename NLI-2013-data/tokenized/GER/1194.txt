I think that it is better to have broad knowlegde of many academic subjects because there are many reason for this .

First , I think if you have broad knowlegde of many academic subjets you will have a better chance for a job in the future life .
Companys or firms will search people who have a big knowlegde of many subjects .
Also this people have the ability to help in many departments .
So for example , if they have had varios ecnomic subjects they can work in every department of the firm or company .

Secondly if you have broad knowlegde of many academic subjects it is good for yourself .
You save the feeling that you have learn a lot and that this what you learned can help you in many situation of your futher life .
So for example you can help people which needs any statement from you .

Thirdly I think it is very busy to have many academic subjects because you have a lot to learn .
So maybe you have n't got the time to meet your friends , to do some sport activities or something else .

There are also people who prefer it to specialize in one specific subject , but in my opinion I think that these people are n't interested in other subjects and maybe they have n't got the interest to learn .
They more likely to meet friends or do sport activities .
For these people personality life like the hobbys a sport acativities or meet friends are more important than the broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

In addition , to have a broad knowlegde of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject I think because it helps you in many situations as like in your job or personal situations .
