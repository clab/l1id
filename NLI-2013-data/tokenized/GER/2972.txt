Although much people may agree with this statement I disagree with it for several reasons .
The first point is that there are no reasons to support this statement .
Why should an older person enjoy life less than younger people ?
Older humans have the same possibilities to enjoy life as younger do .
They are able to go shopping , to go to cinema or whatever they want .

Furthermore I may say that older people enjoy life more than younger do because generally they have more money and know exactly what they want .
Because I am young I have to try out what I like and what I dislike .
For example , if I travel to Austria and after the first three days I realize that I do not like this country .
In this situation the whole holiday will be bad .
If I had been older , I would have known that and would not been traveled there .

It is also the fact that older people are having more pastime when they are free from working .
So they have much more time to do what they want .
Due to this they would enjoy their life more than younger people which still have duties like going to school or working .
Moreover , younger people are stressed more often because they want to have success in their jobs or in school .
So , even if there is time to do something enjoyable , they just will not do this because they are too stressed .

The third reason why I disagree with this statement is because of my own experiences .
Nearly all the older people I know are enjoying their life very much .
My mother is an example for that .
Since she is older than fifty , she is more often in bars and clubs than I am .
She also has many friends and enough money to do whatever she wants .

My last point deals with the danger of deseases in age .
I do not think that this fact consequently prevents older people from enjoying their life .
In my opinion , knowing that life is short and may also end in the next years is an argument for enjoying life .
In that situation people perhaps will care about their time and use it as well as possible .

In the end I think that older people may enjoy their life even more than younger people do .
