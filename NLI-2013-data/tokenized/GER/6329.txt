In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that are today !

This is kind of complicated question , which deals with an complex answer based on different levels .

First of all , I will give a short introduction into the present situation of cars and their numbers in the world , because in my opinion it is necessary for the whole part of that complex .
After that I will give you pro and contra arguments for each thesis .
And in conclusion , I will summarize the facts , I pointed out .
Through the present paper my focus will be Germany , because a wider concentration would be too long and too complex for that essay .

Since the development of cars in the end of the 19th century and beginning 20th century by famous people like Henry Ford , cars have become an important fact and enormous increase .

In Germany cars are the most used and most important transport system , and it has actually an great effect on economy , too - e.g. think about the importance of car export in Germany .

First of all , an argument pro more cars in use in future bases on statistical phenomena .
Since the 1950s in Germany and other Western civilizations there 's an great increase of cars by nearly 5 % or more each year .
It indicates an increase in the future .

In opposite , some people say , the world or every certain region is economical limited , that means there 's no space for an unlimited increase .

Second , people say the techniques , computers and high-level knowledge become more important and will be more specialized , too .
That has a great effect to the car production , what , hence , has an effect to the number of cars , too .

In opposite , if the ecomony will grow and if the high-technique will grow , there will be an another development , which replaces cars .

Third , the more population is in Germany or in the wolrd , the more cars will be used .

But of course we know there 's a stagnation of German 's population , nowadways .

This are the major points and there are of course , a lot of more social , political and environmental aspects , too .

In conclusion , I guess there will be a balance of the cars in use and there will not be a large increase than today .
