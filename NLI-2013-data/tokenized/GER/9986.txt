It is common opinion , that successful people have to try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
When I think of a successful discovery , the first thing that comes to my mind is the discovery of America .
Christopher Columbus tried to find a new sea way to India .
But instead of finding a cheaper and better connection to India , he discovered America by accident .
He took the risk of failure , because many people believed , that there can just exist one possible seaway .
The thesis , that the earth is a plate and not a globe , supported their idea .
Instead of taking the usual , common way , Christoph Columbus tried to risk something new and succeeded in the end .
But at the same time , new experiements and ideas ma also turn into a catastrophy .
One example can be the invention of nuclear weapons .
Einstein did not intend to destroy the world with his discovery .
But if a new invention or knowledge gets into the wrong hands , it can also be used an evil way .
Atomic bombs are now used to destroy life instead of secure it .
Another reason , why past traditions , ideas and ways are as equal important as new discoveries and inventions is the learning aspect .
People have to learn from their failures and mistakes , in order to succeed further .
However , some things can only develope when they had been already experienced before .
In this way , people could discover their positive and negative aspects .
We need the knowledge and the traditions of the past in order to find new and easier ways .
At the one hand , it is important to develope new ideas to achieve success .
But at the other , people are just able to learn , when they understand and observe past ideas and thesis .
