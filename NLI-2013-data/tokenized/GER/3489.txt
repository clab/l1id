The first questions that comes to my mind after reading that statement is `` Did people in the past spend more time helping their communities ? ''
.
To answer that question we should take a short look at the society in earlier times .
A hundred years ago the communties where much smaller than these days .
300 years ago there was no supermarket in small villages .
People had to work together to survive .
The farmer had to grow food , the tailor had to produce clothes .
Everyone was interested in getting the best out of what they were doing .
Therefore they often contributed something to help their community .
That has changed .
Today a lot of people do n't really care about their neighbors and/or surroundings .
For example we have a big house with 6 floors .
20 Families are living in this house .
The house is very dirty inside , when you step outside you can find dog 's excrements everywhere .
Neighbors call the police all the time , because they think their neighbor is too noisy .
Here we can see that even in a small community like the house in my example is not working together .
They are not helping eachother and instead try to make life harder for everyone around .
The country Germany is another example for a community .
We have many different provinces in this country and they usually do n't work together that much .
Every province tries to get the best result for themselves , but instead of doing that through helping other provinces and contributing something to the community they just try to get the most amount of money they can .
So why is it that people nowadays do not spend a lot of time to help their communities ?
We all know that people have the time .
People watch many hours T.V. everyday due to boredom .
They could use that time to help the community .
The problem is that a lot of people do n't feel responsible for their community anymore .
They see that the house is dirty , but they are not willing to do anything about it .
Either because they think `` I 'm not going to do it , someone else can do it. '' or they think `` If nobody is cleaning it , why should I ? ''
.
A way to solve this issue could be to encourage people to contribute something for their community and make life better for everyone .
