The question whether is it more important to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in just one specific subject is not easy to answer .

Personally , I am the opinion that a broad knowledge is worth more than a narrow but specialized knowledge .
However , the business world calls for specialists all the time .
Back in the past allrounders were highly appreciated but nowadays there are just a few left .
Well , this does not apply in general but at least to the business I know , the law business .
As a lawyer it is necessary to be specialized to ensure one achieves the best solution for the client .

But still , I believe that broad knowledge opens new horizons .
Now I am not only referring to business but also to private life .
Having knowledge in various areas also means to have more information .
Information one can use to make up one 's mind and to see things in a totally new perspective .
This actually is why I believe broad knowledge is worth so much .
Only with this knowledge it is possible to understand different cultures , to enjoy foreign music , arts or simply to have an interestin talk with the neighbor who comes from a different country .
With these new possibilities a totally new world is offered to the ones that are open to information on different subjects .
And get back to business : who does really want to talk to a lawyer who only understands the law but not the real problem ?
I does not .
Therefore I am the opinion that broad knowledge is more important to to be specialized on just one subject .
Although , it is not easy to obtain knowledge in different fields , if one has a full-time job , it is worth to spend the spare-time to gather information on other topics and subjects , provided one is interested in them .

Summarized I can say , that I try not to become to specialized too early and to obtain a broad knowledge .
I think it is very important .
