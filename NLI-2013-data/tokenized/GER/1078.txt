In my opionion this statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is wrong .
I think it is better to have a specialized knowledge , because we live in a time where knowledge gets more and more specialized .

In school you can see this argument good , because zou first learn the basics of a method and then it gets more and more specialized .
For example you first learn plus and minus in math and later on it gets more and more complex .

Maybe it is good to have a broad konwledge later in life , because than you can expand on more fields , for example in your job .
But as you can see there is more unemployment than before , because companys need less poeple to work on the machines .
At this point it is good to have a specalized knowledge , because you are different form all the others , who are looking for a job .
So specific knowledge let you stand out and helps you to get a better job .
This is an argument for this , but it has it 's disadvantages , too .

If the job you specified on is already given to somebody with the same field of knowledge , it could bring up problems , because you field of study is very popular and there are not much jobs you could choose from .

This is one argument for the broad knowledge .
But broad knowledge does n't let you stand out form the masses .
This is why you have to balance your knowledge between broad and specific knowledge .

But there are ways to study something specialized and get a good job or a variety to choose from .
This is made by just looking up statistics and looking up which job needs personal .
Another way to solve that problem is to look up if you job is needed in a different state or country and apply for this on if you got the money .

But the best solution is to balance the specific and the broad knowledge , but in mzy opinion it is still better to have a specialized knowledge before you have a broad knowledge .
