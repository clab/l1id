I do agree on the statement that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities .
I would saz the word nowadays could be taken out .
I can tell you from my personal expierience that this is not a new story .
I was as well not a good kid in regards of helping our community .
I always had the feeling that I do not have enough time to help .

When I came home from school , I did my homework and than I went to my sport classes .
I just was part of the group and went home again .
I also wanted to spend time for doing nothing and just relax a little bit .
There was not enough time to do something else .

Now I know that this is not true , as a kid you have a lot of time to do something for your community .
I did only realize this when I began to work and I saw that I will have not that much time in future .

I think the young people have the same problems as I had .
They would like to spend their time for something more important for themselves .
They do not realize that helping others would bring any benefits for them .
Therefore it is not only the fault of the young people that they do not taking some time to spend with their community , it is as well a problem of communication Due to the fact that only adults could communicate from their own experience , it is their responsibility to take action .
Parents and teacher should talk the ownership on this and get the young people up to speed .
If the parents would explain how important the communities will be for the future of their kids .
There will be more interaction with the community alrady .

Teacher should raise this issue in their schools and maybe implement some community activities in their schedule .
So that all kids could learn more about their communities and see by themselves that it is an important thing , so they will continue to participate in future activities .

In conclusion , I would like to make the clear statement that everybody is responsible to help our communities and we should not pointing with the fingers to others .
