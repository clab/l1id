When we reading the newspaper in the morning , watching TV or walking along a mall we indirect recognize that the numbers of advertisments increasing .
All these advertisments promise that this product will be the best and will makes you successfull and provide you a comfortable life .

The question is , if the promises will get real ?

Short time ago I read an article of an bulb supplier .
This brand supplier promised that the bulb which this company produces are have a better quality , a higher lifecycle and the efficency is any percent higher than all competitive products .
In order to save energy I trust this ad and bought a lot of these bulbs and I payed more than for a competitor product .
I was happy to get a high quality product .
A few days later the first bulb was defect .
I brougth it not back to the store beacuse it is more expensive to drive to the store .

A few day later I met a friend .
He told me that he visited the factory which produces these bulbs .
He explained that millions of bulbs where produced and the last process of the production is the brand stamp on the glass and the packaging .

He explained that the same produced bulb will get different brand or noname stame and will get different packaging boxes .
This means that the same produced product , with the same quality and the same effectivity will be sold with a higher brand price and a lower noname price .
I checked the different brands and noname products he told me and found out that only the price has a difference .

As conclusion of this I will no more trust any advertisments .
Advertisements are designed to sell products .
They promising a lot but not the truth .
