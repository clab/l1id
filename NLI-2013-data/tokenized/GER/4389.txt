I agree with the statement that most advertisements overexagerate the qualitiy of products .
This trend can be found in all varities of ads , including print , film and audio .
Some examples where advertisments make products seem much better than they really are include , but are not limited to the following :
Laundry detergants and cosmetical articles are often shown in ads , where the effects of their use are made to look much better than they actually are .
Weight loss products and exercising equipment are commonly advertised by using before-and-after pictures of people , who deliberatly gained body mass over a short period of time and thus allowing them to regain their ideal body weight easily in a short time .

Also professional athelets are used to promote certain articles , creating the impressions that the application of the product led to the results and not the years of hard work and traditional exercise .

Today , where consumers use tools such as the internet or magazines to research the qualities of a product , such as consumer reports or the J.D. Power survey , exageration has lost some of it potential for persuading consumers , as long as the customer is carefull about not making impulsive desicisons to purchase a product .

Exageration is not in all cases used to mislead the consumer , but also as an intrument to point out certain features or qualities of a product , that might not be notable at first sight , for example a refinement in a recipe or an increased package size .
This is also used when there are only slight variation with an competitive product , for example fuel - efficency with cars , calories in hamburges , or interest rates in the financial world .

If an advertisement with great exageration is used , its a humoerous way to make the consumer remember the product .
In conclusion exageration is used to point out qualities of a product , make it stand out from competitors , create an memeroable ad , or even mislead the consumer about the products qualities and benefits .
