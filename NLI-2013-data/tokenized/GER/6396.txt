It is widely considered as a fact that the number of cars in use will decline during the next twenty years .
But this theory is only true for the developed world and not for the world as a whole .
It will be pointed out in the course of this essay why this is true for the developed world and - more important - why the total number of cars in use on this planet will continue to rise .

At first , the question arises why people tend to think that the number of cars in use will decline during the next twenty years .
As the people and especially the politicians in the developed world tend to give more importance to environmental issues , it becomes obvious that cars account for heavy air pollution .
Therefore , mass transportation systems as trains or buses are likely to be able to attract more customers than they are now .
Additionally , it is likely that those mass transportation systems will receive more financial aid from the government making them more attractive for the customers .
As a result of that development , people living in those developed countries will need less cars .

But nevertheless , the amount of cars in use in the world as a whole will continue to rise .
New concepts and developments in the field of energy are currently developed by car manufacturers all over the world and they will make petroleum-based fuel obsolete .
Some new cars as the Toyota Prius already use some of the new concepts .

The last and maybe most significant argument for the theory of an increasing number of cars is the on-going process of globalisation which results in a higher level of development in countries as China , India , Brasil or Indonesia .
Today , most inhabitants of those countries cannot afford buying a car .
As those people get more money out of their job as a result of globalisation , they will develop the same needs which people of developed countries have today - driving into the countryside , visit friends in other cities , making holidays , etc .
And due to their increasing income , they will soon be able to buy cars .
As the number of inhabitants in those developing countries is enormous ( more than 2bn people in China and India combined ) , the number of cars in use is likely to rise .

To conclude this argumentation , it is highly unlikely for the numbers of cars in use to decline .
Especially the growing demand for cars in the developing countries as China and India will bring the number of cars in use to a new record level .
