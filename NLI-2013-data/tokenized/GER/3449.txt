Unfortunately I do not spend much time helping my community , but I admire everyone who does it and try to support these people in other ways ( e.g. donations ) .
There are many reasons for young pepole to spend time helping their community .
Some of them are listed below .

On the one hand a commonly held view is that there is a growing solitude within our society an young people are looking for a family an friends .
In Germany every second marriage is being divorced and many children grow up in torn families .
But as children need support and a person they can admire and they can identifiy with , they sometimes look for this support outside their family .
Therefore , there should be a growing number of young people joining organisations as the red cross or the local fire department .

On the other hand , one has to constate that there is a growing lack of time that hinders young people to join these organizstions .
Due tu a sharpening competition within society and due to a sinking number of job offerings , children and young people might be forced to qualifiy on a vide range of sectors .
In order to get a got job nowadays , you have to be excellently educated , speak 2 languages , have a lot of job expererience , be very young and pass at minimum one year abroad .
As a consequence it seems more attractive for young people to spend their time maximizing their chances of getting a good job than to spend time helping their communities .

Another point to consider is that helping community often goes with a job which is not only requiring time but which is also not paid .
It seems easier to do a job in a company .
In a company you get paid for your work and it might be useful for your curriculum vitae having worked for that company .
Nevertheless , our society needs people who work volunteerently in order to support their community .
When your house burns you will be glad that some people work volunteerently for the lokal fire department , even though it is not useful for their curriculum vitae .

To sum up , there are various reasons for young pepole to give or to not give time to helping their communities .
My view is that there are still enough young people being engaged for their community and doing this for a number of different reasons .
As this work is very important for a society you should be very grateful these people spend their time helping their communities .
