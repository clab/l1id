This question is really important not only for people who are planning and starting studies at a college or university but also for people already working in a specific area .

In my eyes you should specialize in a specific subject as soon as possible .
There are a lot of academic areas you can study so at first you have to identify that one that fits best to your personal interests .
When you are intersted in maths for example it does not make a lot of sense to study literature .
So at that point you have to make the first specialization .
In my eyes that will help you to succeed in your studies because you are learning something about topics you are really interested in .

After finishing studies the process of specialization continues .
When you have studied business for example I think it does not make a lot of sense to search a job where you have to apply the whole knowledge you have collected during your studies .
You will lack the propper knowledge to perform difficult tasks which will lead to failure and in the worst case you will loose your job .

Therefore I think after finishing business studies for example you have to specialize again an maybe search for a job in the marketing or controlling departement of a company .
Even when you now work in a specific area , the process of specializing should still continue .
To become a successful employee for example I think you now must become a specialist in specific tasks of the area you are working in .
When you are working in the marketing departement of a consulting company for example you could specialize to the marketing of chemical products .

In my eyes these steps of specializing in a specific subject are the best way to become not only successful in your job but also help you to divide the important informations from the unimportant ones .
Altough you should not lack a propper knowledge about other academic topics you have to specialize in order to be not provided with a overload of informations you can not handle with .
