I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

To my mind , the main reason for this is that today in the age of mass production there exists a graet variety of products that all want to be sold .
Selling a product makes it important to draw the attention of people to it .
This aim is normally achieved by using exaggerations in the advertisments of products .

For example , advertisements often state that a certain lotion makes look one 's skin ten years younger by taking away all wrinkels .
I actually do not believe that this can be achieved just by the use of a certain lotion .
A lotion might help to moisturize your skin and by this make it more soft , but I do not believe that it is able to make you look ten years younger .
This is a typical exaggeration often used in an advertisement that makes the product seem to be much better than is in reality .

Furthermore , people 's attention in our hectic world is usually drawn to so many things at the same time that an advertisement that just gives us clear information on a product will not help the product to be sold successfully .
Most of the products advertised in TV .
The cost of this type of advertisement depend on how long the product is shown .
Thus time often will be rare und used in a way that draws the attention of the audience very quickly .
The easiest way to do this , is to make people believe that the product is much better than all the other products that it could be compared to it .
This goal is normally achieved by telling people something about the producht that makes it seem better than it is in reality .

At least , all the means of our modern media society makes products often seem better than they are in reality by proposing them in a certain light or colour .

This is why I want to state that in conclusion that one should not believe everything presented in advertisements .
