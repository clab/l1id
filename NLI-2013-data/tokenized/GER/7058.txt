The amount of cars will certainly decrease within the next twenty years due to both economical and ecological facts .
Oil has become more and more expensive due to many reasons .
The wars , which are held because of the oil certain countries have will steadily influence the prices in the future .
The weapons need to be financed , which force but and also enable certain countries to receive as much money as possible and save wherever they can .
This will lead to the raising of taxes and , predominently , of oil prices .
The citizens will try to change their means of transportation by using trains , buses or even bicycles .

In major cities , traffic jams cause people to lose a large amount of their time , when trying to get to work in the morning , or even travelling around their country during school holidays .
Soon many people will realize the other type of convenience : when arriving at a certain place without the negative aspect of having dealt with a great amount of stress moments before .

Another problem , which the people will be faced with , is the pollution the cars produce when being run with normal fuel .
It is certain , that the Ozone Layer is being damaged daily and soon the people will become confronted with the effects this will have on their direct environment .
In this case , the sollution could be using fuel from plants .
But the gas stations , which offer this specialty cannot be found easily , especially when one is dealing with an emergency of a broken down car due to lack of fuel .

The conclusion is that many people will slowly realize how switching from cars to other transportation will positively effect their lives and their environment .
They will not only be able to be more flexible due to more time spent with not having to wait on highways but also realize , how much money can be saved by not having to be dependent upon raising oil prices .
