Today , our communites and cities suffer under a large variety of problems .
Often this problems are money based problems , but they are also suffering under the lack of activies of yopung people .
I think the youth of today takes less care about hepling their communities .
So , ask your self , why are our ccommunities so dirty , or why there are less socuial activities of young people in our cities , and why it seemed so that nowadays youth is more selfish .

When you take a look to some public playgrounds , you will find them in very bad conditions .
They are so dirty that they can not be used by toddler or tiny tots .
In most cases theses places are dirty because young people misuse this place for hanging around and distroy them .
This is an evident , for mine , that they don not appreciate the communitie 's playground .
So , they do n't help the communitie .

Also , the youth has got less social activities .
They do n't help older people or do other important social work in ther neighborhood .
And , when they do n't to such important mentioned tasks , they scarce care about the need of a communitie .

And finally , todays youth has become more selfish , the rest of society as well , but especially young people want to reap their benefits .
They take all benfits and goods from other they are able to get , but do n't want it to pay something back .
For them , the communitie count much , often the communitie is indiffernt to them .
Also the do n't build up any identification with their home town .

By and large , it seems to that every thing goes down the drain .
There are server problems in our societies , and they are difficult to solve .
But I am quit sure that we will mange this problem and that this will change .
