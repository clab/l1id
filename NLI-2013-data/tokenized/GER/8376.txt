The question if it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts has been discussed already quite often .
In my opinion it is of greater importance for students to understand ideas and concepts .
The main reason for studying , espacially if seen from a humanistic perspective , is to learn how to think freely , put questions and understand the concept of a subject .
Although facts might be crucial in professional life , every single job will probably require the knowledge of special different facts .
For example a businesswoman will work in a consulting company while the her former study collegue will work in a bank .
It is just impossible to include all facts which are needed in a curriculum of a career .
Therefore it is unavoidable that every newcomer has to get into the demands of a job individually and often start learning from scratch .

As I have seen e.g. in my history classes you will very likely forget some facts but you will never forget the broad idea , for example the reasons for a war or for the rise of the Nazis .
This is much more important to know than to remember every date or the exact sequence of some Engish kings .

This leads me to my next point .
When you study the idea of a subject you also learn the ability of how to do research and where to find facts .
Therefore I think it is not fundamental to know every fact but rather to know where you can find the fact .
Several people go as far as stating that it is actually not important at all what kind of content you learn at university , but that you learn how to do research , how to write papers , how to solve academic problems and how to work without being told every single step like in school .
But this is definitly only true for the humanities and not for professions like doctors or physicians .

To summarize , I prefer studying concepts and ideas because I think it will help me to develop more important and sustainable skills than just facts .
