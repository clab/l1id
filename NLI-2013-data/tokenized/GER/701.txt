When people decide to increase their knowledge , they decide either to do this on one specific subject or the choose to extent their knowledge in different areas .
In can be argued that in nowadays steady growing and changing industry a broad knowlegde is essential to adapt to the ever changing market .
I am also a proponent of a broad knowledge of m academic subjects .

Firstly , business is changing at a rapid pace .
Numerous jobs that have been there for years , and have given labour to people are beeing subsecidiced by machines .
For instance , if a worker only knows how to do a task that can now be done by a machine , the worker would probably loose his work , due to the fact that for most companies machienes are more efficient .
What other job could he apply for if he only had the knowledge needed for one kind of labour .
Replacement of human labour force for machienes is something which happens frequently nowadays , due to the evolving technology .
In fact , many people have reacted to this by extending their academic knowledge .
This brings them the advantage , of easily adapting to chanching circumstances in the commercial world and they will less fear changes in their profession .

Secondly , I favor a broad knowledge because it it is less boring .
Specification can bring along boredom over a long term .
For example , if someone has only one task to rely on , in order to keep him satisfied with his work and knowledge , he might get tired of the routine , ascribed to his work .
He could not easily switch into another field , without educating himself all over again .
He would might have to attend extra courses to learn about a new field of interest .
If he had extented his knowledge to different subjects in his academic career , he would not need extra courses or even a new formation .

To conclude , having a broad knowledges is more favourable to nowadazs market , its rapid changes and new innovations .
Furthermore , it is key to keep oneself satisfied in his or her labour life , since routine sometimes is a critical factor for unsatisfaction .
