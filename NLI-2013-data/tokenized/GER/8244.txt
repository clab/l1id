I agree that it is more important for students to understand abstract ideas and concepts , because their college education should give them a sound base of knowledge and not a mass of unrelated facts .

Most students want to work at a company after they graduate .
If they had only learned facts in college there is the possibilty that they wo n't need most of these facts .
The college can not teach all of the diverse facts that are needed for a student to be an efficient worker .
It would be better for him to learn concepts in college and learn many facts later , when he needs them for his work .
So , when you study electronics , and you learned every fact about building personal computers , and later came to a factory that builds car computers , most of the facts you learned may be useless , but the concepts of creating a computer in general may come in very handy .

Furthermore students who know the concepts and ideas can connect and thus better understand all the facts they may learn later on because they know how everything is related .
For example , if a student with business major only learned facts about , say , Germany , and not the concept that stands behind those facts , he might never be able to fully understand them , or to see that facts he learned about Brazil can be compared to them .

Another argument is that facts can be easily accessed through a book or even the internet just at the time they are needed .
It would take much more time or even be impossible , to `` understand '' an concept just when needed .
The student probably would n't even know which concept ist needed , because he would not be able to see the larger picture .
For example , if a biology student in America has the task to build a fish tank with exotic fish , and he had learned what `` normal '' fish need , and how a fish tank works in college , he could just look up the differences between exotic and `` normal '' fish on the internet , or ask a colleague .
If , on the other hand , he had no clue about the complex workings in a fishtank , he might not be able to complete his task at all .

Of course studying human anatomy or history may require more learning of facts than other sciences , like mathematics .
But I think that the advantages of learning concepts and ideas much overweight the advantages of learning facts in general .
