I agree to the statement , that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them learn facts .

First of all , the motivation of learning should be to know the things , to fulfill the thirst of knowledge .
This ambition should be the reason , why somebody decides to study at an university .

Second , if somebody learns only facts , it will be even harder to keep the facts .
The human memory has evolved by nature in order to better survive on this planet .
At these times it was helpful to understand ideas and concepts , for example , understanding nature in favour to use it .

Therefore the human is not suited to learn facts , in comparison to the computer .

It could be asked , why students have to learn facts at all ?
The reason is simple .
Facts are needed to be present in the mind to construct or to follow a theory as much as bricks and stones are needed to construct an house .
If students do n't learn any facts , they ca n't follow any theory , which rely on facts .

Therefore it is neccessary to learn facts , but the motivation for it should be to understand ideas and concepts .
Learning facts has to be viewed like a tool , which some people like to use and some people do n't , but the reason to use the tool does n't lie in the tool itself .

As I described above , the human mind is not intended to learn facts .
But to develop a complicated theory , it is neccessary to know facts .
Therefore the society created rewards for using learning facts .
A teacher rewards a student , if he learns well and if he learns facts accurately .

Some students are attracted so much by these rewards , that they only learn facts to achieve the reward .
Everybody of us experienced them in the school class , where some pupils learned very ambitiously and accurately , but it was easy to see , that they prefered receiving the reward instead of satisfying their thirst of knowledge .

As a solution to this phenomena at school , I propose to reward the understanding of ideas and concepts much more then just learning the facts .
The pupils need the discipline to the learn facts , but they also need to see , why the are learning them .
