I disagree with the statement , that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , but actually I can understand the the people , who suppurt it , either .
If you consider young people nowadays , they always tend to be hanging around and avoid doing things , which might be useful at all , not considering , whether it is useful for them or for anyone else .
I must admit , that there are youngsters , who live according to that .
But on the other hand , you have to look for the reasons , why young people are acting like this .
One reason might be , that there is not the appropriate offer in the communities the people live in , which depends on the community itself .
Another reason could be the identification with the people 's hometown , which , in my opinion is strictly related to the size of the community .
Because in smaller communities every person knows every other person so the social reward , is much greater , when people recognize your work .
Furthermore people work together in the communities , who know each other for the whole time of their life , which brings along a complete different kind of motivation .

On the other hand , it is very important to consider the expectations other institutions have on the student as well .
And there are quite a lot of institutions apart from communities , like schools , sports clubs , family and of course friends , respectively the partner .

Young people want to be succesful in school to have the oppurtunity to apply for a good job later , they want to have a hobby they can spend time on and the family and of course friends also want to be part of your life .
If it is quite difficult to handle all these things successful on their own , then it is hardly applicable to fulfill a further task .

Nevertheless it is possible to give time to help your community by declaring it as your hobby , if you find something , which you really enjoy to do .
In my case , I had also the opportunity to help my community , even full-time : one year ago I worked 10 hours a day , five days a week for one year in the civil service as a driver for retarded and elderly people .
By the way , this was a very interesting experience , I will never forget .
