As I am studying business management at the university in Bayreuth I am specialized on one specific academic subject .
But many people ask me what I would do if I do not get a job in a company or need knowledge of another subject to fullfill a new job .
So is it better to have a broad knowlege of academic subjects than to specialize in a specific one ?

Well , I do not think so .
Of course , if you have a broad knowledge of different things you are not so much restricted to a certain job .
You might know a lot of things other people might not know .
Nevertheless , what kind of jobs will you get ?
Maybe you are able to work for a lot of different companies or do something on your own but the jobs you can get will always be in a lower position as you are missing the necessary background information to fullfill the complete range of tasks of this job .

One might say that if you are specialized on a certain topic it is hard to get another job .
This might be true , but why should you even look for another job ?
You are specialised on your subject because you think it is the best for you and you want to spend your lifetime with a job working in this special segment .
If you have enough knowlege in your subject you will soon reach a higher position as you have all the necessary background knowlegde to fullfill your entire tasks .

People who know more about their segment they are working in have more success and therefor live a happier life .
As Arthur Lassen said : `` Nothing will make you happier than to succeed in the things you love . ''

As a conclusion one has to say that specialized knowledge will help you much more to find an apropriate job .
Even if a broad knowledge could help you in different parts of your life , knowing more about your subject and going below the surface will lead to much more success and maybe even happyness .
