In a societey fixed on issues like youth and beauty , quite often people think that enjoying life is a matter of age , or better said a matter of not being old .
When you look at TV commercials for example , you will find it suprisingly hard to find older people enjoying a joy - ride in the new Range Rover rather than young and good looking adults .
On the other hand if there are reports about the elder it is mostly about poverty or illness , or other issues old people are likley to get in contact with .

But this is as many things in our society a misleading thought .
If one watches closer it is not that hard to find the complete oppsite of what was written befor .
A lot of old people actually enjoy their life , despite of the picture some might have of them .
On one hand they have got a lot of time because the do not have to work anymore and on the other hand they use that time much better as the generations before them .
A whole new market with special offers made exclusivley for elders has developed .
Sports , travelling or social work is part of that huge variety .
So enjoying your life is not a question of age rather than a question of willingness to do so .

There are of course a lot of older people who would call there life boring and not very enjoyable but you will find young people with the same opinion .
As a matter of fact the whole issue of enjoying life is a question of your finacial background as well .
It is obvious that for some older people it is hard to get along with their small pensions as it is for young unemployed or under qualified people .

Taking these idears together you will come to the conclusion that young people do not enjoy their lifes more the olders do or the other way around .
Being old is no reason to have less pleasure living , and being young is no free - ticket to happiness .

So basicly enjoying life is up to you , because if you are not making the best out of what you got , nobody will do .
