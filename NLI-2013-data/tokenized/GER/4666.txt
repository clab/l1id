Advertising products is very important for the companies and without doing it , the chance of making a big profit is a slim one .
You can see and hear commercials almost everywhere , if it 's on Television , radio or on the street .
But are the products really as good as they always look like in commercials ?
In my opinion they are not .
There are a few reasons why I think this way .

First , the food always looks so delicious on TV and advertisements , but if you go to the store or make them products by yourself it never looks like the picture on the package .
There it always looks shinier , everything seems to be seperated when they cook it and it seems to smell very good .
I heard before they use something to polish their products so it looks shinier , they also use only the best and good looking food and sometimes they even replace it with plastic imitations .
For example if they show you a delightful chocolate bar , it 's usually just a piece of plastic made look identical to the bar .
And if you buy it sometimes you might be disappointed , because it looks a lot different , it 's smashed or crumbly .

Second , cleaning products are not always as easy to handle as the Television shows it to their customers .
For example the new swiffer duster , which is a fluffy cotton pad on a plastic stick .
On TV the woman just takes one of those pads and sticks it on the plastic handle .
In my personal experience it took me quite a long time get it all together and even if it 's handier than the regular dust cloth it still does n't clean as good as the old method .

Finally , clothes are another major point in my suggestion that advertised products look better in commercials .
You always see them good looking women and men on TV that seem to have a perfect body for any kind of clothes .
When I go to the store and try the same ones on I usually get disappointed , because they do n't look nearly as good as they do on the models .

There are quite a few reasons why most products are n't as good as the ones in the advertisements .
But there are some that I bought and I am very satisfied with and do n't want to miss them in my house .
