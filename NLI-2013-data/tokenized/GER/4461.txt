If you ask me most advertisments make products seem much better than they really are !
Contemporary commercials are perfectly influencing a products success by connecting emotions , wishes and promises on the product .
Often the fame of celebrities or important events is used to enhance the products image .
And as a third point many promoted features you often don ' t need in daily use .

To connect products with emotions and promises could be as old as the history advertisment itself .
People are encouraged to buy a product because of these emotions and suggestions .
A commercial suggestivly promises you .
If you buy this kind of vodka you ' ll becpome invited for important parties and will meet beatiful people .
Advertisment promises that you ' ll be happy when you purchase .

Celebrities often promote products and brands become `` prime '' sponsors of for instance sports events .
People tend to connect these products to the famous properties of the celebrity or the event .
Typically brands try to find their clientel by choosing the appropriate sportsman or event to sponsor .

Very often many promoted features don ' t be needed in real life .
The so called innovative shaver by new technology basically makes the same job as an older one and the amazing highspeed or acceleration of a new sports car can ' t be driven because of the speed limits .

Altogether according to me successful advertisment has to heighten a products image because of the hard competition among many similar products of the selling market .
Furthermore the companies have to attract people to buy things and to refuse the old ones .
First of all this is a rule of our economic society and of course there more and more things around us to being purchased .
If you become a critical user and buyer you will detect all these mostly unwarranted `` heightened meanings '' .
