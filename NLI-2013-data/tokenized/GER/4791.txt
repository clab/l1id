I believe that it is true that most if not all advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
If we compare the number of products that are today in the market to the number of products sixty five years ago , we will notice that there is a noticeable growth .
Because of that , the competition has increased .
Producers have to come up with new ideas how to present their product in a way that is going to convince the buyer to choose their product and not any other that is on the market .
When they ca n't improve their product or if it is even to expensive to make an improvement , owners of companies decide to make their product look much better in the advertisement than it actually is .

Human beings are mainly stimulated when it comes to buying things by how a certain product looks .
For example , we can find a lot of shopping channels on TV .
The product is always presented in a perfect way .
Here we can see how the products are not just visually perfect but also perfect in the way they work .

A good example for this are exercise machines .
Lots of machines promisse you to develope a perfect body in a limited time frame .
For their advertisement they choose people in perfect shape that might not even use that product in real life .
But of course they claim how much that product has helped them to stay as fit and healthy as they are .
Another product similar to this one is a weight loss pill , which always promisses people weight loss in a short period of time without having to watch what they eat .

It is very dissapointing to watch how many people fall in to this traps , buying products and discovering later on that is was not what they believed they would be getting for their money .
