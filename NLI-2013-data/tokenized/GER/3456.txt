Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I will argue in favour of this statement by using several supporting aspects which are directly related to the topic .

One big reason why this statement is true , is that individualism and personal achievement concerning the own career are becoming the ultimate goal for everyone in society .
There is no time and room left to help old people , take care of children or foster public compounds .
Due to that increasing egotism , young people show a lack of responsibility and careness of their direct human counterparts in their nearby communities .

Modern art of life is strongly indicating that personal achievement is a must-have and a life surviving necessity to every young , ambitious and aspiring man or woman .
So if everyone is preoccupied by reaching his own goals , there is no progress of society anymore .
In fact , society would decrease and looses all its values or achievement it has reached over the centuries .
So individuality and egotism inevitably leads to a downgraded society and is a real danger to everyone living in this society .
So young people should spend more time by supporting society in a way each fits in best .

It is even a duty for young energetic people to supplement their power and vitality to support their surrounding community .
A equilibrium between helping communities and personal achievement must be reached by everyone .
But this must be taught bei the elder society members , and thus this message must be conveyed from top to bottom .
If the adults can ' t reach the young people no more , one must not wonder about the growing egotism and refusal to support local or federal community .

In my opinion this is a real problem to society and will preoccupy us a lot in the future .
The failures of the previous generations are now seen in their offspring .
