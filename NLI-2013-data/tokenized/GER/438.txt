In my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is definetly a very important advantage in life , but you should have also a broad knowlegde of other academic subjects , too .

It is necessary to know about other academic subjects to use your special knowlegde in an effective way .
For example , a manager has to know about much about politics , computer science and mathematics to use and handle his specific economic knowlegde .
If a manager only knows about economic , he could n't do a good job .

Another advantage of broad knowlegde is , to use it easy in your normal life .
It helps you having a good conversation with your business partners or other persons .
When you only know about your own specific subject , it is not possible to talk with other people about their problems or the news in TV .

On the other hand , concentrating on one special subject can help raising the career .
For a scientist , for example , it will be a good choice to concentrate on only one academic subject , because he hardly can use other knowlegde in his job .
When the scientist does n't get deep into his subject , he ca n't do a good job , because his task is , to find new things and think further than other people did before him .

Another advantage of specializing is , that you can be the best in your subject if you only concentrate on this one subject in your life .
It is not possible to be the best in computer science , when you are focussed on other subjects at the same time .

As a result , it depends on the person , his attitude and his job , what his best way of education is .
For some people the best way is , to have a broad knowledge , and other people should better specialize .

In my case , the best choice is to have a broad knowlegde , because i am still not quite sure about what i want to be in my life .
After making a decision i can still specialize on one specific subject to be good in my job .
