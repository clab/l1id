Knowledge is the biggest treasure that you can ever achieve .
But is it important to have a braod knowledge of many subjects or is it better to specialize in one specific subject .
You can earn more acknowledgement if you know as much as possible in one subject .
That can be explained in many reasons .

First , when you are a specialist in one subject , it is more possible to go deeper in the material .
You can do a scientific research and firgure out why are these or this problem .
With that knowledge it is possible to investigate things .
For example , if you are in the economic word you are able to understand what happens .
This could not work if you only know a few methods .

Second , people , which you make a academic conversation , have really more trust in you , when you have deeper knowledge .
When talking about the dollar 's weakness against the euro , it does not make sense to talk about it without that specific kwnowledge .
You are able to discuss and to investigate .
People almost ever argue to each other on a high level .

On the other hand having braod knowledge of many subjects can be puzzling sometimes .
Keep in mind that you have a lot of knowledge .
It could be difficult to explain something when you are not certain about the problem .

In conclusion i mean knowledge in one specialize subject is the best way .
You are a raelly specialist and you can always be certain what you are talking about .
Therefore people will have more trust in you .
