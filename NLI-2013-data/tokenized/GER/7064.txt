I do not agree with this statement .
Opposing , there will be even more cars than there are today .
People are more and more interested in status symbols ; therefore , they want bigger and better cars .
This is not only represented by the huge variety of possibilities we have to buy a car nowadays : we can hand in our old car and pay less for the new car bought at the same firm ; we can buy cars only used for exhibitions a lot cheaper than they would have been normally ; we are able to lease cars and even if someone is not a doctor , he might well be able to drive a new Mercedes .

Due to this importance of luxury goods , people demand for better things .
The car industry is already making use of this because I have never seen as much advertisement for cars as I do at the moment .
They advertise on posters on the street , in magazins , in the cinema , and the car industry seems to become bigger and bigger rather than smaller .

As we all know , cars pollute the environment .
I live in Frankfurt and I remember those electronic boards put up on big streets in the city center where people are asked to refer more to puplic transfers .
On the other hand , and I can only speak for myself , it is just more convenient to drive my own car , listen to my own music and drive at my own speed ; so I will definitely not be using more public transfers in the nearer future .

Considering my point of view , I am very sure that there will not be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today .
