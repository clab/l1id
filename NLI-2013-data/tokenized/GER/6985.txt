Did one ever asked themself the question how the world would like in twenty years ?
I guess everyone did .
I am asked to write an essay about the following statement `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
Today it is the year of 2006 .
Twenty years from now would be 2026 .

Popular thoughts against cars are that they are not good for our enviroment ( ozon ) so that it would be much better for the nature if the people would use trains .
As well as the argument that if one takes the train one will not have to mess with traffic .
Those ideas might contribute to the statement that there are going to be fewer cars in use than there are today .

In my opinion I do not think that there are going to be less cars in use .
A car is a really nice way to get from point A to point B. One is not dependent on the bus or the train .
It is nice to have the opportunity to use public transportation but one also has to rely on them .
Most of the time the bus does not drive when one wants to be at a certain place .
For example , if a student wants to be at school at 8.00 a.m. but the bus only arrives there either at 8.05 or at 7.35 , he will have to be 5 minutes late or wait for half an hour .
Having a car is much more convenient for that matter .

I am sure that people will not stop driving cars because of them harming the ozon .
People destroy nature all the time .
People already know about the problem and do not do anything about it so they will not stop driving all the sudden because of that matter .

If one takes a closer look at the argument that traffic might people hold back from using cars , one can see that a train or bus has its places where they need to stop and their certain routes .
By taking a bus one might even waste more time than being stuck in traffic .

It always depends on where on lives though .
I would recommend taking the train in large city like NYC .
But taking the car outside of the city .
I came to the conclusion that one needs to differenciate between the city and the suburbs/country .
I think that in twenty years from now cars will be used fewer in the cities but in the suburbs just as much as today .
