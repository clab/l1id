It is a common notion that older people are in greater concern about their own health than younger people , talk about the `` good old times '' and often seem to be skeptical towards changes in lifestyle .
However , this notion is only a matter of perspective and cannot be generalized that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
In fact , enjoyment of life is such an individual concept that is impossible to compare the levels of enjoyment among different age groups .
Who could give an general definition of `` enjoyment '' , let alone some way of measuring the level of it ?
This , however , would be required before someone can state a different level of enjoying certain things .
The answer whether there is a difference in the elvel of enjoying life between certain groups of people can only be a balanced one .

The perceived difference in the level of enjoyment lies in the different ways that various people enjoy life .
A close look at a typical family reunion , e.g. , Thanksgiving , where different age groups of one family get together , reveals that the difference in perceiving joy in life may very well be associated with the age of a certain person .
While the grandparents may enjoy watching their grandchildren play , younger members of the family might need talking amongst themselves or some other activity to be able to enjoy their time .
This , of course , cannot be generally said about all families , but certainly a similar case can be constructed from the social network of almost every individual .

Least to say , if young people enjoyed life more than older people , should n't there be some statistical evidence from the social sciences to support that claim ?
Such a fact would certainly show in many observations , such as happiness surveys , comparisons of the quality of living across regions , or possibly suicide rates .
Yet there is no numerical evidence to support that assertion .

In conclusion , while someone might perceive a difference that another person does n't enjoy life as much as the observer does , the only difference lies in the way the enjoyment is felt .
