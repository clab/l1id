I THINK THAT MOST ADVERTISEMENTS MAKE PRODUCTS SEEM MUCH BETTER THAN THEY ARE .
THIS IS , OF COURSE , A KIND OF CHEATING TO THE CUSTOMERS ON ONE HAND .
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND ITS JUST NORMAL .
IT DEVELOPED LIKE THIS OVER THE TIME , COURSED BY MANY REASONS .

I THINK THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES ABOUT ADVERTISEMENT :
TOUCHING AND SEEING .

IF PEOPLE WATCH ADVERTISEMENT , FOR EXAMPLE IN THE TELEVISION , THE ARE JUST ABLE TO SEE THE PRODUCT , AND NOT TO TOUCH IT .
AS THE TOUCHING AF A PRODUCT , AND THE DEVELOPING PERSONAL FEELING BASED ON THE TEXTURE OF IT , IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR HUMANS TO GET AN OPINION ABOUT A PRODUCT , ADVERTISEMENT IS ALWAS KIND OF CHEATING ...

WELL , IN MY OPINION THIS IS COURSE ENOUGH NOT TOO WATCH ADVERTISEMENT , BUT MANY PEOPLE STILL DO .
I STATE , THAT IF PEOPLE DO NOT TOUCH A PRODUCT , THEY CAN NOT GET A REAL OPINION OF IT .

THE STATEMENT THAT MOST PRODUCTS LOOK MUCH BETTER IN ADVERTISEMENTS IS EVEN MORE CORRECT AS MANY COMPANIES TREAT THE ADVERTISED PRODUCTS VERY HARD BEFORE USING IT .
A GOOD EXAMPLE FOT THIS IS THE MC DONALDS BURGER .
MC DONALDS IS , TRUELY , PAINTING THE BURGER THEY USE IN THEIR ADVERTISEMENT .
THIS PAINTING MAKES THE BUERGER LOOK MORE JUCY , MORE TASTY .

THIS BEHAVIOR IS WHAT I REALLY CALL CHEATING .
THE COMPANIES CAN NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE CAN NOT TOUCH THEIR PRODUCTS IN TELEVISION .
BUT THEY SHOULD NOT CHANGE THE ORIGINAL VIEW OF THE PRODUCT TO GIVE PEOPLE A WRONG , BUT BETTER SELLING VIEW , OF IT .

ADVERTISEMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE BEST WAY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS TO THE PEOPLE .
THROUGH THE LAST CENTURIES IT APEARED IN MANY DIFFERENT KINDS .
STARTING WITH LOCAL ADVERTISEMENTS IN SMALL NEWSPAPERS OR JUST ON THE STREET MANY YEARS AGO , THE INCREASING DEVELOPMENT IF TECNOLOGIE OVER THE LAST YEARS MAKES ADVERTISEMENT APPEAR NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD , AT ANY TIME OF A DAY .
IT IS POSSIBLE TO FIND A BIG SIGN OF COKE ADVERTISEMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF AFRICA .
THROUGH THE TECNOLOGIE CAMPANIES FROM JAPAN ARE ABLE TO ADVERTISE THEIR PRODUCTS IN GERMANY AS WELL AS IN INDIA .

MY OPINION TO THE ADVERTISEMENT OF TODAY IS THAT NEARLY ALL PRODUCTS SEEM TO BE BETTER THAN THEY REALLY ARE , BECAUSE THE WORLDWIDE PRODUCING AND SELLING COMPANIES ARE ALL ABLE TO USE THE NEW TECNOLOGIES FOR THEIR ADVERTISEMENT .

THE NEW TECNOLOGIE LIKE TELEVISION , MOBILE PHONE , RADIO AND SO ON MAKES THE HUMANS ALWAYS AVALIABLE AND REACHABLE FOR NEW INFORMATION .
AND AS THE HUMANS DO NEARY ALL RELY ON THE TECNOLOGIE , ( EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF IT )
ITS EVEN MORE EASY FOR COMPANIES TO INTRODUCE AND , IN FACT , FAKE THEIR ADVERTISED PRODUCTS .
