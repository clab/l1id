We all love advertisements .
One the one hand women like the nice jeans advertisement guys , on the other hand men like underwear models in the same way or even more .

But , are we really influenced by advertisements ?
Do they really make us feel that some products are better .
In fact , do we really taste McDonald 's in another way if we have seen an advertisement before .
Do we really feel better if we drive a BMW X5 , which is delivered fresh from the enterprise in Munich !

I 'm of the opinion : It depends !

Refering to the two examples from the introduction , i want to explain why I think , that it depends if advertisements make products seem better :
Firstly , i want do deal with the McDonalds example .
I claim , that we do not taste a Big Mac in another way if we see an advertisement .
The reason is that you feel or taste food and things like shoes or other things that relate to your body .
Consequently , i think you can not betray your body .
Indeed , I believe you can do it for a short period of time , but if you bought the wrong size of a pair of shoes you will have to confess to yourself after a certain time that it was a wrong buy .
I think eveybody of us has bought at least one time shoes or a pair of jeans which did not fit , but we wanted to say to ourselves they are just perfect !

On the contrary , I claim that if you buy a car , advertisements make it seem better .
Just think about the nice winter landscape , the car drives with his four wheel system through the snow like it would be a normal street .
You would love to say that this is your car .

In fact , I learned at the univerity , that especially car manufacturers are often placing ads in newspapers and television , just to make their buyers secure they did the right thing .
Hence , car manufacturers do exactly what is stated in the question of this essay : They try to make a product seem better through an advertisment .

Also of my own experience , i can say i have experienced that a product gets better through an advertisement .
Everywhere on the university are ads of IBM , and i glad i have an IBM Laptop , because otherwise , i would ever feel like i have a bad PC , because nowhere is an ad of it .

To conclude , i want to summarize my opinion .
An ad just can make a product better if it does n't harm yourself in a way .
All personally related products can only be made better for a short time period , whereas other , just technical things , like cars , video games or even a microwave can be made better through an advertisement .
