The controvery , if successful people who try new things and take risks rather than people who only do what the know is an interesting one .
I agree with the idea that innovation and taking risks will rather lead to succsess than on remaining your knowledge you already have .

Think of the world of computing :

+ A company which invest a lot of efford in research ( computers ) and new ideas will probably introduce innovative products .
The customers are attracted to new features , the new product will pushed away the old one .

+ Moreover , a company is be able to gain a higher price for its new product , because it has more functions or is better to use , you can ask for a higher price .
That will lead to bigger economical succsess .

+ When you have new ideas , you are always one step ahead , you are better prepared for future events .
Someone who is doing only the things he already performs , he can react only .

Think of car-makers such as Chrysler Cooperation in the US-market .
They sell big SUV 's , which need a lot of fuel .
Toyota introduced a new generation of hybrid-vehicles .
Their cars are quite succsessful in the market , environment-frindy cars became popular .

DaimlerChryler instead had to close whole plants because no one want to buy their gas-guzzling cars .
And this is just the beginning .
The change of climate on earth is just to begin to change .
People are going to change their mind sometimes , and you are better of if you have new and better ideas for the future .

This leads to the idea that if a person ( or a company ) , who is not dealing with future events , tries new ideas and takes risks , will never be succsessful in the future .
As a summary I would say that new ideas are an investment in future growth .
