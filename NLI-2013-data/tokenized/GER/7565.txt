The following texts deals with the question whether it is the best way to travel with a tour guide .

Traveling with a guide has many advantages over traveling without guidance .
A tour guide knows the area well and therefore , will guide the tourist to the most remarkable and worthwhile spots of a city .
Commonly the guide is familar with the historical backgroud of the area , and will be able to explain the landmarks and the development of a metropole .
Besides the well-known highlights , a guide will also be aware of secret spots and so , allow the tourist to be intoduced into the side of an area that is out of the spot light .
That will not only show an often charming and different side of a city , but also completes the big picture .
In addition to that , guided explorations are safer since the a person who is familiar with the area will also know the unsafe places where it is not recommended to go .

On the other hand , traveling without a guide is more of an adventure .
It is up to the traveling group to explore the city and to find both , the landmarks and the secret spots .
The travellers are more likely to get in touch with locals since they are not as isolated from the `` normal crowd '' within a group of guided tourists .
I also believe that traveller will experience a trip differently , if it is not organized perfectly by a guide .
The travelling persons can set their own pace and adjust the amout of daily explorations to their actual ability to concentrate which makes a trip less exhausting and more pleasant .

I summery , I believe that travelling without a guide is is the better way to explore a city .
