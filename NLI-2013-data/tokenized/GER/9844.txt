Taking risks and trying new things are important factors in order to be successful .
However , it is equally important to be sensible at the same time in order to achieve something .

One the one hand , only people who are willing to try something new and to take risks can stand out and do better than their competitors .
It is neccessary for people who want to have success to believe in their ideas and to be self-confident .
A person that never dares something will most probably not be very successful .
Today , innovation is very important but always connected to a certain risk as well .
E.g. launching a new product can fail completely , costing a lot of money and it might even lead to a company 's bankrupcy .
However , if it is successful , the profit of the innovation is usually higher than the profit of products that have been established on the market for a long time .
Only companies that come up with innovations regularly are competitive and able to maintain thier market share .

One the other hand , people who do not know when to stop often risk a lot .
If the risk is to high , it is better not to take it .
To my mind , it is sometimes better to stand still than to risk losing everything .
If something is not very likely to be successful , it is a very important characteristic of a person in a high position to decide against it .
Furthermore , it is not always neccessary to do new things if the `` old ones '' work well .

In conclusion , I agree that people trying new things and daring things are often more successful because one can only stand out in today 's society by differentiating from the others .
This is very important since success is defined by doing better than the average .
Nevertheless , I believe that it is very important to know , when something is too risky .
Only people who balances these to factors well will be really successful .
