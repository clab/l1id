`` Who wants to be a millionaire ? '' is a TV show produced and broadcasted in many different countries .
Everybody who regularly watches this show will recognize that people winning high amounts of money in this show have a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects .
Many people claim that it might be better to have such a broad knowledge of different fields than to be specialized in only one given field .
Nonetheless I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject .

The first point to support this opinion is the rapid growth of knowledge .
Man 's knowledge doubles every three to five years .
Several hundred years ago it was possible to study theology , astrology , astronomy and medicine and then claim to be a man having the whole knowledge of the whole world , being extensively educated in any known field of science .
With the huge amount of knowledge we have gathered today this is no more possible .
Thus there is a certain need to reside in one specific subject .

A second point is that one has to adapt to a certain grade to what industry and society needs .
Industry is looking for highly trained specialists , engineers , physicians and phycisists .
But not for someone who tells them he knows everything , but only to quite small extents .
With this knowledge you might be an interesting candidate for `` Who wants to be a millionaire ? '' , but not for a good job in industry .

Third , I think it might be quite a boost for your self-confidence to be able to see yourself as a real expert on a given topic .
Last year there was a certain awareness concerning avian flu , and there was no single day without the news reporting about it .
In most of those articles and shows there were citations of experts on the topic of virology , highly trained specialists who really knew how to fight flu .
But there was no single citation of anyone claiming to be the one to know little about flu , but also about every other topic .
To have a chance as an expert , you need to be a specialist in this subject , and this will only leave you little time to gather broad knowledge of other subjects .

What we need today is the expert highly specialized in one specific subject .
To address different issues it might be necessary to combine experts and build teams , but in a world facing such a rapid growth of knowledge specialization is according to my opinion definitely the best and only effective way to go .
