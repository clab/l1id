In general I agree with this statement , although I think it does n't make sense to suggest an exclusive choice .
Of course a student has to do both , understand ideas as well as learn facts .
I think it has got to do a lot with differences between cultures .
My education was definitly focused on understanding concepts .
But I know for example from Korea that students have to learn much more by heart .
I will try to explane what I mean on an example from the field of music .

In India it is common for Tabla-players to learn many compositions by heart .
Although there exists a system for musical notation it has no relevance .
Everything is learned by heart from mere listenening .
On the other hand you have the european tradition of staff notation and musical scores .
It is not necessary to learn everything by heart because it can be looked up at every time .
This fact is connected with a different attitude towards tradition .
While in India it is more common to emphasize the continuity of a certain school or family tradition ( called gharana ) in Europe more attention is paied on what is new or what seems to be new .
Of course both musical traditions develop and change in the course of time , but their way to new ways of expression is a different one .
In India a tabla player ( who is a compser as well as a musician ) first learns many facts ( compositions ) , and then , after a long time of practising and trying to adapt the tradition he might introduce new features and invent his own compositions .
In Europe many composers ( who are not necesserily performing musicians ) started to compose at a very young age .
Before they had the chance to learn the history of music they already begin to understand some ideas and concepts and with the help of these develope compositions as objects .

To summarize I would like to say that it depends on the cultural environment what importance has to be given to the understanding of ideas or to the learning of facts .
