The issue at hand is if young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This is a very interesting question because the industrialised countries face an increasing average age of their inhabitants and an increasing life expectancy .
This accelerates an aging society with less younger people .
But does this mean that there is less fun in life for these people ?

In my opinion , old people can enjoy life as the younger ones do .
In fact , older people enjoy a lot of free time which they can use to take part in various leisure activities .
For example pensioners have a lot of time which they can use to travel not depending on their company or school vacations which makes their travel more relaxing and their destinations less crowded .

Furthermore , a majority of the elderly possess large amounts of money which they can spend on their hobbies .
Having probably paid off most of their debts and not being forced to raise their children anymore they can use their savings for themselves .
For example , older people can buy goods which they have always dreamed of while the younger ones still have to work and save money .

Additionally , As medical treatments are more and more developed , the older people can still enjoy their lives by continuing to do sports , improving their quality of life and health .
For instance , compared to drugs in the past there are more soft treatments , suppressing the disadvantages of the aging process by using hormones , enabling them to do many sports the younger ones can do , too .

Lastly , more and more products and services for the elderly are created , making their daily life more enjoyable .
Older peolpe are seen as `` Silver Market '' by several industries , being offered many products developed exclusively for them just like group travels in which people of the same age meet and explore foreign countries .

All in all I think that I have shown that being old does not mean that older people cannot enjoy life .
They might even be able enjoy life a little bit more than the younger ones do .
