While during primary and secondary school time it is essential to gain a broad knowledge about many different scientific subjects , I think after aquiring this basic knowledge on various subjects it is equally vital to concentrate further on one specific subject for your further career .
I therefore generally disagree with the statement and will explain my opinion in the following .

We live in a world that reflects high levels of specialization in every work branch you look upon .
Even a computer expert today for example can be classified in various ways , according to the branch he works in .
He could be a software designer or a hardware engineer for example .
So even within an already very specialized branch , there are still more subdivisions .
To keep up with those general movement of specialization in the working world , you just have to adapt and specialize on one subject or you will get left behind .

Another example related to this I can draw from my own experience - out of my own development within my academical career .
I started studying forest sciences , then after four semesters I concentrated on zoology , and after another two semesters I focused further on entomology .
I think this was a natural development and most students make this kind of progress .
On the contrary , if you do not specialize in any kind of area within your studies , it might appear as if you are not interested enough in any subject .
It then seems as if you are not going through any positive personal development .
In my opinion therefore , someone who fails to specialize himself during his studies has missed an important chance already to shape his future and career .

Concluding , out of the reason expressed above , I disagree with the statement .
Altough I have to admit that in early education a bias should lie on building up a broad knowledge on various subjects , in the major part of the rest of one 's life it is more important to specialize on one specific area of interest and to increase knowledge on that subject .
This importance of specialization is heavily determined through the fast and innovative time we live in , which explores its subjects in ever greater detail and is in need of experts for that .
