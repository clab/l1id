I absolutely disagree with this statement .
Why should enjoying life be based on age ?
Sure , young children have a lot of fun playing around and laughing about simple things and just enjoying mostly everything they do but I also know a lot of older people that still enjoy their life very much .
A good example are my grandparents .
They are almost 80 years old and are happier than ever .
They had to start working really hard when they were teenagers .
Both of them worked almost all the way up to their 65th birthdays .
They have 4 sons together , so you can imagine that it cost a lot of time and work to raise the children .
Now , the sons are adults and already have families themselves .
My grandparents are retired now , so their hard work life is over and they can just enjoy life .
Their usual day includes long walks through the Nature and spending a lot of time with friends and family .
They have a nice hobby : Bowling .
Every Thuesday afternoon they meet with other people at the same age in a bowling center near their house and just enjoy bowling and talking to good friends .
They often come over to my parents ' house on the weekends .
Sometimes the whole family , including all 4 sons and all their grandchildren meets there and we sit together and have coffee and cake .
My grandparents have so much they enjoy .
Last yaer they even made a lifelong dream of them come true , they went on a vacation to the swiss alps .
They spent 2 wonderful weeks there .
They took tours along the mountains , had a picknick in between a very nice land scenery .
After they came back and told us all about the trip we almost got a little jealous .
They were so excited and now they are even planning to go back there next year .
So you see older people enjoy life just as much as young people , maybe sometimes even more .
