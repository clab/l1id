Well , as may things , it depends from which angle you are looking at .

Most people have an image in mind that is described by the following features : a video game playing young society that spends most of its freetime in front of a TV or a computer .
It is not just the media but frequently members of the parental generations who consider their offspring `` asocial '' , `` apolitical '' and `` unaware '' of the things going on in the world .

Telling from my personal experiences , I really have to be at issue with stating that young people of my and the following generations do not dedicate enough of their time in helping their communities or showing any other sign of social interest and awareness .

Since 2001 , I am a member of the human rights organization amnesty international and in the course fo my work there , organizations such as amnesty for instance nowadays observe an increase in young people willing to spend their time writing letters , participating in urgent actions to help freeing political prisoners around the world ( or at least bettering their living conditions ) and taking action for those who suffer and are excluded from any satisfying of their basic needs .
I came to learn a lot of students and teenagers of my generation who joined regional groups because of being highly aware of the unjust things going on in the world and who want to change a little something to the better .

Through friends , I also experienced a large interest in social professions among young people , showing that they are absolutely not unaware of the problems in society and that they are doing their best to bring about some change .
One prominent example may be the civil service in Germany , which means that young men can choose between serving in the army or doing social work .
Most of my male friends decided for the latter .
Ok , you may say , they made the decision under pressure taking the more comfortable solution .
Plus , in our society social tasks are mostly assigned to women , wheras men litterally have to be forced to deal with tasks where `` soft skills '' are needed .
This is a very shortsighted concept of our reality if you consider the growing number of young people of both sexes ( ! )
who are a member of their local student club defining principles of the university policy or who are engaged in their community by contributing their ideas to local parliaments .
Another striking example is volunteering in organizations in your own country or abroad where young people help to develop a better infrastructure in third world countries for example , by buliding schools , teaching classes , working in hospitals and so on ...

Therefore , to conclude , I do not agree with the image of young people being lazy , unaware of problems going on around them and / or being too reluctant of taking action in local or regional parliaments or lobbies .
