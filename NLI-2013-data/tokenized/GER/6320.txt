The environment is suffering from all the air pollution , that leads to a warmer earth climate .
This has already the effect that poles are starting to melt .
That is why the protection of the environment is becoming more and more important and everyone is getting aware of the dangers and risks we are provoking .
Everyone means mainly people in first world countries because the developing countries usually cope with other severe problems first .

The worlds population is increasing exponentially .
Developing countries strive to achive a life standard equivalent to the first world countries .
Some , such as India for instance , are getting closer to this objective .
They work very hard to participate in the world trade and in forming a strong economy .
They attempt also to raise their life standard and this includes the purchase of cars .

In first world countries a car is a sign of wealth and independence .
As long as there are no further inventions to replace cars this will not change in such a short time as 30 years .
Maybe the gas will change to renewable resources but in the end a car means more comfort and independence and that is what nowbody wants to give up .

That is why I do not think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
