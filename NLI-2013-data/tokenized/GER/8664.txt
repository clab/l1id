I agree with the statement .
For a students , it seems more important to me to understand ideas and concepts seems than to learn facts .
Nevertheless , I do not underestimate the value of the latter , although overall I think understanding ideas and concepts is for two reasons a more appropriate way to response to life 's challenges than studying mere figures .

First , we are facing an increasingly complex world today , and understanding concepts might prove to be better help in reacting to this complexity .
Information and technologies are changing rapidly , as our knowledge about the world advances .
Knowledge is very flexible nowadays .
For example , facts about medical problems or genetic diseases can change within months .
The same applies to the growth of new achievements in healing patients who suffer from , to give another example , cancer .
This implies , that the ability to understand ideas and concepts gains more importance today than in the past , since it does not `` expire '' , as facts and figures , which we once learned , do .

But not only the factor of expiration of some facts makes them less useful for students to tackle problems with .
It is also important to provide students with tools which can help them work in different situations .
Concepts and ideas might be applicable to more than one situation , and in this respect they are different from facts which apply to single situations and problems .
Understanding these ideas seems to be useful to learn how to solve problems in general .

On the other hand , learning facts and figures of course is important to have some basic knowledge about the world .
Comparing problems , that once arose , with current ones might help us understand the matter in a more comprehensive way than otherwise , and in some cases it might even help us to develop innovative solutions .

To conclude , it is both important for students to understand ideas and concepts and to to learn facts .
Nevertheless , I think that students should concentrate on understanding ideas and concepts , which are applicable in different times and situations , whereas facts and figures might expire and only apply to a certain context .
