Some people say `` no risk , no fun '' and because of this no profits and furthermore no success .
I definitely agree with these people and with the given statement .
Of course there are witnessed examples of successful people who just copied ideas in order to earn big profits .
Of course many people who do not run a business in which risk and creativity are daily questions , are able to realize a nice career as well as high wages .
And of course people who define success in a completely different way such as being a member of a kind of club maybe even the captain of a bowling team are successful with a high degree of riskaversion .

But from my point of view people are only successful if they are able to change their environment significantly .
I do not reffer to the direct environment as the personal social context of an individual .
I am talking about changing the whole society or at least the business sector you are concerned with .
What would our world look like without great reformers and visons of few people ?
Personalities like M. L. King , Adam Smith or Mahatma Gandhi changed their society with their inventions , theories or opinions .
But without taking risks or thinking in new dimensions , developments that occured as a result of their thinking would not have been possible until now .

To be successful it demands a low level of riskaversion , a genious strategy ( that can be a simple strategy as well ) and the ability to implement it .
And facts you already know might be the basic knowledge to explore several ideas but without risk and the willingness to do something completely new success cannot be realized .

Finally I totally agree with the given statement .
I would like to strengthen my opinion again by repeating that from my point of view risk and success are strong partners that cannot be changed .
