The thesis if there are fewer cars in use than today can be discussed controversal .
Many points have to be considered in the global progress of economy , culture and und maybe even events you cannot calculate with .

In my opinion the number of cars in twenty years will most probably increase .
There are different reasons why .
The economy tries to sell more cars and did very well the last decades .
So I would n't expect them to work less effective during the next twenty years .
The trend goes to more consumption and the automobile sector is huge in a time where flexibility and local indepedence is wanted from companies .

Also the basic for driving a car , petrol , is secured for the next hundred year .
That makes it even more unlikely that a branch will increase its production .
One actual topic is interesting when I consider it might be the way that fewer cars will be produced .
The global warming is so impressingly aware in the last years , e.g megatornados or wide spread floodings caused by melting poles , that people might be lead to think about another way of being mobile .

I can imagine that a new kind of car will come , hybrid cars , that will have have another source for their energie where the exaust will be pure water .
That saves the nature from acidic rain caused be carbondioxide .
Under these circumstances the number of cars will increase .

I am just not sure how long it will take to establish a new lobby for these kind of cars , a lobby that has more power than the oil lobby today .

At the moment car dealer have on the one hand problems to sell their cars , on the other hand there are coming more and more other car brands in the open market ( globalisation ) .
The result is that prices fall .
With lower prices more people can afford to buy a car .
And so the will , I guess .

A problem with more and more cars is the infrastructure .
Even in Germany the streets have more and more traffic .
This can lead to more traffic jams than we havetoday , what makes is more expensive for firms or more stressful for usual drivers to drive a car .
That could become a reason that the number of cars will increase slowly .

As a conclusion I can say that firms will find a way to sell more cars than now .
One good effect on this can be that in spite of the more cars the quality of cars referring to oecological reasons will become better because of public pressure or because of a refusing nature .
