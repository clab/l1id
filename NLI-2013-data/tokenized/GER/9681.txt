Christopher Columbus was the first European to discover the continent America .
He was an explorer .
I thinkt it is quite evident to everybody that in order to reach his aims he had to take a lot of risks and finally , although America is not India , he succeeded .
But is it always necessary to take risks in order to be a successful person .

With regard to this question the first thing to come into my mind is that there are actually a lot of people who are highly successful without ever taking much risk in their lifes .
I am talking about people who have a pleasant childhood , who have nice parents that are aware of their responsibilty of being parents .
Parents who care about the education of their children .
Mostly those children have fewer problems at school which means they have better marks and therefore are allowed to study on well-reputated universities and finally become for example high-paid businessmen .
They never take much risk and still become successful .

Moreover I am not sure if it would not be better to focus on your strengths .
Michael Porter for instance affirmed , that companies should rather focus on their competencies instead of trying to enhance their weaknesses .
In my view that is applicable for human-beings .
You probably could be much more successful if you try to enhance your already existing skills than to start to learn new skills , and of course that is less risky .

But on the other hand there is no denying the fact that there are numerous examples , like Kolumbus , which proof that a certain amount of risk is a premise for success .
That for example can easily on the stock market .
The stocks that yield the highest profit are also those which can cost you a lot of money - they are highly risky .

And of course the exmaple of the businessmen is only some kind of a stereotype .
Often one has to make difficult decisions in order to reach one | 's aims in the working life .
Decisions always equals potential risk .
Suppose you get a challenging high-paid job offer in Asia .
Then you could jump on it taking the risk of going into a new country and being exposed to strange and maybe unkind people or you could deny it and stay in your homecountry earning an average amount of money leading a normal life .

Taking all the relevant aspects into consideration I reach the conclusion that it is always a trade-off .
You can either be successful taking no risks an relying on your old skills or you can be successful taking a lot of risk by going a new and different way .
Therefore I cannot totally agree with this statement .
