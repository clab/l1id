I disargee with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people .
Firstly , I do n't think enjoying life depends on the age of a person .
In my opinion things like getting along with one 's life and the ability to stand bad and hard situation are more important in this context than the age of a person .
And , for example , the ability to bear grave moments and siuations normally raises when people mature .
According to this , older people have even an advantage : They can stand bad situations better and so they are more able to enjoy their life again , when the things got better again .

Secondly , I know many old people who really enjoy their life .
For instance , my grandparents travelled a lot in the recent years and they really enjoyed it .
Another example is a old , retired man I met in my university : After his retirement he decided to attend several philosophy courses about topics he had been interested in since many years .
And watching him participating very engaged in those courses , I really thought : This man enjoys his life !

All in all , I 'm convinced that this statement isn ' true .
And I hope I also will enjoy my life when I will have matured .
I think one reason to provide such a statement may be to be to much focused on leisure time : If one equates enjoying life with enjoying life , than young people surely have an advantage : Simply because they have more leisure time since they do n't have to work .
But having no obligations , like to work , does not mean that a person is happy .
Another fact that the person who made the statement probaly had ignored is the following : Young people may seem more happy if you see them in the streets , but you do n't know how they feel at home .
I remember the grave
