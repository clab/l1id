Some nights ago I sat on my bed and tried to learn for a very important testpaper I should write the next day .
The subject was biology and so I tried just to learn the facts about the different processes in the human organism .
But as I wrote the testpaper the next day , I realised that this was no good idea .
I could write down what I had learned , but I did not understand anything .
All the different processes ...
I had really no clue , because I just knew some simple facts .

This has been an silly experience for me because I always did it like that .
But today I realised that this is not the way it should be .
I am in school to learn something .
I want to know and understand what my teacher is telling me .
Perhaps I would like to explain other students what I have learned or try to help them if they do not understand something .
But if i just learn some facts , that will not work .
Students should really understand some processes , ideas and concepts , because this is what stays in mind .
They should learn for their lifetime and not for a 10-minute-test in school .

Sure there are subjects where learning facts is the easiest way to get good marks .
Sometimes there is no logical princip for me which I can follow .
But i think this is not often in ones life .
In this situation it is definetly more important for them to learn some facts than to know nothing .

But because I am a student I know that it is most of the time possible to understand the ideas and concepts the teachers try to explain .
So my opinion is that many students are too lazy to learn concepts , therefore they learn some facts .
The problem is that they forget the facts after a little pause , while if I have understand the main idea I will always remain me at this .

Students are learning for their lifetime and they should learn effective .
What does it help someone if I know the facts of the processe of the photosynthesis for three days , but never realised what importance the photosynthesis has for the humanbeeing ?

I am definetly convinced that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
