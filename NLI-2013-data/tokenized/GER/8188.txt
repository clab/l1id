I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to unterstand ideas and concepts rather than just learning facts .
I believe this , because students will gain a higher level of education that they need in their jobs and they will also have a higher motivation to learn .

The first point is that I think students should understand academic models , ideas and concepts in order gain a higher educational level .
When understanding a theoretical model , a student will be able to apply it to the real world even if the real world does not exactly match the theory and its assumptions and implications .
For example , when just memorizing and recalling facts , a student might not be able to make a proper decision in the real world because some assumption or conditions have changed since the facts were learned .
This way , a student will not be able to customize his decision to the new situation when using her knowledge .
So , a student who understands the theory and get react to new developments can achieve by far more in her job , which is ulitmately the goal of education , namely to prepare for the work

Another good reason for understanding ideas and concepts is that students will most likely have a higher motivation to learn and therefore learn more .
In contrast to memorize facts and recalling them , understanding an idea is less boring than a process of memorizing , which is repeated over and over again .
When I was in school I did not like to just learn facts , and propably everybody else I knew did not like it , we all learned far more things when understanding a theory , which supports my point here .

To sum up , it is far more important to understand the ideas and concepts of the matieral that should be leard , rather than just facts .
The reasons are the higher level of education with a significantly higher chance to suceed in work and the better motivation of students which will yield to more knowledge .
