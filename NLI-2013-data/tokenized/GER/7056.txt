In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

I do n't agree with this statement because everyone wants to have a car .
In this essay I will give some reasons why I have this opinion .

First of all and that 's in my opinion the main reason why I think that in twenty years there will be more cars than there are today , is that most of the people get richer , so they earn more money and they want to have a good reputation and to look great , that 's why most rich people want to have the newest and best looking cars at the moment .
In addition to that the cars are getting cheaper with the time because the automobile industry produce more cars .

Another reason is that the youth want to have cars earlier so they get cars often as a present .
Today the people do n't really want to live anymore in the cities , so they move to the suburbs and sometimes it is n't possible to reach other places without problems , then it is more practical to have very early a car to be more independent .

In my opinion in few years the cars will have such a high technical standard which is better for the environment than today and this will be another important reason why there will be more cars in the future than now .

In conclusion I disagree with the statement and with the reasons I have listed above I support my opinion .
People will earn more money not to have only one car , but two or three .
Then a new technology will appear in a few years , and will be a second reason why car driving wo n't be worse for the environment anymore .
The last reason will be that people will move from the cities to the suburbs .
