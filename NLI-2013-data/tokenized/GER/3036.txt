I disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
The following explanations shall provide the basis for my opinion that older people enjoy life more than young people do .

Young people often seem to be happy and cheerful .
They participate in a lot of activities , are often around other people and enjoy their leisure time with exciting things .

Older people often stay at home , do not have many different activities in their daily life and seem to be less excited .

The above statements decribe the surface of what the life of these two groups of society is like .
In my opinion it is more important to take a look under the surface and to find out about the mental state of these people .

Young people often find themselves being put under pressure .
Life for them is very difficult .
They are growing up and their environment and their own attitudes and opinions change very quickly .
It is difficult for young people to take decisions and to be strong .
This leads to a variety of mechanisms of self-protection , which often imply an activity-oriented life .
For example , many young people often go to parties .
They seem to be enjoying life as much as possible .
However , they are often just taking a break from their stressful life , but are still not able to truly enjoy their life .
They are not truly relaxed and happy , bcause they are not really doing what is best for them .

Older people have mostly passed this phase of doubts and difficulties .
They show a more relaxed attitude towards life and its surprising turns .
This group of the society knows that mistakes are made and wrong decisions happen , and have learned to take everything easier .
Moreover , older people to not let themselves be put under pressure by other people or circumstances .
They show the ability to take more decisions in their own interest and to know what they want for their life .
For example , they do not go out to parties as much as young people do .
They know better that activities including a more personal social contact is worth more than just pushing away their problems .
Older people are choosing their best opportunities for life and enjoy them .

The above paragraphs argue my opinion that older people enjoy life more than young people do .
