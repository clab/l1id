In following text I 'm going to express my thoughts about the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know .

There is a distinction of successful people that I want to make before answering the question .
There are two kinds of them .
First is the successful guy , who just happened to be in the right spot or have the right friend to come into a position where he is successfull .
Those people mostz do n't try new things at all or use new knowledge .
They 'll be interested in keeping the current status quo .

The second kind are the self-made successful people .
They do have to take risks and think new thoughts in order to be successful .
For example if you open a shop , you 'll have to get a loan from a bank , which is risky because you might ca n't pay it back .
If you are not able to pay your rates you risk not only the new shop you 've opened , but your whole existance .
Therefore you have to make sure that your bussines is going to work .
The best way to be successful is to differ from others .
You 'll have to think about new products to sell , new ways to advertise them .
Maybe new locations and ways to build them .

Without innovation it wo n't take long until there is someone better coming into the field , to take your custumers away .
That 's why , as a self-made man , you always have to be on top of new developments .
Whether in technical or in marketing issues .
That does n't mean that in order to be successful you 'll have to start something totally new .
It 's perfectly possible to start with something that you already know and are good at .
But it 's a must to always develop new skills and knowledge .
Custumers always want the best service they can get so you have to improve your service .
Once you 're successfull , ther is no guaranty that it always stays like that .

Successful people will always make efforts to improve further .
It 's neccesary for them to take risks and think new thoughts .
