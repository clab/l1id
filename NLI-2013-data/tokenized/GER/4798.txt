The companys in the world build a lot of product , but not all of these product need the people .
So the companys spend a lot of money in TV spot or marketing in newspaper .
They want that the consument thinks that they spend the best product and the consument has to buy the product .
The question is when the companies spend more money in marketing , sell they more .
And if yes spend they so much more that the cost for marketing are in the value .
Red Bull spend half of their money in marketing , they have two teams in the formular one , one football club in austria , one air craft world series , ...
But is that to much money .
Cannot they spend the money in better produkts or gaves the money to theirs workers , shareholders , in social projects , ...
Another example is Ebay , Ebay spend a lot of money to tell the people that you can be happy if you sell your thinks which in your house or in your flat .
You tell 3 , 2 , 1 , my .
But are you happy or is it better if Ebay do not spend such a lot of money in marketing .
When they spend the money a better product , lower cost for the customers .
Or if they spend the money in environment .
Advertisements should tell us that we buy the best product , but in real we do not buy a product which is better than the product which stand next to them .
We habe to pay for the marketing , product from big companies are more expansive than products from no name firms .
The people feel better if they buy a product from big company , because they know that they get a good product .
When they buy a product from a no name firm they do not konw if the product is quit good .
