Nowadays due to the fact of an changing econmoic situation which asks for highly skilled and qualified people and makes it even more difficult to get a suitable job , it is more important for students to gain the ability to understand ideas and concepts rather than it is to learn facts in oder to be special on the job market .

At universities it is important that students do learn the theory of the subject in order to gain a basic knowledge in this sector .
Unfortunately they do not experience a lot of the practical site .
Apprenticeships are on a volunteer basis at most universities and most of the students use their free time off in the semester holidays to have fun instead of working for companies and doing trainees .
However , in the time after having finished universitiy it is of high importance that students can show their future employees that they do know more than the pure theory .

In the daily working life it is neccessary that one is able to work independently and furthermore is able to combine facts , own ideas and concepts .
Most of the people leaving school think it is easy to study at university as they only have to learn facts which are provided from the professor .
But nevertheless studying at university is more .
Only people who show the ability to think and work independently are those who are highly skilled and later on qualified and contribute to the success and progress of economy .

Furthermore if students are able to combine their knowledge they are also able to think subject linked that means that they are not just specialised in one subejct or theme but are also able to link topics with each other .

These students are capable of survinig in the real life and might have good career in business .

In conclusion , it can be said that I am off the opinion that it is more important that students know how to understand ideas and concepts as it creates an individual person .
All the other students who only do learn facts store these in a short term memory and do not know how to think independently .
This kind of learning does not repersent an appropriate basic intelligence and education .
Nowadays nearly every graduate from school wants to study
