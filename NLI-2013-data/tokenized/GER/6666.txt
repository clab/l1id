I do not agree with this statement , although I would be glad if it were true .
In my opinion it is too idealistic to assume that the numbers of cars will decrease .
It might be possible if a new technology were discovered and brought into use , or if several societes around the world learned to depend only on public transport .
Unfortunately , twenty years is not enough to come up with a completely new way of personal transport .
There would have to be a phenomenal invention like a little individual airplane for everyone to replace the car .
As I said , I do not regard this as possible .
Concerning the public transport , it would be necessary to reorganize whole cities or even countries in order to make the car a less practical means of transport .

One could argue that because of the concern for the environment that people have they would not buy new cars anymore .
Especially because of the increasing pollution of the air .
However , I think that the numbers of those who are really and honestly concerned about the future of our environment are too few .
There are still those who do not care about pollution and who regard it as more important to be able to possess an individual car .
A lot of people might have ideals of a cleaner and less polluted environment , but as soon as it comes to their personal comfort they are not ready to give away the car .

Another reason why there will not be fewer cars is , that the biggest part of the world 's population consists of people from poor countries or countries that are now growing and increasig their wealth .
It is most probable that in these countries the number of cars will increase immensely .
For example China .
More and more people gain money through commerce , people that before lived in poor conditions .
These people will now be able to buy cars , so that in the end , the number of those who buy cars is by far bigger than of those who decide not to use them .
