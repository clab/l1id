Companies spend a considerable amount of money in marketing of their products .
The principal aim of these marketing campaigns is to increase sales of their products .
A secondary desired effect is to strengthen the image of the company and of the product .
Consumer choices are often based on brand prestige .

In view of these goals , it goes without saying that companies regularly try to make their products as attractive as possible .

To name just a few recent examples , we may think about Airbus 380 , Sony laptops and AMD processors .

Airbus presented their new airplane in a very glamerous way , highlighting the exceptional comfort , high speed and low fuel consumption .
Recently we learnt that they knew about many major problems , in particular the wiring problem .
Of course they did n't mention such problems in advertising spots nor will they ever do .
They had to admit the problems because they were unable to deliver the aircrafts in time .
Moreover for the stock market they have to provide some information regularly to their share holders .
But even then they did not really tell the truth .

Another example is Sony .
They are producers of power supply for laptops .
They recently found out that batteries may explode causing damages to objects and injuries to persons which are close to such notebooks .
Even if they now offer to exchange all the batteries , it do not expect them to mention this in TV advertisement spots .

The story of AMD is somewhat different , because their product is working as you may reasonably expect from the TV spots .
The newest processors are much faster and cheaper than the ones of previous generations .
So where is the flaw in this case ?
The flaw is somewhat more subtle : they once compared their products with the ones of their strongest competitor and showed their superiority in terms of processing power and power consumption .
Meanwhile in recent advertisements they do not mention that Intel has now the better processors .
So they deliberately omitted that their products are now inferior in many aspects .

Their are many more examples of the style `` By my product and you will be successfull '' .
What successfull is depends on the product , but many times one can spot admiration or other positive feadback from friends and envy from competitors .

Consequently these examples give evidence that companies are unwilling to disclose their weaknesses in advertisement .
