I completely agree with this statement .
The main reason for advertisment is to sell their product on the market .
They want to get the attention of the viewer or the reader for their product .
Advertisment should not only emphasizes the goodness of their product , furthermore it stresses a character given by the advertisment .
For example , when there is a company advertising for entertaining things like a funny tv show they also have an even more funny and entertaining advertisment during the commercial breaks .
It is not important for the company if the message which is given by the advertisment is correct or not , the only important thing is that they get the people 's attention and may achieve interest to watch their show .
The only thing advertisment does so is because of money .
Money rules the world .
And so the company is not afraid to illusion people .
Next to the obvious reason that the company wants people to buy their products first of all , is that mayby their product is not so good that people would buy it .
In turn , they have to improve the image or quality of their product .
This makes a product seem better although it might be worse .

On the other hand lots of people have already made a lot of experiences with some advertisment and their promises years ago .
Moreover , they got to know that most of all the advertisment is much better than the product in reality .
This experience made people more sceptical .
But how should people know if the advertised product is for real worse than the advertisment promised or if it is maybe exactly like that or even better ?
They have to test it .
And therefore they spend some money .
Maybe they test it just one time , but they do it and that 's exactly what 's the purpose for an advertisment .
