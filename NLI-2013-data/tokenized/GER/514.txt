Is it better to know a little bit of everything or to know everything about a special subject ?
Certainly many students have already given this question a fair amount of thought .
But maybe there is no need for an either / or decision as both approaches to knowledge have their advantage in academic life .

To advance academic research , you need specialized knowledge in your specific research area .
Before you can for instance tackle new approaches to cancer treatment , you need to know all there is available on your specific subject as a starting point of tought and to form a new and sound hypothesis .
Many processes are highly detailed and not easy to grasp quickly and therefore need an intense effort on the researchers ' side .

You do also need broad knowledge of many other academic subjects in order to function well in the everyday academic life .
In order to communicate with other researchers , you need to know at least the concepts of their research subjects .
Broad knowledge also hepls when it comes to making your research results understandable to an audience who is not familiar with your specific topic .
And lastly , broader knowledge helps you seeing the overall picture and patterns that you would miss when you only concentrated on your specific subject .

A balance of in-depth knowledge and broad overview is certainly a good basis for meaningful and sustainable research .
Broad knowledge helps you to discovering the general patterns and also communicating with your peers .
Specialiced knowledge helps you to penetrate the problem more profoundly .
