In my opinion , the car and other vehicles used for transportation have a central position in our modern society .
The use of cars will therefore not decrease but even grow in the future .
To ensure that development being sustainable we have to make great efforts in science and technology .

First of all , I am convinced that transport in general is the heart of our modern world economy .
The globalisation of our world has only been possible because of a broad and intensive use of cars , trucks , ships and other vehicles .
Within this process the structure of our modern economies got more and more focused on cheap transport and mobility .

Second , cars a an important part of the people 's daily life in every modern society .
We use cars to travel , to work , to go shopping and even to compete against each other ( e.g. in motocar races ) .
Beside that , it is an important status symbol for many upper and middle class people .
In my opinion , the importance and therefore the demand for cars will increase substantially on a worldwide scale - especially in developing countries as China or India where the new emerging middle class is heading for private cars .

But there are also problems with a possibly growing number of cars around the world : First of all , the exhaust fumes and production process will cause a lot of environmental damage .
The second problem that arises is the question how all those cars and vehicles can be fueled .
The worldwide quest for petroleum and oil , from which gas for cars is made of , is growing higher and higher .

To challenge those two problems , scientists and car producers have to concentrate on doing research to find alternatives to the current car concepts .
There are promising ideas and experiments , but still no revolutionary new concept to assure a sustainable use of transportation vehicles in the future .
Finding those alternatives is absolutely necessary to further enjoy the benefits the car brings to different societies and economies around the world .
