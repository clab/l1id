I agree and disagree with the statment to some extent .
There are definitely advertisements that exagerate the product extremely .
For example all the weight reducing products praised on TV are just pure bogus .
There is research showing that pills that promise losing 10 pounds in a day , or muscle stimulating machines develop your muscles over night are not effective at all .
However , people 's hopes and sorrows are abused by money hungry companies to suck the money out of the believers .
Additionally , `` half truths '' or suggestive statements are used in advertisements to make the consumer believe in the superiority of the product .
A famous chocolate praises its value by pointing out that milk is contained and that it is therefor healthy for children .
Looking more closely at the content reveals that not more milk is included in the receipe of this particular chocolate than in any other milkchocolate .

Unfortunately , people are very much fooled by colorful moving pictures and convincing actors .
New technologies like TV or the Web induce a high level of accuracy and verification .
The crowds like to believe in what is shown on new media as it is much easier to consume the information without much thought than constantly trying to figure out if the provided information is true and verified .

However , many companies believe that the advertisements should represent their firm image and products .
They understand that customers who realize that they had been disguised by an add wo n't continue in buying that specific product .
Therefor , producing an accurate representation of the product with the advertisement is of extreme importance .
For example it would be unwise if a car company would advertise that their cars are extremely safe without sufficient evidence as accidents falsifiying statements like that would result in huge negative financial concequences and law issues .

The statement that `` most advertisements '' exagerate their products I ca n't fully support as I have n't looked into statistics concerning this topic .
However , in any case advertisements have to be looked at critically as they definitely not always show real life .
