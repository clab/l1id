Due to experiences I have made not only within my closer circle of acquaintances but also in other countries , I can agree with the statement to a certain degree .
Yes , many young people are not prone any more to commit themselves socially and help their community .

In the time of the `` computer age '' , a lot of young people find it more interesting to play computer games with Americans of French than to go outside and look for people who really need help .

Some time ago , my school started an appeal that older , more experienced students should help younger ones to get along in critical subjects like Latin or Math .
It can be seen as a major catastrophe that only three students acutally showed up and offered their assistance .
All others used excuses like `` lack of time '' or just blatantly revealed their aversion against spending time to help others .

This reluctance may also be a result of the transformations many societies undergo during the process of globalization .
The loss of importance of the local communites also affects the church , an institution that has always taken care of the disadvantaged members of societey and that has encouraged especially young people to help .
These days , these young adults lack this encouragement and incentivement .

The solution to the problem may not necessarily be to revive church as a social institution , altough this could be helpful .
However , one has to use the receding to boundaries to show people WHERE and HOW they can help .
Numerous students do not know that they are actually needed in their communities .
But in the age of the internet - with which many young people spend a significant amount of time - it should not be too difficult to convey that message .
Everyone , from every remote location , has the possibilty to encourage young people to commit themselves in society
