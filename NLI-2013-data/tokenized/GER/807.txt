The main problem with this statement is that its implications cannot hold much factual value .
It tries to generalize without taking into account the domain of function .
Different fields of knowledge require different approaches towards specialization in order to be effective .
I will formulate what I mean by this shortly .

In my opinion the statement does not hold much water as a general truth but rather depends on the context where it is used .

There are certainly many fields of knowledge , where it is imperative to specialize extremly into a the subject at hand .
Modern science is a good example of that .
The problem is the speed at which human knowledge expands .
Thanks to modern storing techniques and exponential growth of `` world knowledge '' it is impossible for a human being to have a broad knowledge of different academic fields and still be effective to the maximum in a certain subjects .
Thus if you for example specialize in modern mathematics there will simply not enough time to dwell in the escapades of ancient , greek heroes .

The main counter argument against specialisation is of course the lack of interdisciplinary thought , meaning a specialist does often fail to connect the findings of his field with discoveries of other fields .

For example you might be a person with great interest into the functions and workings of the business field .
You might want to become a first class manager and thus vigorously invest your time in the wonders of the economic sector .

What if for example psychology discovers a way on how to better influence the opinions of people ?
Would these findings not help your agenda -- selling your product to your costumers ?
But how would you know ?
You never considered to connect the discoveries from one field with the findings in yours .

Thus molding parts of different academic fields into something better does indeed require a broader knowledge than just specializing .

From a personal standpoint , meaning the effects two different alternatives of the statement would have on my personal development as a human being I would like to add :

If my main goal is to life a healthy , fun , exciting life I do agree that it is more likely that a broad academic knowledge helps me in my everyday struggles more than pure specialisation .
This is due to the concept of interaction and the fact that human thought does work a lot with association .

This of course depends how much I am attracted to a certain field of knowledge .

In Conclusion the only true answer to the statement is : `` It depends '' .
Its qualities as a general statement are certainly lacking .
