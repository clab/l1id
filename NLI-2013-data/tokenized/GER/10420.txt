There were always innovations and people who try something new .
There are three reasons why I think that it is important to try new things and to take risks to be successful .

First , if people take the risk to sell its new idea they have the possibility to be very successful .
New ideas have the characteristic that nowbody else offers this idea or product .
For example , Bill Gateshad the idea of a new computer software .
He was successful because he was the first who sold his idea and he took the risk of losing all his money .
Second , humans always need to develope new products .
For example , medicaments for new illnesses .
Scholars have to take the risk , that the medicament does not work or causes other illnesses .
Before the medicament can be sold to the people it has to be tested for a long time .
If the tests are not successful , the work of the scholars is not worth anything .
The scholars want to develpe something new and take the risk .
Third , new things and innovations are very interresting .
People like new electronic devices , dangerous attractions in theatres or shows and new tastes and smells for food or deodorant .
Every company that developes a new product has to invest money to invent it .
After the company has to pay money for marketing , product placement and so on to sell its product successful .
The amount of money the company spends is the risk it takes .
But without taking the risk it has to sell its old products but mostly costumers do not want old products .
They are only successful if they take the risk and be the first company that offers a new product .

In conlusion , these three reasons show that it is important to use new ideas and innovations and to take risks to be successful .
