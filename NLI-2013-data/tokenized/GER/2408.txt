The statement presented above is far too general to really capture the complexities of actual life .
There are two main points I would like to discuss here .
First , factors other than age may explain why a person is happy or desperate with life .
Second , we need to look at what we really mean when we use the notion of `` enjoying one 's life '' .

At all times in history are we confronted with unhappy young lives : Or do we think that the young British soldier in Iraq `` enjoys his life '' ?
He may be proud to serve a cause or proud to be able to live up to the challenge .
But when we think of the deadly risk always present in the soldier 's mind , the old lady in her cozy house with her entire family around may look like the happiest person .

The term `` enjoy life '' is too much associated with a life animated by parties , travels around the world and the perspective of having one 's life before one .
It is true that in most cases young people , given their physical strength , have more options to lead an eventful life , as long as they have some freedom and financial means .
However , more eventful may not mean more enjoyable .
Can an old couple not also enjoy life , looking back at a fulfilled life and having the support by a loving family ?
In some countries in Africa , it is the eldest who have the say in the village and the respect of the young people is theirs .

In Chinese , there is a saying that goes exactly the other way round : If you drink tee , the first sips are as bitter as the young life .
When you poor more water , the tee becomes as sweet as the adolescent life .
And only when you add water for a second time your reach the balanced , slightly fragrant stage that resembles old age .
In the Buddhist tradition , this last stage is clearly the preferred and the symbol of this is the old , `` useless tree of happyness '' .

Maybe we people in the West should learn that every stage of life has its own happy moments , and experiences of sadness form part of the human condition .
Neither should young people be `` condemned '' to enjoy life , nor should old people always hear that their happy lives are over anyway .
