From my point of view , in general I can only agree with this statement .
Nevertheless I think this statement requests for further analysis in detail to come to a final opinion on that topic .

It is a clear and from my pespective very sad trend that young people nowadays do not invest much of their spare time into helping their communities .
Therefore it is important to evaluate the reasons for this trend first .

Being 21 years old myself and therefore belonging to the group of `` young people '' I think I can base my evaluation on my own experiences .
One of the main problems communities have to face is to make `` helping the community '' attractive for young people , especially taking the diversity of other possible activities young people are offered today into consideration .

Most young people rather invest their time into entertainment than in helping their communities neglecting the fact that helping their community can become entertainment , too .
I experienced a good example of this myself .
Since I starting thinking I know about a little festival in our suburb of the city of Cologne .
Everybody knew about the existance of this little festival , but somehow nobody was interested in the organization or marketing of the festival .
No wonder such conditions led to dramatically decreasing numbers of visitors throughout the years , which made the festival itself of no interest at all for the young population in our suburb because it always had the prestige of being `` boring '' .

But one day our school principal started a school-wide project called `` Organize a social party '' .
Initiated by a good friend , some friends of mine and me started to think about an event we could use to organize .
Then it came to our minds , that it would not be neccessary to invent a new social event at all .
All we had to do was to do a better organization and better marketing campaign for the existing suburb festival .

Soon we started brainstorming for ideas that could make this community festival more interesting and attractive for young people .
Quickly a whole bunch of ideas was collected , so for example , a soccer competion called `` Little World Cup '' where little teams of young players represented a country of the world fighting for the world championship .
Soon everyone in school was talking about this competition and the community festival , too .

The result was an all-time record of festival visitors that year .

This little personal example shows up how `` helping their community '' can become entertainment and therefore become much more attractive for young people .
All that it necessary is to show up the attractiveness of improving their community .

If this can be aim can be achieved I think much more young people will start thinking about becoming active in their community .
And this , even this may not be the way out of the dilemma at all , it is a important first step to deal with this trend among the young generation .
