I do n't think that this statement is correct .
In Germany young people have the choice between `` Zivildienst '' and the `` Bundeswehr '' .
Most young people say `` No i do n't wa n't to go to the Army ( Bundeswehr ) '' and instead spend nine `` social month '' ( Zivildienst ) in for example hospitals or `` Altenheime '' a place where old people can go and where they live until the end of there lives .

In that nine month , every young person can help their community and the hole society .
In Germany the social sector wouldn'y be able to survive without these `` Zivildienstleistende '' , the guys who do n't want to go to the army .

I for myself did n't want to go to the army because they could't tell my when i can go there and when i would be finish .
So i decided that i make these `` social nine month '' .

These nine month gave me the oppertunity to help old people , speak and listen to him and to give them a good feeling .
It maybe sounds cracy , but old people are realy happy when they see me coming .
Often they are left alone , nobody of there familie comes to visit them so they are happy to have someone to talk with .

I also think that there are many young people who do a lot without earing money for it .
In my freetime i play handball in a club and every year we organize a big party where about 600 people have always ( ! )
a lot of fun .
To organize such a event you need a lot of people and everybody helps to make this possible again , year after year .

What i want to say with this is very simple .
The money that is earned with this party is spend for the smalest children in the club .
They get new balls or tshirts .
All the money is spend for a good use .

Here this is called social engagement and i think the different forms of engagement are also under the young part of the society still not dead .
A lot of young persons want to tell the older ones there ideas to help and to make the different events much better for everyone .
Another example in my opinion is the pope visit in colone at the `` world child day '' .
Over 500.000 young people wanted to see pope benedikt .
That shows me that on the one hand religion is not dead ( insted it comes back ! )
and on the other hand that a lot of young people whant to `` push '' society and there community forwards .

In the last time you can hear much ofter guys that want to publish there opinion to take influence at the public meaning .
I think young people do a lot more to help there communities as in the past , even if the way young people chose is often not that understud as young people want to .
