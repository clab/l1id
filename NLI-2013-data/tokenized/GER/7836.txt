Travelling in a group led by a tour guide can have disadvanntages and advantages .
I prefer travelling without a tour guide or even without a group .
What I like about travelling alone is that you can make every decision very spontaniously .
You can choose where to go next and what to visit each day depanding on the weather , your mood or your finances .
In comparisons to travelling with a tour guide , which contains a very rigid schedule without any leeway , travelling alone is preferable if the target of your trip is pleasure more than obtaining as much information and facts as possible .
A different perspecitve is travelling with a tour guide provides you with detailed information about cultures and history that only experts can deliver .
and you do not have to invest as much time to plan out your whole trip .
The trip has already beplanned by the tour guide .
This can cease in a deeper insight with less effort .
On the other hand travelling independently could open opportunities that tour guides can not offer .
For example , two summers ago I traveled to Spain fore two weeks .
In those two weeks I learned more about cultuer than every expert could have brought to me .
I got to know a local girl my age and we became good friend .
She invited me to her families house for dinner and even to a wedding of her sister .
I gained a deep understanding of the intrinsic cultural differences as well as differences in every day life .
A neagtive point of travelling independently is that it involves more effort .
I you want for example not to stay in one specific town , it needs a lot of encouragement and knowledge to find out bus schedules and upcoming fees .
And at the end the trip might not even be worth it since you do not know what to expect and where to go .
