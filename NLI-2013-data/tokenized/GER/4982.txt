What is advertisement ?
You developed a great product ( in your opinion ) and you want to promote it .
That is the basic fact of advertisement .
A good marketing specialist would do it AIDA-style .
AIDA is a process in marketing .
It includes the following steps : Attention - Interest - Desire - Action .

The first point is getting your attention .
Therefor he must do something special like a big presentation or something else like a campaign ( E .
On did something like that .
It was everywhere in the media and no one knew it ) .
If he got the attention , the interest must be build up .
The following step is : advertisement .
In advertisement he wants to show us that product from its best side .
He counts up all positive skills and gimmicks .
He shows anything in the product that is better than other products and so on .
The next phase is building a desire for your product .
Best example for something like that is Apple , who made a fashion brand out of iPod .
In the last step it is up to you : you have to buy the product .

Sounds good so far .
The problem is that there is not only one company and one product , there an almost uncountable amount of companies and products and anyone wants to sell their products .
In some markets , where there is a hard competition , there is more promises made that can kept .
This leads to a bad image , because if you buy an expensive product and it is working for only a few weeks , you are not a happy customer .
If the number of unhappy customers grows , you will be soon a unhappy company .
A few years ago advertising played not the role as it does today .
The companies realized that their image depends from their products .
They invest very much to make their products the best on the market , so that they can show us , that it is the best product .
