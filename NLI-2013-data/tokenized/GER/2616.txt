Today it looks like more and more people try to stay young .
But why is staying young so attractive for many people ?
Do young people have more fun ?
In our days it seems to be a trend to stay young .
The media supports this thinking a lot by its comercial .
Many people today are influenced by TV and radio and follow this trend to stay young .
To look as good as all the people on TV , many people bye products that are represented by the media .
They by creams or go to the gym in order to look better .

Following the media that much is a big problem today because many people think that by staying young they are more attractive to other people .
In addition , many people think that they can have more fun if they stay young .

In my oppinion this is a big mistake .
Young people do not have more fun than older people .
Having fun depends on a person itself .
People can have fun in every stage of their life .
It just depends on themselves and what they do .

There are many adolescence who do not have a lot of fun because this stage of life can be a very difficult one fore many young people .
It is the time where the body changes a lot .
Young people have to deal with this changement .
During this period of time many young people have problems with their friends and families .
This underlines that being young is not allways the best time for everybody .

In conclusion we can not generalize when people have the most fun of their live .
That depends on the people themselves and what kind of life they lead .
Fore some people the statement `` Young poeple enjoy life mire than older people do '' is truth and for other people it is wrong .
It is important that people do not try to follow the media as much .
Because looking younger does not make anybody more happy .
