It is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I do agree with this statement .
To make commurcial is one of the most investment for concerns .
They have to show their product from the best side for selling it easily .
You can do that with making advertisements .
It is depend on the quality how you make it .
You have to reach the style of the community .
It has to be an eyecatcher when you looking at it so that you can say '' I want to buy that ! ''
For example , I make an advertisement for a drink .
First of all I have to think about it how could I make it so , that the people would buy it immediatly .
One criteria could be the size of the advertisement .
Another one could be the color .
The style and the location is also important .
It has to speak on the community .
So then when I am done with the advertisement and it really looks tasty , actually no one really know the taste in it .
So it could be very sweet or to sour or so on .
Nobody knows the taste before they try it .
So it is a kick for the people to buy the product and to taste it because on the advertisement it seems good and it makes you to buy it .
That is actually the danger on advertisements .
Of course this example does not show a big danger but what about a holiday advertisement ?
Advertisements make everything that the trip sounds perfektly and the price is also okay so people book the trip and when you go there you see the realities about the hotel or the location or what ever , which is not true with the advertisement .
That could be a danger .

Anyway without advertisements the economy would be getting down and no one could sell their product anymore .
Conclusion : Advertisements should not make products seem much better than they really are .
