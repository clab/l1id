I agree with the statement mentioned in the question .
There are several arguments for my decision which I try to illustrate in the following essay .
First of all , trying new things and taking risks always contain new chances which would n't be offered to you otherwise .
If you continue what you already know , there wo n't never be the chance to develope .
I want to give an example to demonstrate my thoughts : I 've been living in small town in the south of Germany for 20 years .
I knew nothing about the life in a big city or how people in other parts of Germany behave .
But last year I had to move to Hamburg because of my new job .
Knowing nobody it was a hard beginning in such an enourmous metropole .
Now I can state that my personnel horizont has grown a lot because I made experiences I would have never lived staying at home with my parents .

Furthermore , life would be very annoying without no action or risks .
The most people have to work all the day and for that reason there is n't much time remaining for hobbies .
Why should n't we try something extraordinary or ecxiting in our less free time ?
For example , learning a new instrument or trying bungee jumping ?
As for me , these are the highlights which enriches our lifes because they offer us a short break in our every day life .

The third argument that I want to mention concerns taking risks .
I 'm totally convinced that we ca n't reach a high aim by excluding every risk .
For example if someone gives up his or her safe job in an economy in order to start his or her own business , there will always be the risk that the business can fail and that he or her will lost all the money .
For that reason , it 's necessary to accept the risk and to be conscious of because you will only be able to success if you are n't fear the disadvantages or the risks .
