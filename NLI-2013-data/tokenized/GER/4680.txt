Do most advertisements make products seem much better than the really are ?
As a source of information I first want to analyse the purpose of advertisement .
Another good way to find an answer obviously is to examine some examples , which will follow .

Much money is spend on advertisement .
The simple purpose is to increase the ammount of sold products .
The most simple way to do so would be to show the product in the best light .
Weaknesses will not find their way in an advertisement .
Therefore the product should seem very good , which in average will be much better than it really is .
Let us find out if advertisement takes this way of promoting goods .

One of the most succesfull products of the last years is the iPod , a portable music player .
With the succes came a lot of advertisement .
The printing campaign simply shows the outline of a figure in black with a white iPod .
As the photo gives a fair impression how the product really looks like and there is hardly writte anything on it , we can not pretend that the product seems much better than it really is .

Take an advertisement of a watch .
An important manufactor advertises with a sailing picture .
There is only little information about the watch , concluding that it fits perfectly for sailing .
Again there is not so much written about the product that we could say it was made better than it is .

Although there is some advertisement showing a product in the best light , most advertisement seems to work differently .
It is not the product , which is sold , it is the brand , the lifestyle , the image .
And therefore something invisible is added to the product , which makes it seem much DIFFERENT than it really is .
