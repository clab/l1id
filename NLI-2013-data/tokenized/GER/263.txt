It is true that facts could be helpful sometimes .
It is for example quite good to know some important dates of history or some names of important politicans .
However , I completely agree with the statement that it has a bigger effect for students to understand ideas and concepts !
There are several reasons why I think so .

One is that if a student really understands a concept he can adopit it to new issues or circumstances .
A good example is the concept of fieldwork , the basic method in anthropology .
If I had learnt just the facts about that method , for example who invented it and so on , I would have had a lot of problems during my first real fieldwork in Cameroon .
But because I learnt the concept and ideas behind , I could adopt it do my specific situation .

Another reason why I prefer understanding concepts to learning facts is that during that process of understanding you will made up your own opinion and you will create your own ideas .
So understanding is an important basis or fundament for further research questions or further thoughts in other areas and by the way you will learn all the important facts anyway , I am sure .

As a last reason it is just much more interesting to learn concepts than facts .
So all the classes and books I have taken or read which were based on concepts and ideas , I really loved .
And I can still remember the things and topics written in these books !
But the facts I had to learn for some multiple choice tests I forgot the day after ..

For all these reasons I think it is much more efficient and fascinating to learn and understand ideas and concepts on scientific issues during university time .
And , after all , I think it will be much more useful for a further academic or other kind of career .
