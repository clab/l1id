A lot of my friends complain that their parents are too boring .
They tell that their parents are not interested in enjoying their leisure times .
Moreover , older people wants that younger people enjopy their lives becausethey have already experienced a lot of enjoyments in their youth .
Therefore , older people encourage younger people to enjoy life .
I agree definitely that young people enjoy life more than older people .

Young people are enthousiastic and vital to live an exciting life .
They tend to use opportunities to travel ; and they want to experience different things .
They want to know everything .
Furthermore , they tend to get quickly bored so they go to parties .
And they dance and go to concerts .
I am not different .
In my free time , I like to meet my friends , go to restaurants , and more over .
To enjoy life means for the youth that they can experiment and try different ways of life .
In contrast , older people are now much slower than young people .
They do not want to act more than it is necessary but I can understand this .
I think when I get older I will become more inactive because I will have a family , one or two children .
I will want that my children enjoy their lives .
Moreover , I will them give the possibilities , so that they can do more things .
This is because I do not want that they say later that they could not feel happy with their lives .
It would be terrible for me .

It is interesting how young people combine a free happy leisure time with businees .
They become even more successful because they are limited in their activities like older people .
My friends are all perfect examples .
A lot of them are succesful in their careers because they are happy and agile .
Enjoying life leads to satisfaction .
Therefore , I think , because older people stop to enjoy life they become more and more dissatisfied .

There are two reasons for me why I think that young people enjoy their lives .
One reason is that they want to see and experience everything .
Another reason is that they become more succesful with this attitude .
Now , I enjoy my life , too , but I know that this attitude will end in the future not only because of some changes in my life but also some changes in my attitude toward enjoying life .
