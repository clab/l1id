I do not agree with the given statement .
If you look closely to advertisements you will realize that they do not promise any effect which they cannot provide .
They actually create a desire or support or maybe increase an already existing desire for a life-style or for example a better look .

One good example is car advertising .
The companies are legally not allowed to provide technical details that are incorrect .
They mostly show the new car in an desirable environment or in an adventorous situation .
As a result the consumer is feeling that he could be in the same situation if he would only own that car .
But this is a misconception of the comsumer and is of course wanted by the advertisor and the car company .
Nevertheless it does not mean that the car could not be driven in that situation if the customer would ever be in it and thus it might be as good as advertised .

Another field of advertising is the beauty industry .
There are a lot of commercials for hair color or foundations shown on television .
They mostly show some celebrity using the product and telling how the person is happy with it .
Those commercials are carefully made .
They do not promise that the hair of the customer will look like the one of the actress after the treatment or that the skin will be as smooth as the celebritie 's .
It is just the wishful thinking of the customer having the illusion of being able to look as one of those famous people that makes him buying the product .

Another example is medecine .
Every medical condition is different and all advertisments for medical treatments have the additional advice to ask a doctor befor use .
Just the desire to be as healthy as the people that are shown causes the effect that buyers think they got a promise of better health after use .

If there is any disappointment after the use of an advertised product it is normally caused by expectations the consumer created according to the subconscious influence he or she was exposed to by seeing the advertisment but not at all because the advertisement made the product really seem have a quality that it does not carry with it .
