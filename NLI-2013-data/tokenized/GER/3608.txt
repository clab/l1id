In the city I live in you can find young people at every public place : in the streets , in the town center and on public playgrounds .
Often they hear loud music , disturb other people , drink alcohol or just damage something .

This introduction shows that I support the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities but instead they do no useful things .

But what are the reasons for the behaviour of the young people , why do the spend no time for helping .

One reason might be the numerous inventions which were made throughout the years .
Mainly the inventions for the freetime like the invention of the internet , the TV , or even the playstaion affect the young people 's free time activities .
Many young people have all of this inventions in their homes or even in their own rooms and they are used very much .
Thus there might be not enough time for helping the community .

Moreover in the modern socity one thing is very important : to earn money .
Money is very important for the young children as they want to afford the above named inventions or they want to wear expensive clothes .

The community service is not being payed or if it is payed it is payed it is payed worse .
In a part time job young people can earn enough money to fullfilmost of their dreams .
Thus the young people might work in a part time job instead of supporting the local community service .

Besides if young people participate in helping their community they are not free any more in their spare time .
They have to keep certain appointments at fixed times .

So all in all I agree with the statement .
