Is a broader knowledge going to increase once perspectives in business and life ?
Let us think about a child in school at the age of 15 .
In this case I would recomment that a child has to learn a wide range of subjects in order to become more intelligent and recieve a good knowlege from his school .

But regarding a young person , at the age of 16 or above , who would like to go to university it seems neccessary for me that students get a deeper knowledge about one specific field .

As everyone knows everyone is individual and has different interests in different subjects .
In regard to that : how can someone who does not like or is even not familiar to biology study this subject ?

In addition to that our environment needs people who have deep knowledges , for example in the pharma industry .
Only these people are able to create new medicines to help people with difficult diseases .
It is necessary that these persons are well informed about what they are doing otherwise it is a very risky operation .

Further more there could hardly be any competiton in our busines life if everyone has the same education without any specialization .
How could employees decide whether a person is suited or not for a job which expects deeper knowledge ?

And what about a person who is interested in maths , but this is the only thing this person is able to do ?
It would get lost in the big competition and would never have any chances in improving his unique skill .

As a conclusion I can say that specification is the only way to improve a persons skills and to keep competition alife .
People need specification as otherwise the unity and importace of a person would get lost and as a result of that one person would be unsatisfied , sad and helpless .
