I do not agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars around in twenty years than there are now .
In my opinion , the number of cars will either stay the same or increase .
There are several reasons which support my opinion .

First of all , I think that our society , at least in the First World , is so advanced and programmed on a continuing progress that we would not be happy about taking a step backwards by reducing the number of cars .
I could not imagine living without a car .
People in today 's society have gotten so used to having cars that they even rely on them in several cases .
A man , for example , who works in an office which does not have any connection with the public transport network cannot get to his office without a car .

Moreover , one can tell from the development concerning the car business that there has always been an increase of the number of cars since the invention of the first car .
This fact makes me suggest that this development will continue in the future as well .

Besides that point , there is also another reason which needs to be mentioned .
Even though people know about the environmental problems which car fumes cause and even though most of them are also aware of the fatal consquences this could have , such as pollution of the air and destruction of the ozone layer , thez do not intend to change anything .
Most of them simply get on with their lives , driving their cars as usual .
Consequently , it can be said that most people think of the consequences as still being far awaz from them and their personal fates .
They do not realize the disastrous consequences of their behaviour because they do not show up that clearly at the moment .

However , there is still an even more important reason why I do not think that the number of cars will decrease in the next twenty years .
In my opinion , there might be a point of time when more people actually start to worry about the environment and the effects of using cars .
Anyway , I do not think that this will cause the number of cars to shrink but that it will rather lead to an increase in research and development of new technology which prevents the car fumes to harm the environment .
