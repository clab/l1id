The matter of young people helping in communities has been discussed for many years and still heats up our discussions .

Young people are often declared to be the future and therefore feel responsible for it , but for sure it 's wrong to blame them for every negative tendency or development that can be found in nowadays society .

I think it cannot be denied any more that in former times people were much more engaged in their local sports club , church group or what kind of community ever .
But why has the number of interested youth decreased here ?
Are we just not as nice as our former generations ?
not as social turned ?

Of course not .

The reasons must be somewhere else .
Today the pressure on young people is much higher .
They are exspected to be successful in school , university , career etc ...
At the same time they 've become much more public by internet or modern mass communication .
Everybody is available everywhere , if one likes he can just go to the next town by his ( mostly ) own car and during holidays the majority can afford to fly away for holidays .
50 years ago this was unimaginable .
By greater mobility we gained access to many , many more things to do , places to visit and people to meet .

But THIS does create pressure .
People have the feeling of missing something when they just rest for a while .
So many new have-to-do 's have appeared , it 's not easy for communities to attract young people to get involved in community matters any more .
Who wants to work as a coach at the local football club with little children ?
Maybe even voluntarily ?
Who likes to organize social afternoons for the counties older residents just to name two examples for possible community work ?

These kind of community work is considered old fashioned and out of date .

I do n't say I like this tendeny , I only try to explain it .
Of course there 're still other positive examples which do not support my theses and I do know some personally .
In my community some youth are involved in organizing one day trips for little children for example .
But I do live in a small village in the country .
How 's life in big cities ?

All in one I agree with the given statement , but it 's too easy just too blame someone specific for this .
It 's not only the young people that changed , but rather our whole society .
