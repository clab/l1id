I do n't think travelling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way .
As I have a lot of travelling experince I am convinced that travelling by yourself is the best way to do it .
With doing so you have much more freedom because you can make decisions on your own and do n't have to consider someone else .
This also prevents you from possible arguments with the group or your travelling partner which could lead to a vacation you do n't enjoy fully .

Another important advantage , in consideration of a tour guide , is that you get to explore places on your own and do n't have to stick to a certain travel itinerary .
This offers you a lot more possibilities and you can stay at places you like and avoid the ones you do n't like .
Tour guides have their program which they run through every trip .
I think this is unpersonal .
When I am travelling I want an individual route that 's the perfect fit for me and gets the most out of my time .
Mostly you wo n't find this in a guided tour because it is designed to satisfy the needs of a broad range of people and a lot of times covers the really touristy spots .
I am not such a fan of this .
You get to know a country much better if you go to places where the local people are instead of all the tourists .

When travelling alone you are much more responsive to new people .
While I was travelling in Australia I met so many new people which I probably never would have talked to , if I would have been in a group .
But when you are by yourself you are more open for making new friends , just for the simple reason to not be alone all the time .
Furthermore it broadens your culture knowledge and understanding .

Last but not least it is more expensive to book a guided tour than to explore the country by yourself .
