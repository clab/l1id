Once I took an oral exams and it was not going as well as I expected .
In the end the professor said to me : `` I can see you have learned the topic but you have not studied it ! ''

What did he mean with this sentence ?
Well , I learned all the facts and examples from his lecture but during the exam I couldn ' t transfer them to the systems he asked me about - it just was n't enough .

So if someone asks me if it was more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than merely learning facts .
I would tell him the following : Depending in which field you are studying in facts and numbers change very rapidly over the years , so getting the whole concepts might be the better approach .
Then it is very easy to get certain facts using the world wide web , but getting the right use out of them or find the right application is a thing you have to learn and be trained with .

And then , if you understand the idea behind a process rather than learning the dull facts , the knowledge is preserved much better within your brain .
Most important of all if you get the ideas and concepts you can derive abstract methods that can adopted to new situations and systems .
Therefore they are more valuable than mere facts .
But as always it is n't as black and white as it may seem in the first place .
Allthough I would put the stress on understanding the whole picture more than just the details , facts and examples can help you especially during the learning process .

In the end Ideas and concepts backed with a few numbers and examples give you a round profile and help you being a good student and becoming a competent worker , scientist , engineer or what else you choose to become .
