I do not think that this statement is right for all the young people nowadays .
I would say that it is like it ever was in history .
Some people engage for their surrounding and some others are not interested in it .

You cannot say that all the young people do not give enough time to others .
That would impline that for exampple 50 years ago they did .
It is right that it would be good if young people would engage more for others , but that is not a specific problem of young people but of the society .
There are not only the youngs who do not care about the needs and problems of other people but also the grown-ups .
I know a lot of examples where people had a big probleme like an accident .
They could not do their housework on their own , but nobody out of the neighbourhood offered help to this people .
At the moment I am doing a course so thst I get educated to visit and help old persons who cannot get along on their own and there I here lots of terrible stories about the ignorance of young AND older people .

But I think if there would be more offers for courses perhaps more people would engaged .
Lots of people want to help , but are afraid to do something wrong .
They think that for example by staying some hours with an old helpless lady they could make a terrible mistake so that the woman falls down and breaks a leg or kind of that and in the worst case dies .
So they do not offer help for not getting in such a situation .
It is the task of the government of a state to offer courses to the people so that the people get the confidence in themselves to help others .

It is not always the point that people are not willing to do something but they do not feel able to do it .
If they would feel lots of them would be willing to help others and spend time for them although you never should expect too much .
