Today it is very difficult to invent new things or find new ways to be succesful .
But what is the best way to be successful ?
Should you take risks ?
And for which persons it is easier to take risks ?

In my opinion it is not easy for an unsuccessful person to take a risk .
Becauso there must by any reasons because this person is unsuccessful .
So perhaps an unsuccessful person already took some risks which were not successful .
So they are in a kind afraid of taking new risks .
If the new idea is wrong they will lost again .

And this is different at successful people .
They have a lot of success and for them it is no problem to take risks .
They are not afraid .
If the risk was wrong there is a base under them and nearly nothing could happen to them .
But one reason why successful people are successful is that they take risks .

For this I will give an example .
You have to imagine you are the CEO at a big company and at the moment the number one with your products in the world .
But there are several smaller companies which are coming closer and closer .
One day a customer want you to create a new product , but with your machines this is not possible to take the order .
The customer sais that he will go to the other companies if you do not built or create the necessary machienes .
Taking the order will cost a lot of money and the success is not sure .
What would you do ?

I think it is much easier to take the order for a company with very much success .
They know they can take risks because if the order will not be good it will not be all over .

It is different for a CEO who 's company does not work right .
On the one hand the company needs the order but on the other hand it is the end of the company if the order will not be successful .

Another reason is that successful people always want more .
So they do not think about as much as unsuccessful people .

So I think it is easier to take risks if you are a successful pearson .
