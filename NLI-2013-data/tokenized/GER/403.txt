In my opinion it is in general better when you have a broad knowledge of academic subjects .

Firstly , in many academic subjects , you need a overview about several topics to understand the relationship within one topic and between different themes .
I study economics at the University of Applied Sciene in Nuremberg .
For example in Finance I have to know the theoretic basics in Finance but I also need the knowledge of mathematics , tax and law .
So I am not only specified on one subject .
During the semster , we have many differnt subjects which all stands in relationship to economics .
For example , marketing , finance , law , tax , accouting .
english , general mangament etc .

Secondly , it is not sure , that someone always get a job in that subject that he has studied .
So it is possible , that he had studied Finance but now works in a marketing department .
The situation on tte work market is not so good and so it is better to have a broad knowledge .
My friend studied logistics and now he is working as banker , but while his studytime he must vistited lectures of finance and assurance .
So he has not that problems to work in this field .

But there are also subjects in which it is better , when you are specified .
For instance in medical : It is not possible , that every doctor knows everything .
You need someone for skin deases but also someone who has knowlegde about cancer .
In this case it is of advantage , when you have a specific knowledge .
On the other hand it so for the human brain impossible all to know .

In a conclusion it is to say , that it depends on the subject and how deep the subect is related to others .
On the one hand it can be better to have a wide knowledge , on the other hand it can be useful to be specialise in one academic field .
