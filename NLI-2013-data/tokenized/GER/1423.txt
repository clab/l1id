I disagree with the presented statement .
I think it is better to have an specific knowledge about an academic subject than having a wide range of academic knowledge .

To underline my opinion I would like to refer some arguments and examples .

First , I would like to refer my own experiences when I was studying law at university .
There was a mass of students that started with me in my first semester .
About 300 students had for several years the same courses , so we were all taught the same general subjects .
There was no difference between the students , though the number of students was so high .
Is it possible that 300 people like to be taught in the same way ?
This was something that disturbed me very much .
In order to get rid of that academic unity I refused to listen to each lecture and started to read books on subjcts I was interessted in and got specialised by myself .

Second , you have to keep in mind that you need to get a job .
I think most of the jobs are very specialised and you will need certain skills and knowlegde to get your work done .
This is why you have to specify in one or two subjects before .
Then it would be to late for you to specialise .
A as result you have to conclude , that it is better to specialise early in order to get a good job .

Third , of course I have to admit that there are so many things that are interessting to be dealt in class .
In that general way it is granted that you also learn about things you were not interested in ( yet ) .
Perhaps you find out more about other subjects , that you did not get in contact with , because you were specialised .

But neverless I would like to prefer to specialise myself and pay its tribute not to get into touch with other more general topics .
I think when you are really interested in arts , music or anything else you can still read books about that or occupy in any other way yourself with general topics in your freetime .
