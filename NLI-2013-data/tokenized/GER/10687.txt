SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THE TASKS OF LIFE

In the following I want to take issue on why people wanting to be successful should try new and risky things .

Where would we be if people wanting to make progress did not affront new challenges ?
Is confronting yourself with new challenges and unknown tasks not always connected with taking a risk ?
So this means , taking risks is what makes people advance and this again I consider as being successfull .

Experiences like going to a new school , moving in a new apartment and having a new neighbourhood or start a new job or just do some bungee jumping , give the person carrying out the action a new point of view of life .
The new living circumstances challenge him to get out of old patterns of behaviour and she/he will start to reflect on his captivites , no matter what captivity it is a social , professional or just a physical one .
Having this new point of life permits you to enhance your horiyon and allows zou to go steps further .

All in all , this means to me going succesfully through life .
