When people travel to cities and other places worth seeing , they may make use of a guided tour during their stay .
There are good reasons for having a guided tour in a group , but personally I believe that traveling on your own has greater benefits .

This means that you will be with them until the end of the trip .

A further reason why traveling alone or with friends is better that a guided tour is that you will likely have better memories from the trip .
This is because when people travel without a guide they will get into personal situations , rather that group situations .
