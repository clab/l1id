In my opinion it is definitely preferable to have a broad knowledge of several academic subjects to specializing in one single area .
The most important aspect to me is the variaton in topics which one specific subject can not supply .
If - regarding the academics - I had only one topic with which I would have to spend my entire working time I would eventually get fed up with the subject , as variation is the key to keeping me interested .

Specialization limits your point of view whereas a broad knowledge of different subjects enables you to understand different people with different academic backgrounds .
Furthermore specializing in only one topic makes it less probable to meet new people with different backgrounds at all as you will not leave your main field of interest very frequently .

Broadening your skills also might have some positive effects on your social environment .
You might find more friends and have more success with the other sex as you will appear more interesting not being a ` freak ' who is only interested in one single thing but being able to look like a person with different facettes and diverse interests .

In discussions with collegues , friends or other person at you will certainly have a less harder time being educated in more than one topic as you might easily find arguments and examples in your various subjects .

To summarize all the mentioned points make it by far more attractive for me to gain knowledge in not only one subject but many different , although one should try no to have too many interests , as superficial knowledge in many fields of mind also will not bring you very far .
