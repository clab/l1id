I do not believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years from now .
My doubts are particularly fueled by the aspect of mobility which I believe to be having an even gaining influence on our lives .
In the face of incessant globalization , people will most probably be more and more forced to be flexible in a physical sense .
Both the ability and the willingness to move and to have a long way to work will be essential in the world of tomorrow even more than they are today .
Higher mobility will naturally require more cars .

The main argument against the continuing spread of vehicles may and can be seen in the environmental issues affected by their use .
The certainly ever-growing awareness of these often ferocious environmental downsides will for sure have a long distance effect on people bying cars .
But I believe that this will only be the case if car manufacturers will not succeed in developing cars with considerably less harmful environmental side-effects than they have today .
If these corporations , however , do achieve this goal on an effective scale , and there is at least some reason to believe they do , I am convinced people will not be deteriorated from bying cars in any way .

But I believe not only the improved environmental issues to be a potentially enhancing factor on car sales .
Looking at the technological development of the last hundred years , it seems quite plausible to assume that cars will keep becoming less and less expensive , at least as far as low - and mid level cars are concerned .
I believe that the car will not only pursue but also broaden its dominance as a mass product , increasingly reaching more and more potential customers .

Naturally , my argument is only convincing if the automobile industry finds a both affordable and effective way of reducing the devastating effects of cars with regards to air pollution , i.e. global warming .
One may , of course , doubt whether the industry is willing and capable of reaching this goal .
If not , customers will certainly shy away more and more from the car as an every-day item that we use even where not necessary .
In the case of the latter , people will , I believe , be way more sensible in their conduct in twenty years , probably to a degree at which this sensitivity even effects their consuming habits .
In the face of global warming , I would certainly support such a change .
