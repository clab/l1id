contrary to popular belief , there are many people who are quite successful although they did not invent new things and therefore had no risk , such as people who inherited a fortune .
however , i am convinced that you normally have to be innovative to be successful in life .
i will try to explain this with the help of economic and political successful persons as well as persons who lead a perfectly well marriage .

firstly , people who succeeded in earning a lot of money , such as bosses of big companies , must often find a new way to sell things .
if you take reinhold wuerth , a famous economist and one of the richest men in the world , this becomes quite clear ; for example , he sells highly specialiced manufacturing tools .
certainly , he had to find this gap in the market and it was a great risk to sell such specialiced tools at the beginning .

secondly , successful politians have to be extraordinary and thus have to have new ideas .
of course , it is also critical to have a common knowledge , but the crucial point is to be innovative .
imagine a politician who just acts and thinks in a way everyone else do .
he would never become famous and no one would know him .
however , this indludes to take responsibily for others and this also means to take risks .

finally , one must take into consideration that people who are happily married are successful in some way .
it is a well-known fact that finding an appropriate partner is highly difficult .
people who found there true love had to take the risk of failure .

to draw a conclusion , i would say that there are many different ways to be successful .
however , regardless of which way you consider as really successful , you have to meet the general criteria which i have just mentioned .
