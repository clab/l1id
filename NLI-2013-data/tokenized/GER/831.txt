In university I am often confronted with this kind of question from my friends or other students .
Of cource both , a broad knowledge of several academic subjekts and a special knowledge on one subject are important .
In my opinion one has to find the right balance between these to options .

On the one hand , it is more important to have a broad knowledge of many different subtjects in early stage of studying .
I try to illustrate this on an example .
I am studying geography .
This main field consists of many different fileds such as geomorpholgie or climateologie .
When you start studying geographie you even do not know about the existence of these fields .
This is the reason why you first have to get known all the different parts and fields of geography .
You first have to find your field of interest On the other hand it is really important to specialize on one specific subject when you achieved a certain amount of broad knowledge in the second part of your studying .
After you finished university you have to find a job .
Therefore it is essential that you are specialized in on certain field .
Companies do not nead people who just have got a broad education .
To come back to my example of geography , the special subject of geography `` geogaphic information systems '' is a really uprising field .
Persons who specialice in this field will have it easy to find a job when they leave university .

In conclusion I think the right answer to this question depends on the point of time .
First of all you have to reach a certain amount of broad knowledge such as given in the Bachelors degree .
Later on , it is important to specialize in your field of interest such as given in a Maters programm .
