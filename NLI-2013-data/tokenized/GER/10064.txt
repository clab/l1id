In my opinion , both can be positive .
The situation determines if continuing doing things you know is the better way or if trying new ways leeds to more success .
If you for example run a business like a bar , which has a lot of confident customers who are absolutely satisfied with the atmosphere , the furniture , the menu and the service , you would not really thing about changing anything .
Changing this already well working bar would always mean you risk losing costumers who may dislike the changes , and it will also cost you a lot of money .
But if you run a bar where customers keep complaining about things , you may very well consider changing something and become more successful doing so .

On the other hand , i think that even when you run a business which already seems to be perfect , it is never a bad thing to dare something new , because the world is changing so why should you refuse changing ?
As a bar owner , i would rather prefer to lose some boring , old customers to serve open-minded new customers instaed , just because it is more exciting .

It is clear that deciding something new is always risky , but that is what an exciting life is a about .
In addition to that trying new things mean that you make a lot of new experiences .
Being experienced will never be a bad thing when it comes to being successful .
You probably have dealt with a lot of problems in your life if you have had a lot of different experiences , so you know better how to handle them then somebodzy unexperienced would .
This is why i would prefer trying new things in order to gain a lot of experiences .
