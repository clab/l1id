Considering the statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' you definitly have to consider the aspects of money .
To own a car and to drive it frequently is already quite expensive and people are always complaining about high petrol prices , In addition to that it seems that they continue to increasing constantly .
Therefore it could be possible that some people think about using different ways of transport instead of driving a car .

However , in my opinion there will not be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .
Most of the people that will be allowed to drive cars in 20 years are already living nowadays and they grow up with the comfort of having a car in nearly every familiy .
I think if you get once used to cars and all the comforts they provide you will not like to miss them .
There is , for example , the independency that a car provides .
If you decide to go somewhere , you do not have to look up the schedule of a bus or a train , you do not have to wait untill the tain leaves or search for a possibility how to get to the trainstation .
If you have got a car you can just go outdoors take your key and get away .
Moreover the car is very practical if you want to get to a place without wasting lots of time .
By car you can go more directly , because there are more streets and roads available than ways for a train , and therefore it is possible to save time .
To save time is one aspect that seems to be quit important in modern times .
You can easily observe this if you count how often people mention the sentence `` time is money '' .

In conclusion I would say that people will not give up their cars the only aspects when cars will probably be used less than nowadys is for long journeys .
I think therefore people will use flights more frequently .
