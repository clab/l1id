The statement `` Succesfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing waht the already know how to do well. '' has several examples in the scientifique history that show that it is true .

One of them is Albert Einstein , who had at the beginning of his professional live strong difficulties to find a suitable job .
He ignored his friends who where arguing not to change his job and went to an university in Berlin where he developed the theory of the relative time .

Another example ( where the meaning of successful is different ) are the attempts to kill hittler during the second world war .
These people knew how to survive in the nazi society , but they took the risks of being killed because they believed in what they did .
From the point of view we have today they where succesful .

Another side of the same medal is the recent economy .
The value of the firms only depends on the their success at the stock fairs .
As result the managers are trained to push these courses and they do n't care about there employees ( it 's not a risky behaviour , because everyone does ) .
In this case success is a question of the definition .

But there is another way to success too .
Doing continiously the work you know how to do well will give you a smaller but steady flow of success .
Because people can rely on you it will have an positive influence on your work .

My personal way to success is a combination of personal and professional success .
At the one hand you must have the possibility to have i.g. a family .
That 's why you need professional success , with risky decisions that will you allow to earn more money .
On the other hand personel success is never a result of risks .
