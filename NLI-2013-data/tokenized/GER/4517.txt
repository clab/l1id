Before thinking about the truthfullness of advertisement , one has to distinguish between the different forms of advertising .
To keep this Essay short I will focus on two forms , informative advertising and emotional advertising .

Emotional advertisement tries to connect certain emotions and a certain image with a specific product .
For example Marlborough cigarettes have always been associated with freedom .
Because of this definition of emotional advertising , it cannot be truthfull or untruthfull .
People will buy a product because it evokes certain feelings and emotions .
In effect the advertisement of certain products is actually part of the product itself .
The reason for this is that most people would not buy a product such as a Louis Vuitton handbag if it would n't have an image of luxury connected to it .
This image of luxury is only upheld by advertisement .
Only the customers know at the end if the image and the emotions they acquired are as good as suggested by the advertisement .
I do not think this can be generalised in emotional advertisement .

Informative advertisement on the other hand informs the potential customers about a certain product , in order to convince them that it is the best product they can get .
This form of advertisement can of course be truthfull or untruthfull .
By witholding facts about a product or by actually lying about a product it is possible for firms to get an advantage over their competitors .
But in general , lies do not last very long .
It is not wise for companies to raise expectations they cannot uphold .
If a company dissapoints its customers they will never buy this companies products again .
In my opinion companies exaggerate the benefits of their products only so much as is expected by the customers .
Customers expect advertisement to be moderately exaggerated and are not dissapointed if they buy such a product .

So in my opinion advertisements do not make products seem much better than they are , because customers expect advertisements to be exaggarated .
