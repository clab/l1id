In this essay , I will discuss , whether it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , or to favor Specialization .

To my mind , specializing in one subject is an old-fashioned way of thinking and is not favorable nowadays .
The main reason for that is the job situation of our modern society .
In the generation of my parents it was common to study one topic , then get a job and being working in this job for their whole working life .

Today , things have changed .
Mostly because of economical means , the job situation is not that reliable as is once was .
In the last decades , the frequency of hiring and firing employees has increased and is still increasing .
The consequence of this development is that people often have to change jobs .

The only way of surviving in this new circumstances is to be as flexible as one can be .
If you now choose one special field to study , there will be no guarantee for you to find a job in this sector , especially not for your whole working life .

Only if you are planning to do research after having finished your studies it might make sense to concentrate on a specific topic .
To find new ideas and to really change the world you cannot study every possible subject in detail , because it is neither efficient nor manageable .
But this is definitly not the most common case .

And of course do companies like employees who are very well trained , but for you yourself it is important to remain flexible and to be able to learn new things , which will be necessary in the future working life .

Studying should be a preparation for your life and the only way to accomodate your studies to the modern job situation is to do your studies with wide-spread interest .
