I clearely disagree with this statement above for the following reasons :
Maybe on a first impression , young people often seem to have more fun because they are able to take part in activities like doing sports , going to parties and traveling .
Clearely , some of these activities ca n't be done by older people mainly for physical reasons .
But on the other hand , there are still many activities remaining that are even more suitable to be done by older people : First of all , there are characteristic ways to engage in sports for older people , like hiking , swimming and playing golf and chess .
They even may have the advantage of perhaps having practiced this kind of sport for several years and can now acchieve greater , more satisfieing success .

Second , there are a lot of opportunities to meet other people in several clubs or on bus tours .
In these occassions they may even meet people that share the same interests .

Finally , a lot of old people start traveling all after the world once their done with their career .
At this point , it is important to mention , that in an older age one has a much greater amount of freetime he can use for any of those activities he likes most .
That 's due to the fact , that in childhood and youth one has to go to school , to study or to work in a job .
I personally know older people , who really began travelling all over the world because they finally had the time to do so .

So it is obvoius , that there many possibilies for older peo So finally , one can conclude , that you can only answer this question for yourself , depending how `` fun '' is definded and how it can be measured in your eyes .
