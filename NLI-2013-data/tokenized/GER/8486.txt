According to the statement , that it is better for students to understand what they learn , namely the concepts and the ideas , rather than learning facts by heart , is convincing to me .

In general it is more effective to a student to learn ideas and concepts , as they will last longer in their memory .
I can emphasize this by my own experience , as it s very difficult to memorize facts .

Learning dates for instance for a History course does not help a lot in understanding why historical events happened or what effects they could have on our contemporary time .
Facts also does not help the students in the future , when they leave the university .
When entering the job world , it is much more helpful for a student to know the basic concepts and ideas , which he or she can apply in his or her job .
Taking the example of the History course again , it would be more logic , if the student learn the main differences between the epoches or the essential research methods , which historians need to accurately do their work .

The studies should provide a framework , within the students can work by their own .
Some lecturers would argue that it is nevertheless important to know some facts .
I agree with that , but learning facts should not be the main part of the class work .
There should be rather more interchanging action in the class , so that maybe old concepts will be discussed critically and new ideas can develop .

Understanding the ideas and concepts provides the student with the ability to use them and work independently .
This should be the prior aim of every university , namely to educate the student to an independent thinker .
