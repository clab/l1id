In general , I do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
However I would maybe change this statement into : Young people nowadays are not given enough time to helping their communities .

I think that today many people , particularly young people , just do not have the time to care about their communities .
They are involved into too many other activities .
The pressure from school for example and all the other possibilities and offers provided by advertisment do distract them from any social activities or projects .

Another reason why I approve of this statement is that I think young people do not really have too many possibilities to get involved into any social project .
The communities do actually rather care about current problems with policy and administration , so that even they are not really able to spend too much time on thinking about involving youngsters .

The only opportunity for helping the communities , which is taken by most young men , is doning the civil service or going to the military after finishing school .
But even this opportunity is actually not taken voluntarily but one is actually forced by government to do any of these two services .

Of course if young people would be more interested in helping their communities they could maybe gain some access to some helping organzations .
But as long as this interest does not exist and as long as the communities do not offer any urgent projects to them , communities wont get any more help from young people .

Most young people do care about their families and friends very much .
And if anybody has a problem most young people are willing to help .
Consequently you see that there is not a lack of common interest but there is just a lack of connection between young people and communities .
