I agree with the statement that people who try new things and take risks are more successful than people who just stay on the level they are already on .

In my opinion people who want to be successful should be creative and open for new things .
Furthermore they should believe in themselves and should not get insecure , if other persons do not agree with their opinion or way of proceeding .
For instance , many big inventions such as cars or planes would n't exist this time , if there would not have been somebody who was affected to new things , had the will to research and to take the risk of failing .
Probably , when Daimler invented the first car most people thought he would be crazy and did not support his plans .
He had the risk to fail , but as we can see today it turned out as a big invention and he became famous .

However , if people would n't be risky and open-minded the human nature would n't be on this level it is right now .
The society needs people who are interested in new things to develop and to grow up .
If we all would stay on the level which we are good in and do not increase our abilities , we still would live in wooden houses as centuries ago .
