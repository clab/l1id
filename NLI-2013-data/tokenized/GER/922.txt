In my opinion there is a need for specialists and generalists .
With generalists I refeere to people who have a broad knowledge .
If everyone is specializing on his topic no one has an overview of the total problem and on the other hand if all students focus on many academic subjects there wo n't be any specialists to do specialized work .

For students there sould be a choise wether to get a broad knowledge or specialiye on one subjet .
It is important that one can figure out what suits him or her best .
For me it is specializing on a specific subject , but I still want to have knowledge of the surrounding fields of study .
If there is quite a broad interest in subjects and a specialisation in one topic at the same time , it is possible to link one thing from one field to the specialised field and eventually come up with something new and inovative .

I think there are also some slight differences between the fields of study .
For business students it is neccesary to know a lot of a huge varyity of topics , but the need to go into detail is not that big .
This is different for students from engineering .
To bring the research or production forward it is vital to know all details of existing solutions .
So an engineering student must focus on one topic if he likes to contribute to that subject .
But still with specializing on one specific topic he sould not forget about the view of the total .

If the statement is taken as a general statement I have to say that I do not agree with it , but it is correct in specific fields of academics .
During my work expirience I saw that sometimes it has to many specialists and ofthen they forget about what the whole picture is .
In there cases the statement could lead some people to be a generalist .
These generalists then could help the specialist to work to gether and direct them to a good solution .

The statement has some truth withing but I ca n't agree with it totaly .
