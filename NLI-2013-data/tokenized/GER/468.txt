There are some advantages in beeing versed regarding a specific subject as well as having knowledge about a variety of subjects .

It is very common today that people occupy only a small vatriety of subjects .
Such people are called isle - people in Germany .
This means that people do only very well , when they work in their special subject .
To my mind this is one of the most frighten development in German economics as well as in German society .

As far as I can see , the human beeing is such a complex construct that must be challengend often .
People should be flexible regarding different subjects to maintain the individual skills and characteristics which make them unique .

I try to get knowledge of a variety of subjects , for example : medicine and english , but also sports , music and photography .
It is a big advantage , for instance when you live by your own , like I do .
Let me explain .
When I moved into my own appartment I was able to paint the rooms by myself and to drive the lorry for my cargo by myself .
Therefore I saved a lot of money by avoiding plumbers or any other speical workers .

In reference to the job situation in my country it is also very important to have a wide variety of knowledege and to be , moreover flexible .
Of course some vacancies in Germany require a lot of different skills .
Because I do n't want to become unemployed one time ; I tried maintain , or precisely enhance my knowledge .
A person versed in only one subject can only work in this category of jobs .
It is the only thing you can influence to get a job in different spaces of business .
So why do n't you do so ?

Finallly I draw the conclusion that wide knowledge is not only necessary regarding profession , but moreover regarding your private life .
One reason is , that the life itself requires also a lot of different skills , like beeing friendly , lovefull or even to be organized in reference to the household .
