No risk no fun

I agree the statement `` Successful people try new things and take risk '' .
In my mind it is so , to .
When you thing you like do new stuff you need a liddelbit the kick .
That is the big point what I need .
For exsample I like to go to a big city like New York .
I was never in this town I dont no from the city .
But I like go to the city .
Thats fun I stay every time for proplems .
I need eat a hood offer my head .
The ather side I can go dow .
I dont gat waht I need .
I m die that the side ot risk now I have a nice life .
May be a sport exsample what I can say about boxing .
You have two side the winner and loser .
Eath of one bring the risk with same he can lose .
He risk that he is the loser .
Next exsample the wall street you put money in funds , well you this make a good job .
Dont for get the risk look like lose money .
Thanks for
