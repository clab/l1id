Every year we get older and older and we do n't care of the changes which happen .
We often do n't notice the alteration brought by the passing of time .
But in reality we should wonder if our life is not better when we are young .
Do n't people usually think that young people enjoy life more than older people do ?
In this essay , we are first going to show the aspects of enjoying life as an elderly person and then we are going to talk about life when we are young .

First we are considering the fact if elderly people reallz enjoy their lifes .
On the one hand , elderly people are often lonely and have few friends .
They live together in special houses where no young people are .
People in such homes often lose their pleasure in life , because they are disconnected from the outstanding world .
On the other hand elderly people are less attractive than younger people .
They have also more health trouble and are often disprised by a lot of people .
Additionally , these people always live together and see no other people .
This is why they also become more and more sad , because they notice that their are rejected by society and that nobody cares about them .

On the whole I would say that it is very difficult for elderly people to enjoy life , because they often are very lonely and have few friends who look after them .

Now we are going to see that young people can enjoy their live .
First we can say that young people meet a lot of other people .
They are always with friends , doing sport , playing games or enjoying their life .
A lot of the time is spent in places where a lot people are and this gives those people the opportunity to meet new people .
Secondly , young people are more attractive than elderly people are and they have no difficulty to find a boy-friend or a girl-friend .
They are usually good looking which causes that they can better enjoy their live .
Thirdly they are well-off , are in a good shape and health and they can do what they want .
Their strength allows them to travel all over the world and see new places .
Furthermore there are not many limits which prevent them from beeing happy , because these young people have the whole life in front of them .
These people often do n't have to worry , because their live will last for a long time .

To conclude we see that , as time goes by , we change and that these changes affect our perception of life .
When we are young we meet a lot of people , we are more attractive and we are well-off , which are all things which disappear with the fact of becoming older .
This is why I agree with the statement and find that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
