I assume that people who are willing to try new things and take risk are more likely to be successful .
Taking a risk also means that there is a possibily that one is going to fail .
Therefore people who take risks are also more likely to fail than those who do not take risks at all .

It also makes sense to me to hold on to a traditional method if people have been successful using this method for generations .
If one learns from a person who has been really successful and has achieved a lot , it would be nonesense not to use the information in order to do a good job yourself .

Trying to be successful by doing what one already knows well is definetely safer than putting oneself at risk .
Still work as well as techniques have approved throughout history which shows that people who have been innovative gained success for example Henry Ford with his first appearance of mass production in the automobile industry .

In this world of globalization one has to try new things in order to succeed and it is also helpful if one is able to adjust to new conditions easily .

To my mind the people who enjoy their work are mostly successful and to enjoy the job should also be the most important goal when choosing a job .
Poeple who only do what they are told and keep on doing so for years are more likey to get bored while working .
Therefore it is also a personal experience to try new things and take risks .
If one really wants to be successful in business , creativity and the willingness to take a risk are two very important character traits one should not miss .
It is reasonable to try out new things because if you are not going to do it somebody else will and thus will also gain the success .
We live in a world that constantly changes and it is always better to be the one who initiates the changes than the one who is forces to adapt to the changes .
