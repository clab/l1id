In life everyone tries to be sucessful and is working hard so their dreams will come true .
However , I believe that the key to success is to have innovative ideas and not to be afraid for new things .

First , your enviromment is changing around you all the time , so it 's always important to keep up with it and be informed about the changes in it .
However to be successful you even have to be better than the others and put more efford into it .
This means that you have to work harder and sometimes try new methods to work through something .

Second , I believe that it 's important to trust his own skills and believe in his work even if they are risky or different from the normal way .
These ways make your work special and put even more work into it .
New ideas or ways can improve your work from other and lead to success .
For example a new software or a new technique can effect the whole industrie .

Third , if you only do what you already can do there is no moving forward and you stuck somewhere .
This means that other people with the same knowledge can replace you or can turn your work into something unimportant by having an even better idea .
For example a product nobody wants to buz because someone else 's product has an even better effect Although success comes with a lot of hard work and with being creative and innovative , success can open a lot of different doors like money , self-conficence or happiness .
So in conclusion I think it 's important to be risky and able to try new things to reach his dreams and be successful .
In fact everyone what 's to be so .
