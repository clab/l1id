Personally , I agree with the statement that the number of cars would probably decrease in the future , as the contemporary situation already provides hints that the trend is going towards this direction .

First of all , the recent development of the gas price , shows that driving a car becomes more and more expensive .
Even today more and more people try to avoid to use their if it is not necessary .
Moreover , already today there are people who ca n't afford having a car .
I think that it is very likely that this trend will continue in the future .
Consequently it seems sensitive , as having a car becomes more and more expensive , that even the number of cars might decrease .

Moreover , cars cause pollution .
People are already aware that it is detrimental to the environment and thus in consequence also to health if the traffic is not reduced .
Campaigns try to raise the awareness something has to change .
Thus I can imagine that measures have to be taken to reduce the traffic .
One of the simplest is to reduce the number of cars .
Governments must and will have to take action , hence it appears reasonable that they will try anything to obtain a reduction of the number of cars .
One possibility to reduce the number of cars might be to raise the taxes which would in the end also make driving expensive , so that people might no use more public transports .
However , I can also imagine that as there is a need to reduce the number of cars in order to protect the environment , the costs for public transports might be lowered thereby encouraging more and more people to avoid buying a car .
This trend can already be observed in the big cities .
Car sharing and a stronger use of public transports such as subway and buses have become common hints that the number of cars is decreasing .

However , although I believe that the number of cars will decrease in the future , it is also possible that this does not happen .
A new technology based on regenerable resources that makes cars less dangerous for the environment may keep the number of cars stable .

We will see
