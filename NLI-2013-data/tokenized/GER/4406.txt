I agree to the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
To my mind , this is a typical but natural problem of advertisment .
Showing an obvious benefit of buying the product , or even present a brand to a new market , advertisment is designed to let the selling rates increase .
And that is why advertisment only announces the advantages of a product , but not the disadvantages or problems that may occur if using it .
Moreover , the designer of the advertisment is not necessarily interested in the benign of the user who buys the product , despite , he or she just wants to sell it .

To show this problem , I will make two examples of advertisement : Everybody knows that chocolate tastes sweet and delicious on the one hand , but if you eat to much of it , you will get fat .
Nevertheless , the advertisement only deals with the delicious taste or may show a famous person - who is of course not fat at all - eating the chocolate product which shall be bought .
Another , very obvious example for an advertisement exaggerating the use of the product is the advertisement for washing powder : If you use one special brand of washing powder , your clothes will get cleaned much better than bz using another product .
And the white T-shirts in the advertisement are as white one can hardly imagine .

But despite of the negative effects of advertisement , there are positive one 's , too .
Without advertisement you get no idea of the variety of products you are able to buy .
And as you know the problems of advertisement , you can judge it better .
I think every adult , and also most of the teenagers know that not everything advertisement provides is true .
Nevertheless the product may have an advantage .
And often you realize new products which you maybe searching for only by the advertisement .

In conclusion , although most advertisement present products better than they really are , it is not so bad many people belief .
And moreover : You do not have to buy these products .
