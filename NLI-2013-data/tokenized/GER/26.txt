In my oppinion whether to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject depends on the skills you already posses and the stadium of your study .

My suggestion is to visit a lot of different and widespread spectrum of classes in the first and second year of your studies .
This will definitly help you to build up a solid fundament of overall knowledge and basic skills .

Perhaps , when beginning your studies you are not quite sure in which area or specific subject you want to specialize in the future .
Therefore it is helpful to get an insight into many subjects in order to find out about your strengths and interests .

After this period of orientation , I clearly recommend you to specialize on a certain subject .
Until now you should have already gained a fundamental basic knowledge and a clear view of what your interests look like .
So now it is time to enhance your skills in your field of interest .
It is very important to gather detailed knowledge about your specific subject , because that is what will make the difference between you and someone with general knowledge .
This is your advantage .

For instance , if you later want to apply for a job in industry or at a research facility , it is necessary to be provided with good specific knowledge and skills .
Otherwise your employer may think that you might not have unique strenghts or interests and chose someone else .
Today it is very important to be an expert in your field of study in order to compete with others .

By specializing on a certain issue you show that you are able to concentrate on one topic and that you are able to go into detail .
Provided with these attributes you will stand out of the masses and you are thus well prepared for future challenges .
