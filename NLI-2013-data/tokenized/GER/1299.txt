The issue at hand is whether it is better to have a broad academic education or to specialize in certain academic disciplines or fields .

On the one hand , there are good reason for a variety of academic experiences .
If you receive a broader eduction , your academic background will help you to be able to work in different kind of job .
For example , if somebody has not only studied medicine but business administration as well , this person will have a lot of opportunities on the job market .
He or she can work in a clinic as well as in a consulting firm .

Furthermore , different academic fields provide different approaches to solve problems or to describe the world .
Being able to see several views , somebody will gain a general view of eduction and science .
For example , a student who is a candidate for a degree in economics but who also does attend some extracurricular courses in psychology , will be able to better understand why poeple in economic theories act the way they do .

On the other hand , it is neccessary to develop a certain profession .
That is why somebody should focus on one academic discipline in particular .
Today there is a very strong competition at the labor market .
A student who does not specialize in one or two subjects probably will not be able to succeed in a highly competitive environment .
For example recruiters of leading investment banks cannot employ somebody who does not have a detailed knowledge about certain topics .

Moreover , time you spend on trying to get broad academic skills , cannot be used to spezialize in one particlur topic .
This is a trade-off-problem .
When I also attend extracurricular courses , there is - in consequence - less time to deal with those courses that are neccessary to receive a degree .
This could also lead to the aspect that is mentioned above .

Finally , after considering all these pros and cons , I feel that the very best is to focus on a certain academic discipline and to specialize .
Maybe one extracurricular course can be attended each term .
This will provide a solid education and good opportunities , but will use the broad supply of a college or a university in an effective way as well .
