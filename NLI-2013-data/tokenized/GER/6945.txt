The car use int he 20th century continuinlgy increases with each year .
In countries like the United Sates an average family will own at leats two cars , since there is no other way in order to get from place to place .
Unless restrictions are made on how many cars allowed within a household , the amount of cars in twenty years will not decrease , but possibly even increase .

As the prices of cars becomes cheaper and cheaper , more people can afford to buy cars and therefor will take this advantage .
In many countries there is no other way to get from palce to place unless you own a car , because of the long travle distances .
Just looking at the raise in traffic , almost everywhere in this world , prooves that there are a lot more cars on the street and that the number of cars is not going to be declining .
As long as the public transportation in many countries remains weak and possibly even expensive , on the long run buying a car will do more for one .
In many states the public transportation is terrible , there are only a few busses thta drive to the local area , and that every thrity to sixty minutes .
If people need to be ontime somewhere they wo n't rely on a bus to bring them there , especially if it wo n't even binrg you too close to your destination .
Systems need to be created such as the U-Bahn , Bus , and Tram system in Vienna or even the New York subway system that allows people to get form place to place in a resonable amount of time and under good circumstances .
Only if people start to use public transporation and their own two feet , will the car use decrease and that outlook is not comming up soon .
Teenagers can already get thier lisence with 16 and 17 in many countires , which only increases the car use in the world .
If every teen in this world has the possibility of driving a car or even half the teens in this world , that would mean that the car use would most probably double .
Car use will only stop is emasures are taken against it .
THe fact that cars are used is n't bad but very understandable , yet cars that not friendly to the environmetn should be created , such as electrically run cars , which would be more expensive , which would also cut down rates on car use .
