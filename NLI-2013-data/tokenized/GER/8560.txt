At the beginning I would like to give a short definition for the three terms ideas , concepts and facts .
Facts as the numbers and dates behind ideas , concepts and theories .
For if for example the `` theory of adverse selection '' was published in 1957 by Milton Freeman , the facts are 1957 and Milton Freeman .
The idea and the concept are the problem of adverse selection and the influence it has on economic problems .

My definition leads me to the opinion that I am supporting the statement in some cases , for example in the field of business adminsitration , especially in Marketing .
For instance is the 4P concept about formulating a strategy for bringing a product into the market .
To use this theory in practice , it is not important to know when and who someone established this theory .
It is more important to know what the general idea is , the facts would only be a nice add on , in which nobody would be really interested .

In the field of economics it is somehow different .
As theoretical concepts are the results of an idea a person had , it is quite important to know when and why someone concluded his or her ideas in a theoretical concept .
Economical scientists often refer to each other , especially in Microeconomics and Macroeconomics .
To understand each single theoretical concept , it is important to know when the concept was published .
The author might might have included the idea of another scientists , have used the other authors theory to formulate his own theory or there has been other external influences like wars which affected his work .

To conclude my statement I would say that the necessity of understanding concepts and ideas and learing the facts strongly depend on the field of study in univerity .
It is a little different during high school .
The target of high school is to provide a good general and basics knowledge for young people .
Here it is absolutely necessary to know everything , the dates and the ideas as well as the concepts to get a good general overview over the society and the development for example in history .
