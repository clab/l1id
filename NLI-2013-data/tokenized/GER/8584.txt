I agree with the statement , that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , for several reasons .

First , I think that the students should understand ideas and concepts because then they really know how a thing works .
When they just learn a fact they will forget it soon after .
On the other side it is obvious that they when they understood something once they will not forget it for a much longer time .

However , sometimes it can be important to learn facts .
The students should learn some important facts , because it is nessecary .
For example , I think everzbody should know when the second world war startet and when it ended .
This is just knowlege that everzbody needs that live nowadays .

Second , I think in the modern world it is much more important to understand ideas and concepts because today it is to difficult to know all the facts .
We live in a world where everything is specialized .
Nobody is able to know all the facts , so it is much better to understand the basics .
Facts are getting more important for the persons who work and don t go to school anymore .

A doctor for example has to know how the human body works .
He has to know all kind of bones of a human being .
For students it is not important that they can show all the specific bones of a human body .
It is possible that a student that learns all the bones , will become a lawer in the future .
Then he has to know completely different things

In conclusion , I agree in general with the statement .
I just think that it is important for the students to know some basic facts .
