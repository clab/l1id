I diagree with this statement : In my opinion you should concentrate on one - or at most two - academic subjects .

The first reason you should do so is that academic subjects and modern sciences have developed to a pretty high level .
Furthermore , a lot of ways to specialize - meaning minor topics - are available in each distinct subject .
Thus , you may not gain the abilities and experience which is necessary to work as a profession in a certain subject , if you do not concentrate on this single one eagerly .

Second , if you keep on wandering among too many subjects during your time at college or university you may easily loose track of what you are heading for with your education .
On the contrary , if you stick to one paticular subject there will not be too much difficulty in earning a master 's degree in this one within a usual period of time .

I have made the experience of studying mathematics and physics both as majors at the same time myself .
Although these subjects are definetely related to each other and one might guess that there are a lot of connections which make it easier to advance in these ones than it would be with any different combination , it still is very demanding : Working on both subjects has taken almost all of my time and thereby did not leave much room for leisure activities not related to university .
Furthermore , I sometimes felt like being lost in a sea of too many choices : As a result of my intense studies I got to know really a lot of minor subjects which I could specialize on in my diploma thesis and most of which seemed to be interesting .
Thus , I felt like sticking at a point where it was hard to make a decision ; had I not started off with both subjects , the decision which topic to work on would be easier , as I would not have come in touch with so many promising topics .
In addition , it would definitely not be possiple for me to work on one more subject no matter how few the additional workload might be .

Finally , instead of working on too many subjects , I would recommend everyone to train his so called `` soft skills '' .
This means that people should try to engage in community activities and social programms rather than working on another academic subject .
This will give them a sense of how to work with different people , which is really important for their future carrer : For business as well as for university research it is important to effectively work , discuss and find proper solutions together with other persons .

Resulting from these reasons my conclusion is that you should not try to master as many academic subjects as possible , but rather try to concentrate on one academic subject and different social activities .
