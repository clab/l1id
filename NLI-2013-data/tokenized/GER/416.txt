During my academic education of biology , I studied a wide variety of topics .
Beside my major subjects , ecology and zoology , I took classes in botany , genetics and physiology .
After getting this scientific overview I specialized on the biology and ecology of spiders , which was also the topic of my diploma thesis .
Later , during my PhD thesis , I very glad having received a scientific overview espacially in botany and zoology because I needed the knowledge of very different topics to conduct different field - and laboratory assays .
To my opinion , it is not a mistake to take very different classes at the university , if this is still possible .
This is because then you have the possiblity to choose the subject you like most and on which you can then specialize later in your studies .
Furthermore , you never know , which knowledge you will need for a future job .
If you have a broad but superficial knowledge of some subjects , you are always able to intensitfy your studies and get more specialized in the desired topic .
Unfortunately , the educational systems at most universities in Germy have changed since my tand mostly , it is no longe possible to study all subjects simultaneously due to limited money resources .

Often you have to choose your majors before getting registered at a university .
I think this is not a good development at universities , becouse no one knows what fure will bring and which qualifications are needed when people have finished their university degree .
