Young people could be the most encouraged members of a community but not all are the same kind of person .
I grew up in a small town with approximately 36000 inhabitants .
I attended a youth club that was leaded by the church .
We did a lot of things for our community .

First , we meet to discuss problems in our city .
Every wendsday there is a discussing round about current problems , e.g. about vandalism in our old town .
Moreover we organize parties and events where we collecte money for different programs to help other people .
It is a very good feeling to have fun on a party and at the same time helping others .

We also make trips to help underpreviledged people to renew their houses .
These are some examples of our community work and I hope that they show why I am disagreeing with the statement .
But I also know that such a community work is not generell .
I think especially in big cities it is a great problem that young people do not spend enough time to helping their communities .
But I think this is quite normal .
They are not as closely connected to their community as I am .
I suppose that they even do not have the chance to be directly involved .
There are to many problems in big cities that hardly can be solved by youth .

But I also believe that many young people are not interested in their community because they only think about their own wishes and problems .
They are not able to connect these two things .
I mean own problems and community problems .
I think they often stand closely together .

I would summarize that this is a difficult problem which is not easy to solve but I think that not all young people are lazy like it is maintained from many adults .
