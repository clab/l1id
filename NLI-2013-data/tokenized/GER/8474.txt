From my point of view it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts , because of my own experiences .
It does not make any sense if they learn facts , sometimes by heart , without understanding .

Furthermore , if they understand the ideas and concepts , they automatically learn them .
In addition to that , they remember things , they learned by understanding better then without .
Moreover , what do they want to do with their knowledge , they learned once , without understanding ?
They cannot use it in their life .
And students learn for their life and not only for their teacher .

For exemple sometimes it is not important to know all the chronological years and events of the past by heart .
It is much more important to know , why something happened and/or someone did ?

Another exemple which refers to that topic is the subject latin .
I learn it in school since 4 years and we do not only learn a large amount of vocabulary to translate some texts into our language , but we also analyse the texts .

Today it is easy to make researches on the internet , by only printing something out , without understanding anything .
You have the choice to learn everything without understanding , or you read everything carefully with understanding .

As far as I am concerned the second way is the better one .
All in all it is better for students to understand everything , then only learn them by heart .
