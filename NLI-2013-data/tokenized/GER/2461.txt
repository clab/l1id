` Young people enjoy life more than older people do ' .
The first question which I have to ask myself is : how to define young , respectively old ?
A girl born in Europe in the year 2006 will become approximately 90 years old .
A couple of decades ago this figure seemed to be unbelievable .
( Note : Also for the majority of the world 's population such an age is quite unlikely . )

Still scientists in Europe agree on describing life of consisting of different ` spheres of age ' .
First period : 0-20 , Second period 20-45 and third period up from 45 .
Even within this categories there are many , many splits like the ` third age ' from 80 onwards .

From my point of view young people are between the age of 0 and 45 , old people from the age of 45 up to X .

So far we see that life expectation has increased but the question is if young people enjoy life more than older people do .
As we live nowadays in a fast changing world ( e.g. globalisation ) this has also influenced the ` joy of life ' .
For instance in Europe in the late 1950s up to the late 1980s it was easy to predict somebodys curriculum , the likelihood of job-hopping was quite low , also the worrry about environment like global warming did not play such an important role as it does nowadays .

As a result of the change of ` outer-circumstances ' ( globalisation , growth of life-expectancy , environmental questions , etc . )
also the way how people ( can ) enjoy their life has changed .

From my point of view in the year of 2007 young people can not enjoy life as much as old people do .
Young people can not be sure about there future .
Things like job opportunities , environmental damages , wars on resources like Oil , a fast and sudden changing world et cetera make life much more unpredictable as it used to be .
Still young people can enjoy life but only in short terms : young people can enjoy their weekends , their holidays and their free-time in general .
But can they enjoy their long-term future ?
Can they enjoy their studies at University by being always aware of the job-opportunities ?

In contrast I think older people can be more sure about there future .
Some of them might still need to work some years until they reach a sudden age ( e.g. 65 ) and from then on they can enjoy their pension .
In contrast to their younger relevants they do not have to care so much about personal impacts of long-term future and it 's problems like wars on resources ( e.g. there will be still oil for app .
30 years ) nor do they have to be always ` fit for the market ' .

Nowadays some researcher also say that old people are more financialy potential than young people which often makes life easier and more enjoyable .

Finaly I would like to say that this gap between old and young people scares me a little bit - on the one side young people with an unknown future on the other side the old generation with plenty of time and money to enjoy future ...
