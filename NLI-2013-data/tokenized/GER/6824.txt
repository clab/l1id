When thinking about the next two decades one could imagine a lot of new inventions and innovations that faciliate our lives or even change it drastically .
The prospects in technological development are promising and therefore I believe that there will be fewer cars in use than they are today .

In my opinion , the main means of private transportation twenty years from now is still going to be the car .
I do not believe that there will be an invention which is able to replace the car .
In the last couple of decades the car has assumed an important role in every-day life .
It is too much included in our life routine as to lose significance in as little time as twenty years .
However , the machine that will be called `` car '' at that time will be very different from the car we know today .

Technological development will have to face the problem of rapidly declining natural ressources very soon .
As cars use up the fuel given to us by nature , the developers need to find alternative energy sources that are able to replace gas .
Methods like using electricity or solar energy which have already been invented have to be made more practical in order to convince people of the advantages of changing to new technologies .

The lack of indefinite natural ressources combined with a slow development of new technologies will decrease the number of cars in use .
People will have to find other means of transportation in order to get around .
Bus transportation will be increased and people might stick to this kind of transportation in order to save money and time as they do not have to wait in traffic jams when going to the office in the morning .
