It is a common saying that older people do n't have so much fun in life than younger people .
Or that you have to use the time when you are young , because the old age comes very fast and then there is nothing left in life that you can enjoy .

Therefore , it is a very controverse topic to be discussed if young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I disagree with this statement , because there are many reasons that show the difference .
There is a saying telling that you are always as young as you feel .
I think that is perfectly right .
My mother who is 52 years old does n't behave like she is over 50 which is a very old age for young people .
She wears modern clothes like my sisters and I and she listens to the same music .
She does what she wants to do and enjoys life as much as possible .

Another point is that you ca n't say to an old maybe also handicapped person that he or she does n't enjoy life .
A friend of my grandmother is about 76 years old and despite her leg injury she enjoys life and has a very positive attitude .

An example of how she enjoys life are her various trips with a group of older people .
Twice a year this group travelles to places in Europe by bus .
They do n't go hiking anymore , but they visit museums or famous buildings .
In addition to that , they are together with many people at the same age and with the same interests .
Everytime this woman comes home from one of those trips she is really happy , because she has enjoyed it so much that she wants to go on the next trip again .

Concluding I can say that by regarding various older people I 'm sure that older people enjoy life as much as young people do .
The only difference is that the activities and events which make people enjoy life might differ between young and old .
