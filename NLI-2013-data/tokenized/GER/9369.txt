In general , I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .
However , I am not convinced that it is not neccessary to learn facts also .

On one hand , it is very important for students to understand the basic idea of different phenomenon .
With this it will be much easier to learn new things and solve problems much more effective .
The needed facts one can review later in a lot of books .

On the other hand , for solving a problem one will need always a lot of facts and while working in a company , one will be always under time pressure .
Therefore an employee with a lack of already known solutions , will need much more time for solving a given problem , while spending time in reading books .
Moreover it is possible that he will find an already known answer for the task .
For example , when one have to invent something new , the first point is always a patent research .
Mostly one will find a already known proper solution .

As a scientific assistent at the faculty of mechanical engineering I met many times problems while researching on a specific topic .
My experiences are , that in 98 percent I can solve these problems only with the actual state of the art and only in 2 percent I need to invent something new .
Moreover I wrote a lot of exams in which I had known all basics , but , I was not able to calculate a giving machine , as I had not known specific facts .
According to this , I am advising the students in my classes of thermodynamic to have an careful look to the different processes given as an example in the book .
When they will write the examen at the end of the semesters , it is possible that one of this processes have to been calculated .
