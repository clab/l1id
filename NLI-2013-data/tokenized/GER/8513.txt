In earlier times schools and schooling itself had an excessively straight forward concept , to dump information in form of facts onto the students without considering them as individuals .
However this concept is outdated and thankfully most necessary adjustments to a modern way of learning have been made .
Of course it is much more efficient to understand ideas and concepts to eventually be able to put them to use in reality than to just learn facts by heart without understanding them .

Having several generations in my own family I can experience the infulence of an older , less modern education .
In those times the motto often was `` just accept it '' .
Very often unmotivated teachers still use this concept with their students today , they just are n't interested in their education .

Compared to that a passionate , motivated teacher will always take the time to explain the facts he just put in the students ' heads and turn them into comprehensable concepts .
The best example would be a complicted looking mathematical formula with three variables .
If a teacher just throws that formula on a student 's desk while telling him to adapt it to the numbers 2 , 5 and 9 the student will most likely respond with a blank stare .
However if the teacher approaches his student with the given formula and sits down with him and explains why this and that is in it , the student will probably be able to use it soon .

Or if one learns a certain book by heart , will he understand it ?
No , in that case it would not even be a given that the particular person will know any of the content , he will simply be able to repeat the words , like a roboter .
However if this person conciously reads that book and overthinks the various concepts , he will learn from it .

It is logical that the understanding of a given idea or concept is more productive and thus more important than to just learn the dry facts .
Facts do not have to equal knowledge , and only knowledge will get you somewhere .
