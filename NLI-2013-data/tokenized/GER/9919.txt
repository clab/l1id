Nowadays in our society , most of the people wants to be on the `` safe side of life '' .
If it is not 100 percent sure they do n't do it , because there could be a risk which they do n't want to take .
But is that really the best way , only doing what you already know how to do well ?
In my opinion , the answer is no !
You have to do risky things to be succesful .

For example , if you want to improve in your work life , you have to do tasks which you have n't done already .
So , you can show that you do n't want to stay at the same level , but increase your knowledge .
This show your bosses that you are commited and have a great loyality .

For the student life , in particular , it has to be absolutely normal to try new things or meet some new people .
It 's not possible to earn a great vage after university , if a student has n't showed great flexibility .
A student who get 's always great grades can maintain with only studying in his common environment .
But when he is ready to take risks and want 's to succeed in life he could also go abroad .
In an other country he learn 's a new language , get in touch with a new culture and meet some new friends .
So he can build a network which could be very useful in his life .

In my opinion , it is like at the stock market .
You can only earn a great benefit , if you are ready to take a risk .
If you only invest in blue chips , your chance to obtain a great benefit is much lower as if you put your money in more risky assets .

Finally , I think all successful people who are working in the business had to do a risky decision in their carreer ( e.g. Bill Gates , Donald Trump , Josef Ackermann , ... )
