Well actually I cannot say wheter I agree or disagree , because it depends on the situation .
For example when I want to travel without my friends and my family I would propably choose a groupe led by a tour guide .
Because then you are not completely alone and you will see a lot of the country you are travelling to .
But on the other side it is sometimes really annoying to be with a group of 20 people .
You always have to wait till everybody is back in the bus and so you waste a lot of time waiting for people .

And of course you are not as independent as you would be travelling alone .
Because the tour guide has his programme to do .
For example I have been to England with my mother in June and we did not want to drive by our own and so we decided to travel with a group .
But sometimes we really missed to do the things we want to do .
Because someday we were in this really nice village but we had just 30minutes there bevore the bus left again , but that was just not enough time to enjoy this .
Especially not , when the place you visit after that is absolutly not compareable to this nice village .

So normally when I travel with my parents we do not travel with a group , because it is more comfortable .
And then my father always prepares very good so that he takes the part of the guide and shows us everything , although this is sometimes more exhausting than travelling in a group .
Because my father has a really strict timetable for the things he wants to see and so we have to get up very early and come back to the hotel late in the afternoon .

So in my opinion it depends on the situation .
Normally I would not choose travelling by a group , but when you travel alone it is the best way .
For example I am now in Australia and when my language course finished I also want to travel around , but I do not want to travel by my own , because I think it is comforting to now that you are not alone and will not get lost .

So I really cannot say wheter travelling by your own or travelling by group is better , because both kinds of travelling have their advantages and disadvantages .
