This is a difficult and very interesting important statement .
In order to answer the question we have to consider the advantages and disadvantages of cars and we have to diucuss the attitude of the people in view of cars , traffic , air pollution ...

On the on hand I do not agree with the statement .
Everyone has a car , the people live longer than today and so there will be more driving-people .
Another reason is that a car is nothing special - fifty years ago a car was something unbelieveble - it was a wonder and only a few people were able to have a car .
Only a few people were able to buty a car or had the driver licence .
At the moment most people have the driver license and it is easy to have a car without much money .
There are many possibillities to get a car without earning much money , for exemple by pating step by step or by renting a car - and I think this facts will be increase in the next years and will be much stronger than today .

But on the other hand I agree with this statement , and I hope it will be correct - this would be very very important for us , our body our healthy our nature and our planet !!!

Fistly I think that the people are more sensible with our nature .
We all know that there are many problems caused by us .
The problems increase day by day and and the people are more heaten with ithem than twenty years ago , and I think in twenty years they will care more than today .
They will not take the car unneccessary , such as driving from one shop to the other , they will walk more .
Another exemple is to drive allone - they will meet their job friends anb drive together , this will be cheaper .

Secondly the communities helps to reduce cars .
In is very difficult to find a parking place in the city - so it would be much better to drive by bus .

Finally the governement helps to reduce the cars with the very very high taxes for having a car , for driving a car and for the gas .

To sum up I can say there are many reasons for reducing the amount of cars .
And personally I belive that all people are interestet in our nature and healthy , so that the number of cars will gradually discrease .
