Althoug there are still many young people who are very engaged in their commmunities , I agree that in general they do n't provide enough help .
Especially by observing the intense need for help in many communities because of less support from the government it is clear to me that there should be much more young people engaging themselves in their communities .
Nevertheless , I have the strong impression that the interest in social activities has decreased among young people .
This has three basic reasons .

First , I am convinced that the decrease of importance of religion in the modern society has caused a more egoistic approach in life of young people .
Since there is less religious education , providing moral values , the emphasis is put on personal succes but not on helping others .
Thus , it appears that helping the community for many young people is a minor goal in live than egoistic aims .
Therefore there are less young people who are helping their community by taking part in social work of the churches .

Furthermore , young people are also less interrested in politics .
Threfore the young people spend their time with other things like personal amusement and do not try to realise their political and social views in their communities .
For example in the generation of my parents there were regular political debates in their town , where also young people made proposals for social projects and also participated in such actions to realise their political aims .

Lastly , I believe that live in big cities prevents young people of helping there communities .
Although there is a lot of social work to do especially in big cities , only a few young people are trying to improve the situation because they probably feel anonymous in big cities and cannot identify with socially weaker people .
Apart from that there is also a lack of group feeling in big cities .
Consequently the young people do not experience life as living in a community and are therefore less motivated to offer their help .
