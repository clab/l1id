I totallay agree with the statement , that it is better , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one subject .
I did a professinal education as a media designer and now I am studying media sciences , political sciences and cultural sciences , and therefore I can tell from my own experience , that it is very important today , to have knowledge of a variety of topics .

First of all , my studies showed me more than once , that many developments , they may be cultural or technical , are connected in some way .
So , when you have knowlegde about different subjects , you can develop a much better understanding concerning the whole situation .

What is more is , that a broad education is very useful for later business life .
Today , jobs are not that restricted and limited anymore .
Almost every modern job applies an excellent general knowledge .
During my eduacation , for example , I had to show creative skills on the one hand , and mathematical and technical skills on the other hand .

Studies also show , that few people would keep one job for their whole life .
There is a certain tendency , that people will have two ore more jobs during their lifetime .
My mother is a good a example for this development .
First , she did an education as a nurse .
When she became mother , she stayed at home for 10 years .
Now , back in business life , she works as an german teacher .

All in all I think , I made clear , why I am convinced that a broad knowlege of various subjects is necessary .
The key word for the 21th century definetly is flexibility and I think , that universities in particular should support that development by offering a huge variety of academic subjects .
