I am personally not sure whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or in one specific one because there are advantages and disadvantages for both opinions .

On the one hand it is of course good to have a broad knowledge in general .
In our society it will always be useful to know as many aspects of different field of science as possible and to have the ability to talk about many different areas of knowledge .
It would be fatal if I am just a specialist of my own field of study but do n't care about other aspects that maybe could influence me in some way .
There are always connections between different areas of academic studies and it is possible to import some aspects taken from another filed of study to my own specific one to widen my point of view .

On the other hand it is important to have specific knowledge in one field .
Firstly because the use of studying is generally to deepen one 's knowledge in a specific field of study .
Secondly I think it is very important to specialise on one topic in which I am really interested and have a great knowledge in than to know only main facts in areas I am not that interested in .
Thirdly a specific knowledge in one subject will be vital to my future life because if I ever want to get a job somewhere I must have a great and not just a general knowledge about the field I want to work in .
In addition to this the subject I am specialized in is probably an area which I am very involved in so that I can express myself and my skills in this field very well .

So I come to the conclusion that even if it can be useful to have knowledge in many different aspects of life it is more essential to have knowledge in one specific subject most of all because it will help me to get job in future .
But that shall not mean that I am not convinced that it is also vital to increase my knowledge in other areas of study .
