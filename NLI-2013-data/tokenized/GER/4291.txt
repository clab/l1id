Nowadays the lack of help by young people is a big problem of our society or community .
The help does often lack concerning older people but even in politics or sport clubs .
In every part of our society , youth try to refuse their responsibility so they can use their time to play video games and other unimportant things .

A good example is the work at social associations .
It would be a good idea to let youths do an internship there or something like this , so that they can learn to treat with responsibility .
This would be a benefit for themselves and for society since a lot of costs for staff could be saved in the associations .
The work with old people or people who need help , like disabled people can also have a good affect to their personalities .

Another good aspect is the lack of help concerning politics .
As seen in every recent election , the participation in the elections has still decreased .
Of course this can also be a fact of older people who do not go to the elections but it is actually evident , that the biggest part results from the lack of interest in politics of the adolescence .
It would be a big support for the cities , villages and towns , if younger people expressed more interest in politics and help their communities at the same time with election campaigns for example .
With such supporting people a lot of costs can be saved even here , in the political sector .

Furthermore , there is another part of community , which is affected by the lack of help by young people , namely sports clubs .
In the past there had ever been people that just lived for their regional sports club , no matter which kind of sports .
The did everything for this club .
And indeed it is the community and the help of a lot of people which makes such a sports club to a club that functions pretty well and brings a lot of fun .
Nowadays young people just want to go there and to do there kind of sports .
And after that , they want to leave .
They do not want to be confronted with any responsibility , which could require a little bit of trouble .
Something like club parties in such sport clubs presents a good example .
Most times , those are organized with the help of all club members and those members are the people who bring the beverages , the cakes and whatever .
But today it is already too much for a young club members to bring something for the community , like a cake , or to give their friends a couple of hours of their time to help at the club party .

Conclusionally , in my opinion , young people should absolutely give more time to help their communities , since it is not only the community , that benefits from that , but even themselves and their personalities .
