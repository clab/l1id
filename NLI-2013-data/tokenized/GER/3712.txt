I agree partly .
The whole situation changes from time to time and through the globalization there have been a lot of important changes in society .
Young people definetly have more possibilities to spend their free times for things they really like and therefore one could easily say that there is a big change in the behaviour of young people .
Furthermore life becomes faster and that is why everybody , not only young people have to think better how and why they do the things they do and if it is the best they can do .

Besides that it differs from age , religion and place in society how active or passive young people are in their communities .
My own experiences are that I myself help a lot in my community and lots of my friends do so too .
An other point one have to have in mind is how the young people feel in the community .
If they are happy with the world around them the help of the young people is logical , but if they have no friends and fun at work it is logical that they are not willed to help the community and prefer to sit in their room next to the computer or television .

Besides that the government could try to make help and work of young people more public , so that the young people can see , that they can help and perhaps can have a better feeling throughout that , what they have done .
For me it would be important to show which goals young people can reach .

Finally it seems as if young people are lazy and do not give enough time to help their community , but in my opinion nothing changed and nothing will change .
There will be young people who help and there will be young people who does not do so .
