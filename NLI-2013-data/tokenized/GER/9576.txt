New idea = success ?

The most successful ideas are new and never seen before .
Almost all people are attracted by things they do not know yet .
So by following new ways of thinking you can become a successful person .
I agree with this statement , as new ways of thinking can help you to be successful in some situations of life .

Starting a company is a high risk .
In order to be successful in an economy you should really have thought of an idea no one has had before you .
Especially , if you want to sell things , new ideas may help you to make your good more attractive to people who would buy it .
If you would try to sell something everyone does already have , you will have a bigger problem .
So you must make yourself special , what mean that you have take new ideas apart from what you already know into consideration .

Another great example are internet companies that convince people to by things they used to by at normal shops , even food or cars , via the internet .
New comunication forms , such as specified formus , have come up .
Now the founders can get rich by selling their internet sites .

But there are other parts in life where you can be successful with a work that is known and you can do well .
For instance , building up new friendships or partnerships , as well as social engagement .
For these kinds of `` jobs '' it is not important that you earn any money or make profit .
Here people can be successful in this way that he or she is satisfied and happy with their life .
This would be a definition of success where I cannot completely agree on the statement .

The of couse you have to be really good at your job and better as everyone else .
This is the point where new ideas may help you to stick out of all other people again .

All in all the conclusion is that if you want to be successful in an economic way you should definetly try risks and have new ideas .
However in other parts of life it is better to do what your experience is based on an what your good at .
