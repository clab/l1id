I disagree with the statement that having a wide knowledge in academic subjects is better then beeing a specialist in onlz one subject .
There are several reasons to confirm my opinion i will list .

The first argument for this is that with having a special education you will recieve a great job and earning much money .
I will show the example of an architect .
For this job you need a special education in only one way of an acedemic subject .
Arcitects for example are looked after on the job market and because of this they would earn much money and having fun in their job .
But when you have a great knowlegde of many acedemic resourses you might have problems with fining a job , having a career and earn much money .
Reasons for this is that in the most companies you are required to have a special education .
So there will not be any job challenges for this kind of broad educated people .

A second point why I prefer having a special education is that in my opinion you are more satisfid with you life and yourself .
Being a specialist means a great feeling .
You have abilities only a few other people have and then you know why having studied for a long time .
This creates also respect in the society and kind of personal honor .
I think this are great feelings which makes your life Otherwise when you have studied a huge area of subjects you are also an academic educated person .
But is it realized by the others or are you happy with that .
I think no because there are always other people who are better than you in a special topic .
If you have studied a bit math a bit physics and a bit biology .
There will allways be speacialists af these subjects who knows it better than you .
This I think creates sadness or depressed feelings to your own and is a reason why I disagree with the statement .

Concludet it has to be said that no matter what education it is important to have any
