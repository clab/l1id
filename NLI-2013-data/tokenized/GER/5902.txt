That is a really difficult question .
I think cars a one of the most important vehicle which we have and want .
We need it every day , it does not matter what we do .
If we go to to work , if we go to sport or if we just visit a friend , we going almost every time by car .
Indeed , we can use a puplic vehicle like a bus or a train too , but in some cases it is really difficult or just impossible to go somewhere by bus or train .
I live in a very small town , which is almost 30 minutes away from my school and from the next big city .
If I go by bus and train to school , it would take me more than one houer .
I would spent one houer on the way to school and one houer on the way back .
By car I just need half the time , so I safe quiet a lot time in which I can do other things , things which are more important .
Just if we get something else as a car , like little plains , then I guess it would be possible that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today .
The current standard is not the final result , but it is a starting point for new and better development .
Therefore it is possible , that in few years we going by little plains to work or school .

A vehicle was the most important invention in the 19th centuries , it makes our life much easier .
Accordingly I do not think that we just say , okay all vehicle away and we do not need them either .

We have to develop new and better cars to protect things like nature .
Nature is one of the most important thing which we have in the whole world .
But we destroy a part of it with pollution .
That we have to change .
This is the only reason which I can think of , that we get fewer cars or vehicle , because our nature is distroyed to much .
But present we do think about it , to solve this problem , like a mentiond above already , we develop new and better cars with less pollution .
We all the cars are away , we would have a lot of workless poeple .
If I just think about , how many peole work in the car industry , that is quiet unimaginale , because that are so a lot .
In reason of all above mentioned facts and my own opion , which I also tried to explaind about , I think we would have everytime somethink like a car or a vehicle .
