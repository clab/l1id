I think , it is absolutely necessary to understand the whole idea and the whole concept of a topic .
On my opinion , only then it is possible the get the core and the intention of a topic .
If students would only learn single facts , they would never receive a complete picture of a subject .
They permanently would have single pieces of information but never a whole picture , they would absolutely lack an overview of everything - like in a puzzle where some pieces are missing .

Furthermore , all ideas or concepts themselves contain facts which are embedded into them , so it is not even possible to lern about an idea without learning - at least a few - facts .

My experience has shown that I have less problems to learn and to remember both , the whole idea as well as important facts and details , when I have understood the whole topic .
I have tried to learn only single facts a few times , for example at maths , a subject I am not very good at .
I only learnt single formulas but had no idea about how all these formulas worked together in any relationships .
In those cases I never got access to the deeper sense of the materia .

Another example I have already experienced , was when I had to learn a lot for the university .
Especially in one management course there was so much content during the whole semester , I really was afraid I could not cope with .
But at the end of the semester , when I had understood all ideas of the content , all information matched and fitted together nearly alone .
I really was < in the topic > .
So finally I could use all information I had to learn , because I knew what they were all about , I could categorize them and use them in the right way .
I am sure , this would not have been possible , if I only had learnt the facts .

Summarizing , I think students get not only a better , but also a wider knowledge by understanding ideas rather than single facts .
