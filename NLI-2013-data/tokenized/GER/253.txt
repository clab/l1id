I agree with this statement because at the begining of every inovation stay ideas and concepts .
Without them you can learn nothing about facts .
This statement can be best described on the example of the begin of a carrear .
If you are new in the company and you are chalenging with new tasks and maybe problems which you have to solve .
What would help you ?
You have to start with analysing the problem .
This implies that you have understood the concept .
After this you can try to develop ideas which could lead you to solution .
And only at the end you will use the facts to come up to the solution .
Another aspect wich confirms this statement is the fact that that the facts are always available .
You can get the facts from books , from internet and from another different sources but there are no sources for ideas .
If it would be so than there would be a lot of reach people .
So the main aim of every study should be the ability of developing ideas .
This is also the main feature which makes difference between university and scool .
The fact are the contents and only helpfeaters which you use to realise your ideas .
