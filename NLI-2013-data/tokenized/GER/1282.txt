Nowadays widespred discussion exists as to whether students should focus on a specific subject during their studies or rather try to gain knowledge in many fields of academic interest .
I have given this question some thought myself as I started out attending an interdisciplinary course at university and then decided to refer to a course solely about economics .

On the one hand , dividing your attention in between lots of different subjects , you do not run the danger of becoming a narrow-minded academic completely endorsed in their own field of study as you interact with many different points of view and opinions .
Some of the brightest researchers you meet might not be the nicest company as they are not open to other peoples ' points of view .

Secondly , focusing on one single topic you might miss out on a lot of interesting things you could learn in other fields .
As an environmental engineer you might also be interested in arts , just as an artist might want to know how a power station works .

Thirdly , if you have chosen one subject you want to concentrate all your studies on , it may be hard for you to change direction and you may end up having to stick to a subject for the rest of your life .
Especially in the fast-paced world of today it is essential to stay flexible and a knowledge of many academic subjects certainly helps to do so .

On the other hand , it can become quite exhausting trying to accumulate knowledge about a wide range of topics at the same time .
I found it very hard trying to remember all the paragraphs during my law class and , half an hour later , having to recall the most important dates in German history .
Whereas if you stick to one subject , the amount of work will be less overwhelming .

Furthermore , by devoting your time to one specific subject you will be able to study it in depth and gain distinctive knowledge that will be more valuable than just a broad overview you get if you study that subject besides many others .

This valuable knowledge , that puts you apart from other students , will be what companies look for if they are trying to hire people for important jobs and , what is more important than improving job prospects in a world like today where well-paid and highly regarded jobs are scarce ?

To conclude , I think it is better to speicalize in one specific subject rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects , because , although there are a number of advantages in accumulating broad knowledge of many subjects , the gains from focusing your studies on one topic clearly outweigh these .
