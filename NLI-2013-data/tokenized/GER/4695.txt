Due to better possibilities of communicating and optimized wazs of transport , in the last century a process took place that incorporated the world : the globalization .
One result of the globilazation is the increasing advertisements for products all over the world .
On the one hand advertisement helps us to inform about products .
But on the other hand you have to ask yourself if this process of advertising is really neutral ?
And in my opinion the answer is no .

When you watch TV , you can see beautiful cars driving through the landscape and beautiful womans sitting in it and enjoying it .
But the question is if you also will enjoy to ride this car ?

When you go to cinema you see several advertisements for films that are promised to be exciting .
But again there | s the question : is it really that exciting when you see the whole film by yourself ?

There are cases that confirm that the promises become true .
But in my opinion , in the most cases you will be disappointed of the product you decided to pay for .

The globalization certainly has positive effects on the world if you just think of the possibility to convey products or information .
But in my opinion it causes that quality isn | t anymore guaranteed in every case .
Let | s take the example of the advertisement for the car .
In TV you saw the car with all the beautiful impressions and it | s great equipment .
But you | re not able to judge the quality of the car by only seeing it .
So you may be dissappointed when you actually buy the car .
This is a typical example of the thesis that advertisements make products seem much better than they are .

In earlier times , you offered someone a service or a product and what you got back was also a service or prducts .
This was the process of exchanging things directly .
And you there you were able to judge quality .

But the globalization caused competetion .
And competition causes lies , so that the products seem better than they actually are .
Because of the increasing competition between big companies , the promises become better and better , the quality of products instead becomes worse because of mass production .

So you can definitely say , that , not in all cases , but most of the time advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
And in this case the question I asked at the beginning of this text is answered : globalization does not have only positive effects .
