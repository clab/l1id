Do young people really enjoy life more than older people do ?
Generally spoken , probably not many would refute the statement , that younger people enjoy life more than the elder .
This essay tries to come up with some theories about the reasons for this common oppinion .

First of all , every old person happened to be young once .
This means they probably partied , travelled , hang around with friends , laughed , joked , went to the public pool , and did everything else what ( young ) one would identify as `` enjoying life '' .
As they became older , the preferences of `` enjoying '' changed continually .
Maybe they founded a family and got children or the started a successful carrer .
They surely had pleasure with this part of their lives as well .

As they became old , they retired from their jobs and their children were young women and men themselves .
Once again their side of view about `` enjoying life '' changed .
They now have time to collect stamps , reading books , spending time with their grandchildren , and so on .
One would say , they became wize and settled down .
They look back on their lives and enjoy what they achieved .

Of course these are examples of lucky and happy people .
There are also many retired who sit all they in some pubs and get drunk .
As well there are many young ones behaving rather `` boring '' compared to others .
But these are rather the exceptions to the rule .

These statements clearly point out that it is very difficult and probably not consistent to compare the joy of life between young and old .
First , it is hard to find a possible definition of what `` enjoying life '' means .
Second , there is an existence of a kind of conflict between the views of the generations themselves about the meaning of `` enjoying life '' .

There is no way for a fair comparability between the joy of life of the two positions , old and young .
Therefore I conclude with the statement that both young and old enjoy their lives equally strong , but in a very different way .
While the young ones have an urge to express themselves and show their way of enjoying , the elder enjoy more for themselves , intristic and quiet .
