I think it is not easy to answer because you have to respect several aspects .

On the one hand I think this statement is correct , because today there are some people who think only on theirselves .
They think that they are the most important person and if somebody needs help they say : ask somebody else .
This is a very hard opinion and I think ( and I hope ) that this is only a minority of our population .

On the other hand I think that especially some old people have a wrong opinion .
They often speak about an unfriendly and unpolite youth , but I think this is not a correct opinion .
I think that this is caused by those people I have talked about in the first paragraph .

I can tell about my friends and me .
We are a group of five people and we work in a home for old people .
There , we do lots of things to help these people to have a nice day .
We stay there two times in month and the old people are very happy to see us every time .

Another example is my big sister .
She is cooking in my old school for lots of pupils with some other parents , because the village has not enough money to pay for a good food .
So many parents decided to do this job on their own to give the pupils a good meal .

I think this is a good help in the comunities .
What is important to say too , is that there are many pupils who helps other pupils with their homework and learn with them for tests or other things like that .
This is also a kind of help for others .

At least I can say that I think that the majority of our population is doing lots of things for their communities .
Of course it can always be more , but if everybody helps a little bit , I think it is a good start for the future .
