I want to state my opinion wether a broad knowledge of many subjects is better than to specialize in one subject .
Both ways have their specific advantages and disadvantages which I would like to state in the following text .

Having a broad knowledge is always an advantage , not only when it comes to game-shows like `` Who want 's to be a millionaire '' .
Knowing a lot gives you an open view to the world as it is .
It opens you for alternative explanations and solutions and might even make you into a more tolerant person .

Even though from this point of view it seems very usefull to gather a broad knowledge it also brings with it some problems .
Many specific knowledge is what makes you an expert in some area .
When beeing a competitive person who always tries to be the best you will not achieve your goal , if you are not focussing your energy to some few subjects and even if you are not competitive the everyday job-requirements force you to have a certain amount of knowledge about a special subject .

Even though the capacity of the human brain seems to be nearly unlimited , the time of most humans is not .
Getting a broad knowledge needs a lot of time to gather this knowledge .
If you try to get to this knowledge on a university you soon will have to face the fact , that not just the time but also the money of most persons is limited .
In most countries all over the world , studying is not for free .
Even in Germany where Universities where free for decades a growing number of federal countries is intoducing study fees .
So at one point or another most people have to make a decision between the amount of knowledge to gather , and the time and money they got to do this .
In my opinion a broad knowledge is an ideal which is very hard to reach .
So I think it is better to first concentrate on one subject and to get to know everything possible about it , get a job by using that knowledge and try to broaden your horizon afterwards .
Not doing so will turn you into an unemployed academic with a broad knowledge .

When talking about this topic another pretty important thing has to be mentioned .
More important than finding time to gather knowledge , is to make sure you do n't loose the one you once had .
In Germany it is said , that when finishing Highshool one has the broadest knowledge in his whole life .
When starting to study often just a few months are needed to loose this knowledge , mostly because one focusses on his primary subject in college .
So maybe the mentioned ideal is easier to reach by not forgetting knowledge than by gathering it .

To summarize my personal view : I for myself always try to gather as much knowledge as possible even though I know it is just possible within certain limits given by the environment .
But even though it is surely better to have this broad knowledge I will never say a bad word about someone who just tries to be the best in his primary subject .
