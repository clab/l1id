I absolutely disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Firstly , the population is still growing worldwide .
Secondly , mobility will be at least as imporant in twenty years as today .
Finally , many countries will continue their economic growth which will also lead to an increasing demand of cars .

Obviously , the population is still growing worldwide .
Already about 6 million people live in the world and in twenty years about 8 million people will live on earth .
Thus , more cars will be needed than today , since , for example , more people will have to drive to work or they will go shopping with their car .

Mobility is very important in our society and it is likely to become even more important in future , since companies demand that their employees are flexible and mobile .
So you wo n't probably find a job if you are not flexible and mobile .
In addition more jobs rely on a car .

Take the booming parcel service as an example .

Finally , as countries are persuing their economic growth , more cars well be needed to make this growth possible .
When new industries develop also new houses will be build .
This will cause more traffic on our roads .
So new infrastructure must be build .
This process will repeat several times in 20 years .
And we will end up with even more cars than today .

In my opinion , in twenty years there will be much more cars in use than today .
The reasons are obvious , the population is gorwing everywhere and will continue so .
Mobility will also remain crucial in a modern society .
And of course booming economie will also lead to more cars , which will be nece
