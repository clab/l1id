Young people are often said to mostly have themselves in mind .
This thesis might arise from decreasing numbers of young people that are actively participating some sort of communities .
But is this true ?

In my opinion this theory is too simple and the topic needs to be viewed from several aspects .
What kind of communities are we talking about ?
Churches , sects , clubs or Online communities ?
In case of the first two I believe it may be alright .
Young people would like to be free in mind and not spend their life being afraid of an evil lord who will smack them down unless they serve certain people .
Turning their backs to religion for me is the right choice .
But on the contrary I believe that private and online communities are not lacking motivated and caring young people .
A lot of communities have been formed - or should I say boomed ?
- during the past few years .
The word itsself is probably one of the most frequently used ones among young people .
Their active participation helps these communities and , as it is the idea behind it , it also helps themselves gathering social contacts exchanging information and opinions .

But yes , some children certainly spend too much time playing video games or watching TV instead of making something that is more productive or creative .
They waste their time they sit in front of their monitors seeking short-term satisfaction .
Of course they are wrong but their are not the ones that tell themselves what is right and what is wrong .
They also will not find a way to communities themselves .
It is their parents that are responsible for them so it is them that need to be harmed if young kids some day lack social skills .
They determine where their children go , what media they are confronted with and what social activities their children are part of .
But the parents are not solely responsible .
Teachers play a role and have to provide a kind of ethical education , too .

To conclude I would like to say that this sentence is full of prejudice but maybe totally nonsense .
It is true that society forces most people to take care of their own as there are less and less rewards given for sacial actions .
