I do not agree with the statement , stating that broad knownledge of many academic subjects is better than to specifiy in one specific subject .
I think it important to specialize in one specific subject .

From my point of view it is important to specialize in one specific subject for many reasons as described in the following .

First , if you specify in one specific subject you will have a lot of knownledge of a specific subject in contrast to people who rather have a broad knownledge .
So when a company is looking for a person who can solve a specific problem they would rather hire a specialist than a person who only has broad knownledge of a specific problem .

Another reason for specializing in one specific subject is the development of our society and the business world .
Since there is increasing competition between companies in all sectors of business .
Companies have to start specifying in order to gain all possible ressources available on the market , for example .

For this reason , Companies start looking more for specialists on a specific subject rather than looking for people with broad knownledge .

However , it is important that specialiyed people do also have a little knownledge of other subjects too .
For example , If a company is looking for a new employee it does not hire the most specialized person .
The company wolud rather pick the most specialized person with the most broad knownledge .

In my opinion it is important to know that broad knownledge of many sectors/subjects is important but it is even more important to specify in a specific sector/subject .

As a conlusion you can say that it is not only important to specialize in one specific sector/subject .
At the same time it is also important to increase one 's knownledge in other sectors/subjects .
