The issue at hand is whether or not it is more important for students to grasp the meaning of what they learn than just learning facts by heart .
This is a very important question as many pupils just learn their stuff by heart in order to satisfy the teacher but they are not really able to practice their knowledge .

In agree entirely with the statement because students really have to be aware of what they are studying in order to be successful in a test or the real world .

In the following I will try to support my opinion by using several points and examples .
One reason which makes me claiming this , is that if you just learn a fact but you do not have a real idea why you are learning it you can not complet an examination successfully .
As most of the questions in a test are transfer question you have to know how to practice your knowledge and just knowing the fact will not be a good help .

Based on this point I think being aware of the ideas and concepts is the better solution .
Moreover , I take the view that understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than just learning facts in the outside world as well .
Let me exemplify what I mean , if you have a job interview and you know that it is very helpful to show a good behaviour this is good for you .
But it is much better if you know the reason why this behaviour is important and how exactly you have to react , for instance you have to be aware that good behaviour consists of friendliness or being honest and so on .

Thus , I think that my view is the right one .
Furthermore , above all it is very important for people doing sports or doctors to understand the idea and concept of what they are learning .
What I am trying to say is that a doctor for example not just have to know facts about a specific operation .
No , he has to know when he has to do this kind of operation and especially how he has to operate !

This is a very good example showing us how important it is to understand the idea of what we are learning .
In conclusion , I have stated different points in order to support my opinion .
The understanding of the ideas and concepts is much more relevant than just learning examples in order to have success in different spheres of our life .
