People can be successfull in a lot of different ares .
They can be successfull in sports , or music or in their proffession .
But do they have in common , that they are trying new things and are taking risks ?

In my opinion , that is definitely the case .
People who are successsfull know what it means to be good at something .
To get this feeling in manz different ares they try new things , because it could be possible that they succeed in this area as well .
For example a good basketballer .
He loves beeing the one people cheer at .
To get this feeling more often he begins doing highjump or so .
So that he could be successfull more often .

I think that another very important point is the fear that they could suddenly fail , and this fear is as higher as successfull you are at the moment .
Failing in an area in which everbody considers you to be good is much harder than failing in something you are doing the first time .
If I am doing a IQ test and I was successfull , I fear to do it again .
Because I am worried about if I am as good as the last time .
But doing an other test would not mind because no one could compare my results .
So I prever to take some risk and do something new .

The most important argument is that successfull people are willing to search for new aims and new competitions in their live more than `` looser charackters '' .
They are not worried about failing because they know they are good in something .
No , they search for new competitions and new hurdles they could take successfullly .
My friend for example is very good at athletics .
But he does not want to stay here at home and do his sport like it is right now .
No , he wants to go in a foreign country to compete there and to meassure with other students .
This means a completly new surrounding for him and the risk he could fail , or could be not as successfull in athletics as he is here in Germany .

All in all I agree with this statement , because I only know successfull people , who are not only doing things they know they are good at , but who are trying new things and taking risks .
