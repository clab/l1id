With new useful inventions or working methods someone can make much money in less time .
The question is , if this person needs tu be risky or not - or if someone who does it the old `` normal '' way , could not succeed .

First of all in my opinion everybody can be very successful in every little job or things he does .
If he wants to , he will do good and will not need some new ways or risks to work it out with more success .
He perhaps will last longer for that thing he wants to reach but he will reach the end much more safer .
If you dare more like other companies , do not mean that you risk more .
You can check and double check and if your idea is not good , you can try again .

In modern world nobody will throw a new product on market without several tests of customers .
Everybody tries to reduce the risk to a minimum .

On the other side a really new idea needs a big starting amount .
This big investition does not guarantee the profit and the success .
This of course could then open a door to a higher level of money but is very risky , because nobody can say , if people will accept the new product or not .
In the fast changing internet and mobile world , often you just have to be the faster one and this person .

New inventions like ebay are able to have millions of customers , it is just the idea , that counts .

In conclusion I think it is not necessary for a new company to be risky or to dare too much .
First of all you have to check the guarantee of success and if the idea of the company is good , the success will come in a much more safer way .
