Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I do not agree oder disagree with this statement , because on one hand there are many products , which have very bad advertisment but are very usefull and effective .
On the other hand , the products with the biggest and greatest advertisment can be unusful and uneffective products for me .

It depens also on the intress of people .
Everybody in the world has diffrent subject in which he is intressted .
For example a man who loves car will be able to decide if the advertisment for a new car is much better then the car is in reality or if the advertisment just exactly show the quality of the car .
A other man , who hate cars , who just move by his feeds because he thinks that cars are bad for the enviroment will say , that the advertisment is bad .
Or that the makers of it just want to make money .

An other different by giving the right mark for the advertisment is the age .
The more years a human has lived , the more things he know .
For a little boy for exaple impressed the new car much more then the man , who loves car .
Because the man saw so many cars bevor in his live and for him its just something he now in a new way and teh little boy , for him it is not just a new car , it is something new in generally , because he have not known it bevor .

I think that you can not say that a advertisment is bad , bacause the people for whom the advertsiment was made maybe think that this a great advertisment .
I just can say for the advertisment I am intrested in show most of the time a good advertisment .

When I tried a new product , for exaple a shampoo , what was advertised as the best shampoo ever on tv , the advertisment was not always right but some times .
All in all you have to be intrested in the prodcut and you need a liitle knowlegde to decide if it is good or not , you have to think about , that other people has not the same opinion as you , and you have to think about if this product , which has a good or bad advertisment is the only one between many , or if there are many good or bad ones .
