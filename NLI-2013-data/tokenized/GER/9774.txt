I agree with the statement , that successful people try new things and take risks earlier than other people .

In my opinion successful people know what to do for a well doing business .
They are more confindet because of there success .
I think only the developing of new ways and new technologies can make you successfull for a long time and that is what the they want to have .
Success for the rest of their live .

They know that when they stay at there level , maybe the others will enforce them and then they fall down at a lower level .
So the invention of new things is also a defense mechanism .

I think , if you are successful and you do the same work everyday than you get borred on what you are doing .
For good and successful work you have to enjoy it and if it is borring you even can not enjoy it .

Another reason for taking risks is that the people maybee will not loose there jobs when they are unsuccessful .
That gives them the possibility to improve new procedures .

Propably the fact of beeing restless and of taking risks is the key for beeing successful .
And when you are succesful it is easier to try new things .
Think about a person how sells newspapers the hole day , if he try new things for selling more newspapers , it can have a bad end for him .
If his plan failed than he might loose his job and even that is the reason for him to not take the risk .

All in all , i think the main reason for trying new things is that the person who take the risk is much more self-convident like the others and self-convidence makes winners .
