I disagree with the statement .
Students have to understand the main ideas and concepts on the one hand , but have to learn the facts aswell .
If students understand an idea , they should be able to work the facts out in any case they need them , but only if they know some facts .

When a student only learns the facts he will later only know them and might lose the view for the whole topic and thus not being able to anwer the question .
He might lose himself in details .
It is important to learn the facts aswell as the general idea , because you cannot answer a question without having any facts at hand .

In case a student only learns the general idea and forgets to learn the facts he opposes the problem of not being able to answer a qouestion once again .
He might have understood the whole thing , but is not able to present certain facts that are necessary for explaining a specific topic .
Therefore an answer wo n't be possible .

When a student has learned aswell the general idea and concepts as the facts he should be able to answer every question on a certain topic , without greater problems concerning his preparation .
he might have other problems , but they are not to be discussed here .

In my past school time I generally learned the facts but sometimes it occurred that I had n't understood the whole idea and concept and therefore a classtest was really bad .
If I only had understood the main ideas and concepts but hand't learned the facts I was n't usually not able to answer quoestions according to the given task .
When I had understood the ideas and concepts and had learned the facts , the classtest was n't a big deal .
So I have experienced just what I have stated above .
Serveral friends of mine have experienced something quite similar .
Bad grades when they had either only learned the facts or ideas and concepts - good grades when having learned and understood both .

Thus it is most important for the students to learn the general idea and concepts aswell as to learn the important facts concerning the topic .
