I totally agree with this statement .
And I think a lot of examples can be found in everyday life .
Just look at the advertisements you can get in the normal supermarket , like food .
In the advertisement everything seems very healthy , even the choclate nut cake with cream .
The company of the product tells you how much vitamins or other healthy things their product contains .
Maybee , that there is a huge amount of a special vitamin found in the choclate nut cake , because of the nuts it cotains .
But the advertisement does n't mention how many fat is in there because this of course would n't turn out to be a very healthy figure .
In the past years the advertisement tried to capture probable buyers of their product with the signs `` zero fat '' or `` zero sugar '' .
But honestly , who ever expected a lollipop for example to contain fat ?

Other non-eatable products like detergent or facial creams as well are not the magical liquids and fluids they pretend to be .
Many people let the advertisement lead their trolley in the supermarket .
And when they are at home they discover the truth behind all the colorfull promises .

One thing that shows , that even the politicians are aware of the dangers of the all to promising advertisement is the prohibition of tobacco advertisement on TV and in newspapers .
The tobacco industry has a lot of money , so they can afford the best advertisement which promises the consumers freedom , coolness , cleverness and a lot of other things if only they lit a cigarette .
The fact that wealthy companies can spend a lot of money on promising advertisement on the other hand means that that smaller companies that ca n't afford expensive advertisement ca n't promise too much to the cosumers .
Of course this does n't mean , that products with less promising advertisement necessarily are healthier products .
But in my opinion it is more likely .
