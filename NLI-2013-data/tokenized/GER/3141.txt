In my opinion it is not true that young people enjoy life more than older people - for various reasons .
One of the most important reasons for me is that it is impossible to generalize .
Every individual is different .

A shy , introverted young person may find it hard to enjoy life and a lot of teenagers today have a tendency to spend a lot of time inside the house watching TV or playing computer-games rather than to go out and socialize with people their age .
A lot of them seem to prefer living in a virtual world rather than reality .

On the other hand I have noticed that older people can be very communicative and chatty , they still know the importance of socializing , making new friends , getting to know their neighbours and they enjoy having a social network around them - family friends and neighbours .

A lot of young people do go out - but do they enjoy life ?
It always is a question of definition , is n't it ?
Especially in the U.K. there is the phenomenon of binge drinking - mostly young people who try to get completely drunk as quickly as possible .
The effects can be seen in the streets of a lot of cities on a Saturday night .
In a lot of clubs teenagers go to you can get a wide range of drugs .
If that is your idea of enjoying life - have fun !

And then , old people today might not be what they used to be - I think the elder generation has become a lot more active ( and more often than not has a secure income at its disposal ) .
Old people now like to go on holidays , they might even buy their villa in Spain , there is a whole wellness-industry aimed at the older generation .

So , in the end wether you enjoy life or not really is not a question of age but of attitude .
