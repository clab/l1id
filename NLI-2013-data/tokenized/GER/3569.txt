Are young people not give enough time to help ing their communities ?
And was it other in former times ?
To answer this question you have to think about a few different points of views .
The first point is that they are a lot of young people , which have some kind of `` I do n't care '' opinone .
They do not have targets to life for or task to do .
As I drive to Berlin per train to do this test a saw a few of them , already beer drinking in the moring .
Furthermore , there are a lot of young people which do n't have this kind of `` homefeeling '' in their communities .
They would take any change to leave their towns .
You should not forget that , perhaps , they have to leave their communities to find a job or have a better future .

However , on the other side there are young people every age which spend a lot time by helping their communities .
They work in social organisations like the `` red cross '' ( So , do I . )
or the `` Kinderhilfswerk '' .
Althought , they spend a lot of time in social project like organisation of a camp for kids without parents or collection money for a homeless shelter .
The question also implies that it was better in former times .
This is perhaps true but I 'm to young to join this expericens .
I think as time change aswell the situation als change .

All in all I disagree with `` Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities . ''
They are helpful young people , but you have to look for these .
