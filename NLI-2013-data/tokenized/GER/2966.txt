This statement seems to be true at a first glance .
But having a closer look on this topic one should differentiate more precisely .
First of all these type of statements cannot be generalized .
Thus it should at least be mentioned that we can only speek of majorities .
Second one should be aware that an answer to the question whether or not young people enjoy life more than elder is highly subjective .

From my experiance I would even oppose .
Admittedly younger people in most cases bring along a higher level of physical fitness .
Thus they have a broader variety of entertainment opportunities .
In turn this opportuny might raise the confidence of young people .

But what really matters is time ( actually my opinion ) .
As I define young people to be something around 20 and older people to be retired , I think elder have signifacantly more time than young people have .
This degree of freedom ( in the sense of time ) allows for much more activities .
While for instance students have to learn and work hard to fund their studies retired persons might meet with friends , travel around , go out and drinks some , visit operas , go shopping or whatoever .
This lack of time is a crutial thing that counts against a superior fun-level of young people .

Secontly I think young people are exposed to more stress .
Old people do not have to make decisions like `` Should I join this or that university ? '' or `` Should I apply for this internship ( respectively job ) ? ''
.
This type of decisions - someone in the beginning twenties have to make - cause an inherent stress situation , which again lowers life quality .

Thus I conclude from my personal experiance that this relationsship does not hold .
I think it is actually the other way round .

Again , one should not neglect that this answer is highly subject to the definition of young and old and must not be true for each individual .
