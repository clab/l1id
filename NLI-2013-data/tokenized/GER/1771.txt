Some people say that in their opinion it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I mainly disagree to that opinion .

As a child and during the time of education at school to gain a broad knowledge is important .
That is because for the life after school a child must find out in what it is interested .
This is on the one hand important for the choice of profession and on the other for its own developmet .
But later it is as well as important to specialize in a specific subject , because specific knowledge is very worthy .
So for example a company is willing to pay a lot of money for employees who have specialized in a subject where only less people are specialized in .
That is because their knowledge is rare .

Another point is that today the sum of academic knowledge is so big , that it is impossible for one person to specialize in every subject .
But everzbody feels much better and is much prouder of himself , if he is specialised in a specific subject , than if he knows a bit of everything .

Third people are more interested in some things than in others .
And if somebody is interested in something he will be able to learn more and faster than if he is not .
According to that it is more efficient to specialize than to do not .

Last , based on the second point , there could no more scientific research been carried out if everybody would try to specialize on everything , because everybody would die before he would get to the point where he could start research .

So basically you must disagree with that statement .
