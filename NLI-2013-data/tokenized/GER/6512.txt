I partly agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use then there are today in twenty years .
I do agree partly with this statement because of several reasons .
Firstly , we live in a world that constantly changes .
If I talk to my grandparents or even my parents today , it is astounding how much the world has changed during there life 's .
This is why I think is likely that this will continue .

Regarding cars it is obvious for me that there will have to be changes .
For one , the gas is getting more and more expensive .
Therefore , people have to think about cheaper ways to travel and transport things as well as themselves .
As a matter of fact , one can already realise the fact that people are trying to use their car less often than a few years ago .
The train is even used more and the German train company states in its advertisment states that going by train often is much cheaper than driving a car .

Additionally , it is not only a matter of money , but also a matter of the protection of the environment .
Even if the gas was not as expensive as it is now , there would have to be a change .
The air pollution produced by the cars nowadays is too dangerous for all the people living in the world .
It will and it has already caused serious problems .

This is why I think and why I hope that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are now .
However , it is an illusion to think that we can live without cars or even with a lot fewer cars .
People are too used to use their cars all the time .
This is why there has to be another way .
The governments all over the world should invest in the discovery of new ways of transportation .
For instance to use solar engergy to run different cars .

This is why I only partly agree with the statement .
If the people do not try to find different , cheaper and less dangerous , ways for transportation , there will be no way that the number of cars decreases within in the next twenty years .

Furthermore , I can not really imagine that the number of cars will decrease a lot in as much as twenty years .
But it could start to decrease which would be a step in the right direction .

All in all , I think especially because of financial problems that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today , even if it is going to be hard for most people not to use their car anymore .
