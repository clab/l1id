I believe that the issue of whether or not you should have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of specializing in one subject depends on your plans for your future career .

If you plan to study a subject and gain as much academic degrees as possible in it , you may think of becoming yourself a part of the faculty staff , maybe an academic teacher or even a professor .
In such positions you should have a broad knowledge in your specific field of studies so that you are able to provide the student body with an excellent education .
You also have to represent your department and thus seem very competent and confident concerning your `` speciality '' .

On the other hand , I think that this field of employment is rather limited and much more students will apply for jobs in enterprises or other firms .
We live in a world which is characterized by growing globalization and a tendency to change faster and faster .
In such times you should be able to adapt to an ever changing environment , for you can never be too sure of your position .
You may be asked to do additional work which has nothing to do with the subject you studied at university .
It is expected that a modern employee is able to improvise and to be open to changes .
As in these times of modern media the time we need to acquire certain information is much less than some years ago , we are expected to have a broader knowledge of the world , especially in the fields of history , politics and culture .
The world is a melting and meeting pot of cultures and countries which struggle to keep update and remain or become a leading nation in this world .
For that reason every citizen has to play his part in economy , and he plays it best if he is flexible and able to solve any problem he faces whether it is part of the subject he specialized in or not .

In my opinion you should try to gather as much knowledge as possible and the best way to do that is to study many academic subjects and everything that you are interested in as well .
