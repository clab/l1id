I strongly agree with this statement .
This is for various reasons : First , the mere learning of facts is boring to most people , thus leading to lack of motivation and concentration .
Understanding the underlying ideas and concepts on the other hand is more interesting to most students .
Plus , once they have understood a certain concept they often feel proud of themselves which gives motivation for further learning .

Moreover , once a student has developed an understanding for the basic ideas of a certain issue , they are not likely to forget what they have learned as fast as they would had they only memorized facts .
Plus , students who have an understanding of the matter can answer questions more easily , and are even able to answer questions that go beyond the mere facts .
Thus , from a didactic point of view , understanding ideas and concepts is far superior to learning facts .

Now let me give you some examples supporting the statements which I have made above .
Let us take a look at the physics of a flying ball .
Students can either just memorize the formulas or try to understand why the ball is moving the way it is .
Simply learning the formulas is not interesting at all as they consist of only letters and numbers .
It is easy to forget that the x was squared or that what a certain letter meant .
On the other hand , trying to understand the cause of the movement is a much better idea .
Students learn that there are different fundamental forces that act on a flying ball .
They can now draw a picture showing the directions of the forces acting on the ball and retrieve the formulas easily form their sketch .
If they were now given a different problem of moving objects they are also able to indentify the forces and thus deduct a set of formulas describing the motion .
Had they only learned the formulas of the flying ball in the first place , they are not very likely to be able to handle a different , but similar problem .

Another point I would like to make is the fact that once someone knows the underlying concept of a problem , they are also able to explain and to pass on what they have learend to other people .
This is again due to the fact that they are able to answer questions going beyond mere facts .
