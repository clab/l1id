I think that this is not a very simple question .
Especially not for me because I am still young and not yet old .
So I have only the opportunity to summerize out of my sight as a young man .
Nevertheless , I will try to find a well argued result .

Young people on the one hand are in common healthy .
They have the physical possibilty to jump around , dance , make sports , or to move from one point to another .
And all that without any disabbilities or any pain .
Older people on the other hand have often painful times .
Does not matter , if owing to a life 's work , or common diseases .
They are often not able to walk for a long time .
They often have problems with their heart or their blood circulation .
But as they worked for nearly their whole life , older people have gotten the possibilty to save some money .
Young people did not yet had this opportunity .
And nowadays money is an important factor to enjoy one 's life .
As a result of this let me say that old people are rich and young people poor .
Another result of this fact is that older people do not have to work anymore .
So they have the opportunity to schedule their time as they want to .
Young people on the other side have to go to school , to university , or even to work .
Now let me say that time is also a very important factor in our current time .
2:1 for the older people .

And now let me summerize .
Young people are healthy .
But they have neither money nor time to spend in life .
For me time and money is the most important to have fun , i. e. to enjoy my life .
All these regardings let me think that older people enjoy their life more than young people do .
