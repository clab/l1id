In the following essay the topic if it is more important for students to learn facts or to understand ideas and concepts shall be discussed .

My first example has to do with the variety of chemistry aspecaly the organic chemistry .
If a student wants to broaden his knowledge of organic chemistry he has like is sayed in the introduction two possibilities to do this .
He could on the one hand start learning millions of different molecules and wayes to produce them .
On the other hand he just could learn the different ways of how special classes of molecules are produced .
The second way would give him a general understanding of how the synthesis is working and for what and under which conditions he can apply it .
This would give him the same abbilities as the student choosing the first way but he can get to his target in a much shorter time .
He also will be able to learn new things relating to the learned things more easy because he can relate this new information to already learned stuff .
The person using the first way has to learn everything by heart and has no chance to make it easier or quicker .

Looking on the using of the knowledge the first person will always know directly what he has to do to get a specific molecule while the second student has to think about it and search for the right way for producing the same .
But again the second student has a benefit if it comes to a molecule not known by both students .
He will solve this task as just explained but the first student will be completly helpless .

Summarizing what the given example shows it has to be said that understanding general ideas and concepts is faster to learn for the student and makes him more flexible in using his knowledge .
This brings me to the conclusion that the understanding of ideas and concepts is a lot more important to learn for students in my opinion .
