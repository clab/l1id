In newspapers we oftenly read that today 's youth would be the so-called ` fun generation ' who is ignoring the problems and needs of their community .
In my opinion , that 's a generalisation which does n't fit with reality .

Young people can and are engaged in a wide range of fields .
In Germany , there is for example the ` Volunteer Social Year ' that young people can choose to do after they finished high-school and before they start higher education .
In this framework , young men and women are caring for a period of twelve months either for elder or disabled people or are engaged in cultural or political organisations .
Further , it has become relatively frequent that German high-school absolvents go to another country or continent to do some social work .

In 2005 I attended a World Youth Congress in Scotland that gathered active young people from all around the world who are involved in developing projects within their communities .
There were lots of examples of young people who are doing fantastic work ..
A young Indian girl who creates a library for girls or a Sierra Leonean who conducts workshops for a reintegration of former child soldiers to civil life are just two of them .

I think that today 's young generation is combining the principle of fun and care for their community because they discover that it gives pleasure to help .
They have the educational background and the necessary awareness to be able to recognize how their own behaviour affects the development of their community - at least they should have it .
But in the case that this consciousnes is not yet existing , there are other young people lobbzing for it .
An example are the Karlsruhe Student Days One World where high-school students get familiar with topics around globalisation , environmental protection and human rights by attending workshops which are conducted by members of active youth groups .
