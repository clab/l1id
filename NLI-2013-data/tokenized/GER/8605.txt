I do not agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I want to explain my point of view with the following reasons .

First of all , understanding is the key requirement to learn successfully , even facts .
How does someone want to learn facts without understanding them ?
Even facts require a proper understanding of them because facts are not only facts but also related other areas of knowledge .

Furthermore , facts are not combined with learning strategies , wheras the understanding and comprehension of information are always linked to the `` how '' , the way and the means how to understand ideas and concepts properly .

This brings us to the relevance of learning methods .
In order to comprehend ideas , facts , theories represented in texts or in presentations , it is important to be aware of different learning strategies .
Students confronted with ideas and concepts at school or university have to develop strategies which enable them to steer their concentration in order to learn the most important components of an idea .

Moreover , another decisive point about understanding ideas and concepts connected with the idea of learning strategies development , is that compared to facts they can help more in real life .
Facts are also important , of course , but in life , which does not consist of loose facts but of social interaction and things always related to each other , it is more helpful to combine exterior and new information with old ones .
In addition , there are a lot of concepts and theories about to know how to combine old with new knowledge .
Statistics can depict with the help of facts how things appeare in numbers , but onlz helpful strategies about how to comprehend idears prpoerlz van
