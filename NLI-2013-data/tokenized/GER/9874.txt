`` Taking risks and gainig success is a combination which connot be split , because one thing is the reason for the other one '' .
This was nearly the first setence I heard by my professor of economics .

Now , approximately 18 months after I heard this statement , I am discussing the advantages and disadvantages of people who take risks and the effect this has on their success .

I reckon that , as it can be observed in the global economy , business just seems to work by taking risks .
Therefore people like managers , who are involved in deciding-processes , are responsible for their decision .
In some cases they can be wrong , but in others , they are right and for being right they ear honour , apart from the money they get , which makes them successful even in another direction .
If there were no people taking these risks , our whole economy would not be so developed as it is , because without visions of people and their risks to put them into action , many of us would not have a job for instance .
Additionally , I think that it is routine that makes people sick of the life they live .
People who always do the same things for years are often unsatisfied with their life .
I would truly recommend those people to live their dreams and to go for their goals , because everybody has visions and targets , which are worth to be fought for .

However , in my opinion , every change is connected with a certain risk .
Consequently everyone should balance if a new beginnig would lead to a better state of satisfaction .

It appears to me that successful people nearly all share one common character trait : their self-confidence .
Self-confidence is absolutely a most for being successful because there are always hard situations and some people who do not make life easier for someone , who is progress of changing something .

Finally it want to support my arguments by citing my own philosophy of life : `` By taking risk , connected with a bit of luck , people can built a bridge from all the stones they get thrown on their track to success and satisfaction . ''
