I do agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

The term `` enjoying life '' can be viewed at from many different angles and each individual will have an own way to explain this phrase .
But taking into account all possible aspects I can think of right now , the above mentioned statement seems agreeable to me .

Compared to the past , the youth in our society today has the freedom to achieve almost everything - from enjoying a financially secured family background and a prestigious education in school to all personal favourites , such as sports , socializing with others , and the arts .

Young people are energetic and can do whatever physical challenge there is to meet .
They can travel the world during their studies , they can choose from a variety of plans for their career , and are most of the times preferably hired by employees compared to the elderly .

But most of all , they enjoy a wide-spread portfolio pf personal enjoyment .
In a society focused mainly on the younger citizens , the ways to enjoy yourself seem unlimited : dance clubs , bars , sport clubs , travel agencies , internet chat rooms and platforms all offer their services to their young customers .
If you are young , you are in !
All doors seem opened .

Older people often feel excluded from such activities due to bad health , lack of energy or acceptance by the young .
They often fail to catch up with the fast and immensly important development in the telecommunication sector and do not find many possibilities to share time with others .

An example for this striking difference between the desired young people and the rejected older ones can be found at any time of the day in an ordinary chat room .
The chat users tend to ask for the age and the sex of the one they are corresponding with .
Not seldomly they close the chat window when the answer is `` 28 '' !

Of course , there are quite a few offers for older people , too .
But I witness a development in our society that mainly the young people are enjoying themselves .
Maybe the older should get more motivation to learn new skills in order to enjoy their lives .
But maybe the young should accept and respect the fact that one day they too will be old .
If our society achieves THAT , then ALL will enjoy their lives more .
