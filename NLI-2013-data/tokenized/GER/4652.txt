In my opinion , the statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' is absolutely true .
It may depend on the product , how much influence the advertising campaigns have - but for most products in consumer markets it is true .

Let 's have a look at an example : There 's a commercial for chocolate on German television .
That chocolate is delivered in golden paper and is a litte bit more expensive than all the other available products .
Now what would be an appropriate commercial for that product ?
Right - a man looking like James Bond , having a party in the back garden of his huge expensive house and beeing accompanied by beautiful young girls .
And that 's exactly what that whole advertising campaign is like .
But why does it have to be like that ?

No one would want to buy that product if they saw ordinary people - for instance an elderly couple sitting on their couch - on television , eating that chocolate .
As stated above , it 's nearly the same with all kind of consumer products : computers , cars , beer , even razor blades or tooth paste .
To be honest - nearly all kind of razors blades are the same , there is no unique selling proposition .
So the companies use the advertisements to make the difference .
You can see a well shaped guy shaving his mustache and his young girl friend watching him .
Or they tell you that the new Wilkinson shaver has now four razor blades instead of three .
The commercial on TV tells you , that you must have that shaver because it has four razors - no need to prove that it 's really an advantage to have four razors instead of three .

What 's used to make those products much better than they actually are are emotions .
That specific beer shown on TV must taste better than the others - you are like those wild guys who are having fun in the commercial .
Since that new SUV is standing on the top of a big hill in that advert , it must be better than the old model that you 're driving at the moment .
May be - may be not !
But the fact that you see that certain picture produces desire for that product .
Even when the SUV shown on the picture is n't any better at all - it looks much better than all the others do .
And that 's exactly why most companies make their products appear much better in advertisements than they are in reality : It 's working !
