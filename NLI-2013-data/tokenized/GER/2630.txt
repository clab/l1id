How can you judge or measure , if someones enjoying his life or is happy .
I think you ca n't generalise that young people enjoy their life more than old people .
You als ca n't say wether rich or poor people are more happier .

The first thought is maybe that young people like children or teenagers could be enjoying their lives more than older people do , because they do n't have to care about such a lot things like their parents , like paying the bills , shop some food , going to work etc .
It appears that young people have more free time , what gives them the ability to do many thing they like an enjoy .

But in every part of your life there are certain typically things you worry about .
For example a teenager has to grow up , find out what type of human he is , what he likes or dislikes , make experiences with the other gender .
That can bring joy and pain .

The most people look at their childhood and believe it was a very good time , but the most do n't want to make certain experiences again .
Although in your later life you normally got more work to do and more things to worry about you could enjoy this special part of your life .
One other thing why older people could enyjoy their life less , is maybe that they do n't have family and are alone .
Sure on the one hand it happens to old people that their friends die and they have no family , but on the other hand there are so much examples of old people , who are stille married and still have a lot of friends and famlily .

In my opinion happyness and joy can not be categorised by such things like age , gender or the money you have .
Your life and every part of it can bring you joy .
Everyone is responsible for his own joy , no matter how old he is .
Therefore I disagree with the statement .
