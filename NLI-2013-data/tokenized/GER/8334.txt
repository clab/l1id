I completely agree with the statement .
Out of my own experience , I can say that it is much better to understand the ideas and concepts behind a certain topic .
It makes no sense to learn facts only be heart without understanding the real content and sense .
When you simply learn something without really understanding it , you are likely to forget everything soon .
After a few weeks , you will not be able to memorize what you have learned anymore .
But when you really understand the idea and the concept , you will probably remember it much longer or even a life long .

I experienced that phenomenon myself .
It is now nearly one year ago that I passed my `` Abitur '' .
And I have to submit that I forgot a lot ...
Things I learned by heart for instance in biology have disappeared nearly completely .
But on the other hand , I can remember almost everything in maths .
That 's because I really understood the concept behind all these maths operations .
In my opinion , it is a shame that you learn so hard and in the end you forget everything again .
That can not be the objective of effective learning !

So the only conclusion from this can be that it is essential to understand what you are learning .
At the moment , I 'm studying Business Studies and in order to use all the concepts I learn at university ( like audit methods , accountibility , portofolio diversification etc . )
in my later job , it is important that I understand them .
There is no other way !
You can only be good and successful when you know what you are actually doing .

Consequentely , I can only recommend everyone not to simply learn things by heart .
That makes no sense !
Teachers should support this idea as well .
They should n't ask their pupils to learn facts and figures , but to understand the things they have thought them .
