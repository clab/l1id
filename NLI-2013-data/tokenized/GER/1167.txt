Whether it is better to specialize in only a small number of academic fields or whether a broad overall knowledge should be aimed at , is a difficult question for students , teachers , professors , schools , universities and governments in everyday 's discussions .
Often a strategy has to be adopted , that can only focus on one of the given directions .

Having experienced two different school systems and also knowing about the different aproaches taken in schools and universities , I can speak from my own experience in the course of this essay .

The German school system , for example , follows a very generalistic strategy : Students have to learn everything from biology to maths and from latin to music .
By following this approach students are said to gain a good general knowledge and develop their intellecutal abilities while training various skills and techniques .
Students educated in this manner are often percieved as very intelligent and get credit for being able to communicate with people about various topics while using their ability to analyse things from a well-stuctured overall perspective .

On the other hand the information they have is not very detailed and otfen only scratches the surface .
Generalistically educated students often struggle to specialise late in their life for a barrier is set early when competing with specialists in their desired jobs or universites .
They have to cath up with a lot of study , before this is possible and thus often find it hard to compete with the specialists in today 's globalized world .

On the other hand specialists also encounter a lot of problems .
They often find it difficult to gather a general overview when first meeting a topic and are frquently juged upon their poor knowledge in fields they are not specialized in .
If somehow they get bored or are forced to step out of their specialiyed subject , they face very hard conditions not being able to simply swop jobs , universities or simply fields of study and will be urged to built up new knowledge pools from the very beginning / making all their pervious efforts worthless .

However students having followed a specialist education are also known for their deep expertise and thus often have an advantage on any job or university market .
They are good at what they do and thus blessed with success and content about their specification .

Finally , taking both views into account I personally think that a general education prepares students better in an academic sense for the quests of today 's world .
The task they will meet will never revolve around one sinlge subject .
However - also taking todays competitiveness into account - a certain specification is vital if one wants to compete sucessfully in the globalized world .
A well-balanced mixture of in-depth study and generalistic academic skills and topics should thus be the aim of any student , university and government .
