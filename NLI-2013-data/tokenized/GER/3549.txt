I do agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .

I think it is really important that the kids of today do not only sit in their rooms and playing computer or watching TV .
But that is how they spend their free time .
They do not care about people who really need help and they are only interested in themselves .

For my application for a student exchange programm with the government I was asked to spend some time in a place where people need my help .
I chose to go to a place where homeless people can have lunch and dinner .
During that time I saw so many poor people , with old and dirty clothes , who were very hungry or who needed medicine .
It really was an experience for me .
I helped to give them warm lunch and dinner and I felt so good when I saw that the homeless people where happy about the meal and that they could laugh again .
There I felt as if I really can help people and that I did something important .
But if you go in the cities you see many kids who are laughing at homeless people , who are angry about them and who say that they should be taken away by someone .
But who is the `` someone '' if they do not want to help ?
I think it is important to change their behaviour .

Furthermore , the same thing happens with old people , who cannot live longer on their own .
The youth of today does not care about what happens to these people .
They only say that they are old and that they will die soon .
But the question is what they would say if they are in the position of the old people who need help ?
They would wish that there is somebody who helps with their shopping , washing , cleaning the room etc .

In my opinion the experience to do something important and to see people laughing again , is really important for the eduction of today 's youth .
You do not only need to be good at school and know how to work but also how to handle other people and what to do for the society .
For me that is , when you are ready to become a responsible human being .
