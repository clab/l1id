This is a very difficult question , which I ca n't answer by saying `` yes '' or `` no '' .
There are arguments for both opinions .
On the one side , you have to think of the less devoloped countries of today .
They will clearly have economic progress and more wealth for the people within the next twenty years .
For example , the quality of life in countries like China or India has been improved within the last decades .
And qualitiy of life means having your own car , as it is common in Europe or Northern America .
So , in the year 2026 , the world could be faced with inhabitans of former `` third world '' countries who drive their own car .

One the other side , the problems of carbon dioxide , such as global warming or more tornados , will leed to a different way to consider the use of energy .
The `` green house effect '' is more and more acknowleged among scientists , and maybe somedays also the governments will consequentially deal with this problem .
Cars are one of the main producers of coarbon dioxide .
So , if you want to try to stop global warming , one possibility could be to reduce the number of cars .
Maybe the governments - instead of making it possible for their citizens to have an own car - will improve the public traffic systems like buses or trains , or they will try to develope new technologies which are n't dependent on fossile energy , like solar energy nowerdays .
In Germany , also the taxes on fuel are very high .
The government tries this way to make the people become aware of their use of fuel and maybe to reduce it .

Finally , no one knows what the technological or economical developement of the world will be like within the next twenty years .
But these developements will extremely influence the number of cars .

I think , the second version is more probable and therefore I agree with the statement above .
The idea of millions of Chineses and Indians driving their own cars and producing much more carbon dioxide than today is n't very convenient .
