This question is not easy to answer .
On the one hand , I think understanding ideas and concepts is very important .
On the other hand , I think learning facts is also very necessary .

Understanding ideas and concepts , mainly determines or belongs to evolving a good sound knowledge .
A good understanding of such ideas and concepts is always a basic component of a sound knowledge .
Ideas and concepts may be taught in a very casual way , so that students can remember such ideas and concepts easier .
Perhaps they 're using quizzes or games , for example .

Learning should not consist of just learning facts by heart .
Of course , pupils and students have to learn some important facts , for instance , geographical or historical facts .
It is proved that pupils who have to learn only facts may have good or even excellent results in exams , but they also tend to forget things faster .

If pupils understand ideas and concepts , of what they have been taught , they can reproduce it more quickly .
They see basic relations between different ideas , concepts and aspects .
They probably wo n't forget things as fast as pupils do who only learned facts .

Reproduction is a very important part of the learning process .
As long as you can reproduce ideas and concepts , you know or you are able to understand what you have been taught so far .

By way of conclusion , I think students should have both , an understanding of ideas and concepts and learned fact .
The mixture is important .
Emphasis should be on the understanding .
A basis must be designed and this basis must be completed with single facts , which students have to learn .
But , the facts cannot be missed out .
It would be unthinkable to know the ideas of , for example , the French Revolution , but not knowing when this event took place .
The same with geography , it is good to know the customs and habits of , for instance , Japan , but you also have to know were it is situated .
So , as mentioned before there should be an approbriate balance between both , understanding and learning .
