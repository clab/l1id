One of the famous social institution amnesty international has more members than ever before and the interesting thing about their members is that are more young people than adults which seems to negate the common sense that young people are egoists and prefer to do more for themselfes than for other people .
The important and connecting fact on this diverse thesis is that there are more young people which are social engaged , usually work for different organisations , but also tries to look for their own interest and career .

There are a lot of pupils and students who work during their free time for non-porfit institutions like places where homeless people can food , clothes or a place to stay during the cold time .
And also there are many students who chose their subjects on the university in social areas like medicine or law to help other people .
But the important distinct of now and the past is that the young people do not go to demonstration or show their politiacal understanding in the society like their parents twenty years ago .
The young adults combine their modern life with own car and expensive clothes with social engagement .

But in fact , there a few students who do not care about other people .
but this fact depends on the way they are treated by their parents and they society they live in. to show social responsibility is something which must be learned .

As far as I am concerned most of the young people try to show social responsibility and engagement for their community .
they try to help their society with every little step they can do .
