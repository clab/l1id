I do not agree with this statement .
In my opinion it is much more important to be good in one specific subject then to know a litte about many subjects .
So I think you do not need any people who know a little about everything .
They are not valuable to the academic issues .

For example it needs to find a solution on a problem that is much specific , like improving social conditions .
There you need no knowledge about global warming or the different planets on the milkyway .
On the other hand you need no knowledge of the social structure if you want to find a solution of global warming .
So in my opinion our society needs specialists and no allrounders without a deeper knowledge of a specific subject .

Of course it would be nice if you are a specialist on a subject but also know something about the other topics .
But firstly you need to get the special knowledge of one thing before you may care about other issues .
There is no goal in knowing a little about everything .

The people who know a litte about everything can participate on conversations about certain topics but they are not valuable to solve problems which need a higher level of knowledge .
Every part of society needs specialists .
Even our chancellor has her specialists who are involved in the problems which belong to their field of knowledge .
So specialist are the most important people in every government , company and even family .

So for me it is important to become similar with one subject what means becoming a specialist .
This is the reason why I disagree with this statement .
Specialist on academic topics keep the world spinning around .
Withouth those guys there could not be found any solution for problems which require a high level of knowledge .
