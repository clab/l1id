Younger and older people have differnt ways to live their lifes but it seems to me that younger people can enjoy their way of living more than older people can .
That is why I agree with the the statment .

On reason is , that I think that young people are more unconscious than older peolpe and that is why they are more free in taking advantage of what is going on in front of them .
For example if hey have the opportunity to go and visit a friend in another country they often do not thing how hard it is to go there .
They just take a few things and try to reach their friends place , maybe by hitch hiking .
This mostly differes from the behaviour of older people , which often have to plan things in a really organized way .
And often have all this thouhgts like is this the right moment in my life , what about my job ...

This feels like , that young people have a big amount of freedom to act however they want A other reason why young people can enjoy their lifes more is , that they do not have the same amount of responsibillities like older people .
They do not have children to look for .
They can go to a party the whole night long without having lots of stress the next day .

They only need to go to school .
Young people often are more healthy then older peoples , so they can do a lot of things older people cannot do , for example extrem - sports According to all the other reasonable things about this topic I would think , that the main point why young peoples enjoy life betteris , that they still have freedom to choose what they want to do , without beeing trapped in an adult life .
