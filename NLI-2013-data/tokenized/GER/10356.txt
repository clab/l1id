Personally I am convinced that people have to try new things and take big risks if they want to be successful in our days .
I am studying economics and from my lectures and from observations of today \ s economy I know that you can not make much money with something that already exists .
Of course you could just buy something and resell it for a slightly higher price but the big money can only be earnt with something that is brand-new and everybody wants to have .
A good example that proves this thesis is Bill Gates .
He invented a completely new program for computers called Windows and earnt several billion dollars with it because everybody wanted to use his new program and there was no other program of a similar kind available .
Because he was the only one offering such a program he could sell it for a very high price and he and his company Microsoft became extremely successful , admired and wealthy .

But in order to find or invent new things people have always to take risks because at the time someone invents a new product there is uncertainty about whether people will buy it or not .
If the new product does not sell well , all the time and money the inventor has spent with thinking about and producing his product is lost .
If the Windows-programm would not have sold well , Bill Gates would have lost a lot of money instead of earning it .

It is easy to see that big opportunities are always connected with big risks and dangers .
reason for that lies in the fact that in our days the people in the western countries almost have everything they need and always expect new things .
This implies that only these people can be successful who can offer them new things .
