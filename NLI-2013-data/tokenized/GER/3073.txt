`` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' - a challenging topic to discuss , but also a question that becomes more and more important .
Our society , especially the german society , gets older and older .
Since the birth rate decreases from year to year , we will confront an `` aging '' population in the future .
In contrast to emerging and growing cultures like the chinese or the indian , we will confront upcoming problems a lot earlier .

But what defines your ability to enjoy life ?
Does age actually have an impact on the way you live your own life ?
Do factors like physical ability , experience and your current situation in life affect your ability to enjoy ?

Since I am just 22 years of age - I know how much fun it is to be young and how easy it is to enjoy life when there are no physical boundaries or limits .
You do not confront the boundaries of movement , orientation and sight a 80-year old man would have to live with .
When you are young , you are at a point of time where you are constantly experiencing new and interesting things .
And the younger you are , the less you think about the future .
Everything is taken care of by your elders - you do not need to worry about anything .
In my opinion this is the perfect base to start an enjoyable life .
So especially when you are really young , it is a lot easier to enjoy life as it is .

But what happens when you are growing up ?
There are many , many events in life that change your current situation dramatically .
You live in a period of constant change .
From day to day you are confronted with more and more problems .
Starting with puberty , life gets more challenging from day to day .
Your first relationship , your first break-up , your first day of school , your first bad grade , your first car , your first major accident - with all the positive things happening in our youth - you are now confronted new and unkown situations which might prevent you from enjoying life as you did when you were really young .
And the older you get , the more you think about how easy everything was when you were just a kid ...

But is getting old really that discouraging ?
Does the fact that you might not be able to do everything you want , be it because you are physically `` handicapped '' or your current position in life , prevent you from enjoying life ?
I think , as you grow older and older , your preferences change .
Activities like going to clubs or playing around and being physically successful do not define your life any more .
At a certain point of time , be it the retirement-age , different things make you feel content and happy .
Seeing your own children grow up , spending time with people that are close to you or just being able to be a `` good advisor '' to the younger generation might become ways to make your day .
Since life has become more and more stable and changes dont happen that quickly anymore , you get the chance to view life in a totally different way and thus you become able to benefit from different things and enjoy your life .

In my opinion not the age but your own character , your own `` soul '' define wether you can enjoy life or not .
Even the richest man or a child that gets everything it can possibly imagine might be the sadest and loneliest people in the world .
Whether you are old or young , rich or poor - happiness and the ability to enjoy your life are not mainly influenced by external facts - what really plays a role is the person you are and how you see life itself .
