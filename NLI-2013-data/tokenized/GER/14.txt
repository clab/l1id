I fully agree with the statement for four reasons .

1. If you have a broad knowledge of many subjects you can improve your knowledge in these areas constantly .
If you are just good in one subject it will be rather hard to gain new knowledge in other areas because you lack the basic understanding of the topic .

2. When you are looking for a job you can choose from a much larger variety of offers if you have an idea of more than one subject .
Given the example you are a manager and you know many subjects very well .
Then you can draw conclusions , that could help you solving problems at work , with informations from a different subject .
Cross-subject thinking is an important qualification for higher management positions .
Not only because of your intelligence but aswell because you can do smalltalk , which becomes more and more important in business relations .

3. You are always an interesting man when you can have a `` chit chat ' about almost every topic .
It raises your status in society if you have a basic knowledge of lots of topics .

4. Your daily life can be made easier by using the knowledge to solve problems in whatever part of your life you want .
you can use the knowledge like a toolbox for problems .

To put it all in a nutshell having a broad knowledge of a variety of subjects is a base to build on and learn more about particular topics .
It opens you the door to a lot of jobs and raises your status in society .
The knowledge gives you topics to smalltalk about and the use of the knowledge helps you solving problems either in the job or just in daily life .
I only see advantages in having a broad knowledge of many subjects .
