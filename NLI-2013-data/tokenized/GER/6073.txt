In this essay I would like to discuss the statement , if there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .

On the one hand we have to see that the number of cars increased rapidly in the past .
There has been a lot of technical development during years and years .
At the moment you see more cars on the streets than you did in the past .
City representatives are saying that there is n't even enough space for all those cars .
They 're building more parking areas and larger streets .

But now we have to discuss wether this development , seen in the past will go on .
I think in times of globalization the markets around the world spread and people are willing to drive cars .

On the other hand the resource with which cars drive , namely oil , is becoming rare .
There wo n't be enough oil in the future to make each car on the world driving .

But as I already said , there has been remarkable development in technical research and I think that in the future cars wo n't drive with gas or oil but with solar energy or h ^ 2 .
We will have to see if industry will be able to produce as many cars as they 're required by people .

Also we are not sure if the oil will be rare in twenty years .
However , today it can be seen that the car producing industry has the potential to build future cars .
But at the moment they gain a lot of money with the old by gas driving cars .
So they say : `` Why should we build futuristic and environment friendly cars , if we get enough money with the old cars ? ''
.

They should change their behaviour and build environment friendly cars so that the oil wo n't be that rare that not everybody could drive his car resp .
buy a new one .

As one can see there are many factors , which have to be discussed for a statement like that .
A lot has to be done that there could be more cars in future than there are today .

Out of today 's view I think that there wo n't be less cars in use than there are today .
In twenty years there still will be enough oil to feed all the cars .
Unfortunately the car producing industry does n't use the potentials for enviroment friendly cars so that the number of cars wo n't decrease in twenty years and may even increase but with a longer view there will be a change on the streets with fewer cars and cars as a symol for money as it is maybe flying in planes nowadays .
