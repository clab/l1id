One can undoubtedly say , that everybody in our society strives for success .
But what is the underlying principle leading to success ?
Some people claim that successful people are innovative , take risks rather than continuing working on what they already know well .

In my opinion , this statement is true for many cases .
People who try new things or take risks are more willing to explore their boundaries .
This makes it more likely to come accross discoveries and ideas that are revolutionary and lead to and outstanding performance .

Also , these people are usually more adaptable than their collegues who prefer to stick to their old patterns and spend their entire life in an office , performing the same tasks everyday .

Risky people are usually at the forefront of their field , whereas people who do what they know well , will always lag behind .
People who are open-minded perceive changes in their environment not as a threat , but as an opportunity and are able to take these chances to revolutionise an area .
Furthermore , people who are willing to take risks cannot usually be discouraged easily by concerned friends or family when trying to set a very far-fetched idea into practice .

A classic example of how being innovative lead to huge success is the story of a man working for a computer firm .
This company had been specialised on the production of huge computers for a long time .
This employee had the idea to build portable computers ( i.e. laptops ) .
However , his idea was rejected by his boss .
As a consequence , the employee resigned from his job and set up a company who built laptops .
As we know today , his idea had been a huge success - and the company still suffers from being reluctant to adopt to this change .

Critics on the other hand may say that there is no recipe to success .
Just being bold and trying new things does not necessarily guarantee a successful outcome .
Also , moving too far away from ones 's initial area of studies means that a lot of time must be invested in learning new techniques and theories , as many field require a substantial background knowledge in order to work in them .
This , indeed , is a valid argument .
However , as mentioned previously the attitude of people who are prepared to take risks is much more likely to lead to an outstanding discovery .

Clearly , there is no guarantee for success , but as the previous examples have illustrated , only people who are willing to take risks and search for the unexplored are likely way to become very successful .
