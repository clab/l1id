I am a young person and I am working for free in the catholic community of my hometown .
So I have a good idea of what young people do to help in their communities .
Because of this , I am convinced that the statement is wrong .

I know many young peolpe which are helping in the catholic community .
There are many holiday camps for children which are organized by young people in our community .
There is also a monthly meeting of this people .
New games or special festivals are organized by this group of young peolpe .
Many peolpe do not recognize this work .
It is not so obviously like beeing a trainer of a children soccer team .

But not all young people are working in a community like me .
I believe this is because working in communities is first of all not very honorable .
Many people do not even care about the community work .
Communtiy work will be noticed the first time by them , if nobody does it anymore .

Second , community work is not very attractive to young people .
The most people , working for free in the community , are very old .
But it is not much fun for any teenager to work with seniors .
If their friends spend time helping the community , most of the young people will have a great plessure to help their communities - togehter with their friends .

And it is also a problem that most of community work is not for the youth .
Young peolpe do not see the neccessarity to help their community , because the community work does not take effect in their allday life .

Overall , I am convinced that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities .
Furthermore , I believe that they do more at this time then in the past .
