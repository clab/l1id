I definitely agree with this statement .
There are several different reasons .
First of all there is the problem with having children .
Almost every older person has already his or her children .
This circumstance makes it impossible to be indipendent for example travelling around the world , going out , meeting friends , changing the job , changing your partner , planning your day individualy , etc .
In my opinion everything seems much more complicated .
By the time you are getting older and older and your health is decreasing .
This means free time activities are getting limited .
Most of the time older people do have more money and time to spend but are not able to live their dream because of children or physical problems .
These aspects do not mean that older people are not enjoying their life because this depends from the point of view .
I am right now a young person and it is clear that I am not ready to have children .
I 'm enjoying life now because I have the possibility to study , to go abroad to learn and improve different languages , to plan my whole day and week without taking care of someone .
This way of thinking seems really selfish and ignorant , but exactly this aspect makes it possible for young people to enjoy their life more than older people do , or better , even can .
Through this behavour it is possible to gain experience in different fields which creates finally your character and your point of view towards the whole social , public and private life .

This ignorant way of thinking also helps you to prepare yourself of not being hurt from others and .
