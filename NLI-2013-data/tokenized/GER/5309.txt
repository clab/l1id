I totally agree with the statement for it is the very purpose of advertisements to raise the sales of the particular product .
In a capitalistic society , it is a general rule that nobody would pay for anything he does not expect to get a benefit out of .
Companies place advertisements , `` commercials '' for their products with the only purpose of selling them .
This will generate profit , their benefit .

Competition drives them to discover the most efficient ways to do so .
The most simple and basic form of advertising a product would be a neutral statement of its features .
This is seldomly done , for there are provenly better ways to motivate potential customers to buy .
Even if it were true that all products that are advertised would have - from a neutral standpoint - features that would make them worth buying , this is not what the consumer asks for .
It has been discovered that emotions are the key to human motivation .
This very broad realization is being directly utilized by advertisements .

I will illustrate with the automobile as an example .
It is no secret that cars are very important for peoples ' prestige : `` Tell me what you drive and I tell you who you are '' .
Therefore , a wide variety of different cars for different types of `` lifestyles '' exists .
Commercials try to appeal to people that lead a certain lifestyle and to convey emotions that relate to it .

In an ideal scenario , a customers ' decision is entirely based on that he thinks owning the car will invoke the certain emotion that was displayed in the advertisement which again relates to his lifestyle .
Factors such as quality and price are totally neglected .
As a natural result , in most cases , the car was made to look much better than it actually was .
That is , when you judge from a natural standpoint , neglecting the `` emotional '' quality of owning such a car .

With the `` emotional '' method proven to work as an effective means to raise product sales , it is consequentially applied by most companies for a wide variety of products .
Without trying to say that all products seem better in the advertisements than they actually are , it can well be generalized onto the vast majority of them .
