The statement if successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , is very difficult to evaluate , because it depends on how well someone does on a special topic .
Thus , it is very difficult for me to agree or disagree with the above mentioned statement .

In my opinion a person can also be successful in doing things which he or her knows in detail .
When I think of a professor of mathematics for instance who is teaching at a university , it is even necessary for him to know his subject very well .
He is also successful , although he does not try new things , because there are no real discoveries in math which can be made .
Everything is already fully discovered .

Nevertheless , there are people who need to try new things in order to be successful , scientists for example .
If you do not take risks , you will not have any success in your field of study .

A very controversial topic at the moment is cloning .
Everyday , genes are getting reproduced by several scientists .
All this started some time ago when `` Dolly '' the first sheep was cloned .
The world at that time was shocked .
These scientists who were responsible for Dolly 's existence took the risk of maybe creating a monster , because no one has ever had any experience with this technology .
Many people , especially those with religious backgrounds , raised many concerns .
But despite these critics , the scientists moved on dealing with human embryos .
In the USA , voices have already announced that a human has been cloned .
To my mind , this is defintely a success , whether or not you agree with the ethical background .
Scientists have taken the risk and they have tried new things .
Consequently , they have been successful .

The point I am trying to make is that the statement I had to discuss is bias .
On the one hand , it is necessary for being successful to discover new areas , but on the other hand people can also be good in only one thing .
It just depends on the kind of person you are .

All in all , I cannot disagree or agree with this statement , because for me both are very important facts for being successful !
