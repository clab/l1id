The question I want to discuss about is whether young people enjoy life more than older people .
This questions plays a not unimportant role , since the average age of especially western communities chang dramatically and today 's young people are more and more drawn into the corner of a fun - generation .

But what is meant by enjoying live ?
People of different age groups have different definitions of enyoing life .
Young people are constantly facing more problems about their personal future especially concerning money .
Since a lot of young people ca n't be no longer sure to have a secure working place , many young people try to push this problem aside , by covering the left spot with activities that might distract their view off the actual problems they have .
So they often lose the focus on how to solve their problems by positioning themselves in a world , where everything is about fun and joy .

At first , this might work , until the person realizes , that fun and joy cannot happen without money .
At this point young people can go in two different directions .
The first group may focus back and concentrate how to get back on track while the other group might be trapped in a vicious cyrcle of wanting to enjoy one 's life , but having no money to do so and also not beeing able to get any money the legal way .

Older people on the other hand are more experienced and since almost everybody of them , especially here in Germany , is affected by World War II , they value the things they posess more than a person who has not gone through anything comparable .

But if an older person can enjoy life or not , depends on his or her possibilities to do so .
Illness or death of one 's partner might easyly avoid to enjoy life .

But even if you are healthy and have a working partnership , you still need money to fulfill your dreams and to enjoy life for instance by travelling different places in the world , buy your favourite TV , etc ...

And that is the point where the arguments about young people and old people come together .
I think , that you ca n't finally say that young people enjoy life more than older people .
To enjoy life you need to create a basis which allows you do develop your personality and your self-actualization and this does not depend on whether you are old or young .
