There has been a wide discussion about the behavior of young people during the last years .
One of the critical points often provided by people is that nowadays more and more young people stop to spend free time for community activies .
Before I point out my personal opinion to this statement I would like to have a look at the overall situation in my country and beyond referring youths doing community work .

In Germany it has never been very common to do community supporting activities .
Since the state with its highly developed welfare system took over most of the tasks , youths were n't that much demanded to do voluntary community work .
I know that we can find different situations in other countries .
For instance , in the USA , if one wants to study at a good university as Harvard or Princeton , next to your good grades you should also show some evidence that you have carried out some community work .
Also in East Germany before the unification it was common that groups of young people helped out the community in for example providing recycling stations , newspaper services .
Children and young people even helped out on the fields of the nationally owned farms .
Although these tasks were n't often made voluntary , it increased the feeling of the youth to be connected to its community and helping each other .

Nowadays I think that the feeling for the need of community work more and more disappears .
Among young people it is even a reason to be kicked out of a group when one is doing community work .
It 's not fancy enough .
The feeling that everyone has to care for himself is spreading around .
Noone cares about other persons due to individualistic behavior patterns of the 21st century .
Sometimes it is the case that even neighbors do n't know each other and therefore would never come up with the idea to help each other .
But this is not a `` young people '' problem .
If the parents do n't live a life where helping other persons is a part of , how can their children learn that it is important to spend some of their free time with community work ?
Additinally young people today can do so much more things .
Why doing community work in groups when sitting in front of the television or playing a video game is so much easier and more comfortable ?

Therefore I agree with the statement above .
Reasons for it can be found in many areas but the most important one I think is the tendency of the society to stay for oneself and do n't care about others .
