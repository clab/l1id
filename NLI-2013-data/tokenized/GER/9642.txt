It is a much debatted topic in psychology , in companies or among friends what actually makes a successful person successful .
Are there certain characteristic that all successfull people have in common ?
Characteristics that are essential ?
Do we for example need to be risktakers in order to be successful ?

Sometimes it is stated that successful people are not satisfied with things they arelady know how to do well .
They do not rest on their achievments but rather go out , explore , take risks and are willing to do and try out something new .

I would say that there are a lot of different ways to be successful .
It is not only depending on the definition of success ( is not the same for everybody ) , but also on the area or subject in which you are working or lets say be successful .

For example someone that has a certain speciality can be successful in a certain profession without that above stated charactersitic .
A model for instance just looks very well and s/he can be very successful in her subject without ever going new ways or taking risks .
S/he just has to stick on what s/he already knows .

In other areas I would say it is definitively essentail to be a risktaker .
For example when you are working in a research department it is essential that you have good and new ideas .
That characteristic is necessary to be able to perform this job well because if you are always just thinking about what you already know there would never be any progress .
Another example is when you want to open up an own business .
You are definitley going a new , unexplored way by doing this because you cannot predict for sure how things will develope .

In my opinion it is not essential to try new things or take risks in order to be succesful .
I would rather use this statement the other way around : When you are risktaker and you like to explore new things you are more likely to be successful than a person that always sticks to the things s/he already knows .
