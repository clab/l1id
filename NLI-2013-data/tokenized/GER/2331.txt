The statement that young people have a greater ability to enjoy life than older people clearly is an issue worthy of discussion .
In the following essay I try to give examples supporting and opposing this fact .

In the beginning of this short passage it is necessary to state what can indicate enjoying ones life .
The most intuitive points are of course the amount of time spent on activities , which bring fun to an individual .
Examples for this can be sports , cultural activities such as theater or visiting the movie theater , social activities such as meeting with friends or visits in clubs , bars or discos .

The actual amount of time spent on each activity clearly counts toward the young people .
Yet it should not receive much attention , since growing age comes along with growing responsibility .
We shall therefore try to acknowledge the subjective feeling of fun deriving from each activity for the individual .

When it comes to sports , a difference between old and young people is not clearly distinguisable without thorough research , which cannot be conducted at this point .
Most older people lie great emphasis on sports in order to stay healthy or free their minds by physical challenge .
One could argue , that young people are taking the particular sport to a higher level , but this clearly does not support the idea of a greater enjoing .
Every sport is enjoyable for the conducting individual , even if it is being practised at a very low level .

Focusing on the cultural activities , a general viewpoint is necessary .
In general the age of the individual determines its taste .
Therefore the activities chosen are highly dependent on a individuals age .
Again the type of activity chosen cannot determine whether one individual receives a higher reward in terms of fun from its choice , than the other individual does from the other choice .

The third category stated above indicates the greatest difference between age groups .
It is clearly observable and commonly known , that from a certain age onwards less emphasis is being laid upon going out a night and visiting bars , clubs or discos with friends .
From a younger point of view this could be seen as a lack of fun in ones life .

To conclude this paragraph the differences in behavior between old and young people are clearly visible .
Yet this observation is lacking evidence that young people actually enjoy life more than older people .
Thus this statement cannot be backed by thorough reasoning .
The difference in behavior do not indicate more fun in life on one or the other side .
Yet the positive correlation between age and responsibility could make it harder for older people to conduct fun activities .
