Nowadays people use to describe our society with quickly changing terms .
A popular one is : ` the ego-society ' .
The theroy of writers or journalists employing this description is that especially young , urban people are very focussed on their career and benefit , not being very interested in communal activities or even in social relationships .

From my experience I can say that I know many people who live this way , thinking only of their own interest .
At school for example there were much fewer possible activities or clubs then in former days , because fewer and fewer students were willing to organize or conduct one .
Most initiatives were brought up by teachers who did not recieve much support .

There are , of course many examples of socially very active Juveniles who for example work in institutions for disabled people in their free time or simply organize sports clubs .
I think that there is an active culture of helping others without any benefit even among young people .
But still the main tendency is to leave such aparently unattractive works to others or demand pay .

This developement which can be seen in many of our big cities surely has its reasons .
Advertisement in television keeps showing us a world , a very attractive world in which you are not much more than the sum of the things you own .
Young people today do not identify themselves with the moral or social values of their parents , they have become out of date .

While our parents were for example celebrating Parties of their quarter or village nowadays young people prefer anonymous discotheques or bars .
They seem to barely identify with the places they live in and many of the older people surrounding them .
Instead peer groups meet in chat rooms on the internt or shopping malls in the outskirts .
Since many do not feal being part of their community they have no clear idea what or whom they should give their help and time .
