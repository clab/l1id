The question if it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than to specialize in one particular subject is not easy to answer .
First of all many academic fields need a specialisation to explore new developments that broaden the understanding of the related research field .
This are especially the human sciences were processes become more and more complex and a particular researcher propably would not profit from knowledge in a field not related to his work .

In contrast to that there are many academic fields were a broaden understanding of different sciences can help you enormously , as many field are interacting each other .
The whole world is involved in the globalization process , so new commitments between people , countries or institutions are made , that had no ealier contact .
Business manager have to face new partners belonging to an other culture , that could lead to misunderstandings , if the people do not have the related cultural skills .

From my personal point of view , I appreciate to have a broad knowledge of different academic subjects .
Studying European Studies with a focus on political sciences , it is absolutely necessary to have skills in sociology to understand what societies as well as parts thereoff are thinking about various steps of political integration on the European level .
This also includes skills in European law , as you are not able to archive your political goals without knowing the particular law system , this applies at east on functional democrcies .
Additionally , my economic skills are important as without their functionability the whole system would collapse , so you always have to take different positions of view into account , before making a particular decission from your own point of view .

Summarized I would say that it is dependent on your academic field to choose in favor or against a broad knowledge .
On the one hand there are definitly experts needed to be sure that scientific process goes on , but on the other hand in many different occassions a broader understanding of different academic fields is useful to act securely in a world becoming more comprehensive .
