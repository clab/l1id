Do young people enjoy life more than old people do ?
This is a very difficult question to answer and to be honest , I wonder , too .
But for sure I can give you a view out of a young persons perspective .
I surely can state that I alway want to enjoy life to the maximum .
So now we have a different viewpoint on this question , respectively on the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Maybe do young people have more and better opportunities to enjoy life than older do ?

I 'm asking myself what is needed to enjoy life ?
I start to think about what makes me happy .
Time and money plays an important factor to being happy .
But also friendships , a rewarding job , familiy , sexual life , inner peace , living standarts and peace in general as impacts on howmuch you enjoy life .

Let 's take the first two points I mentioned , time and money .
I already see a conflict here .
When you young , you usually have time , but no money to fullfill your dreams .
There are certain points you can fullfill yourself which makes you enjoy life at the time your young , but for sure not all of them .
For example you wo n't have the money for spending beautiful shoping weekends in New York and sleeping in a beautiful Hotels - okay , fair enouth , not everybody is looking for that , but as mentioned in the begining , I 'm writting from a personal point of view .
You start to study hard to become maybe an important personality in future so that you finally could bring up hte money for doing this New York-shopping trips .
But then , well , you won-t find time anymore .
So you always will look forwards till you get retaired for finally spending your over years earned money , but then you might not be in good health conditions anymore .

My point is , to conclude , that there in every life-section will be certain points you enjoy to the maximum but on the other hand points you ca n't fullfill - certainly for that special moment not .
You always will keep on dreaming .
