In this text i am going to deal with the question if young people enjoy life more than older people .
Young people do not have a lot of problems like older peoples because they do not need to work for getting money .
They get money from their parents or grandparents .
Furthermore , young people do not have fear of the future , because they do not think about it .
Additionally , they enjoy playing with their friends , e.g. playing football .
Furthermore , young people enjoy about little things , for example a young child is happy about a small bubble gum .
Young people like children have to do what their parant want because the parents give them a little money and food .

Older people have to work because they need money for food , a flat or a house , clothes and so on .
Furthermore , they have not a lot of free time like young people .
Otherwise , older people have some advantages like driving a car because of their work .
They decide what they want to do and do not rely on other people 's decision like young people do .

In conclusion , i think young people enjoy life more than older people because they do not fear the future like older people sometimes do .
