From my point of view is this statement not to support .
There some significant reasons to reduce the use of cars , for instance the environmental costs through pollution , the expenses in general for the car owner like for fuel etc .
But I strongly believe , that even if the natural resources are running out and the prices of fuel will continue to rise , and even if we pollute the air and do not do ourselves a favour , I believe that the mankind will not use the cars less , as long there are any cars available .
And this opinion has many reasons .

The people today do often not care about the world tommorrow , they just live in the presence , in the time of comfort and waste .
People want to be independend , they do not want to wait somewhere at the busstation , being ruled by a scheduled arrival and departure .
Using the car is often the most comfortable and fastest way to get somewhere , especially to a workplace .
Often it saves time taking the car than for example the train .

Nowadays we are too individualistic , we also want to have our own private space , and often prefere to drive somewhere just on ourselves quiet and relaxed , than having chatting people around us that could disturbe our peaceful moment in the car .

Having and using a car has also many practical reasons .
If you go somewhere for shopping for example , your car is able to store a lot , you do not have to carry heavy bags around .

Especially for a family do have cars an enormous importance .
It is more pleasant for a mother having your children close by you in your car , than using with them the public options , that only would cause stress and bring you children in a danger .

But I believe that if our economic system will continue like that , having a car will become much more luxurious .
But I am convinced that people rather would increase their depths and getting a loan to afford having a car than missing this out .
The human beings in the industrial world are just too lazy and comfortable for being more sensible and thinking of others or considering the environment .
