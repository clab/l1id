Yes , I do agree with the statement , that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
There are some developments in society , that corroberate this statement as well as my own experience in the local community work .

Let me first outline the social reasons that support this current situation .
We are today living in an egoistic and materialistic society .
People usually just live by and care for themselfs .
This can also be seen in the increasing number of single housholds .
Making carrier and living a hedonistic life is just what is promoted by the public media and our economical and political agendas .
We are living in a society that is largly based on consuming and that subsequently produses a lot of products and possibiliities to consume .

Suffice to say that this creats a condition where people do not even have the impression to have enough time to engage themselfs in selfless community work .
They work much to make a living and to finance all the pleasures the entertainment industrie is advertising as the means to live a happy and succesful life .

But it 's not only that enjoying alle the entertainment is so time consuming , but there is also a lack interest in helping others , due to a missing moral education .
In the past this moral education was largly done by religios institutions that where just a cornerstone of every society .
You can agree or disagree with the development to a rather secular society , but one can hardly deny , that our society is painfully lacking an institution that would overtake this important moral education .
Politics and the media certainly do not fill this gap , but actually are increasing it .

My own ecperience as a leader of a youth group in my community is - also talking to the older members of our community - that it is getting harder and harder to motivate young people to engage themselfs in helping others .
Also the number of young people that are active in our community tremendously decreased over the last 50 years .
