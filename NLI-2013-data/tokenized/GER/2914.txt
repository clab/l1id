I agree with that statement .
Most people do n't think like that but i think thats true .
There are many reasons why younger people enjoy life more .

Firstly , the best jears are over for them .
The most of them have seen , done and lived anything so live has to offer no rising for them like it has for young people .
The firts kiss for example is a very beautiful experiance for young people and thez get butterlys in their stomache while doing it but for old people it 's onlz a normal process .

The same is with getting the driver licens .
Young people ca n't wait to be 18 and get it and drive their own car .
In compearance to that car driving is not as exiting for older people than for younger .

Secondly , young people can go out with frinds or go to the disco and dance all night long or go to a bar and drink something or someting like that , what old people can not do just becouse the most of their frinds are dead or to old so they can even not walk .

Furthermore , many old people live in '' houses for old people '' ( Altersheimen ) .
There they have the same process every day .
They wake up at the same time , eat at the same time , go to toilet at the same time , wath tv at the same time and so on .
That seems to be very boaring to me .
Life has to offer much more to young people .
Every day they make new and unknown experiences
