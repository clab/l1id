The issue at hand is : is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or is it more imporant for students to learn facts .
This issue is very important , because the answer to this question could lead to a better learning system .
In my opionion both the understanding of ideas and concepts and the learning of facts is very important .
But if I have to chose , I guess understanding ideas and concepts would be more important .

The first reason why I believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important is because students will forget the learned facts , but the understanding structures and concepts keep in their minds .
For example , when a student learns why exactly to use this kind of word in sentence in a foreign language , he can everytime remember why he is doing this way .
But if he just uses this kind of word , someday he will forget it and ca n't remember why he should use this word .
The student who learned ` why ' using exactly this word , can everytime remember .

An other reason why I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts is because students do n't learn how to solve problematic issues .
When they only learn facts , they are not able to understand the real problem , because the never learned how different concepts work .
They just learned what the facts are , but every single issue differs from the exactly learning structure , so they maybe do n't understand the idea .
But students who learned how to deal with ideas and different concepts , are able to solve the problem better .

Finally , in my opinion it is easier to learn facts than to understand ideas and concepts .
That is an important aspect , because many students may be a little bit stupid or are not very intelligent , but they get the same grades than the intelligent ones because of learning facts .
That is would n't be right , because when a student understands the idea und understands the ` why ' , he is a very good at what he does .
But the student who just learns the facts , he is n't good at what he does , he just can things good in his mind .
Should this be the sense of learning ?
In my opinion , it is n't .

Ultimately , I think understanding the concepts and the ideas is very important for a student .
It is also important to learn facts , because in some subjects you have to learn more facts than in others .
But my reasons and examples demonstrated that it is the better for students to understand , so they keep things better in their mind , the can solve problems better and the can be proud of their grades !
