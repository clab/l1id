For the discussion of the question whether young people give appropriate time for helping their communities some definitions have to be pointed out in the first place .
First of all what means helping the communities ?
These are probably activities that shape and support a traditional communities , e.g. attending communtiy events such as festivities and celebrations as much as helping out if there is any need of support for example for seniors .

Secondly : what means nowadays ?
Has there really been at time when this ever worked out properly ?
The answer of this question touches the first aguement i want to talk about .
Of course there has been a change of the situations and the meaning of communities in the western world during the twentieth century .
One aspect certainly is the strong increase of the density of population inducing a growth of communities .
By becoming bigger and more complex they lost their athmosphere of a defined neighbourhood , whicht definately determined the people `` s attitude towards their communtiy .

An aspect whicht also might have affected this attitude are the rising requirements of a successful life .
Recently the social pressure for getting a high qualification in order to get a good job became much more important than it was maybe fifty years ago .
Especially young people are highly determined by this and this causes an increasing lack of time for a vivid community life .

A nother aspect is certainy the fact , that people have less moral values due to a lack of a religious backround .
And I would conclude that there is definately a need for establishing new ethical attitudes among people in general .
the question is how to do this .

In the end I would say that to agree the statement one has to define the preconditions of the statement .
