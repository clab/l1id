In my opinion the statement is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
To confirm my opinion I will give several examples .
For example if you think of a product filled in bags like soup and then of a commercial in television .
The soup looks colorfull and it seems that many thing are in it .
But if you will buy it and cook it on your own at home there are not as much noodles in it as the commercial wants to make people believe .
This happens on an special purpose .
Advertisements are made to sell something to people .
People who make advertisements are specially trained to know what people want to have , so they will only show us the things we want to see .
In my example this are more noodles in the soup then there actually are .
Another example is advertisements for underwear on large posters everywhere outside .
On these posters you can see beautifull men and women , and the underwear fit them perfectly .
The inventers of such advertisements did this perfect thing to make people think that they can look like these people too if they will buy the product .
So it is all about what buyers want to see and feel when they look at advertisements .
The makers of advertisements mostly pretend to have the best and perfect product and to convince buyers to believe so too , they exagerate in demonstrating good items as perfect items .
No one wants to spend his or her money on things that are not worth it , but they also have to believe in advertisements .
