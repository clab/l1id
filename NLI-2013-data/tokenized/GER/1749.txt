In my opinion , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
I am of this opinion for different reasons : Firstly , you need the knowledge of many different academic subjetcts to understand a specific subject totally .
For example , you cannot understand literature without historical knowledge .
Knowing what a novel or play is about is just not enough , additionally you must know something about the time in which the literature was created or the society the author lived in .
This knowledge will not be presented in literature class , so you need to deal with history , too .

Secondly , studying one specific subject is only succesful if you have thought about the subject from all possible perspectives .
Understanding something only from one point of view creates the risc that you do not know enough about critics or different opinions .
For example , there are many different opinions about evolution .
If you are specialized on biology only , you will never learn some other theories or you will never understand how American theologists can argue against Darwin 's evolution theory .

Additionally , a reason why I think that having a broad knowledge of many subjects is the better option , is that some specific subjects contain questions that cannot be answered by this specific subject alone .

A very good example is medicine : you can study medicine without ever getting in touch with ethics , but during your career , you will need ethical knowledge to make some important decisions .
It is impossible to be a good doctor if you are only interested in medicine ; you have to be interested in ethics and the human society in general , too .

In conclusion , we can say that the best way is deciding which subject you are the most interested in then and study on it .
At the same time you always have to keep in touch with other academic disciplines to become not only an expert of one specific subject , but to get a wide general knowledge .
