Today , education is a very important factor for the personal development and as a concequence , many people have a wide knowledge in different subjects .
For my person , I agree and also disagree with the statements due to the following reasons .

One one side , a students should concentrates himself on one specific topic .
Today , there is so much to learn about on subject , you do not have the time to study an other subject .

Imagine the subject biology .
There are so many inventions in the technology for biology and this inventions result in new discoveries in the subject .
As a concequence , students and also graduate persons always have to update their knowledge and that would not provide the time which is needed to study a different subject .
Therefore , a specialisation absolutly necessary to be good at his subject .

But in my opinion , there exists also a differt view .
Influences like globalisation and environmental pollution have changed the world .
Everthing is connected together .
Further , society deeply depends one nature .
And in this framework , it is really important the we know how the world is connected .

A broad knowledge of many academic subjects can provide this knowledge .
For example , a chemist in a big chemistry company can only do his job well , when he also know what consequences can occur in the environment and even in the society .

In conclusion , in my opinion there are some reasons why I should support the statement of specialisation and also some reasons why I shoud support the broad knowledge of academic subjects .
