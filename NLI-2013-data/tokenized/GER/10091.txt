I believe that while people who keep doing what they know they can do well can be successful for a certain period of time , they will eventually have to turn to something different and try new things in order to stay successful in the long run .
Thus , people who are successful over long periods of time are usually characterized by the willingness to give up the familiar and to `` explore the unknown '' , that is to try out different things even if they do not know how it will turn out .

In the short run , people can be successful by clinging to what they know how to do well if they are doing something which others cannot copy easily .
Consider , for instance , a painter who masters a certain technique of painting which is popular among buyers of art and which other painters cannot copy .
This painter may be successful even if there is not much alternation , say , in the themes of her paintings , because she is the only one who can produce such works of art and people are willing to buy them .

But success based on keeping doing what one can do well may not be of long duration .
Let us continue the example of the painter introduced above : Other painters may try to copy the artist 's painting techniques and themes , an eventially they may manage to do so .
If so , the works of art of the painter who had used this special technique first do not any longer stand out as much as they used to because others have gained the ability to reproduce similar works of art .
In order to stay successful , our painter may now have to try out something different : For instance , develop a new technique or turn to different themes .
She will have to explore new ways of painting .
If she manages to do so in a way which friends of art find appealing , she will again be one or several steps ahead of her `` competitors '' , and she will continue being successful and reknowned as a painter .

A similar logic can be applied to the case of industrial production .
A person who invents a new kind of product and who is the first to introduce it to the market will be successful in selling this product at a high price and will make profits if customers like this product .
However , over time competitors will manage to copy the product or supply similar substitutes .
Thus , the producer will have to decrease the sales price of his product if he still wants to sell it , and his profits will be reduced .
In order to keep profits on their previous high level , the producer will have to conduct research in order to invent and introduce new products ; that is , he will have to give up the familiar and try out something different .

Therefore , I believe that people who are successful over long periods of time are people who are willing to try new things instead of simply keeping doing what they know they can do well .
