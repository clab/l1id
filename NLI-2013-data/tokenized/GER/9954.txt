In this society succes plays a very important role .
The definition of success is to be good at something and make money with that trade , or talent .
Some people have it easy and some people have to work a little harder for it .
It is very important to be familiar with the subject of interest , however it is also important to try new things in different areas and take risks .
A person can not truly know their potential , if they only stick with the trade they learned .
If their potential of growth in that field has deminished and they are not successful they will never be successful .
It is impossible for a person to be successful if they do not try anything new and drastic .
It will always keep them in the same routine , and even in the same financial situation they are in today .
A drastic change is needed in order to be successful because creativity can only come from change .
It could be real estate , or even a bussiness .

It is definately a good thing to take a certain amount of risks because if nobody would take any risks our economy would not be same today .
The founders of various fast food places , coffee places , and grocery stores took risks to open their stores .
Imagine the world without Starbucks , Mc Donalds , and Wal Mart for example .
These are internationaly traded corporations , and very successful .

Trying new things like the idea of a drive through restaurant , for example , and taking risks in not knowing if it would be a success in the future , play a very important role in being successful .
