Today almost evey adult has a car .
Most people use their car eveyday , for essential things such as going to work or driving to a supermarket to buy food .
A car is an element of daily life .

Of course in cities where there is a good public transport system , people do not need a car for their daily life .
But in more rural areas or cities where puplic transport is not very effective , there is the need of cars .

Reasons to reduce the number of cars are to protect the environment and the fact that cars and fuel are getting more and more expensive .
Maybe in some years there are no more as many people as today who can afford a car .

On the other hand there is the fact that business and working life gets more and more flexible , spontaneous and individal , and the need to get to a specific place in a short time increases .
And we should not forget the industrial branches that produce cars .

Weighing these points , I came to the conclusion that I do not think the number of cars will decrease .
I want to point out that I think it would be a better development for life on earth if there would be fewer cars in twenty years , but I do not think this will happen .

Today industry that produces cars is still a growing business , and I cannot imagine that this would change in the next few decades .
I study geodesy , and something that I could do later is developing navigation systems .
An example where navigation system are commonly used is in cars .
Many people and companies work and research for new developments in cars and components for cars .
So I do not see a financial reason why fewer cars should be produced in twenty years .

To sum up I want to say that I would be very happy if there were fewer cars in twenty years .
The reason for this opinion is the protection of nature and the environment and to reduce pollution caused by cars .
But I do not think this will happen because business and earning money encourage the production of more and more cars .
And I cannot imagine that business interests will step behind in favour of environmental reasons .
