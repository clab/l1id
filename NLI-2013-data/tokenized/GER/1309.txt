Since five years I am a student in Biotechniologie .
This is a very special subject - but I got during my studies also an overview to many other subjects .

Like I have made it I think it is good .
Having his own specific subject and being really competent at this subject but having an overview and a basic knowlegde of different subjects .

Then people from different specific subjects can work together on a bigger projects in which are different specific subject are needed .

In my opinion it is important because today every special subject is very large and you cannot get enough knowledge in every subject to develop a bigger academic project alone .

For example I am doing my diploma thesis at a topic in biotechnology .
And about the tasks of biotechnology I know very much but sometimes I have a question about the chemistry .
Then , yes - I can read a book about it but I can also go to the Chemical Department .
There I can ask a specialist , and he can explein it to me very easy .

And there is also another argument .
It saves time and time is money .
It ist quicker to put the knowledge of different persons together .
When I would read a book about my chemical problem , I would lose much time .
Probably the person from the Chmeical Department would have explained it to me in an fwe minutes .

In conclusion you can see that it is more effective to have one specific subject and then to make some teamwork with people from other specific subject .
It will be easier and quicker .
