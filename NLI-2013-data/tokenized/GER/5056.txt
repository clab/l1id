I agree with the statement that products seem much better than they really are .
It is the commercial 's job to present goods and services as good as possible .
Advertisment is an essential way to communicate with prospective but also already existing customers .
We get information via different ways : TV , radio , newspapers and paper-walls along streets .
Marketers distinguish between dormant and already existing wishes .
Af part of their work is locating clients and find the best way to give them information about for example a'new generation ' of a certain product .
Imagine you enter a supermarket and just see food , drink and cleaning aids in neutral packages .
People memorize and recognize products in an easier way by identifying a certain brand , especially when they are already familiar with a specific one .
Products are usually advertized either in an abstract environment , I mean just the perfectly photographed product with a bright-coloured background , or by offering it by attractive actors .
Brands tell stories , create a certain life-style .
For example : Is there a really amazing difference in taste between pepsi-cola and coca-cola ?
I do n't really think so .
Ordering and having a coke provides a certain feeling , independent on the taste .
What you see , is always an idealized picture .
It is up to your choice whether you want to buy it at least once and try whether the content covers your imagination .
But do n't be disappointed if maybe the package tells a different story concerning the packed good .
Another example : Cars are not only buyed due to financial reasons , but also because they create an imagination for the driver to be sporty , in a certain way it means a method of showing status .
To summarize I think we all know about the effect of advertisement , it is a comfortable way of getting news , but the elder we become the more concious we are about the effect .
