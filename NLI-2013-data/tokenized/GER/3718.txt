Nowadays it may seem at first sight , watching the daily news about the terrible , careless and lazy youth , that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
In my opinion this statement does not show how reality really looks like .
Of course there are young people who do n't do anything for their community , but there are still a lot of young , intelligent and involved people who show their best leadership and invest hard work into supporting and helping their communities on a volunteer bases .

The cause of the statement shown above might be the always existing and never ending generation conflict that reflames in every country and in every century .
But young people do help their communities these days too .
For example at my university there are a lot of possibilities for students to get involved in community service as a volunteer .
Of course not every students gets involved with community work but most of my friends do .

Let me give some certain examples : There is a law club that gives legal adive to people who cannot afford a lawyer .
The people who come there do not have enough money to pay a normal lawyer , so the students organised a club where they help people to find legal advice , but do not take any money for it .
( this happens in Poland , in Germany it is forbidden ) .
Another students club takes care for the environment , another teaches little children to speak foreign languages , and another helps unemployed people to organise a company or firm and take the first legal and economic steps to it by developing business plans .

A lot of students get involved in their ` international ' community as well , joining amnesty international for instance and fighting for human rights through organising different actions like writing letters to different governments , governements who are violating human rights .

Some of my friends get involved socially .
They go to schools and do a social year in their own country or in foreign countries for example .
Ina , a friend of mine , did that in a middle school for handicaped children in Cologne .
She was helping out there as a volunteer , and did not get any benefits from it ( except her personal experience of course ) .

Another example is that young men help out as a ` Zivi ' between their graduation from high school and studies at a University or other jobtraining , to avoid going to the army for one year .
The most common is for them to help out in hospitals or homes for older people .
And they do n't just do it to avoid the army .
Some of them , as my friend for example , stay longer at the institution .

There are far more examples of how students and other young people get involved in helping their community .
They do care , no matter what adults or older people might say and how bad the generation conflict might get .
It proves that the young people nowadays are not as careless as one might think .
