If you can explain from each topic a few things it is good ; you have knowledge .
However with your unfinished explanations you could confuse people even more .
Also in todays world there is a request in people who have specializations on one topic .
In todays society it is better to have specialized your knowledge on on specific subject .

Having a little bit of knowledge in many topis is not so effecient in todays society as if people are specialist on specific topics .
For example most people know something about computers .
When the computer is broken they may try to fix it with their limited knowledge .
This however may produce even more harm .
It would be better to bring it to a specialist on Computer who know what he or she is doing and fix it properly .

Another reason for beeing a specialist is when you try to find a job .
Most buisnesses looking for people with special abilities which are useful for their companies .
So if you have a lot of knowledge in a specific subject which they need you are more likely to get that job .

When you are a specialist you can use your knowledge to research on your specific topic and might find out something useful .
For example the Wright brothers knew a lot about flying .
With help pf their knowledge they managed to built a plane which actually flew .
And now look how far humanity got with the invention of the plane ; communitcation became so much easier .

Imagine what would happen if teachers would not specialize in a few subjects .
Students would properly never be able to learn in depth about the ideas represented in the `` Scarlet Letter '' .
Nor will they be able to learn how electricty works .
Teachers specilize on they subject so they can answer all the questions one might have .

It is very important to specialize you knowledge in one specific subject .
With your knowledge you will be able to help people with problems including your specified topic .
It is also easier to find a job since companies are looking out for peole with specializations .
The power of knowledge can also be used to improve the living standarts by researching on planes or deseases .
However you should never forget to know something about the other topics .
If you do n't you will isolate yourself from the rest of world because you do n't understand what is happening .
So be sure to kow a bit of everything and at the same time specialize in one specific subject .
