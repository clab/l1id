Many people think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide and many do n't .
Both types of travelling have their advantages and their disadvantages .

When you are travelling in a group , you have the advantage , that you do n't need to plan your trip exactly .
You can just follow the tour guide and let him think about which places you are going to visit .
Like this you can see many beautiful places , which you have n't known before .
The only problem you can have is , if you like to visit an other place , which the tour guide did n't plan before , you can not always do it , because you have to follow the guide 's instructions .

Also , when you travel with a guide , you can get information about places and buildings you are visiting very easily .
You do n't have to read in a book and look for the intresting information .
A tour guide can give you information very fast and knows the intresting details .
Travelling in a group , you can also meet new people , make friends and spend time together on your trip .
So , you are never travelling alone .

But when you travel without a guide , you can also have fun .
First you should organize your trip .
For some people this can already be very excited .
They buy books about places where they like to go .
They can choose by their own , which churches , which other buildings and tourist attractions they want to see .
And when they arrive there , they already know something about the place they are visiting .
When you are travelling by your own , you can also change your plans .
If you like a place you are visiting and you want to stay there for a longer time that you have planned , you can do that and you do n't need to follow the group you are travelling with .

I personally prefer to travel without a tour guide .
I like to plan my trip by my own and I do n't like to follow the whole time the guide and a group I possibly do n't like .
