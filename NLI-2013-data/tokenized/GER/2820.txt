It is a common prejudice that youth is a prerequisite for joy .
Even if this believe is usually not consciously articulated by the people holding it .
As a matter of fact , only the old can actually answer this question because they have been both - young and old .
From an analytical point of view I see no logical reason why youth should go along with happiness .

Obviously , most of the young people are still struggling to get what the elderly have already achieved : a good job , a house , a wife and so forth .
Therefore older people have a good reason for being more calm and patient .
This could enable them to see life from a relaxed point of view .
Doing this is surely of great help for anyone who wants to enjoy life .
On the other hand , in case an old person has not succeded in life , this might make him pessimistic .
Whereas for young people there is always a good chance that great changes take place in the future .
As they cannot rely on this feeling that everything might improve in the near future old people need to come to terms with what they have .
So in the end it boils down to the art of being content .
Any man or woman who masters this task ( regardless of their age ) is in my opinion able to truly enjoy life .
Old people have more time to practice and a bigger need to suceed .
That is way I think that they have an advantage in this context .
