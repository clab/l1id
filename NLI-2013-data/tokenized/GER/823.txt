I do not agree with the question .

The major reason that brought me to this conclusion is , that only specialisation makes perfect .
That means if you want to work in a certain field , you have to specialize .
Because you have to know as much as possible about this certain field , in order to work on a highly professional level .
For example , if you are a doctor , you should learn everything about medicine , the human body and how to treat sicknisses .
If you only know how to treat a cold and how to measure the blood pressure , you can not work on a high level .

To give another example ; If a programmer would not specialize , he or she will never find a job .
Because there is such a great variety of programming languages , that only specialisation will make it possible to work in a certain field .
There is no general programming !
A programmer has to choose one field to work in , maybe web-designe , than he or she has to studie a lot in order to get a good overview about this particular working field .

I think you can transfer this to every kind of academic subject .
Only specialisation makes perfect .

But it is also my opinion , that people should have a broad knowledge of many different subjects .
Not especially on academic level , but a good general knowledge is important as well .
