I think young people do n't give so much time for communities as ages ago , but they still give enough time to helping their communities .
Nowadays the communities have lost a lot of their importance .
Years ago , communities were much more important , because a person spent the whole or nearly the whole life in the same community .
Today , in a globalized world , one lives for some years in one community and for some years in another community .
People change much more their place of living and they are not so dependent on communities as in earlier ages .
For this reason people , especially young people , do n't identify themselves so much with one community and because of that they are also not interested in spending a lot of time for a community .
Another reason is , that young people do n't have so much time as in earlier ages .
Especially school and university became much harder .
Because of that , young people have to spend much more time studying and do n't have a lot of time for their communities .
Also at work , young people are more and more under pressure and have to work more .
They also have to improve their skills and therefore have to go to an evening school or something similar .

Nevertheless , it 's not the case that people do n't spend time to helping their communities .
In my opinion they do it in a more indirect way .
They support organisations as `` WWF '' or `` Amnesty International '' which do n't work in a particular community ; they work global .
But their work contributes to the whole world and also to the communities .
It 's important that somebody cares about the environement and happenings in the world , which in fact influences all of us , also the local communities .

Because of the above mentioned points I think that young people give enough time to their communities , even if it is in an indirect way .
