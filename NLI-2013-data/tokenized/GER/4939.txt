Nowadays there is a big competition between companies which launch a product in the same market because every company will have a big market share and a high number of selled products and a high net profit .
Because of this fact most of the corporations and other limited companies go to an advertising agency for producing advertising campaigns .
These were used , for example in the television or in newspapers to raise the turnover of companies which are selling these products .
But the question is : are the statements about the offered features from the products right ?
In my opinion advertising spots do not show the reality over the products .
So the products are not as good as they were shown in advertising spots .
For example the cars of mercedes-benz were published in tv as the most luxury and comfortable cars .
As one can see mercedes has big technical problems with their model E-Klasse .
Another point to mention is the fact that some products have other ingredients than in the advertisements published , for example products from the discounter Aldi .
Aldi offers his customers rice which was genetically manipulated .
But I believe that a company which wants to launch a new product on the market has to make it better through advertising than it really is because customers do not buy a new product if this product has the same features or ingredients than a product which has been sold since 10 years .
Additionally one can say that the advertising market is very big in the whole world .
So advertising agencies have to offer to the public very great advertising spots with the best products for beeing competitive in the advertising market , because the agencies will get a high return of investment in future .
But it could be a disadvantage of the fact that products are not as good as published that customers can be lost because the products the company offers are not as good as published in the advertisements .
So the customers are unsatisfied with the products and buy these products by a market follower or another company .

All these arguments leave me with just one conclusion namely that customers should buy products which they really need and not because of the fact that these products were published in the advertising spots .
