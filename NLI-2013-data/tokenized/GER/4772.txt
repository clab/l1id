Advertisement is made to sell a product to the masses not to point out insufficiencies .
I completely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The truth is very helpful most of the time but in the case of trying to sell a product one should not rely on telling the truth .
My point is not that lying should become common in advertisement , although it already might be in some cases , but there are more important things to look at when trying to convince a customer of bying ones product .
The human eyes are one of the most important sense to everyone and advertisement should use that to get their viewers ' attention .
Let us take a milk commercial on tv as an example .
If the commercial would just show me a cow in a huge milking facility squeezed between others and being connected to a milking machine , that would not make me want to buy milk at all .
The important thing is to attract the potential customer by stimulating their senses , for example with perfect images on the tv .
So , if i would then see a healthy looking cow on a green swiss alm being milked by a handsome young farmer ( or for the men , by a gorgeous young famer ) it would make me more convinced that this product is being produced in this way and therefore is much healthier and over all , it just makes me feel good about myself just looking at that postcard image .
Other examples of advertisements which show fitness products for example always give the image of heathy lean young people feeling good about themselves and having fun in their life because they are using the product which is being advertised .
This image of a perfect body , and the thinking , that this product might help me to achieve my goal and look like these people on tv , makes me more likely to by that product .
People don not want to see the truth in advertisements , especially on tv , they have that already every day .
They want to be guided , how to escape that dull life and achieve things , how to lose ten pounds , how to have the most fun with the newest computer , or how to reach their dream vacation destination .

In conclusion , advertisement is all about appealing to the senses .
Since only sight and hearing can be reached by advertisement , the industry also uses these features in their advertisements extensively to persuade somebody to by their product .
It is all about getting attention .
