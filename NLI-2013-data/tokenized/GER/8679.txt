I agree with the statement that it is more important to understand ideas that it is to learn pure facts .
I have several reasons supporting my opinion on this topic .

Firstly , today nearly all facts are available anywhere at anytime .
So the importance of learing facts is weakening .
Instead the time coul ; d be used more sensefull getting concepts .
For instance , it is possible for a history class student to get nearly all historical figures he needs in the internet .
There he can get them all day long , and with the help of mobile computing nearly everywhere .

Secondly , concepts are very important to learn , because you need them in order to create own ideas and concepts .
Facts do not help much with that .
For instance in my job as a controller I do not only have to know how some special figures , for instance the return on investment or the earnings of one year have to be calculated , but in order to improve our controlling instruments , I have to figure ot new figures .

To do this , I need to know how to create them .
I need to know which numbers would me of use to our management .
To create new figures it is also necessary to have a general idea of mathmetical concepts .
These can not be learned by heard , but have to be understood .
Once understood , I am able to apply these concepts to work on new ideas .

Thirdly , for high developped countries it is very important to be faster in developmet than for instance the fast developping countries in asia .
They are able to copy our industry products very fast after they have been developped by us .
Therefore we need to be faster in generating new products , new ideas and new technologies .

You do not learn to create those new technologies by learning facts .
It is only possible to learn creating them by learning concepts and ideas .
In my point it is really important to understand concepts and less important to learn pure facts .
This is because in future it will become more and more important to be creative and inventive .
In order to achieve this , it is highly appreciative to have well educated , creative employees .
