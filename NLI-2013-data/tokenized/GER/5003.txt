I deeply agree to the statement that advertisements make products seem better than they actually are .
In fact , I believe that many products would hardly be bought at all if people only knew the product itself and not the advertisement that goes along with it .
My opinion on this has been influenced by experience and by academic studies , and I would like to state several reasons for my answer .

First of all , the psychological mechanisms behind advertisments are rather obvious .
It is easy to see that a galopping horse and a handsome man have not much in common with the taste of a cigarette , but the positive feelings created by the descibed image do influence a persons feelings towards the advertised brand .
This can be explained psychologically and physiologically , and I am sure that studying Psychology has helped me understand the underlying principles better .
The advertisement industry is a huge and powerful one and the quality of an adverts thoroughly influences the selling numbers of a product .

In one lecture on the psychology of advertisements I heard about certain techniques that are employed by advertisers which have only deepened my opinion on advertisements .
An example of the fakeness of the presented product is the fact that the thickly streaming milk one can see in an advertisement for cornflakes is as tasteless as the flakes themselves : the milk is actually glue and the flakes are made of plastic .

I am convinced that most advertising companies employ similar techniques to make the products seem supernatural and generally better than they are .
It is unlikely that a company could still compete with others if they simply stated that their product was good .
It seems like a good idea to have certain regulations in advertising .
These do already exist and it seems almost necessary to protect consumers from being lured into purchasing a product that only seems attractive because of the idea sold along with it .

It makes sense that a producer wants his product to shine in the best light .
However , I think that the techniques being used in advertising these days go far beyond what one could call a realistic image of a product .
Therefore , I can only agree to the statement given .
