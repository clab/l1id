I mainly agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Firstly , I wolud like to mention that there are different types of students .
Each of them learns in a different way .
Therefore it is not surprinsing that there is also a group of students that only learns facts , without being interested in how and why scientist , historians or authors thougt about and invented facts and things we learn about nowerdays .
Some of the students admit that they are able to keep facts in mind but that they are not able to understand logical ideas and concepts that lead to these facts .

Secoundly , only learning facts or also understanding the ideas behind them depends a lot on the subject a student studies .
For instance logical thinking is necessary for a mathemathiks students but not for a history student .

From my point of view understanding the ideas and not only learning the facts is always important , no matter what the subject is .
Furthermore also in subjects that are mainly based on facts such as history or biology there might be questions about the reason for a certain development or the students might even be asked to tell their own opinion considering speculations about future developments in these field .

In this case the students who also know about ideas and concepst are much more likely to be able to give a good answer than students who simply learn the facts .

Another important point is that nowerdays students are very keen on getting to know the resons for certain facts as well as solving problems they eventually have to deal with in some tascs , especially in practical subjects such as chemistry and physics .

Moreover students who only learns the facts , learn them for a specific test and forget them afterwards .
But students who learns the facts and also the ideas and concepts often keep them in mind for year so the things they have learned may helf them also in far future .

In conclusion I must say that I consider the learning of not only facts but also ideas and concepts is the more effective way of learning and is therefore prefered by most of the students .
