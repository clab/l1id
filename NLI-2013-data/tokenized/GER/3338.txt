`` Why do n't you get more involved in church community activities ? ''
, my father used to ask me when I was younger .
In my oppinion there are a lot of factors that have to be taken in account , when analyzing the modern situation .
But the trend certainly shows , that young people spend less time for helping their community .

Modern improvements forced us to focus more on individuality than years before .
For instance , many television advertisments show successful stars , who want to show the importance of individual potential .
If you are a great actor or singer , why focusing on the community ?
This will sooner or later evolve to an attitude of egoistic .
Which means , I am the most important person in my life and this is what really matters .

Second , young people are less bound to their evironment and requirements for a successful life changed .
Today , you need to be able to adjust in a short time , for instance , to a new city or country .
Otherwise , employers might choose someone else for the job .
Furthermore , expactations of adults towards children changed , too .
School and marks are more important than anything .
As a matter of fact , students in Japan spend most of the time in school or at home , while preparing classes and learning from textbooks .
There is hardly any time left for the community .

Yet , the most striking factor is human lazyness .
For example , when you live in a big city , you do n't rely on your neighbours .
However , many people living in huge , crowded areas do not even know the people living next to them .
There is no reason for communication and as long there is a possibility , that people take advantage of your friendship without giving something in return , human nature tends to refuse interaction .
Supermarkets , cold stores and several other services enabled people to live independent from any community .
There is obviously no need for a community .

In conclusion , I agree with the statement .
Roughly speaking , young people avoid responsibility towards communities in recent decades .
Certainly , they should think about changing their minds in the future and realize the benefits .
