Over centuries , starting almost with the founding of the first universities , the ideal of a completely educated person was dominant on the European continent - somebody who masters ancient languages as good as he is at natural sciences or even the arts .
And on the other end of the line ?
There was the specialist , soley focused on his subject , almost an idiot in his single-mindedness .
But the times have changed .
With todays fast growing amount of scientific knowlege and the fast pace of research - new findings published almost every day - no one can know everything these days anymore .
So the specialist , who was laughed at only 150 years ago , seems now to be the ideal of an educated person .

However I think one should try to take the best parts of both educational ideals for oneself .
And my suggestion to make this possible , is not to try to gain broad and specific knowledge at the same time , but one after the other .

During primary and secondary school there is plenty of time to teach the students different subjects and viewpoints .
Even if it seems to be a waste of time because there wo n't be an opportunity to use the attained things later on , it will still widen the students mind and help him organizing things s/he learns later on .
For example , when I went to secondary school , I was taught Latin and Ancient Greek - which both do n't serve much purpose in todays world , but it helped me not only to study French and Spanish easily but also told me a lot about European history and mythology , what is quite important for job I do now .

On the other side , when somebody enters university or has already studied some years , it 's time to take a decision and choose a subject or a focus for his graduate time .
Because of the above mentioned imense amount of available knowledge , this focusing on one field is propably the only way to be really good at it .
( Which again is in my opinion the main party in doing something ) .

So my ideal is somebody who has a broad basis of knowledge , which makes him able to decide , based on the broad basis , in which subject he wants to specialise in later .
