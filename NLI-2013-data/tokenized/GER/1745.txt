In answer to the given question , I will first focus on the perspective of a prospective university student who is trying to decide on a field of study .
Should he rather follow his multifold interests or concentrate on one specific subject ?
In recent years , many new , multi-disciplinary majors have been created at German universities , such as `` Philosophy & Economics '' or `` Cultural Studies '' , which incorporates studies in ecnomics , politics , law , language and regional culture .
For a student faced with such a choice , I would always recommend to opt for one specific subject .
I believe that multi-disciplinary studies can only convey a superficial knowledge of the various fields they cover .
Within the spectrum of his studies that usually last three years ( for a Bachelor 's degree ) , the student will study so many different issues that he/she is never given enough room to fully penetrate any of them .
Especially for students who have not yet decided on a specific career , studying various academic subjects all at once will confuse them rather than focus their thoughts .
In contrast to this , a student who decides on one traditional field of study such as law or economics will at least have solid training in that specific field , which equips him/her for a pre-specified career .
The student can then either follow this career or make a conscious decision to choose another path , rather than just being confused by a variety of rudimentary knowledge and not having learned to prioritize .

To make my point clear , I believe that it is crucial to have a fundamental training in one specific academic subject .
However , this does not imply that your academic thinking should be restricted to that field only .
If the purpose of academic work is to find solutions to real-world problems , then it is absolutely necessary to incorporate different viewpoints into your reasoning because one discipline alone will never cover all aspects of an issue .
In this sense , I would say that it is important to be apt in one specific subject in order to make profound statements , but other academic subjects should never be entirely neglected .
