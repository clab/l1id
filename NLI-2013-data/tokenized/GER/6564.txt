Fewer cars in twenty years ?
Do you really think there will be fewer cars in a time of a raising economy ?
I do n't think so for 3 reasons .

Firstly , the world has 60 billion peoples and it wo n't stop raise .
The number of people all over the world will increase .
The economy will also increase .
My personal infer is that more people need more cars , and the graphs of the world population supporting my opinion .

Secondly , people have to be more flexible , it 's a major point in every job .
In todays jobs for example you have to travel from Berlin to Munich daily .
You do n't would like to fly because it 's to expensive , so you have to drive .
In my mind there is a big importance in beeing flexible , therefore you need to have a car .
If you do n't have one you could easily loose your job .
Do you like loose your job ?

Thirdly , the car manufacturer are aiming to sell more cars as they are doing right now .
That 's the goal of every entrepreneur .
They are doing everything to increase there cars .
They will design and manufacture new models .
Perhaps a new brand will start up .
They are reaching new potential customers in third world countrys .
So for example Lancia did , they produced very cheap cars for poor people .
All this leads into a increaing number of cars .

In conclusion , I say that it 's nearly impossible to decrease the amount of cars .
There is only one big problem , the oil ressources , but we have very good scholars to invent new alternative mobiles without the need of oil .
I am very excited how the future is going on .
