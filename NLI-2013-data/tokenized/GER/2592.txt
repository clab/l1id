If you read the statement for the first time , you probably would agree at once , but after some thinking I disagree with that statement .
Though reasons like `` young people are in good shape to do everything they want '' or `` young people do n't know any sorrows '' come to one 's mind immediately I do n't think these are the deciding facts concerning this question .

Moreover , I would say that older people have the great advantage to know real friends or even to have partner or a own family with whom they can share their luck .
When you are young , people come and go , but older people know better with whom they want to share their whole life .

Furthermore , older people found out their real passions and can spend their time on them .
As a child you maybe try to do a lot of different things , like playing soccer or tennis , but you do often quit them after a while , because you are not satisfied .
In opposite to the older generation , who got to know themselves better over the years and therefore can fill their spear-time with activities they really enjoy .

Above all , older people are more experienced than the younger are .
This is the deciding reason why I disagree with the quotation .
There are many beautiful things happening in the world that you do n't see as a young man or wowan , because you are busy with yourself or occupied with non-important issues .
A beautiful landscape , for example , means a lot to older people but younger people maybe do n't even take notice of that .
Everyone can see another example when you look into an ordinary parc in a city .
In general there are more older people hanging around and I think that fact shows that they know better how to fill their life with joy and fun .

The conclussion of that essay must n't be scary to anyone .
In the end it says that we are all winners .
The older generation , because they are probably enjoying the best time of their life but also the younger generation , because they can look forward to it .
