The quality of a people 's education and principles therein is measured in different ways .
Germany for example is still a country very much influenced by the ideal of humanistic teaching principles conveighed by and kept alive almost since ancient times , when scholarly education was a matter of academies and reknown schools of thought .
It seems that German non-universitarian education for High School students is still strictly modelled after this old idea .
Therefore High School schedules in Germany include - or rather cram in ?
- many subjects .
As soon as a student reaches university or college level he finds himself quickly forced into making his first own educational choices for which - due to the lack of previous experience - he might not be ready .
There seems to be a great disproportion in what is considered important knowledge , everyone should have access to and in the understanding of what a true academic really is .
When it comes to universities academics are people highly specialized in their subjects .
German universities praise their specialists .
Of course , the people displaying knowledge or even expertise in several subjects are often highly praized but they are rare and getting rarer by the generations of students .
So much focus is put on the early specialization of the mind that the broad and not necessarily deep level of knowlegde is completely underestimated , whereas exactly this level actually makes people accessible and grants them lightness and fluency of conversation with many different people of - again - many different - social , intellectual etc. - levels .
Unfortunately , education has become strongly influenced by trends of all kinds .
I am especially referring to the growing interest in economic studies rather than the humanities , including philosophy .

Myself having enjoyed substantial training in the classics - Latin , Greek and Hebrew - I only want to speak for the advancement of the broadly educated individual .
The earlier a specialization takes place the earlier a mind is locked-down and fixed .
In order to determine the best use and combination of one 's interests as well as capabilities one has to be as free as possible for as long as possible .
I fear that specialization drains the individual early of its creative energies and serves as a uniformer to knowledge in general .
