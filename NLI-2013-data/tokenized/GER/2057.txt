I do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do for various reasons .

First of all , many young people today are under so much pressure , that they often do not find time to just `` enjoy life '' but have to study or work hard to compete with many others their age to get a satisfactory job or a place at a good university which they want to attend .
Elderly people , on the contrary , especially if they are already retired , are much more free to enjoy their time .

As a psychological research has shown , people experience a shift in values during their lifetime .
While younger people are still very much keen on achieving material richness and tend to compare themselves much more with others , older people seem to put more emphasis on emotionally closely-knitt relationships and value material goods less than young persons do .
Hence , one could assume that elderly people do n't experience as much social pressure from society than youngsters .
The high rate of suicides among young people would also speak against the assumption , that young people in general enjoy life more than older people do .

However , I also do not believe that older people generally have a more joyous life than the younger generation .
They face different challenges : While young people might experience greater mental stress , older people most probably have to conquer more physical stress , often in the form of serious diseases .

As an open question in the end I would like to ask whether it is at all possible to determine the level of a person 's enjoyment from an outside perspective ! ?
