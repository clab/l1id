It is said often that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities , but I would disagree with that .
However , before laying out the arguments against this statement , it is essential to define what is meant by `` community '' .
Is community to be understood as the general society that we live or can it be understood as the specific community of an individual , meaning his or her family and friends , neighbors and people of the town or village that that individual lives in ?
If `` community '' were to be understood according to the first proposition , than I would still argue against the orginal statement .
True , traditional ways to serve one 's community have changed over time .
For example , the church in Germany has lost its importance for a lot of young people ; thus , there are not as many people involved in charitable activities organized by the church as it might have been the case 50 or 40 years ago .
However , these ( and similar ) chores are now being fulfilled by other societal organizations .
Non-governmental organizations such as Amnesty International or Greenpeace who are vital to discussions in and changes of societies depend especially on the participation of young people for they are generally more flexible and able to invest time - and young people do indeed make up a big part of their active members .

If we were to understand `` community '' to be a smaller group of people , than I would absolutley refute the original statement .
Recent surveys such as the German `` Shell Study '' have shown that young people value family and a safe and comforting community higher than they used to in the 1970s and 1980s .
Scientists believe that this development has its roots in the effect of globalization : people are required to be more flexible and to adapt to changing conditions while at the same time facing an increasing insecurity due to the job market which sees a high unemployment rate or at least very instable working conditions even among highly qualified young people .
And since traditional values have increased in young people 's favor , they are naturally more willing to help to sustain the structures that provide them a sense of belonging .
Thus , for example , they take care of older family members instead of having them live in a retirement home , they help neighbors repair their house , they organize groups at school that cook for the children instead of having them by fast food products , and they are engaged in local politcs or regional environmental initiatives .
to sum up , all these examples show that young people do care about their communities and and that they are not devoting less time than other younger people in earlier times to help their communities .
