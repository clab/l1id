I strongly agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because I have observed that nowadays everybody is occupied with her or himself .
For example last month I had a terrific accident and I was not able to attend my classes so I was depending on the helping hands of my classmates .
But although they recognized my absence knowbody was willing to help me with my homework .
That was an hardtime experience for me .
Thus , I have many friends I felt so alone .

Another good example is the behaving towards older people .
I sometimes sit in and overcrowed bus and an old woman is coming in but nobody besides me wants to stand up and offer the woman his or her seat .
That makes me sad .
Or helping old people with their housework would be a good possibility to pay attention to them but nobody has time to do this because of a full activity plan .

To my opinion every person should treat the other person like he himself wants to be treatend by someone else .
That means when you are observing that your neighbour needs help then do not hesitate to help him because next time probabily you will need his help .

The most important thing to me are the people who suround me for example my parents , frieds and neighbours .
And therefore I always try to keep my eyes open and help them when they are in need because I now know how it feels to be without help .
For me it is also clear that I would help oder older people in any occasion because when I am old I need the others help to .

To sum it all up I strongly believe that young people should change their attitudes towards other people by spending more attention to the needs of other people .
So that they will change from selfish young people to ones who pay attentin to their friends , neighbours and to all other people .
