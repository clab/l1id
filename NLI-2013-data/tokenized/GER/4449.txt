Most of us feel overwhelmed by advertisement every day .
We see it everywhere in town , even along the highways .
Many people do not like it because it seems penetrant and unhonest to them .
But is it really trying only to fool consumers ?

Advertisement is information , first of all , it informs us about a new product .
And it is a comfort and easy way to get to know what 's new on the market .
And no one can force anybody to buy the thing .

In many countries there are rules for companies - they are not allowed to advertize something by lying about it .
But it is evident that limits are not clear , when does suggestion end and lying start ?
If a perfume company engages a model to tell the consumers that she or he feels attractive and irresistable by using the perfume this might be true .
There is no guarantee that the consumer will feel the same but it is suggested .

Advertisment wants to attract people by promising them a great and wonderful product that will change their lives .
Rationally thought it is clear that not every new hamburger , perfume or shaver will change our lives .
But advertisement tries to attract the inconscient parts of the brain .
We often do not think about it rationally and long time .
Many companies promise the potential consumers to fulfil their deepest wishes - if they just buy the product they will be beautiful , intelligent and loved .

I think that most advertisements definitely make products seem better than they really are and I think that many or most of the suggestions made by advertisements cannot be fulfilled .
So it is necessary to handle advertisemant with a certain attention and prudency .
I also like being informed about new products but it is essential to think about its real use .
Of course companies try to influence people only because they want to make profit but on the other hand it 's the people 's decision to buy their product or not .
