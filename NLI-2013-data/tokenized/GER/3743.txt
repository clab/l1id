I disagree with this statement .
I think that young people nowadays have a lot more responsibilities and many more things to do besides school than they used to have twenty years ago .
Back then , pupils used to go come home , do their homework and then help their families doing housework , watching their little siblings or helping neighbours cutting the gras .

Nowadays , parents expect more from their children .
They want them to be successful in sports , playing an instrument , or spelling competitions .
So i think , it all depends on what the parens expect their children to do .
There are parents , who do n't make or let their children join activity groups besides school , and others who make their children take part in more activities and competitions than they want .

Thats why many young people do n't have the time to help their communities , even though some of them would like to do that .
There are many young people who are too buisy to help their communities , because they 're put under pressure to be magnificent at school , graduate from college and get their doctors degree as fast as possible , which did n't always use to be like that .
Only rich parents could afford to give their kids a higher education , make them play one or even more instruments and offer them activities besides school , because they had enough money , to hire people , who cleaned their house , cooked their meals and watched their kids .

In spite of that , poorer families could not afford that , so after the basic school education , young people had to work and support their communities as much as possible .
It 's all up to parents and the environment young people grow up in .
Some young people might still find enough time to help , after all the dancing classes , gu
