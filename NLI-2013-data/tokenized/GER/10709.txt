Success is usually the result of doing something in a new and sometimes extraordinary way .
Successful people like Bill Gates , Michael Jackson , or Donald Trump were successful because they did things in a totally new and unconventional way .
Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard and revolutionized the software and computer world when he invented his well-known Windows software .
Very successful people tend to do things in an unconventional and new way in order to create value for themselves and society .

These rather extreme examples of successful people are far above the usual definition of success .
Nevertheless , they demonstrate a certain way of dealing with ideas and visions .
Successful people have to take risk in order to become successful and make their ideas or dreams come true .
If a person only does what he or she has done his entire life in the same way over and over again , it is evident that this will not lead to outstanding success and recognition .
People are successful for doing things in a new way and , therefore , they are rewarded for what they achieve and not only for what they already know .
Of course , a person 's success is always combined with a lot of risk and luck .
When Bill Gates left Harvard in order to start his own business , he made a very risky decision .
What if his computer programmes would have failed ?
But successful people have to take on financial and personal risks to convince other people , to find investors for financing , and to prepare for long times of hard work .

In contrast to that , there are people who like things the way they are and appreciate what they have .
These people might call themselves successful and happy although people from the outside might disagree .
Therefore , it kind of depends on your personal opinion whether you call yourself successful or not .
The extreme examples mentioned above do not happen every day and involve a high amount of risk and a spirit of adventure .

In conclusion , I generally agree with the statement .
But the line between success and failure is very thin and it always depends on your point of view whether someone is successful or not .
