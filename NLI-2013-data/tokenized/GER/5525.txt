The goal of an advertisement is the increase of a product 's sale and the company 's profit .
It therefore seems a given that the item of sale is presented as positively as possible .
Not all prodcuts , however , can live up to the promises they make .

Bank loans , for example : very low interest rates and easy pay-back means give the impression of fast money without much hassle and very little responsibility for the customer .
Rather hidden are tricky issues such as securities or initial down payments , which have to be provided on a standard basis .
The focus of the adds does not disclose the actual costs of such loans .

Therefore , a viewer can easily be led to believe that lending money from the bank is quite inexpensive , whereas she or he may in fact be running up a huge amount of debt when all aspects of loan taking are considered .
In particular , the maths between income , basic living expenses and costs for a loan , are usually very revealing .

Another illusion that advertisement reinforces is that of looks .
Research regularly shows that particularly young women feel pressurized by the appearance of persons in ads .
A recent study found that even women who work in the advertisement industry and who know of the unhealthy lifestyle of most of the female models as well as the use of computer techniques such as photo-shop , believe that their bodies are not the way the should be .

One area where the claims of the ads and reality appear to be more balanced is medication : mandatory guidlines on dozage and recommended consultations with medical doctors seem to convey more caution than many of the `` easy does it '' and bubbly commercials for general products .

Finally , something also needs to be said about the consumers : while much of the responsibility for creating illusions obviously vests with the advertising industry , the consumers should also be held to a certain standard of scepticism and critical review .
