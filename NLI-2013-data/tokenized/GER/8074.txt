That is actually a topic which is dicussed by a lot of students I know year after year .
A lot of them argue that lerning facts have nothing to do with the intelligence of a person and are rarley needed in one 's future job .
To a certain degree I agree with their opinion because an engineer should understand that he is not allowed to use a weak material for the fondation of a house but that he rather has to choose a strong material one can build on .
That is nothing one have to learn but what is rather logical .

Others , on the conrary argue that some facts are necessarly to understand a certain idea .
My favourite example is that an engineer who finished his study will not be able to build a house or even a machine if he does not know which components exist to build or to construct them .
That is why engineers have a special subject in which they learn which range of components can be used to construct a machine or to build a house .

To be honnnest , I believe that there has to be something in between .
I know a lot of students who learn a lot and thus know many specific facts in their fields but they do not have a structure for their knowledge .
One could say : `` They cannot see the forest because of the trees . ''
They have problems to analyse a new situation because they are not openminded but caught by their thoughts .

On the other hand I know quite a few students who actually do not learn at all but they still can analyse a situation properly and give a good answer .
Nevertheless , they lose ground as soon as a dicussion becomes more detailed .

Finally , I have to say that I do not agree with that answer because I believe that understanding ideas is as important as lerning facts are .
To be more precisely , I believe that one have to learn facts in the beginning to understand a concept or an idea properly .
That is the way I used to learn during my study and that is what I would recommend to everyone .
