In my opinion it is right that not all but a lot of advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
It often happens that you see a product for example in a television ad or in a newspaper and that you are disappointed when you have finally bought it .
Sometimes the advertisement promises more than the product can fulfil .

Some years ago , in Germany for example there have been a lot of advertisement campains for cigarette-brands like `` Marlboro '' .
The advertisement agencies tried to create an image of coolness and an easy lifestyle by using cowboys smoking cigarettes as presentors of this image .

But everybody knows that smoking tobacco does n't help to get an easier lifestyle .
It causes diseases like cancer .
Therefore there are governmental restrictions that secure the customer from being betrayed by companies .
As a consequence television spots of the cigarette industry are forbidden in Europe .
It depends on the industry how much exaggeration of the quality of a product is possible .
In the car industry for example where a lot of competition exists it is almost impossible to lie about a product .
Selling cars has a lot to do with trust to the people who sell the cars .
When a customer feels betrayed he wo n't return to buy another car .

The fact to try to make sure that a product seems better than it really is is just natural .
You ca n't criticize advertisement agencies when they try to create a very positive image of the products of their customers because that 's just what they are supposed to do .
But sometimes it happens that some people just do n't understand the message of a advertising campaign because sometimes they are too creative and the advertising agencies are misunderstood by the customers .

But in my opinion this `` creative '' advertisement should only be allowed to the point when it does n't mean betraying or liing to a customer .
