I would n't agree with this statement .
Of course , it is very important to have a good overview over all academic subjects .
But after having achieved this one should decide on what is most interesting to oneself and specialize in this specific subject .

First of all , trying to stay broad in one 's knowledge means to preventing oneself in specializing in a specific area .
But without doing this , it is not possible to gain a deep understanding of any subject and there is the danger that one is just scratching the surface .

This is particularly important nowadays .
Each of the academic areas has grown extensively in knowledge and experience so that it is even impossible to get a full understanding of just a single area .
Furthermore , in order to produce new scientific results or new thoughts in an academic area it is important to have a good knowledge of the latest developments in this specific area .
This is can just be achieved by concentrating and working hard on one subject .

Moreover , I think that it is important to devolop interests , and maybe sometimes also disinterests , in certain areas during one 's academic education .
As far as I have experienced this , it is just possible to achieve great results in a subject when one is interested in the material and thus is able to develop enthusiasm for one 's one work .
Always forcing a person to deal with things that are not so important for he or she , the person will feel uncomfortable with his or her work .

So , specializing in a particular acamdemic area helps and supports the development of own interests and thus increases one one productivity .
