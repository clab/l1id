I disagree with this statement because i think to have a specialized qualification is better than a broad knowledge .

On the one hand ist good to have a broad knowlege of many academic subjects because you might find a job easier .
And with broad knowledge you may stay between two typs of an industrial branch .

But on the other hand threre are three arguments to spesify in a subject .
At first there is the point that when you have only one subject you are better in this like anonther person who knows only a bit of this part and so from the view of a company you are more interesting to them like the other .

The second argument is that when you might loose your job you will easier find a job in this subject like the person who knows only half of the subject .
Fir instance when you go to a company to apply for a job and you have a higher knowledge if the boss of the personal management asks you some questions about the subject you will have a better chance to get the job .

Last but not least when you are rearly good in your subject you will have the opportunity to get a leading position in a company an give instructions to those who only have a bit of this knowlege than you .
And as a result of this you might earn more money because you are a specialist in your job .

As a conclusion of these statements i will take the way of specialization in a specific subject because i want to have these three typs which i wrote above and not only beeing a normal employee with a boss .
I want to be the boss .
