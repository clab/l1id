In terms of limited availabilty concerning natural resources , which is a common topic nowadays , this is quite an interesting question .

In the following I will proceed by depicting several arguements and ideas , either supporting or speaking against this statement .

As already mentioned shortly above , resources which are necessary for a car , such as gasoline , do only exist on to a certain time in the future .
Some specialists state that oil will be sufficient for at least another 50 years , others calculated only 15 years .
With our todays technology , hardly any car will drive once these resources have been wasted .
Therefor , the number of cars may have declined significantly in 20 years .

A further point supporting the statement is the fact of growing environmental pollution .
In order to save our planet , people will have to reduce emissions , for instance by driving around in car less often .
Instead people could rely on public transport .

On the other hand , there is a remarkable trend towards a growing number of cars in the world .
Nations like China or India for example still have only a very low percentage of car owners among their inhabitants .
While economy and prosperity in these countries are growing rapidly , the number of cars is growing even faster .
And this trend is not going to weaken within the next years .

Besides , new technologies are developed permanently .
One common example in terms of the automobile market is the solar energy .
Already today , solar energy is used in car technology and presumeably it is only a question of time when these new generation of vehicales is available on the market .

From my point of view , there is another very important fact one should consider .
Over the last 100 years , since Henry Ford started to produce cars in huge quantities , the car has become a normal thing to own for people in the industrialized countries , representing a certain comfort and as well a status of social recognition .
Obviously people will be unwilling to up things like cars just in order to safe our resources or environment !

Altough resources are limite and a growing number of cars will mostlikely not be a support in order to save the nature , I am absolutely convinced that the number of cars will increase within the next 20 years .

Peolpe will always find a way to stay mobile , mostly through new technoligies .
