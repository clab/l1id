The utmost intention of school lessons is to provide the pupil with the sufficient understanding and knowledge that they can make their way in the sometimes rough and high demanding world .
This suggests that pepole learn to get along with problems coming up and they should thereby retain the things they learned during school time .
As the issues in your life differ quite much from those examples which an average pupil learns at school , I highly agree with the statement that it is more important to learn concepts and ideas rather than to retain simple facts .
I will highline my reasons to believe this in the following passages .

First off , as I already mentioned above it is highly likely to face a situation it which you are demanded to apply your knowledge on different topics .
Therefore the understanding of ideas and underlying schemes is crucial .
As an simple example there are signs and rules you ought to have learned during acquiring the drivers licence .
Other countries obey different traffic rules but maybe use the same signs .
So you are able to adjust to the new challenges and go along with the traffic ideas .

Secondly , understanding ideas broadens your mind and challenges it simultanouesly .
You are much more likely to see connecting and corresponding points in an interdisciplinar matter and thus you are able to gain quicker insight into new fields or topics .
This can elevate your understanding of miscellainious issues .

At third , understanding ideas and concepts may constitute the basis and platform for vital discussions among students .
If you have gained the crucial point of what a topic is all about you are able to exchange thoughts and can thereby help others to apprehend the problem or even take benefit for yourself by reconsidering your own opinion .

Overall I am a strong believer in the didactic target to catch the ideas rather than to retain pure facts .
By shaping the peoples mind this method is much more effective to prepare students to find their way in the challenging world .
It may be that due to this assumption this concept is the underlying structure and principle of all sophisticated schools .
