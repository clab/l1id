Most advertisments really let products seem much better , than they really are .
Advertisment is one way to win new custumers .
In order to fullfill this task you have to convince the custumor with arguments , but are there any good arguments for a chocolate bar ?
Most times buying vegetables would be the better choice .

So advertisment uses the art of persuasion to win a custumor 's heart .
Therefore you can not only present the good sites of a product , for example how great a chocolate bar delivers your daily needs of calories , or leave some fact out like the risk of cancer related to smoking a cigarette .
Often you have to add something to a product , which does not really exists .

You may add a health factor to sugar coated cornflakes , because there some vitamins in them or give a product a social touch by supporting projects in the third world like Evian Water tried by their last campaign .

But the most effective way to let a pruduct seem better is to make it absolutly necassary for the customer 's happieness .
if the customers does not purchase it he never gets happy .
The product has to complete his life .
For this you have to wake new needs with advertisment .
The need to be cool is one of it , it is just the simple need to divers from others and only the new product helps to reach this aim .
The best example for this is a new cell-phone .
It provides a lot of new functions , but if everybody else owns one too , it fastly becomes boring .
The ability to differ from the mass is only possible with a new one .
This is the time when advertisment triggers .

It presents not only the usual features of our new mobile phone it also shows how `` cool '' the new product can be .
Another typical example for this way of creating new whishes is perfume advertisment .
They try to tell , that the human wish of beeing accepted or having sex is only reachable with buying this kind of perfume .
If really helps to attract a new partner is quite unsecure. a lot of other factors are also involved In the advertisment the perfume gets more abilities than it really has .

So the product seem better than it really is
