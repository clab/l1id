In my opinion , success is mainly the result of realized chances and opportunities .
As a consequence , I agree with the issued statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

I do acknowledge that there may be situations in which it may prove better to stick to what you are used to do .
In the course of a sports examination , for example , it may not be too wise to try an entirely new way of jumping across a hurdle .

However , even in a situation like this the basic fact remains valid that without taking some risk you may miss your chances .
In my example this means that this one different jump might just have been the one your teacher wanted to see .

Apart from that , I believe that you ca n't make any progress if you stay persistently at the same level .
And always doing what you know how to well already does n't mean anything else but precisely this remaining static and without progress .
In order to be successful , it is , in my opinion , essential that you make some progress .
For usually success is connected with some achievement .
This is just another reason why I agree with the issued statement .

However , the most important reason , why I affirm this statement , is that chances may appear suddenly .
And as I have explained prior to this , I consider taking and realizing your chances to be of fundamental importance for success .
If you always pondered about whether to seize an opprtunity or not , it would probably be gone before you came to a decision .
It is often impossible to realize your chances with an absolute certainty that everything will turn out all right .
Consequently , there always is a risk in realizing them .
And if you are not willing to take this risk and instead stick to what you know to do well already , you may very likely miss a chance to be successful .
