Who does n't know advertisements for for sporting articles , like NIKE or Adidas or for cars , like the new Mercedes or simply for foods , like milk ?
In these advertisements the products are looking always good or are n't they ?

So the question what I want to discuss now is , if the advertisements make products seem much better , than they really are .

On the one hand I think that the products that are advertised are very , very bad , because it is often shown only the whole article and in most of the cases never the details .
You only have to look at the case of food , because there are often pesticides found , when this food gets tested in labors .
I think everybody can remember the chocolate chaos at the big supermarket Hofer in Austria .

Also the advertisement of cars looks always superb , but in reality there are so many failures , as I have seen on the car of my father .
With this car we always had problems , because the electric was not well working .

As a result of these failures there will also be danger for humans be affected , from the bad technic , as well as from the underaverage bad food .

But on the other hand I think , that the products , which are shown in an advertisement are really as good as they seem , because behind this products it is very often a lot of innovation .
Who does n't know the NIKE Air System in shoes ?
It was a simple development in the past , but today still works , because the people know , that this is as good as in the advertisement .

Moreover I think , that products , which have been tested for long terms by the companies , will increase more and more on quality and finally it is possible to itentify this product with the advertisement .

As a conclusion I would say , that neot everybody should look only at the advertisements .
