Young people today do not think of others as much as they perhaps should , which has many different reasons , including biological , social , and historical reasons .
The time period we are currently living in is a capitalistic era , and people in general , young or old , seek their own benifits in situation .
Children are being brought up to think with a capitalistic mind .
It is important for parents that their children have a succesfull life .
The definition of a such a life at the moment seems to be , wealth and prestige .
These goals consume extreme amounts of time .
This means that young adults are being brought up to think of themselves first , because they are being told a fullfilled life is having material goods .
In consequence , these young people cannot find the time in helping the community .

At a young age , especially in the so-called `` teens , '' young people have alot of things on their mind , taking away any focus on aiding the community .
During these years of transition between childhood and adultry hormones are swirling through the bodies of these people .
they seek new things and try to explore what they do not know .
there is also often a sence of loss during this period of time .
these adolesensce try to find a reason to their existence , resulting in a search for identity .
this proccess can be very overwhellming and often end negativly if not spend enough time on .
This has often been the topic of literature .
one example of this would be the novel `` Catcher in the Rye '' by Salinger .
In that novel it enphasises the importance of teenagers to work on themselves and develope , to ensure a safe ending to their teenage years .
Helping the communities takes up time and energy , which few adolesensce can spare in this time of progression and search .

The young people of today are a countermovement to the movement of their parents .
Every movement is followed by a countermovement .
This can already be seen far back in history .
and example would be the romanticiscm , which saw emotions and fantasy more important than logic and rational thinking .
This was a countermovement to the period of enlightment which cherrished exactly that , what the romantic period dismaid , logic , and rational thinking .
The young peple of today are going into the opposit directions their parents had gone .
Many of these parents were so-called `` hippies , '' which stood for love , piece , freedome , and helping eachother .
If one would take the opposits of the traits in that movement , it would make the young people of today ; self-centered , ignorant , and often aggressive .
This is very much what many young people of today are like .
This way of thinking also excludes the mere thought about helping the communitie .

Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It is not solemly their fault , for they are a product of society and their natural instincs in specific time periods of their life .
