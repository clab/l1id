I mainly agree with the statement .
Advertisements are presented in such a professional way that they are able to make costumers believe they need excactly the product which is shown .

Advertisement is made to show you everything the product can do or how it changes your daily life in a very positive manner .
There is never shown a negative aspect .
The key is , that advertisement is mostly placed at television in the late evening when the people are watching a show or a film and do not want to think about what they look at .
So they do not think about all the negative aspects the product may have , they listen to the music , which is of course perfectly chosen , they see images of great landscapes or happy families so that they are in a very positive mood .
And that is just what the company wants their consumers to be in , a positive mood , where you are more likely to buy products of every kind , even if you do not need them at all .

Furthermore , they are tested with a small audience before they are released so that the company who invented the advertisement can change some kind of it if the test audience critizes it a lot , so there is an improved kind of quality controll .

Another aspect is , that the firm who produces the food or whatever has to be advertised , does not create the advertisement itself in most cases .
They engage a company which is a speciallist in advertisements and so they know everything about what their consumers want to see .

At the end it is important that the statemant includes not every advertisement ever made .
There are big exceptions from that rule , for example when you see a saucege crashing into a wall it does not animate me to buy a safe car .
And you must allways remember that they only create an illusion , when you buy the product just because of its advertisement without comparing it depending on real facts with other products , you will not have much fun with your new product .

In conclusion , I have to admit that advertisements are influencing everybody 's shopping behaviour a lot because they are able to present the product in a nearly perfect way .
