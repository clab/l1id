It frequently happens to me that I buy a product I have seen on an advertisement .
But in the end , it does not meet my expectations .
I completely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I believe this way because there exist several reasons explaining why products are not as good as their advertisements .
By looking at the profit the advertising company makes , the competition between numerous companies as well as the way the product is presented it seems understandable for me that products are not as good as one thinks .

Firstly , the product on the advertisement shall appeal to the customer .
The company providing the product pursues the goal to make profit .
It can only reach a high amount of money if sufficient people purchase the product .
Therefore , the company has to make the product seem as best as possible .

Secondly , one also has to take into consideration that the company always competes with other companies , especially if the product is not a unique one .
If the product should be sold successfully , the company has to present it in a convincing way .
Although the product is not as good as other products , it nevertheless should not show its weaknesses but its strenghts .
The purpose of advertising is to persuade the customer that this is the only right and best product .
Therefore , the company usually has to make the product better than it actually is .
Additionally , the company does not pay any attention to the customer 's expectations .
It only pretends to want to meet the them , but it is not necessarily significant for the company .

Thirdly , the company wants to appeal to a wide range of people in order to influence their decision to buy the company 's product positively .
As a result , the company is forced to present its product in a general way .
It cannot reveal specific features because the company does not know if this appeals to each customer .
In consequence , the company presents its product better as it really is in order to make money with it .

In conclusion , all these aspects prove why products are not as good as the advertisements pretend to be .
The main purpose for advertisement is to make profit out of the product .
Therefore , the product has to seem wonderful , although it is not .
