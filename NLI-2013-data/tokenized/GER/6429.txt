I disagree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than there are today .
At first question I mention about if I am reading statement : what is the definiton of a car in twenty years ?
Are we talking about cars like today ?
With a gas enginge or are we talking about a vehicle with alternative enginges ?
If so , for me this vehicles are not cars .
They are another kind of transporation machine and can not be summarized under the topic cars .

So , it might be possible to say there are less cars in twenty years , but only because of a statistic trick .
Another reason why I disagree with the statement is the fact , that most people in this world nowadays still have no car .
Of course the most people in the western world got are car but what about all the people in asia and africa ?
Only in one of this areas live more people then in the western world togehter , e.g. India .

Also the industrial revolution already started in those countries and it is only a matter of time when they will get the same life standard than the people in the western world .
Life standard in the western world means to be an owner of at least one car .
Today it is possible to see the statistic fact that one cititzien , e.g. in Germany , often owns more then at least two cars .
So if only the people in India at least will own only one car the statement false .

The last reason why I disagree with the statement is that the industrie needs cars to move their goods between there production areas .
Therefore it does not matter if we are talking about a company that produce heavy products or just produce services .
To connect the people with the products of the company it is necessary to use a car .
The employee must be able to meet his customer and the customer needs the possibility to get to the company for e.g. to buy something or to ask for services .
