With this essay I will be discussing the question , whether young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This question is certainly of material importance to our society .
Only with voluntary help certain areas of communities can still function and exist these days .
Let us discuss for instance the sporting area .
I have been the president of our local football-club for quite some time .
I made my way up coming from a member , becoming treasurer and finally the president .
Of course , this function is absolutely voluntarily and I have no monies or even thanks for that .
I did this because I have the strong believe that adults have the responsibility to guide younger generations .
By guidance I do not necessarily mean the education of the youth .
This is best done by their own parents .
No , by responsibility of guidance I mean that youth need to have alternative play grounds for their leisure-time .
Unfortunately , many young boys and girls finishing schools do not have the immediate opportunity to be recruited by firms .
They are looking around and try to find a suitable job or start an apprenticeship .
These days , where millions of employees look for job , especially youngsters with less experience find it difficult to find a job .
The risk here is , if you do not offer possibilities for their leisure-time , they might go wrong paths .
By that I mean misuse of drugs or alcohol for instance , but also crime .
Coming back to my football-club .
The age of the footballers ranged 16 to typically 25 years .
A very critical range of age , we have to observe .
We found it difficult by time to keep the youth interested in sport .
But it was possible with certain motivating factors such as praise and special organised events or even incentives , like new football-shoes .
However , when it came to organise events outside football like concerts or christmas parties we found it even more difficult to find volunteering youngsters .
Even the most finetuned tactics did not help to convince them that they have to help in organizing and helping at the event in order to get some cash money into the clubs account .
Anyway , generally spoken yes , youth does not give enough time to help their community .
On the other hand one has to consider that the interests are changing with the age .
One day they will be in the reign of a football-club and experience these things themselves .
Untill then it is up to us elderly experienced people to get the right direction for the youth .
Agree ?
