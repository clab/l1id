I personly believe , that in the modern world it is essential to have specific knowledge .
Life in the modern world ins influenced by computers , machinery and complex problems therefore it needs well educated people to solve those problems .
For example , nobody is going to ask his personal doctor which he sees when he has a flue if he can also do a heart surgery or transplant organs .
The same applays to a lawyer .
Today the field of law is so complex that it is not possible for one person to have an overlook over all existing statuts or decisions .
A lawyer practising in family law typically does not understand the functioning of a company .
Therefore if you operate a company or you are planning to do a merger you are trying to find the best possible lawyer available .
You need an expert who knows what he is doing and is making sure that you are not in the risk of liablity .
You need a lawyer who specified in corporate law , who is an expert in M & A , somebody who knows the court decisions and all statues possibly beeing effected by the merger .
Somebody who does not put his whole afford in that one thing ( area of practice ) will not be able to compete with other lawyers in the field and most important , he will not be able to get the best possible solution possible .

Of course it is very important that people do have a wide knowledge and that includes for example knowledge of literature and music but that does not mean that he should not be an expert in something .
I believe that everybody should take differend classes in college but he should focus on one area .
It is essential to know how a computer is operating but you will not call a lawyer or doctor to fix your problems with Microsoft .
Since problems will become more specific at the one hand and more people are unemployed on the other side it is neccesary that people specialice in on field , so that they will have a chance on the job market .
Not like a century ago people today do not have to be a farmer , construction worker and fisherman at the same time .
As stated above I believe that the complex world makes it even more important that people specialize in a specific subject .
