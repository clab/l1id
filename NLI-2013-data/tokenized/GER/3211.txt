I would agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities nowadays .
This is a result of the ongoing process of enstranging .
People do not want to know their fellow people anymore .
Today no one knows who his neighbour is .
This is mainly a result of the increasing independence people enjoyed during the last decades .
So why should younger people be different when the society has taught them to be this way .
Young people are also not that political engaged like previous generations .
One reason might be the huge amount of additional leisure offers you can choose from .
You are mobile , so you can get to a disco or cafe at the evening .
Young people play at their PC or Playstation .
And that is more fun than getting involved in a party .
But younger peoples are also tired of politics nowadays .
They do not see politicians as role models that encourage them to take the same career .
Politicians are boring , they are said to lie all the time and they serve not the interest of teenagers but of adults .
What is natural as most young people are not allowed to vote and so they are not interesting for politicians .
Furthermore young people are very reluctant to work volunteerely for charity organizations .
I do not think that it is because young people do not care about these issues anymore but they are to busy to earn money with holiday jobs or similar activities to afford the things they always wanted to buy .
That is why we live in a society that is dedicated to consume all the time .
Even little kids are seduced via commercials in TV or radio to buy the products they actually do not need .
For young people it is more important to have all the new stuff their friends have and that is why they do not have time to get involved in a charity organization .
