In my point of view the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts is right to a certain extend .
The purpose of education in my eyes is not only to teach scientific facts to students , but also to convey the concepts of the political systems and set of values of your society .

In order to do so it is important that the students develop the ability to understand different ideas and concepts and get to know how to critically deal with ideas .
This will help the students to understand why it is important fot them to study hard and gain more knowlege in certain areas .
By understanding the purpose of their education , students feel that school it is not something which is imposed on them , but will help them to deal with educational challenges in their future life .

However , the base for different ideas and concepts are usually facts .
In order to understand ideas and concepts it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of facts .
Without these facts , students can not understand where these ideas come from or how they have been developed in the first place .

However , teaching only facts can not be the aim of an education .
If you teach students only facts there is a high probability that they will feel bored .
It might be difficult for them to understand the reason why knowing these facts can be important for them and how these facts might help them in their future lifes .

To summarize this I think there should be a balance between teaching facts and teaching ideas and concepts to students .
They are both necessary to complete a good education , but I think conveying ideas and concepts should have the priority in a teaching concept .
