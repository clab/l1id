To my mind it is not correct to say that one had to take every risk to be successful .
Maybe it is easier to become famous with a revolutionally idea and a change or even break of common rules but I think it will also work with traditionally methods if you are qualified enough .
The phrase `` nothing ventured , nothing gained '' might be correct in some situations of life but I think if you make up relevant and important desicions too quick and without thinking carefully about it you can easily stap in a trap .

Of course you should not be stubburn and close your mind against every new technology or invention .
To be open-minded is one of the most important characteristic in time of globalization .
But I think that it is even more important not to forget our roots and listen to old people with their long year experiences and the wisdom they get through it .

I will present an example out of equesterian sports .
During the last twenty years a mass of new , different , alternative and better methodes become popular through the mass media .
But if you see the work of a traditional trainer you often observe better success in the end .
If someone tries everything new , he/she can not focuss on one method once .
And the horse you work with will be irritated .
So try out everything and take every risk is the wrong way here .

If you risk everything you also can loose everything and if you built up your life on solid , traditional bottom without taking every risk you do not reach everything but you also did not loose what you already have .

As a conclusion I say that sometimes it is better to do what you already know and do this perfect than always focussing on new thinks and take the risks .
