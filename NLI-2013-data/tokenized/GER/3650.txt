In my opinion , young people already do spend enough time helping their communities .

There are at least two kinds of communities they currently can be involved in , one is the parental community , consisting of the family members and the closer friends of the family , sometimes up to the whole village some people live in .
The other community is the one where the family usually is not involved in , this can be the colleagues from work , but also communities found on the internet or by creating or simply appraising works of art .

Some young people nowadays tend to spend more time in the latter , thus leaving the first community behind with a kind of ungrateful feeling .
This feeling is a remnant of former days , where people where forced to live together in order to survive and support themselves .

Nowadays these tasks that used to be distributed among all generations in a family can be transferred to public organs or private institutions .
This relieves other parts of the family off their burden , giving them more time to do and produce what they really like .

Even more , our modern societies practically force people to leave home .
People are required to be able to travel for work , or to move to different cities in order to obtain a proper education .

The possibility and the need to leave the community in which people grew up in of course weakens this link back home .

These young people pay back their former duties to their families or communities by different means .
Some of them are taxes , which in turn - at least in most of the European countries - are put back into community projects , or specific dwellings for retired people .
Another , equally important way , is to pay back their duties by creating works of art which can support the whole society .

I think by giving the people a choice of what to do with their time is having the biggest impact on the societies , and also communities .
The communities profit indirectly from this freedom .
I think the impact is a good one , the people who are criticizing this simply have to accomodate to the fact that the ways of feedback are changing .
