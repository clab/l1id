I think their are advantages and disadvantages of both - broad and specialized knowledge of an academic subject .
I am studying `` European Studies '' which is a really broad field , students joining academic courses of the history , socialogy , economy as well as politics department .
It includes a lot of devotion to stay informed in all of the subjects .
Therefore , I experience advantages and disadvantages of interdisciplinary studies everytime discussing with specialized students .
It is e.g. true that `` interdisciplinary '' students have a broader view of the world and its various developments , however , when it comes to theoretical background , we cannot compete no more with the `` specialists '' .

Economy and society are both demanding people who are able and willing to learn throughout their whole life in various fields .
The `` new '' employee should be trained in a lot of subjects being able on the one hand to find new solutions to problems and connections due to his multi-facetted education and on the other hand to adopt to new circumstances quickly .
I would therefore argue that it is more favourable studying many subjects for entering `` real life '' business .
However , one should always be aware that one has to concentrate on one major in order to have a reference point of one 's academic and professinal outline .
This core subject should be the starting point of one 's ideas and itentions giving rise through the surrounding subjects to innovative ideas .

However , if one wants to enter an academic carreer it is favourable to have a specific knowledge of only a few subjects in order to find and teach new insights necessary for the acedemic development of each subject .

In conclusion I argue for a break-up of the dichotomy of broad and specialiyed teaching .
Of course , students should take a decision at the beginning of their studies , but even if they chose to become specialists they should get some broader education to apply there skills in various fields .
Apart form this I would advice students of a interdisciplinary course to dicide for a kind of major to concentrate their efforts .

Both are needed and their interactions have fruitful outcomes .
