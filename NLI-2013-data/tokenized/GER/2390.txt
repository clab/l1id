In order to gain an opinion on the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , I would have to first observe typical activities of both age groups .
I would then have to come up with a system to measure enjoyment .
The latter I am not capable of incorporating in such a short format , so that I am going to analize typical activities and - where appropriate - associate a value with them .

What do young people like to do ?
They travel , they like to consume fashion and music , they study and they do sports - and very often all at the same time .
They certainly have the physical abilities to do so .
Not quite as often do they have the funding .
If indeed they do n't , they like to spend big portions of their time in front of the television or computer , watching shows , surfing the internet or playing video games .
Often , these media represent a world , that these people would enjoy even more than their own lives .

If young people do not do , what they `` like '' to do , they are usually too busy to enjoy life .
Older people are not busy .
They have time and money to travel , enjoy culture , and do sports .
But all of that they can only do , if they are still healthy and active enough .
Otherwise they like to fall into patterns similar to the ones described do .
Often , these patterns involve TV or crossword-puzzles .

By sarcastically creating prototypes of young and older people , I am expressing an opinion that is beyond agreement or disagreement with the opening statement .
None of the groups enjoys life more than the other .
It all depends on the individuals and what they make out of their living situation .
