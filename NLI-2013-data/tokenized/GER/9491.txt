Historically , students have been thought given facs and definitions .
But recent developments show , that a new form of education , namely teaching the principle guidelines , the basis of complex structures is more useful for students in order to understand a certain problem .

That raises the question whether or not the old form is still appropriate ?

First of all , I would like to point out that I 'm a student of a university that strongly encourages the students to think for themselves .
Therefore it is very essential to understansd the basic structure and the idea behind a problem .
Simply learning facts is not only boring but also very likely to be forgetten soon .

For example , it is possible to learn chemical reactions simply by heart but is also possible to learn why elements react in a specific way and how they do .
Not only that it is easier to learn one concept instead of a whole set of formulas but it also makes you able to understand how the elements behave under different circumstitions .

That simple chemical example is applicable to a whole range of problems .

Moreover it is essential for a later job , to have completely understood the principals of certain structures .
With a broad basis of concepts , you are able to solve problems more independently and to anticipate possible future problems .
It is no use for anyone being able to respond to a certain problem with facts that have been learned , but not having understood what stands behind them .

Finally , i 'm personally convinced that lerning too much facts is a waste of time and a barrier when you try to communicate with specific people over a complex topic .

To conclude , it should actively be encouraged to learn the essential sructures and to build ones own opinion , rather than learning fact
