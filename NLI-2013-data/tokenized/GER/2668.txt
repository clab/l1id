If people are asked , in an survey for example , who enjoys life more , younger or older people , one is likely to answer spontaneously in favour for the younger ones .
This tendency might have its roots in the wide-spread oberservation which can be made in the today 's society .

But is this assumption right ?
Do younger people really enjoy life more than the older generation does ?
It is true there are a lot of offers especially for younger people to create their free time .
There are clubs and bars in every city where an older person would not really fit in .
Besides there are also a lot of new sports activities which are especially developed and introduced for the generation under 50 .
You can hardly imagine a senior standing on waterskis or making a bungee jump , can you ?

But can therefore be concluded that the younger people enjoy their life more ?
Personally I do not think so .
There is also a great number of leisure offers for older people that are really not less amusing at all than these for the younger ones .
For example you can find dancing events for seniors nearly everywhere .
As the health system has improved extremely the last decades the older people are more healthy and fit than in former times .
Thus they are able to exercise a lot of sport despite their age .
And they really do .
The number of older members in sports clubs or gyms has increased enormously .

Older people also have other great advantages compared to the younger ones .
Normally they have more money and more time .
Most of them earned money during their lifetime which they now want to spend for their fun .
Young people , on the opposite , often still study or earn not really a lot of money at the beginning of their job .
That 's the reason why they often cannot benefit from the rich offers .

Furthermore a lot of older people have already retired and now enjoy their new freedom and `` endless '' time .
Finally I think the mentality of older people has changed .
They are not longer thinking that only hard work can make them happy .
They also want to enjoy the `` evening '' of their life .

As a conclusion I want to point out that in my opinion older people enjoy their life toexactly the same extent as younger ones do .
