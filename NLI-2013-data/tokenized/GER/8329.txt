I agree to the statement that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
But it 's also important to know facts .
Bacause every idea and concept still requires basic facts which are necessary to really understand them .
You have to decline two kind of facts : facts which are basic knwoledge and facts which are only important if you want to handle it deeply .

Many of today 's students learn facts , but they do n't really understand it .
And so it is better for students and for life preparation to understand ideas and concepts than only to know facts .

For example : if you know how something work you must not know why it works .
Many students learn strictly all details of an idea but they do n't realize the whole .

In many subjects you have to learn by hard to get all details , but it is better to understand the concept which allows students to study , recognizing and solving problems which are still different but mainly the same basic .

But students should know and learn facts , too .
Because in todaz 's life every problem must be analized and its solution must founded on especially facts .
To solve a problem without detailed facts is very unprofessional kind of working .
Other persons with ground knwoledge should be able to find failures in your documentation .

Learning must consist out of both : founded knowledge compared with ideas and concepts .
Ideas and concepts may include facts which are neccesary to understand them .
Many students know and learn only as much as needed to pass an exam or anzthing else .
This might be good for the moment but you ca n't pass life very well .
A reason for this could be also a problem of teaching skills .

All in all it must be important for every student to reach a founded education with both : detail knowledge and basic ideas .
