The statement , that advertisments tend to be too euphoric regarding the products value or effectivness , is an ofter heard observation from people consuming todays massmedia .
The reason for a company to spend money on an advertisment is to make the product known to the public and to compete with their competitors on the market .
If the advertisment is made for a new and innovative product , it is more likely a realistic view of the products abilities , than it is in case the product has to compete in a dense market of similar products .
In the later case the consumer is alredy affected by the advertisments of other companys or even own experiences and therefore less likely convinced by a new product .
Depending on the market situation the product is facing , the advertisment has to be choosen by the advertiser .
The statement , I am referring to , should be made more specific , as a general view on advertisments is not possible in my oppinion .

Another reason why advertisments can seem to be much to confident in a products value but actually are not , is the setting or story told in the advertisment .
A vacuumcleaner in front of a beautiful landscape is somthing different from the same vacuumcleaner in a wardrobe .
The product is the same only the viewers connection to the advertised product varies .
Sometimes it is the consumers imagination that lends him to the conclusion that advertisments are promoting a unrealistic picture of a product and not the advertisment itself .

In the case of products intended to be used by a very young usergroup ( kids or teens ) the advertisments are more likly to present a better picture of the advertised product that reality would allow them to .
The young consumers are more easily affected by such campaigns than older consumers , who tend to be more carefull when relaying on advertisments .

The general understanding that advertisments ca n't tell the truth is wrong in my view , though the technique to present a product in a better light as it really is , is definetly in every advertisers toolbox .
