In my essay I am going to explain why I agree with he statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

First I would like to say that success could also be connected with earning a lot of money .
Successful people are in the case to try new things out because they are already rich .
They also do not have to think about what will happen if the new thing , whatever it is , will not work or will not be so successful .
They are able to lean back without caring that they probably had lost a lot of money .

They also dare trying out new things because they do not believe that they would lose something .
To support my view I want to show it through an example .
If a business man would open a restaurant , just to do something different , and the restaurant will not be visited from any person , he will not think about that he had invested his money wrong .
Probably he will believe that nevertheless it was worth it to try it out .

Besides successful people are really getting tired of doing the same thing over years and years .
They want to risk something and want to have more excitement in their lifes .

Only people who are successful woul dare it .
The reason for my opinion is that if people had felt success once in their lifes , then they become greedy of having more and more success .
They believe that no matter what they will build up , it will become successful .

These aspects are leading to my point of view , why I believe that only successful people are taking risks and are trying out new things and why success plays an important role on that statement .
