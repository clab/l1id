Is it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts or is it more important for them to learn facts ?
In my opinion it is more important to understand concepts and ideas for several reason .

Fortunately i had the oppurtunity to experience high-school in Germany and in the United States of America .
In Germany there are no facts asked in test or exams .
Moreover you absolutely will not find any multiple choice questions .
In juxtaposition to this multiple choice questions and remembering facts is basically all i did while i was in Chicago .
I never really had to work with the facts i memerized .
Today I can say I forgot almost everything i have learned in the US but i still understand the concepts and ideas that were taught to me in Germany .

Another reason why it is more important to understand concepts is the following .
A person that is able to memerize a lot is not necesarilly an intellegent person .
So it is possible that a rather unintellegent person gets higher grades in school than person that has a high IQ if only facts are asked .
In my opionion the studying facts should be rewarded but you should not be able to achieve a very high grade by just memerizing facts .

My last and most important point is that understanding ideas and concept prepares you better for your work life .
All these facts you might have learned in school will not help you if you cannot work with them .
And the first step to work with them is to understand the main idea .
Understanding the main idea makes it also a lot easier to memerize it .
So from understanding concepts you pick up facts anyways .

i believe if you understand the ideas and concepts you will memerize the most important facts anyways .
Therefore just memerizing facts is a less advanced way of learning .
As a consequent of this it makes it more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
