In my opinion I can not really agree or disagree with the statement `` Succesful people try new things and take risks rather then only doing what they already know how to do well . ''
For example , it is always necessary to do things which I really know are good and how I have to do them .
I can not open a design agency if I do not know how to work with colours , arts , signs or types .
That are necessary and elemantary topics for a designer .
But if my agency works good , I could try some risks .
For example , I could try to achieve new goals .
This does not work without some risks .
When I first only coloured books and invented new corporate designs for other firms , and now I want to offer a new part of design , the imagefilm , it includes a lot of risks .
I have to ask me some things : `` Do I have enough money for the new equipment ?
Am I able to handle with the new topic ? '' or '' Will I have people wanting pay me for my work ? ''
This are all risks and the topic is a new thing for me .
But I could really be succesfull , maybe I have a great talent in making film .
And new ideas are going to be searched .
It could be , that I have not many limits in my mind about this topic and I could try mostly everything .
This would be a new way for me and my agency .
And if colouring books and making new corporate designs are things which worked good before , they are the basis for new things and risks .
And I can be sure that I have things which are able to allow me the new risks .
That is why , I think you need both to be succesfull , first you should have knowledge which you already know to handle and then you can try new things amd take risks .
This would be a very good combination for beeing a succesfull people .
