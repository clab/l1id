In my opinion this statement is true .
I think this is since young people are at the beginning of there lives and not in the middle or at the end of it .
You can reccognise it if you start a new work .
Generally at the beginning it is interesting , because you have never done it before , but after a few weeks or month you know how to do it and it is becoming less interesting .

Here are some examples why from my point of view , young people enjoy it more to live than old people .
When you are young you have a lot of changes .
You grow up , become interested in the other sex and have to go to school .
You have not to be concerned about that you have enough money neither if you have a job or not .
It does not care you .

On the other hand it really depents on how people have planed there lives .
The most grown up people I know , have a house or an appartement somewhere , children and a job .
Those people have really not a lot of changes in there lives .
The time schedule is nearly every week the same .

However I know some other peoples who have a completly different way of live .
For example one guy I know , he is 50 years old now , stopped to work with fourty .
He has had the opinion that he owns enough money to live on with for the rest of his live .
So he bought a sailing boot to travel around the world .
He works from time to time if he can at a bare in Jamaica , but only one ore two months in a year .

I think in his case the mentioned statement is wrong .
He never stoped to be young .
I think that he enjoys everz daz like it would be his first on this planet .
With this sentence I would like to say that the sentence wich I am writing about is not absolutely true .
However generally I have the same impression .
