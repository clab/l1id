The statement is certainly true .
Products ' qualities are exaggerated by advertisements .
As there is no empirical support available , I will support this position twofold .
First , I will give two short examples of such advertisements .
Second , I will discuss possible explanations of the phenomenon .
If there are both fitting cases and a compelling theory , we have the best evidence availiable without further study .
Finally , I will briefly discuss possible actions .

The first example relates to a typical car spot .
The cars are almost always polished to brilliance , the only exception being spots on Jeeps , Hummers and the like .
But these types of car are designed for use in wilderness .
SUV ( meaning Sports utility vehicle ) is ironically referred to as a ` suburban utility vehicle ' .
The spots pretend a reality that does not exist .
Also , often the windows of the cars are made of black glass .
I suppose this stresses the geometric features of the cars and lets it appear a bit mystique .
Summed up , the cars are always in perfect shape and not in the state of your average car .
Using small and smart tricks , the spots manipulate the expectations and the image you might have of the car .

Another example is a recent advertisement for milk that I saw .
In the morning , the whole family sat together around a nice table in a beautiful kitchen .
the sun was shining , and everybody was havong fun and drinking milk .
This scenario probably is a bit overstretched and not corresponding to the average breakfast .
it was suggested that milk and the enjoyable situation are linked together .

After these two short examples , we proceed to possible explanations .
A set of them is located in the dynamics of the competition on the market .
Firms , if they are to survive , are forced to sell their goods .
To this end , they try to compel the comsumer to buy the company 's product , and not the competitor 's .
Therefore , firms make their goods appear as good as possible .
Advertisements not only serve to immediately selling products - they also increase the prestige of the company 's brand .
A well-known name allows a company to take higher prices for its products , for consumers base their decisions upon incomplete information about the products .
They assume that a well-known brand also means well-established quality , which would justify higher prices .

Also , game theory helps a bit in explaining the phenomenon .
A company cannot be sure that the competitor 's advertisements are true .
So the company may be tempted to cheat a little to boost its sales in a presumably unfair competition .
In political science , this constellation is known as prisoner 's dilemma .

Regarding possible solutions , the EU has some regulations on advertisements that do not exist in the United States .
In the EU , companies are not allowed to include information about the product they know to be wrong .
Also , the EU has stricter guidelines on ingredients in foods and their publication .
Apparently , there might be some room to manouevre in the legislative area to tackle the problem .
On the other hand , an informed consumer judging on the basis of the best knowledge will be the best weapon against these kinds of misleading advertisements .
