In general it is always difficult to decide definitely for one possibility .
Because both of them contain some advantages but also some disadvantages , it would be the best to decide for a mixture .

Whereas a broad knowledge of many subjects refers to the ideal of humanism which has been supported for a long time and partially is still being supported , specialization is a phenomena of modern time .

We are living in a time of change .
Scientific and technical progress have coined the last century more than any time before .
With the term `` globalization '' I only want to mention one of the new challenges we have to master .

As a reaction on these changes the idea of specialization has developped .
Today , there is much more discovered than in former times so you even have to learn much more to get along in a certain profession or academical direction .
As a result specialization is definitely necessary .

Nevertheless I regard a certain broad knowledge to be absolutely necessary for everyone .
Our world is so complex and also complicated that people have to know the essential things about almost all subjects to give an reliable feedback for example to politicians leading a nation .
If people are not as well educated there will be the risk of creating a society leaded by a few people not thinking about entire people 's problems .

So I would prefer a mixture of generalized and specialized knowledge .
All People should learn the most important elements out of all academic subjects .
In school there is the possibility to do so .
Later they might decide to be teached in one subject and in subjects related to this chosen one .
After that , people may really specialize in their subject .

By this way it would take a longer time until people start working but it surely would be an advantage for society .
