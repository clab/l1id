I do think , that successful people are tending to take risks and trying new things .
If one is successful in working , then he or she gets work faster and more effective done than others .
What does this one do with the remaining time , while the others are still working ?
First the one would try to redo work to do it in a better way of quality .
Second he would tend to do different things like gathering with collegues or flirting with a woman .
In this case he would loose the enhance of flirting or gathering , because it would not be , what he is satisfied by .
Third thing that would happen , is one would tend back to his work and do what he is payed for .
Evaluating his work would lift him up in a position above his collegues and in conclusion the one would be miscredited .
At the end he would spend at least a part of his time in doing new things and in taking risks .
In my example , a person is automatically brought up to try new things and to take risks , because he is better than the others .
It could be a member of a company .

Thinking about a more daily term makes the statement common .
Everywhere in the world people tend to do things that makes them different to other people .
If you take a group of children for example , that are playing with a doll , then after a while of being involved , one of them leaves the group in the meaning of playing with a ball .
Ther is and there will always be one out of a group , who is leaving or who is going to take a risk .

Almost everyone in society has got a special thing of doing .
People are bungee jumping or are holding on to a farm with ten horses although its a lot of work to do .
These are supposed to be examples of peoples privacy .
They all tried something risky in times , when they started with this special kinds of sports or private activity .
Probably there have been relatives in any of this examples , that were wondering about the risk part of the activity .
