This question is really hard to answer , because both aspects are importend , a broad knowledge of many academic subjects as well as a deeper understanding in one specific subject .
However , in my opinion specialization is necessary to succeed in your future carreer .
I mean , that is why we are going to university ; becoming a well educated person in our field of study .

Students are attending most courses , that are necessary for their major .
Is this not specialization ?
I think it is .
Furthermore , if we had not such a thing like specialization , everybody would be able to become a politician or a lawyer or even a doctor .
Can you imagine that ?
I believe that this would be an aweful situation .
I want a surgery to be done by a professional and not somebody who is also my lawyer or a carpenter .

I think I made it clear , why specialization is necessary for an intact economy .
However , a broad academical knowledge is not necessarily required , but it would definately be something one person can take advantage of .
For example , an engineer would be unsuccessful to become self employed , if he has not attended a certain number of business or economy classes during his time at college .
These classes would provide him with the knowledge about economic relations and approaches in business life .
Fortunately , the school system in germany requires that students have to attend a certain number of courses that do not belang to their major .
Through this approach , graduates are going to be more flexible , which would probably be something businesses are looking for , when you try applying for an occupation .

In conclusion , both aspects are important .
But people have to be some sort of specialized to be fully integrated into society and economy and to find a job .
As I pointed out , who wants to have a surgery done by a non-professional ?
