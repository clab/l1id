In my opinion there 's something true in this statement but it 's not quite accurate .
Succesful people are regared to be very rich , famous and wealthy .
So if an famous actor decided to take the risk of quitting the movie buisness and to start a whole new career ( for example as professional football player ) he would n't be taking any risk at all .
If he failed he would have enough money to survive this episode of `` new life finding '' and the whole world would report about his attempt to change his job .
So everybody would know about his `` risky '' plan which is n't risky at all in fact because he 's got nothing to lose .

Inspite of this unsuccessful people would have huge problems if they tried to change their job because they would n't have any savings to life from if they did n't succeed .
Furthermore nobody would know about this risky attempt because no newspaper or TV station would be interested in this particular change .

I think the media gives us the impression that successful people are trying new things more often than the common people because we are directly confronted with their new ideas .

Let 's give an example : David Beckham ( a famous soccer player from Great Britain ) changed his haircut every few months and the whole world was impressed by his new style and courage to do so .
At the same time I dyed my hairy every week to another beautiful color but nobody execept my worried mum was interested in this .

Fame and success make it possible to inform ( even without the intention to do so ) the huge mass about the new things certain people are trying .
Another exemple : When Arnold Schwarzenegger decieded to start a political career every newspaper reported about this sensational event but when I won the election to the new head of the sports club not even the local newspaper was interested in this .

To summarize : Successful people are n't taking more risks or trying new things than the normal human being is , the only difference is that the media reports about them .
