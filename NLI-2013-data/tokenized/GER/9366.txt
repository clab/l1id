I do not agree with the statement that `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and cocepts than it is for them to learn facts. '' , because this statement generalizes that ideas and concepts are always more important than facts .

As a student there are always classes that contain for huge parts of facts , for example history .
Other subjects , for example psychologie , concentrate on ideas that have to be prooven later on .

In deed it is important to always have a general idea what somebody is explaining and to understand how a concept works , but using a concept practically without having the knowledge of the important facts around and behind the idea is mostly not possible .
For example : it is good to understand the concept of a war , but that includes not from when till when it actually happend , what the factic conseqences were .

A concept is always just fifty percent of reality , the other fifty percent are the facts that set it into context .
On the otherhand would it be almost useless to collect all the facts about for example the second world war , if you have no idea about the causes ; the ideas and concepts each party of this war had .
With only one , fact or concept it is neither possible to completly understand something nor to make the step from the idea to reality .

Therefore my opinion is , that understanding a concept is for students as important as the facts surrounding the concept .
Both must be understood to realize a topic .
