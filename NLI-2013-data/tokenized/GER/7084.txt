Cars are the most convinient way to travel .
Unlike public transport , you can go exectly where you want - without waiting , without detours .
If zou have a lot to transport , like a peace of furnature you can just put it in the trunk - given that zour car is big enough .
Riding by bus would be very impractical , getting through the doors , finding enough space .

You might thing that the bus is ceaper , and maybe sometimes it is , but as soon as you are n't traveling alone the expensives for the fuel can be shared .
Time is also of importance , even trains beeing very fast traveling from one citz to another , you normaly need a lot of time until you reach your final destination .
You will have to get a bus or subway , which may be late , and in the end you would have been quicker using a car .

Besides of being more practical , there is also a psychological aspect to it .
Your car is something you have earned , somthing you can be proud of .
And most important , it belongs to you .
So you are not quit in public when you drive your car .
It 's like you are still on your own teritorry .
And it is also a common symbol of status , and who wants to give that up ?
I shure do not .

Of cause there are problemes , like rising fuel prices .
But I think that ways will be found to solve them .
Even today there are cars which dont need fuel based on oil .
So when the last oilwells dry out , the cars wo n't lack of fuel - because when it happens cars wo n't need fuel anymore .

I think the car is so convinient , and liked by so many of us , that we will find a solution to any problem that might endanger our beloved automobil .
