I disagree with the statement that travelling in a group led by a tour guide is better than travelling individually without any form of guidence .
My opinion is based on my past vacation experience and my personal preferences in regard to organize my vacation time .

Travelling in a group has the advantage that the traveller is instantly surrounded either by people he or she knows or by other travellers with the same time schedule and intentions .
This eliminates the pressure to meet people for the purpose of socializing during vacation .
Furthermore , hiring or electing a tour guide waives the responsibility to plan and organize time schedules , sleeping arrangements and sight seeing trips to a third person .
This reduces the stress and organizational effort prior to and during vacation .
On the other hand , it limits the individual possibilities to plan the vacation time according to my own and my fellow traveller 's preferences .

Group trips are rather advantageous for shorter trips .
Whereas over the period of several days , individual personalities tend to create minor or major conflicts within the group .
This is especially true for pretty heterogeneous groups , ranging in age , profession , personal background , etc .
Whereas the excitement at the beginning of trips causes most people to subordinate their own preferences to the group 's interest , this is likely to change over the course of a vacation .
Frustration , arguments , and annoyment are only some examples of negative personal conflicts that I saw occuring during group trips in the past .
And these can severely ruin the enjoyment of a vacation .

Based on my experience , tour guides have to the potential to limit the personal freedom to visit attractions that I wanted to see and group dynamics can have a negative impact on all members of the travel group .
Therefore , I prefer to travel individually .
The freedom to create a schedule according to my preferences and to choose who to interact and socialize with during my vacation offsets the extra organizational effort prior to the trip .
By travelling individually , the success and enjoyment of my vacation is in my own hands .
