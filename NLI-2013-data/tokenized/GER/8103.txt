The issue at hand is whether students should concentrate on understanding or to `` cram '' facts .
This issue is difficult because it depends on the subject .
In some subjects like Physics it is more important to practice understanding and approaching theories rather than learning facts by heart .
In other subjects , like medicine , both facts and understanding are essential .
But to know about facts dominates .
I believe that to focus on studiying facts is the better option , because if appropriate learned they will last forever .

To study facts intensivley and frequently is preferable because it 's the fundament of your knowledge and therefore the basis of your proficiency .
Facts you once gained will be availible at any time when required .
For example a doctor always has to rely on his | her basic knowledge about physiology .
If he | she would have to look up a process before curing , treatment would take too long .
In addition , would such a behaviour be reliable ?
Because facts are the basis of our jobs I think most studies should focus on building reliable knowlegde .
Additionally , to stay with the example , a doctor continously has to learn and to advance his knowlegde .
Without appropriate knowlegde he wo n't be able to understand new research .
And therefore wo n't be able to cure his | her patients in a actual manners .
To learn how to approach new findings wo n't help .

Ultimately , I feel to focus on studying facts is the right choice .
I believe this , because
