In this period of time advertisements have a very strong impuls and influence in people 's lives .

First of all I have to say that I was born in this generation where the industry more or less cannot survive without advertisements .

From sharing experiences with my mother and reading magazines from the '' sixties '' , even back then advertisements played a big role in selling products .
I agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because that 's the best way to win customers .

Human beings of course , only want to see , touch , feel , smell ..
etc. the best a product can offer with the senses God gave them .

Regardless of the fact that a lot of products have disadvantages , people are prone to be blinded by the beauty and the advantages of the product itself .

For instance , a simple product like '' soap '' , has to fulfill its purpose .
As a young lady I want to have soap that smells good , looks good , a kind of soap that smoothens or even whitens my skin .

It is proven and I have read a survey oh how many people read information on the package of the soap if this kind of soap is dermatologically tested or not .
The low amount of customers that read this information stroke me .

All what people want is what gives them a good impression in any art of media .
Newspapers , magazines , posters , TV and radio advertisements will try to do their best in this competitive world market .
In order for a product to seem better , advertisement companies would do everything to attract people .

As I have mentioned there is great competition in the market .
And I have learned during my highschool time of strategies advertisements take .
For instance , if they want to attract young people the advertisement company will use a model who is popular , like a famous soccer player or a politician who wil of course try to impress and catch the eyes of the viewers by wearing '' NIKE SHOES '' .
If one person buys those NIKE shoes , everybody else will .
That | 's how we people are .

I am aware that advertisements are exagerated and sometimes full of lies but I cannot deny that I am a victim of this trend .
