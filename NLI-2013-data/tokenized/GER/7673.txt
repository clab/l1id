The question whether or not being in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel is first of all one of age .

If you are old and insecure , the days of adventure and exploring are long behind you and you only feel safe when you are with at least ten other people , it might just be the right choice for you .

If you are going to a country so foreign that communication with locals is impossible , you do not know what you can eat or drink and the wildlife is a mystery to you , travelling with an experienced guide can definitely be an advantage .

But then again ...
If you travel this way , you might just miss out on all the things that make travelling so exciting , unique and worth your while .
Not being able to communicate with natives in the country your in is definitely a huge disadvantage , but if you 're polite and patient and do not act like the king of the world , you might just find your best friends that way .
People that will show you around , show you the interesting spots far away from all the sightseeing , people that will cook food for you that you ca n't experience in any of the westernized restaurants picked by the travel company .

Travelling without a tour guide also enables you to make your own schedule .
You like a place - you stay .
You do n't want to spend 5 more minutes in this town - take the next bus south .

On the downside the freedom of travelling on your own time and schedule always means travelling on your own expense .
So it is possible that a guided tour will turn out to be cheaper than the self organized trip .
This does whatsoever entirely depend on your trip .

One of the great advantages of travelling with an organized tour is security .
You know where you 're going , you know what you 're going to do , you do not have to make any decisions , you know how much you 're going to pay for your vacation .
These are , despite my sarcastic undertone in the introduction , good reasons for travelling this way .

It 's a tough decision between travelling comfortably or taking the risk of backpacking around the world .
Unfortunately most people have more to worry about than just that .
If travelling is an option , meaning it being financially possible for one , the decision between those two entirely depends on ones preferences and standards .

I would personally always take the adventure of exploring a country on my own over the boredom of a guided group tour .
I hope to keep this attitude for as long as possible .
But who knows how long that is going to be ...
