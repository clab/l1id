When I talk to older people , for example to my grandparents , they give me the advise to always enjoy every hour of my life as this time will never be given back to me .
Also , they say that I should enjoy life while I 'm still young as I have more possibilities - maybe not financially , but regarding my health and the time I have .

I 'm still very young , at the beginning of my twenties to be exactly , and , yes , so far I really enjoyed life .
However , lacking the personal eperience of how life changes and how one actually enjoys life when being older , makes this question hard to answer .

To answer this question , I 'd like to look at the things which change when a person is older .
One of these things is responsibility .
As a child , I did n't have the feeling of being responsible for anything .
Without being worried about other persons ( as my parents were with me , for example ) , I could enjoy life more effortlessly .
Also , becoming older means to be faced with other problems .
As a child or teenager , I was not really worried about the question of how to earn my money , how to put food on the table , when to fill out my tax forms , or how to solve problems in my relationship .
However , as a teenager , I experienced an increased responsibility for my education .
I had to go to school every weekday , I had to finish my homework and hand in my assignments in time .
These tasks definately were n't very helpful in enjoying my life .

Due to the time older people have to spend on their job and getting other tasks done , they have less time to do things they actually enjoy - unless you enjoy your work more than anything else .
I know many people who enjoy the work they are doing but would rather do something else even more enjoyable , like studying a topic they are really interested in , go hiking , see some friends , or travel .
However , even though younger people have more time to do all these things - students , for example , have long summer breaks - most young people lack the money to afford all these things .
Also , due to laws and regulations , younger people may not be able to do certain things that older people can do .
Driving a car was something I would definately have enjoyed when I was six years old ( I still do now , though ) , however , I was not allowed to do it .
There are also things which are not appreciated by younger people as things that make live more enjoyable .
Visiting a classical concert or just watching a sunset might be such an example .
For many adults or older people , having an own family is the most important thing to have an enjoyable life .

Given the examples and explanations above , I generally agree with the statement , mainly because of the less responsibilities young people have , the less problems they are confronted with , and because of the time they have available .
looking at it in a philosophical way , one must not forget the other side to this discussion , which is that older people have the experience and matureness to appreciate certain things more which make their live enjoyable .
However , for me it definately seems that younger people have more fun , are more active and get to know more new people .
Also , there is still this curiosity about new and unexperienced things , which makes life very enjoyable .
However ,
