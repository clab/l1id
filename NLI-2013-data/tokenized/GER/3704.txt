Time is a big problem nowadays .
Not only concerning the time we have to spend working every day to make our living but also the time we have to spend to serve social demands .
What young people are taught in an average family today is much different from what they were taught fifty years ago and it does definitely not lead to a person who is actively participating in social areas such as communities without being pushed by parents or career .
Spending time for social benefit instead of for personal interest is something that is very rarely seen .

I think that it is right that young people of our time do spend very little time helping their communities but I am of the opinion that one should not only blame the youths for their lack of interest but in fact look at the causes which are basic for this change .

If you want to be respected and liked in our society you have to work hard for a good education in order to work in a profession which allows you to earn a lot of money .
There is not much time left besides this .
It is a question of moral standards that changed our attitude towards community work .
When our parents were young there was no question that the family went to church every Sunday and that the mother and children helped at community feasts and celebrations .

Those parents showed their children that this community work is part of their daily life .
Nowadays however this is not the case in most of the families anymore .
How are the children supposed to gain access to their community ?
How are they supposed to value the benefits they get from such work if the parents do not show them anymore ?

I found that the friends I made within my community are the ones which remained over a long period of time , not all of them but still a noticable lot .
I spend a lot of afternoons in the communities ' room for kids when I was about fourteen and I must say that I truly enjoyed helping to organize our yearly community feast .

Finally there are always exceptions to be made when it comes to generalizing an opinion about a group of people - or even a whole generation - as in the discussed statement .
Not all young people are interested in helping their communities but still there are some who are more than interested .
Therefore I find it difficult to agree to such a general statement eventhough there is definitely truth in blaming our generation for not being intersted in helping others without directely earning benefit fo oneself .
