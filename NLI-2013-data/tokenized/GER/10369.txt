I think that successful people are often people trying a new thing .
Because I think successful people are people who are in action , who are doing a lot of things .
And so more you are doing , so more you can change .
On the other hand , successfull people are most intelligent , so that they are able to have good ideas and so they try new things .

So I still agree with the appointment that successful people try new things but I think that successful people do n't try everything .
They compares the risk of the new thing with the chance of it and then they decide if they want to do it .
I 'm not sure , if successful people take more risks than other people .
Of course , some do .
But there are people that have take more risks than other and they are very unsuccessful , like Hannibal with his elephants .
A man who try a new thing was Henry Ford , he started up a business and paid his employees 5 Dollars a day , that was a realy high sold .
But it works .
He was very successfull .

Other very successfull men trying something new and take risks are Bill Gates or Gandhi .
I think if you want to be successfull you have to try new things and to take risks as well .
But risk is n't risk .
To buy stocks at the stock exchange and have n't money on the bank is not the same risk as if I have it .
It 's important to make it clear what 's risk and what is really stupid .

I 'm not the person who agree or disagree with such a statement , because it 's too unspecific and too common .
