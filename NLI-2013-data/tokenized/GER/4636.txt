Today there is nearly no product which can be sold without any advertisement .
And the past has shown that those product who tried failed more often than were succesfull buyed by their customers .

So this indicates for me that advertisements make prouducts more that they are because if it would not be like this a product could exist without its advertisement .
So i agree with that statement !

It is clear that advertisement gives the image of a product and also helps to reach the buyers .
And most of the companys know how they can use this .
They try to give their product the best image they could because than the customers will recognize it and buy it maybe next time in supermarket or somewhere else .

To give an example i want to explain how it happend to me when an advertisement makes me buy a product .
A few weeks ago I mentioned an advertisement shown on television .
It was a new hair-shampoo which promises nice hair and a great experience by washing your hair .
Than the next day I went to the supermarket to buy such an shampoo .
But when I washed my hair I could not feel the great experience of washing hair .
Plus , and this was more important , my skin on my head was red because of the shampoo .
This makes it obvious to me that this product was not as good as it was on its advertisement .
So my own experience showed me that advertisements makes products seem much better just to sell more of them .

But i think it is normal that advertisments make products seem better than they really are because its function is to atract people !
Today you seem silly if you believe in what an advertisement promises to you .
So , its just thay goes today when you want to sell things !
