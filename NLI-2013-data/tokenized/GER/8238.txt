University as well as high school students are required to having obtained certain skills by the time they graduate .
This is what makes their degree valuable .
The skills can be devided into two main categories : Learning facts and understanding ideas and concepts .
The chairman of Columbia University 's debate club has recently provoked great dispute as he claimed that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
I do n't agree with him .

In my opinion , on the one hand , understanding ideas and concepts is essential for succeeding after college .
Only if one is able to rethink complicated processes and to find own conclusions , one will be able to improve one 's abilities and will be capable of managing tasks that require improvisation .

On the other hand , this is certainly not possible if you lack the respected facts .
Facts are therefore even more important than understanding ideas and concepts as they provide the basis for the second group of skills .
If you do n't even know the facts about a certain topic , then how can you draw conclusions ?
For example , if a biologist does not know how to define and to describe a somatic cell , can he investigate them and use them for research ?
Probably not .
Hence , it is a must for teachers and professors to provide their students with a broad knowledge of facts , no matter if it is in elementary school , in high school or in college .
Where else should people learn the essentials if not their educational career ?

In conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts is of course a required skill for graduates .
However , they by far do not play such an important role as facts , or other skills not discussed in this essay , for example the ability to speak coherently and clearly , arguing and solving social problems , or teamwork .
