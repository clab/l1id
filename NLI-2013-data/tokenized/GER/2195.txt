Nowadays people often speak about our society and the behaviour of our different generations .
As a matter of fact by talking about these topics the question might come up to ur minde : Whether young people really enjoy their life much more than older people do .
To answer this question you have to look at several aspects that make me believe that older people have less fun in their life .

As a great problem that has to be mentioned at this point is , that older people often get lazy and stick to their home and are kind of timid to leave home for a certain distance .
They feel safe at home and know their enviroment .
In order to this they try to get into as few situations as they can according to avoid new orientation or adaptation .
Or have you seen so many grand-parents going into a fun park or the cinema .
Another aspect might be that you can see many elderly walking around which give you the impression as if they feel not accepted or appropriate in the new started age .
They feel too old .
These are two behavioural problems of elderly which prevent them from enjoying their life as younger people do .

Additionally , although old people have got much freetime and nearly nothing to do , they do not get to the point to do more than the household .
They always think that they have got a certain age and cannot do this and that .
Another problem facing this is , that even younger people do not have the possiblity to encourage their grand-parents to keep on doing something .
This fact might be due to a certain history of generations .
Older people are not allowed to enjoy life only to be kind of advisor for the younger generations .
This is the way older people like to follow but younger people on the other side have not got in mind .

As I pointed out in the paragraphes above , their are several problems which lead older people to the fact that they enjoy their life less than younger people do , when you try to mesure it on the activities people do .
This is why I am of the opinion that older people mostly fale to enjoy their life , probably due to their own history that younger do n't have .
Due to this younger can enjoy life much better .
