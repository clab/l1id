The question if there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years , than there are in use today , is a controversal topic .
People may argue that cars get abundand in the futur due to further development of alternative transportation methods or by concerns about the environment .
I however , do not agree with this staatment .
I even think cars get more and more important and that car use will increas in the next twenty years .

The use of cars is an still will be important especially for working people .
Statistiks show that people have to travell longer and longer distances to their workplace , and in the future this distance will still increase .
A lot of people move out to the suburbs and consequently have a longer way to work each day .
I think this development will continue in the futur and will increase the cars in use .

Furthermore flexibility is a charakteristik that is getting very important these days .
Companys want there employee to be flexible and let them travel for work a lot .
This flexibility can be given by the car and will increase its use .

Another important reason why there will be more cars in use in twenty days than today is that the population on earth is increasing rapidly .
If population is increasing the use of cars will increase as well because more people lead to more cars .

But not only workingconditions and the increasing population are reasons agains the reduction of cars in the futur .
As well the vacationhabbit of people will lead to the opposit .
As the world gets closer togehter by globalisation , open boarders and a common currency for example , travelling gets a lot easier than it was in the past .
People use this advantages and travell a lot and I think travelling by car will get more and more popular .

Last but not least I argue that because of new technologies and production methods , cars get cheaper in the futur and therefore get accesable to more people which will defenetly not decrease the cars in use .

For these reasons I stated above I think the statement that cars in use will be fewer in the futur is incorrect .
