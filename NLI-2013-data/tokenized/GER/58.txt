The question wheather it is generally really better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is not easy to answer since it depends highly on the context .

Undergraduate study courses should indeed offer the students a variety of subjects so they gain a broad knowledge of different areas .
Then , this knowledge can function as a basis to specialize in postgraduate studies .

I consider both the gain of broad knowledge as a first step and the specialization in one subject as a second step to be very important for the following reasons :
On the one hand , due to technical invention , among others the improved communication means , contemporary knowledge is growing faster than ever before in the past .
No human is able to learn everything that has been discovered by scientists so far .
In conclusion , the attempt to gain a deeper knowledge in each academic area must fail .
One can only gain a deep knowledge in very limited subjects .

Therefore , specialization is necessary since science need researchers who are experts in the area they are working .
On the other hand , for the same reason that the world is much more connected than it used to be , there is also the need for every student to have a basic knowledge of other areas than the one he is specializing in for different sciences are more connected and work together more often than in the past .

In conclusion , basic broad knowledge is necessary as a basis to specialize in one certain area .
