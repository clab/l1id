It is important to know a lot about economics and social sciences to predict in an appropriate way if the amount of used cars will decrease in the next twenty years .

Is there any lack or shortage of cars in our society ?
It seems that every family and also every lonely living person has at least one car .
Additional cars are not required for the private use .
Because the population in my native country ( Germany ) is not growing any more , it is likely to agree to the statement so far that the number of used cars will probably not increase .
It could stay constant .

Other questions concern the alternatives of driving a car .
Travelling by train is still very expensive in Germany - the high prizes for petrol are not worse .
Our train system still has to solve many problems ( too many trains are critically late , sometimes they are overboarded ) so that the possibility to use a train instead of a car ist not very attractive to many persons .

One completely different aspect is the availability of petrol in the future and how fast an adequate substitute can be found and introduced .
Maybe in twenty years , it could be the privelege of a few very rich people to drive a car , because the little accessible rest of petrol will have .

How much cars are needed for the industry ?
And what is the tendancy how the indostrial need for cars will develope during the next twenty years ?
Here I have to display my lack of knowledge .
Many articles , chemical components and other things have to be transported from one place to the other .
The disire that the economy of a nation should grow for it 's own ` heath ' does n't suggest that cars could be less needed for oconomic purposes in twenty years .

As a summary , it is visible that there are many different tendancys and developments which make it almost impossible to predict the amount of used cars in the year 2026 .
