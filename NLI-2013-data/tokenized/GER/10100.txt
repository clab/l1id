In general I agree with this statement .
When are too frighted to beginn new projects , activities or somethink else , you do n't give yourself the chance to develop .
In my opinion especially in a business environment you could have no success without new ideas and inovations every day .
You must face challanges every day .
If you just relaxe and do only the thinks you already know , your competitors wo n't give you a chance .
In the modern society you always have to be the best .
You must be the owner of many abilities .
If your mind is not open you ca n't have any success .
When you regarde famous successful people , like ...
for example , they all had ideas and no fear to fight for them .
But on the other hand , if you do the things you know well you are getting better and better .
At least , I would say , you have to be open for new things but you also should improve the abilities in the thinks you already know .
