I do not fullly agree with this statement .
Undoubtely there are a lot of examples in history providing the statement .
One person I think of is Albert Einstein .
He perfomed physics in a time , when the general opinion was , that in physics more or less all has been discovered .
But he was in doubt about some facts , which did not seem to be correct for him .
By publishing his theory of relativity he risked to loose his reputation in the scientific community , as most of the other scientists declared him to be lunatic .
And what has become of is today ?
His theory explains a lot of phenomena like the gravitational force and his name is present to nearly everybody in the world .

For another example you may think of the American expression ` From a dishwasher to a millionaire ' , which states the possibility to become successful in life by trying new ways and hard work .

Exactly at this point I see a weakness of the statement : Hard work .
It does not appear in it at all .
In my opinion you can be succesful in life without taking unnecessary risks .
You might be one of the leading scientists in your special field of interest .
Lets say you are a specialist in computer databases .
Why should you take risk and , for example , start a business selling databases , risking bankrupty ?
It is possibly a sensible decision to offer your abilties to others which will pay you .
Perhaps you will not get a second Bill Gates but you also might become succesfull .

Another point of critizism of mine is the fact that everybody finds success in different part of life .
Having a loved family can make feel successful .
But I think you should not risk anything at all if your family is involved , because your children might suffer from it .
