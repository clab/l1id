Even bad marketing is marketing .
In my opinion a successful person is someone who takes risks and tries new thinks .
I am the best exmple for this statement :

Two weeks ago , I had an interview at the Walt Disney Company for an internship .
of course I could have come to this interview as every one else : nicely dressed , conservative and serious .
I would show him my image of a good teammember and some other strengths .

So I would have had a nice interview and maybe a chance to get the job .

But I wanted to get a better chance on the job : So I came as the comic figure Daisy .
I wore a white blouse with a Daisy pin and a nice skirt , combined with a pink bow in my hair .
I knew that my behaviour was not usual and I was aware of the risk I was taking with this strategy .

First of all , everybody looked at me when I came in , so I got the full concentration on my person .
It was a little bit risky , because this attention can be positive or negative , but for sure they will remember me .

Furthermore , my interviewer could see that I am an outspoken person with motivation to get the job .
Of course , the image of Daisy matched with the job offer I was applying for .
I had to fight for the very first minutes of the interview to give the interviewer the impression that I am still a serious , conservative and trustful worker but it was worth it .

The interviewer gave me the job right away and when I asked why he decided so quick he said :
You applied for the job in an unusual way and showed me that you are able to think out of the box .
Actually , we were looking for someone who takes risks to achieve his goals and you are this person .
