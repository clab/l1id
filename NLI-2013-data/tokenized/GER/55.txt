I agree with the statement .
There are two dangers that lay within , if you specialize in one specific subject .
One is the danger of not being able to find solutions to problems anymore .
If you become so boggled up in one subject , you will eventually develop what is commonly known as `` tunnel vision '' and implies that you can no longer look left or right of your own thoughts .
But sometimes the answer lies somewhere outside , which you are simply not able to see or even realize if you have never heard of it .
The second danger is that if you become too specific in one subject , no one else may follow your thoughts anymore and understand you , thus making your work and/or discoveries virtually useless to society .

One good example of how having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is in the field of law .
A lawyer who has knowledge only of his own national law and rules my end up not finding a solution to the problem within his own system , but if he were to look outside and compare how maybe other countries or codes have solved that same problem , he could adopt the solution and create a more effective system .

Another example would be found in the area of technology .
Technological progress can much better be made if you can take and compare discoveries made in different sectors .
Energy and automobile technology seem to be depended on each other .
One without the other would not be able to survive .
Automibles need energy and energy companies rely on the automobile industrie as customers and consumers .
Exchange in ideas can only lead to improvement .
