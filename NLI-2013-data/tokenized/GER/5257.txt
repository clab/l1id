You can find advertisements everywhere : in newspapers , in the cinema , at bus stations and even on the toilet paper .
So they defenitely influence us a lot .
Often we just buy a new product because the man in the newspaper had such a nice smile .
It 's the question if you really get what they are pretending .
I think there are a lot of products which are in fact not as useful or of the quality the commercial lets them look like .

There exists for example a tv-spot where a handsome girl watches a big screen with an ice-cream on it and while watching it dissapears and suddenly sit 's on an tropic island .
Of course this is not possible in reality but it should show , that together with the ice-cream you buy some tropical feelings .
Advertisements always are used to express some special needings to the person who whatches them .
And a lot of studies show that most of the people are easily to impress , especially with pictures or videos .
From my point of view this is a dangerous fact , because advertisements often promise things which a person does n't just get because of buying the product .
For example the commercials for smokers .
There are always shown a group of modern and happy people , sitting togther , relaxing and of course smoking .
So a young boy might think that if he buy 's those cigarettes he will get a lot of new friends and self-confidence .
But in reality it 's not that easily .

In addition to that , only companies with a great amount of money are able to start commercials .
They will be shown everywhere and a lot of people will buy their products just because of that and not because of thinking it trough if it has got the best quality or the best price .
So I think it 's possible to produce less good products but at the same time sell lots of them just because of a wide range of advertisements .

All in all , from my point of view , advertisements often pretend to give a certain use to the person that buys the product , but in the end it 's often just wishful-thinking .
