I am in favour of the argument that over the next twenty years the amount of cars in use will be decreasing .

Even though large parts of the world 's population will increase their mobility through economic growth , the negative impact of cars will outweigh this natural growth potential .
For example if China 's and India 's economic growth allows people to buy more cars , governments in both countries will need to react quickly to avoid the adverse effects of increased individual mobility .

Firstly , ecologically it will not be possible to continue using as many cars as today in the future .
Our environment is already suffering strongly from pollution caused by cars .
For example breathing and skin problems occur more often on people living in city centre locations than on the country side .
Furthermore our cultural heritage is endangered by car pollution as exhaust is attacking architectural works .

Secondly , economically it is not intelligent to count on individualised transport means .
Increasing congestion leads to large losses for an economy .
A lot of people stuck in their car are not working and loose time to contribute to growth of GDP .
First steps to integrate the cost of this time loss have been taken in London and Singapure by introducing a congestion charge in city centres .
Therefore , in future it will be more expensive to use cars than to use public transport .

Thirdly , most cars require petrol or oil for their engine .
Considering that the exploitable world oil reserves are not increasing anymore , oil will become more and more expensive , making car driving a luxury .
Furthermore as large amounts of oil reserves are located in the Middle East or in politically unstable countries such as Venezuela it is becoming increasingly dangerous for societies to rely on oil as the engine of their transport means .
This is possibly the strongest argument to move to other tranport means than cars as we know them .

In conclusion , the trends laid out above are providing enough information to suggest that there will be less cars in use twenty years from now .
