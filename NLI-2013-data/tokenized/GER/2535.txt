Do young people enjoy life more than older people ?
Or does age even affect the satisfaction of each individual ?
These are two questions that will be discussed in the following essay .
Several arguments will be presented and evaluated .

First of all , the assumption can be made that younger people , especially in Germany are offered more opportunities than ealier generations could ever experience .
The educational paths provide a large variety to develop oneself and to choose a career that suits one 's interests .
Next to the formation of the academic curriculum , possibilities to create free-time activities are almost endless .
Should this freedom which is offered to the young people however , have an influence on how satisfied they are with their life ?

Older people in contradicition are more limited concerning the above mentioned aspect .
Many did not have the possibility to select their work as well as preferred lifestyle according to their major intersts , due to the second worldwar .
This issue might lead to the fact that they regret that they were not offered such a large amount of opportunities .
Furthermore , health issues might lower the quality of life with increasing age .

I believe that the question should not be if older or younger people enjoy their life more , but rather if age is one of the significant factors that has an influence on overall satisfaction .
In my opinion , not age but rather the optimistic or pessimistic point of view each individual has , decides about his or her quality of life .
This characteristic is absolutely independent of age .
