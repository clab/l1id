There are widespread opinions on the responsibilities and expectations of young people nowadays .
I think that young people today still spend sufficient time helping their communities .
But before beginning the reasoning , `` young people '' and `` helping their communities '' needs to be defined : I consider young people to be teenagers of the age between 13 and 19 years old .
Help in communities comprises activities , such as supporting the elderly , being engaged in municipal politics , playing in a sports club , or spending time with small children during holidays .

Many young people today are engaged in politics to help their communities .
The number of members joining political youth organizations has steadily increased over the last ten years .
When talking to those teenagers , I can see their motivation and enthusiasm to participate in political work .
They are aware that they have a responsibility towards their community and even enjoy this fact .

Secondly , the popularity of sports clubs has never decreased .
Most young people are at least in one club , such as the local soccer , tennis , or track and field team .
Although some sports have seen a decrease in members , other sports have become more attractive .
This can be exemplified by sports like American football , baseball and beach volleyball .

Finally , young people today are aware that social activities are meaningful and even useful for their future life .
Everybody who wants to apply for a job after school knows that these activities are an important part of their resume .
Somebody who has not participated in any social community work is less likely to be an attractive applicant .

Some might object that nowadays young people spend more and more time playing computer or surfing the internet .
However , this objection can be countered by the fact that young people used to watch TV a lot or maybe read books instead .
The argument misses to state how young people in former times helped their communities .

To summarize , the political engagement , the popularity of sports clubs , and the awareness demonstrate that young people nowadays do spend enough time on helping their communities .
