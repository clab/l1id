I guess a lot of people had the same problem : You are reading an article about an impressive building ( like the Pyramids ) and you do not understand how it was build and hot it was able to resist all the time .
In case you understand the idea or concept of the building , you can transfer this knowledge to other buildings .
In addition to that you are able to improve the concept for examble by building higher and better buildings .
Also you keep the facts better in your mind .

In this essay I want to discuss why it is so important to understand concepts and ideas .

Firstly , you can transfer the concept when you understand an idea .
In case you understand why a boot in the water made of wood swims you are also able to understand why a boat made of steal is still able to swim .
Just think of these big super tankers in the atlantic ocean which are crossing the sea .

Secondly , you are able to improve the concept .
In case you are an architect you can build higher buildings when you have understood why high buildings are stable .
Just think of the Eiffel Tower which had for the first time an iron scelleton .
People transfered this knowledge to other buildings and increased the size step by step !

Lastly , by understanding the concept it is easier to keep in mind the facts .
You are then able to understand why diesel engines need less fuel than engines with gas because they use different technics .

From my point of view it is really important to understand the concept of something .
With this understanding you are able to transfer the knowledge to other products or to improve the concept for example by building better products .
Also you can easier remind on the facts by understanding the concept .
