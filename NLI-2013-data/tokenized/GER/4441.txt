This essay refers to the question whether advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

I agree with the statement that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because of the following reasons :

The first reason is that advertisements show only the advantages of the products and ignore the disadvantages .
You do not get complete information about the product , about special conditions and tariffs and about the possibilities of use .
Very often you realize the disadvantages of the products after the act of purchasing and you are disappointed that you cannot use the product in the way you planned it .

The second reason is that advertisements make you think that the advertised product is the best product you can have in this area or subject .
But you do not know if this is the truth because the advertisment does not show you a comparison of prices and features of the advertised product and the competitor 's product .
The aim of advertisements is to make you buy products without thinking and without comparing features and prices .
In my opinion , this aim and this way to sell products violates the principle of self-determination and is morally wrong .

The third reason is that advertisements give you sometimes the feeling that you unconditionally need the product which the advertisement is for - even if you have never thought of this product before and you do not really need it .
The advertisements can produce strong wishes to buy things , but people are not aware that their wish ist caused by advertismenet .
The advertisements try by this method to increase consum and profits for the producing company , but very often you make unnecessary purchases and expenditures because you use the advertised products only once .

The last reason why I think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are is that they are often adressed to children .
Children mostly do not understand the value of money and do not think about the quality of an advertised product .
They just want to have it and ask their parents for this product as long as the parents decide to buy it .
In many cases the parents do not spend any thoughts about quality and price because they want to make their children happy and accepted in the community of other children .
So it is much easier to sell products with low quality if you adress children with the right advertisement .

So in conclusion I believe because of the mentioned reasons that advertisements make products seem much better and useful than they really are .
