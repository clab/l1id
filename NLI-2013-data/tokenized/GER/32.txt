The most people have had this feeling yet : these moments when you think you will never know enough , but it alwayz fascinates us meeting people with knowledge in a wide rabge of domains .
But we also learn over our development that it is often better to concentrate on something to protect ourselves from confusion .

Bz pazing attention to that we can focus on a subject we can reach much better efforts than others because of talents and so on .
This is positive for our selfesteem , beause we know that we can do some things ( it does n't have to be only one thing , but it also cannot be everything ) reallz goos and that differs us from others ina positive way .
Specialize in one spcfic subject has also good outcomes for the society .
Your expertize serves the progress in Science in an amount a broad knowledge could n't reach .

But a personal problem for me is : I 'm a psychology student and I know the themes of psychology are more and more interesting for great enterprises to improve the motivation of their workers and also their security and health .

Today you have to be flexible and also open for new challenges in the different areas what requires a wider rabge of know
