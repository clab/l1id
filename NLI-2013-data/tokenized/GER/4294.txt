The statement at hand expresses a strongly generalized opinion on a nowadays very fervent issue .
It states that young people are disinclined to get involved in their communities .
One must pay special attention to the fact that the statement only concerns a particular group in society , which is defined by age , and disregards any other group .

At first , I want to point out my personal opinion : I do completely agree with the statement at hand .
But for generalization reasons , one must explain why young people behave the way they do .

To utterly comprehend the everyday life of young people and the prodigious amount of stress and challenges a young person faces today , one must view the world through the eyes of a young person :
One might assume that academic achievement and the fulfillment of the need for social interaction are the only two major challenges youth is facing nowadays .
This is , however , slightly superficial .

The competition in times of economic hardship and rising unemployment is tough .
In order to maintain the hope of being able to compete against lots of applicants for all sorts of institutions , one must maintain excellent grades .
This is putting the current generation under severe pressure .

Moreover , there is a growing gap between the individual and his/her parents .
The relationship with one 's family is increasingly troubled , which leads to a loss of love and personal support .
Friends have to compensate for this .

The world of today is fast-moving and seldom is there a moment to settle down comfortably .
Youth has to overcome obstacles which range from suffering support by one 's family to drugs and loss of orientation .
Youth faces much .

Consequently , helping one 's community is not a thing most young people pay particular attention to , because they are overly concerned with much more `` important '' issues .
