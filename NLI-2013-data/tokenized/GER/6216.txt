For writing a comment on a statement it is essential that we provide a description of the actual situation first .
At this time the automotive industry is one of the biggest industries in the world , combining a great number of globally leading companies like Toyota , Daimler-Chrysler and BMW .
The sales figures for cars are still rising , especially in emerging markets like China and India and the forecasts until the next decade do not suggest a shift in this trend .
This extreme market growth is the problem for the several problems we are facing today .
Cars are one of the main reasons for the air pollution in cities and metropolitan areas , infrastructure projects for cars destroy enormous amounts of nature environment and because the car is a vehicle for the individual transport of people , it is not able to deal with the more rapidly increasing world population .

Newest trends in the sector try to establish alternative fuel technologies like hybrid technology or fuel cells to decrease the amount of emissions a car produces and to give the customer a chance to be independent from high gas prices .
In the U.S. the Toyota Prius is selling excellent and this has got one main reason : The people do not want to use public transportation and favor individual transport methods .

This reason is the basement of my personal opinion , that there will not be a significant decrease in the number of used cars in twenty years .
No government would accept a development where the very costly infrastructure for cars gets useless .
Modern and fast public transportation systems are rare and mostly to be find on railways ( ICE , TGV , etc. ) , but the accident of the Transrapid recently showed that the technology of these new rail-transportation methods is unsafe and not capable of being introduced widely in the world .

Instead the car will evolve in a way , which will make it suitable for the conditions it will face in the near future .
The electronic assistents within the car will be 100 percent responsible for the driving and the car will be navigated on the motorways by satellites .
This electronic guided traffic will allow to reduce the spaces between the different cars , providing higher average speed and making it so possible to use the infrastructure at the most efficient way .

So there will not be a significant change in the number of cars within the next twenty years , but the car as a transportation vehicle will definetly redefine itself in the near future .
