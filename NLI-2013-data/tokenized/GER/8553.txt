I defenitly agree that it is more important for students to unterstand the ideas and concepts they have to learn than just to learn facts .
There are different reasons for my opinion and I will point out 3 of them .

The first point , I want to mention is that it is easier to learn and remember things , when you understand what you learn .
For example if you study without understanding the ideas there is the probability to fail in an exam because you are not able to reproduce the problem correctly and you can not be good in tests about transferring different information to a new point of view .
So it is not very useful to learn facts by heart , it is more important to get the whole situation .

Another point is that you should be able to connect diffferent information to understand the whole problem and I think this ability is not improved by learning single aspects of a problem .
Facts can change but the main ideas , for example the theories of Milton Friedman will be true even in ten years .
And you will need these thearies to understand different processes .

My last and most important point is that you learn for life and not for school or university .
That means that the lectures and texts in university are important and the knowledge which you should aquire are necessary to succed later in your job .
University education prepares you for yours tasks later in your work life , but if you just learn stupid facts and do not use the offered knowledge , there is a high probability that you will fail .
You must be able to solve a problem and I do not think that facts and figures will help you at your job .
If you need facts in your job , you can use primary and secondary data , for example to launch a research , which will get you the facts you need .

So all in all I prefer that students should learn complete thories and no single aspects .
On the one hand that is more difficult but on the other hand you will aquire much more timeless knowledge
