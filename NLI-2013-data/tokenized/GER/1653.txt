The question , whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one spefific subject is an issue of controversy .
First , I am going to point out the most important points in favor of having a broad knowlegde of many academic subjects .
In my opinion it is very important to have a reliable basis of general knowledge in many different field of study , in order to be qualified for all upcoming challenges in future life .
Especially in our modern times , one can never be 100 % sure to be able to keep the same job during one 's whole carreer .
This means diversity is what counts today .
People need to be adaptive to new kinds of tasks all the time , which will obviously work best , when they are educated as broadly as possible .

On the other hand , there are also arguments in favor of specialising in one specific subject .
To begin with , I would like to point out that despite the advantages of having general knowlegde in many academic subjectes , this knowledge will always stay at quite a superficial level .
It is simply not possible to get a deeper understanding of many different academic subjects , as each one of them is very complex in itself .
In order to work in a responsible position , i.e. as a doctor in a hospital , the general knowledge is not sufficient .
This implies that at least for responsible professions it is absolutely necessary to specialize in one specific subject .

In addition , human beings are a very diverse species .
Not everybody has the same competencies .
This means that people should be able to specialize in the areas they are interested in and in which they are able to compete .
For example a professional pianist might be very dissatisfied , if he had to go to classes of economics instead of being able to go to more music lessons .

To sum up , there are points in favor of having a broad knowlege in many academic subjects and points that argue in the opposite direction .
In my opinion , a compromise should be found : During the first year at an academic institution the students should be able to gain a broad knowledge of many different fields of study but they should then be allowed to specialize in any area they want to , as Nobdoy should be forced to study a subject they are not interested in .
