Thinking about this statement I come to the conclusion that this statement is actually nonsense and impossible evaluate .
The first problem of this staement is that it is much too broad .
In order to be able to evaluate on the topic one first has to narrow down the age groups in question .
What is meant by `` younger people '' ?
What is meant by `` older people '' ?

If `` younger people '' means children of , for example , 3-5 years of age and `` older people '' means their parents then I fully agree with the statement .
If one has ever observed children in kindergarten they seem to have no worries .
They can play and meet their friends and ususally everthing is taken care of for them by the parents .
The parents , on the other hand , as already implied , have to take care of everything : They have to work in order to be able to buy everything necessary for every-day life , such as food and clothing .

The situation changes when the children get to school .
They have duties to fulfill such as attending the classes and doing thier homework .
This all virtually eats thier time they used to spend for so many other nice things .
Any adult would say now : `` Oh , if I could just go back to school again ! ''
However , it is not about the adults here but about the children 's perception .
In the eyes of children school can be very anoying which leads to them not enjoying their life as much as they used to .
To which degree they do not enjoy it cannot be answered here .
It cannot be answered , either , whether they enjoy it more or less than adults .
This is dependent on many more factors , probably most importantly personal perception .
It is in everyone 's own view whether one enjoy 's life or not .
Measuring and comparing joy is rather impossible .
Thus , generalizations should be avoided , also because each age group has own worries as well as each society .
Children as well as their parents in Europe have to worry about different things than children in Africa , for example .
A proof for which age group in which society is the happiest one is probably impossible to produce - if it was , the result would probably be rather astonishing .
