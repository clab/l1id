I disaggree with this staement .
In my opinion both , understanding ideas and concepts and studying facts , are important .

Understanding ideas and concepts are very important for students because if they just learn facts they would n't understand them when it comes to more detailed topics .
For example studying foreign languages at school .
Students can practise their vocabulary and the grammar just by learning them in their mind ( the facts and rules ) but it does n't help them when they need to read or actually speak in that language .
There you need ideas or concepts which the teacher can give you to learn that language more easily .

Moreover students need to study praxis .
With facts they can not learn them .
At this points you need concepts and ideas .
For example in a Math class .
The teacher can teach you some facts and rules about a specific topic but without his or her ideas students are not able to understand that topic .
They need to practice the topic by themselves to make sure that they actually understood the sheme of the topic .

On the other hand it is also important to study some facts .
The subject history could n't be taught without facts .
Students need to study special dates , for example about the world wars , to understand the timeframe and to get a feeling of the past .

Furthermore I think that you usually need to get some facts first before you can start to get some ideas or concepts .
The best example at this point is again the mathslesson .
You need to read some facts or proofs first before you can get into the topic .
In my mathlessons we usually had to read first a page with facts and examples before our teacher explained everything a little bit more detailed .

All in all I am of the opinion that students need to understand ideas and concepts on the one hand and on the other hand I believe that it is important as well that they study some facts .
