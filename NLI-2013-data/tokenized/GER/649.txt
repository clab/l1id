The following argumentation is about if it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Today everyone dreams about to have a very broad knowledge and wants to know everything , but is it always helpful ?

I think it is very important to learn or to know a lot of different things , which give you a basic knowledge about how the world works .
I think that the people have to know that for example in history the important facts like when the first World War was and who Stalin was and where the industrilisation started and so on .
But in addition people should know about mathematics , geography , their own languages , too .
I think people should be able to handle with mathematic problems and should know the grammare of their language .
But it is no use to know from every single subject just a little piece .
It is better to specialize yourself when you want to work , because work always needs a specific subject .
For instance when you want to be a professeur for history , you have more to know than only the questions about who was Stalin .
Than it is important to know that he was a dictator of the ancient Russia and that he wanted to make a communistic area out of the world after marxism .
If you want to practise a specific work , the result is that you have to specialize you , because you have to know all backgrounds in order to do your best in your work .
But I think , if you want to communicate with other peoples it is verz embarrasing if you do not know about some usual facts , which are a basic knowledge for everything you do .
Imagine that a stranger comes to for example Germany ans ask you how many regions Germany have after its reunification and you could not answer him .
That would be very poor .
I think everone has to know that Germany has 16 regions .
That is a fact .

So , all in all I would say first one should know about the basic facts of many academic subjects and than he or she should specialize him or her in one specific subject in order to work later .
I would do it like this .
