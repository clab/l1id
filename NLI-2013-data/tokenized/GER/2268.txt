Some people say that young people have more fun in life than the elderly .
In my opinion these people are absolutely right in saying that .
Besides of body weakness and deseases their are a number of reasons why young people have more possibilities to really enjoy life .

Although already mentioned in the introduction , I want to underline the importance of physical fitness once again .
Not only that older peole are far more often sick , their bodies are just not functionning the way young bodies do .
This is examplified in sports .
In my opinion sports are very important for the quality of one 's life .
There is no denying the fact , that the elderly do not perform as well in sports as younger people .
One can see this in professional sports .
It happens rarely that a person older than 35 is playing soccer in German Bundesliga .
Moreover old people often have to quit doing sports because of physical problems .
Another aspect regarding physical fitness is the time of recovering after a desease or an injury .
It just takes far more time for older people to recover completely .

An addional important advantage of young people is that they still have so many things to experience .
Young people can learn every day new things .
Not only in an educational way .
The youngers have a lot more opportunities to get to know new friends .
People in that age connect much easier .

Furthermore as a young person one does not have as many commitments .
Old people are often settled and living a very organized life .
In contrast , young people can decide to study and live abroad for a certain time - or forever - without having to discuss this with a wife and children .
You are just more independant .

To come to a conclusion , I am very happy being young .
I still have the opportunity to enjoy my life as much as possible .
This does not mean that I am affraid of getting older .
I just think that I have to do certain things now as I will not be able to do them later - when I am one of the elderly .
