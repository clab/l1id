It may be a rel problem , if young people do not feel responsible for their social environment .
But it remains the question , if this is really the fact .
One might think , that teenagers only want to spend a good time , and therefore they tend to neglegt their social tasks , which everybody who lives in a society has to fulfill .
They are to much occupied in having fun with some friends or lerning for school or univesity .
Therefore it would be important to give more incentives or commitements to the young people to help their communities .

But in my opinion this is not the fact at all .
I think that there are several ways somebody can contribute to a community and I think a lot of youg people do so .
This is because there are some activities which are likely to be made , that means there are cases , where helping is n't only work , but instead of this also a lot of fun .
Thus , helping in the community can sometimes be seen as a hobby , where one can gather experience for his life .
It is also possible to meet some friends while working , or also to get to know new friends .

As an example , I would think about the work in the teenage section of a political party .
On the one hand the positve work of such groups indicate a benefit for the community , on the other hand it is also a great opportunity to lern about the life .
So for interested teenagers , this is a good option , which is n't only theoretical , but can also be found in the reality .

Furthermore , there are several young people who start as trainers in the local sports teams .
It is often the case , that they do this , because there is a younger family member in a team , which they want to support , but obviously they thereby help others as well .
In cases like this , one teenager can follow his own hobby and by the way he is able to do a good job either in the family and the society .

Of course one has to be aware of the fact , that although there is plenty of kids who help in their community , there are always some others who do nothing like that .
But I think it is unfair to say that everbody spends too less time for helping others , because it 's always worth mentioning the helpful ones as well .
And of course there are lot of teenagers like that .
