I agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than a very good knowledge on only one subject .
I think that if you got a broad knowledge , you will know what people mean when they talk aboute a topic you have heared aboute , even if you dont know much aboute it .
You are not focused on your special subject tho whole time .
You can free your mind , you are open for new things .
Although the knowledge of only one subject , your special subject , offers good abilities for you , i prefer knowing less things aboute many subjects .
Later you also got the chance to become a specialist in your subject , you can still sharp your skills , but at the biginning you should be ready and be prepared for things who can happen to you .
Maybe you then go on with subjects , you did n't know some years before .

For example , if you have got no job and you are looking for one you have a big space to seach for it and you might can get a job which you did n't expected .
If you are just a specialist in you subject , you might find faster a job , but only about you main knowledge .
It will be very boring for you to do just the same thing your whole life .

I think so , because this is what happened to my father .
He first sharped his doctorial skills , because he wanted to become a doctor , but he also studied law .
Now he is a laywer .
This shows me that you have to be prepared for abilities you might get , but to do so you have to have a broad knowledge about many subjectcs , including academics .
This is necessary to have a good and not boring job in the future .
