According to this topic I can neither agree nor disagree .
On the one hand young people have a lot of energy for instance they can dance through the whole night or go in for every kind of sports they like .
Regularly they do not have physical problems and they know that they have lots of life-time .

But on the other hand they are often struggeling with themselves .
First love , future and a lack of experience etc. are difficulties in their lives .
Personally I am often so worried about my future , my job perspectives and so on that I can not sleep in the evening .

Older people are more experienced .
Although they have got problems , too , they mostly take them easier .
They know life goes on .
That is why they see the things differently and can enjoy other things than younger people .
After years of good and bad times they can analyze situations in another way .

If your are young you want to change the world , you are thinking about the big things .
When you are getting older your values change .
My mother is a good evidence for this .
She told me that went on parties as she was younger and that this was her way of enjoying life .
But today she enjoys staying at home with the family , she enjoys cooking and playing with my little cousins .

Maybe older people think more positive about life and to my mind that is a sign for life quality .
Maybe older and younger people have just another way of enjoying life , but neither younger nor older people enjoy life more like the other group .
So personally I feel that it is impossible to decide wheather young or old people enyoy life more .
Especially the fact that I am young makes it impossible .
So I have to become older and maybe then I will be able to answer this question in a better way .
