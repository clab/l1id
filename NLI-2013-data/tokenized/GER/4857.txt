In our daily life we encounter advertisement frequently .
It starts by listening to the radio in the morning , continues on our way to school and does not end until we switch of the tv or computer at night .
Advertisment - that is so many things : billboards , tv spots , commercials and so on .
And the reasons for it ?
Well there are two significant reasons : for one thing to inform about a product but first and foremost to attract customers to buy the product .

In my opinion the majority of advertisements make their product seem prior to its actual status , but in our time of life it seems like it has to be like that .

I am aware of the huge number of products there are for any purpose anyone could have .
So therefore I can understand the marketing agents , when they try to get just a little attention for their product .
Suggerating an impossible result seems like a well-working marketing tool - if the buyers can take it with some humor .
Red Bull for example : The drink is supposed to help you to be able to fly .
Obviously , consumers know that this promise is over the top , but when this drink first came to market I also thought this idea was funny and I tried the drink .
Or take the example of the Snickers bar .
In a recent tv spot the producers claimed that this chocolate bar would give anyone who ate it magical super powers .
Of course this is not true , but it is a humorous way to attract attention .

The only time I think this kind of marketing strategy is not appropriate is for medical supplies .
In my opinion medical supplies , like special technical appliances or medicine ( prescription drugs ) should only state the features of the product that it truly has .
Otherwise it would be life-threatning .

To sum up I can say that most advertisements make their product seems better than it actually is .
But in my opinion everyone should , if he or she is not sure of what the product is really about , get more information and get aware of possible hazards .
