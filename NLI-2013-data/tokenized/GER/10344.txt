Trying new things and taking risks can sometimes make a person more successful rather than doing what they alredy know .
However , there are times this can have the opposite effect .

Firstly , I would like to mention why this statement can be true at some times .

People who have learned how to do a job and gained working experience have the choice to just keep doing what they learned or takeing risks .
This means for instance that they come up with a new idea or try to change the way things are .
Due to this his boss , customers or other people on whom his job depends , become focused on him and he differs from everybody else .
If these new things are good , he will most likely be promoted or the customers want to work with him again .
The same is true when deciding to open a buisness by himself .
He could become the owner of a flourishing company when taking this risk .
In all those occasions it is important to try new things and take risks in order to become successful .
However , there are other situations in life .

Now I would like to point out the problems of taking risks in some areas of life .

Risks can develop into a problem while attending school or college .
Often one is expected to answer in a specific way and not to invent new ways .
There it is good to do what one knows how to do well .
Moreover , it is better not to take any risks while studying for a test or exam .
The consequences might be severe , depending on the risk that has been taken .
For instance , steeling the answers for a quiz , a great risk , might end with beeing disqualified and getting the worst grade possible .

In conclusion I would like to point out that one always has to evaluate the risk with the possible outcome and how this consequence might be achieved in a different way .
