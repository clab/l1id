I think it is both important , to learn ideas and concepts as well as facts .
But as more valuable I would consider the learning of ideas and concepts .
Learning facts is very usefull if you want to attend a quiz show or if you take a test to be admittet at a college or university .
These test often just ask questions on facts , but people like me are not able to keep these facts .
If I just learned facts in school , I would be pretty stupid , because I am not able to keep it , I just forget it again .
I do not mean to it but I just can not help it .
Wheread if I leraned concepts and ideas I would know much more .
Facts are less important .
If you remember facts you do not have a conection to other topics , for example if you learn that the world war ended in 1945 what does it tell you ?
Not much , only that it enden in 1945 , but if you learn what causes the war to end and what happend after the war you learn much more .
You can make connections to other countries , for example what happend there after the end of the war .
You would be able to relate these effects of the war to other wars and draw conclusions from it .
If a new war starts you may be able to tell what happends when it ends again , just because you learned these concepts in school .
But like I said above it is also important to know some facts .
Everybody should know when the world war begann and ended , but it just should not be paid so much attention to it .
Especially these admiting test should give more importance to the ability of drawing conclusions from an event than recalling the fact of it .

To come to a conclusion I would say it is more important to learn ideas and concepts rather than facts , they should just be supportive .
