In the following I will try to discuss the statement and show examples in addition to my arguments .

First of all , we got to make sure that advertising products is a very important factor in todays economical competition .
The advertiser has to advertise the product , because in the competition of the market there will be a lot of similar products and much more that are alike .

The better the product is advertised , the more people will buy it .
The advertisement has to be as funny , as inventive , as surprising , as basic as possible depending on the target group .

Usually the advertisement tries to focuss the people 's interest on the product .
Of course the product is allways presented in the best light and the weaknesses are hidden , but the people now have the possibility to get information on the product and in todays media there are many ways .
There are papers on allmost every topic , from car to plants in your garden .
The internet provides an amount of product tests and mostly the product is just a better form of a former product , that should already known .

Because of these possibilities of informing oneself , I think it is not the fault of the advertisement if someone is disappointed about a product .

But sometimes you get the feeling that the producer has spent more time on the advertisement than on the product itself .
Only at this point , I think I can agree with the statement .
But developing a bad product and only focussing on the advertisement will be discovered soon by the users and affect the sales of the product badly .

Therefore I think it 's not in the interest of the company to bring bad products on the market and cut there own skin .

Lastly , it is very important to be aware that advertisment is a necessary part of a product circle and in that context I can not agree with this statement .
