The issue at hand is whether one should try new things and therefore put something at risk , or just stick to areas one already has experience in .
In times of globalization , economies develop at an enormous pace - people do have even less time to , for example , invent new theories or machinery .
Otherwise they will not be able to compete successfully in a globalized economy .
Thus , it is important to always explore new areas , in order to remain competitive .

I am strongly convinced that research is one of the essential keys to success for many industries - research can open new , fascinating oportunities that will help your company to be successful .
However , research relies on moving into fields that have not yet been explored .
In order to invent something remarkably new , people always have to think one step further .
If one company tries to keep to its roots and therefore avoids beeing progressive , failure will not wait long .

Moreover , getting an insight into new , unexplored areas is not only useful but also highly interesting - not only for researchers themselves but also for customers who steadily are longing for new technologies in all fields of industry .
People are used to , to always have something newer and better than their neighbours - if this competition ended , people would loose one of their main goals in live .
Therefore , companies do have the task to satisfy their customer 's needs , by exploring new technologies , if they want to remain successful .

I am of the opinion that taking a certain risk , to some extend , is n't even evitable .
A risk-free life is not imaginable to me , due to the fact that you have to take decisisons repeteadly , without knwoing what comes out .
People who are not able to make any decisions at all will definetly not have a good job , a satisfying life and and therefore will definetly not feel happy .

To sum up , not only companies but also individuals - so to speak , everybody - need to take a certain risk , if they want to be successful .
