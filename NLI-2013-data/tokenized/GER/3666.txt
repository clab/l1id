I think the topic of having enough time to help communities when you are young is complex and controversial .
While some people argue that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , I think , however , that young people do give a tremendous amount of time their communities .
My position is based on several reasons .

First of all , young people who are growing up in a community have already tight connections to several members of the community .
For instance , I grew up in a relatively small community .
My grandparents and parents have already taken over responsibilities in the community .
So , it became natural to me to be part of this community , to learn from adults on how to interact in a community , whom to ask for help .
For example , when I was fifteen I asked one member who was the librarian of our community , if I can work in the library to earn some money .
So I already was part of the community when I was a teenager and invested my time , although this was rewarded .

Secondly , I increased my time spending on helping our community after I experienced that being part of the community is also beneficial in situations where you need good friends .
For instance , as my grandfather died , our whole family got support from our community .
Although this was more a kind of emotional support is was really helpful to know that other people do take care of my familiy and me .

This experience motivated me to further take over responsibilities in the community .
Even if the impact of these responsibilities sometimes seems to be small , people perceive them as helpful .
For example I used to buy bread for our old neighbour on Sundays .
Seeing me on Sundays was a highlight of her lonely day .

Furthermore , all my friends at my age are in some manner connected with our community .
They are also working in their leisure time for the community .
We are a kind of big family and everyone takes care of each other .

Nevertheless , some people might object that young people tend to sit in front of their computers or to have parties all the time .
But from my experience I can say that my friends do also use their computers , we do have parties , but we also include our charity work in the community in our daily routine .

In conclusion , based on my experiences and background I am convinced that at least a lot of young people nowadays give a huge amount of time to helping their communities , thus improving the live of other community members .
