I agree with the statement , that young people do not give enough time helping their communities .
An article in a German magazine said , that today we live in a world of interships .
Whenever you have free time , you have to spend it sensible , which means by spending it in a way , that it looks good on your curriculum vitae .
Working in your community , helping old people for example , might look good on your CV because by that you can show your social skills .
But if that community work is senseless for your further professional life , you will not do it bacause there is no use for you .
That is how it works today .
Everything you do has to have a sense for your own future .
So if you want to proof your social skills , you would probably prefer picking out an internship or any other service , that is more linked with your future working goal .

One reason for this way of deciding , what to do , is competition .
In my opinion we live in a world of competition .
Not only in school or university , everyone is competing , whether it concerns your schoolmarks or your ability to make new friends .
Everything is a question of competition .

If you plan to work in your community in the future , helping your community is a possibility of raising your chance of getting a job later .
But because of competing against everybody around you , it is kind of out of fashion just to help somewhere out without getting a piece of paper , that says what you have done .

Maybe there are some people , who help their community without expecting to get a document afterwards but I think , this might only be few .
Further there might be persons who would like to hepl , but do not have the time to do so because of their professional life for example .

Helping in fact means , doing something without a reward .
Nobody I know has the time left to do something without getting a reward .

So I guess there are quite a lot of different reasons , wheather it is their profession , their goals or their opinion by not wanting to help their community because people think , nobody would help them , there are not many people left who actually help their community .
And I do not believe , that the number of people , who are willing to help will increase in the future .
