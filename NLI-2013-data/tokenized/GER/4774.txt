The modern media and entertainment business has reached a level of which you can very easily reach a majority of the population , not only in your home country , but throughout the world .
Today not only newspapers , radio and television are the options to choose from , but for almost a decade now the internet has evolved to a new mass media platform , where anyone can communicate anything he likes around the world .

Thesedays a commercial does its best in trying to sell you a product in thirty seconds or less .
In these few seconds , the creators of such commercials are not just a few people , but huge multibillion dollar companys , with an entire market analysis section , concentrated on selling just one product and finding out the best way to convince you of buying something you do n't really need .

In order to achieve this goal , you need to push the boundaries of your product to a maximum .
If , for example you have a simple , small device , which can play music , you will not sell it as a device with which you can hear music , but you will try to create a personality for this item .
Current techniques are iconizing a product .
The best example at the moment is the Ipod from Apple .
It is not anylonger just a product , but an absolute `` must have accessory '' like a cellphone .
In order to make this accessory attractive , you have celebrities carry it with them and music videos in which it appears and to put it simple , create a nice packaging around it .

The same counts for the fashion industry .
Even if you have the new , landmark setting , groundbreaking couture collection , it still is just clothes .
With the media , press and the right influential people , you can boost this collection to something more than just clothes .
An older Porsche commercial stated : `` A Porsche is a car that nobody needs , but everybody wants '' .

In conclusion ; yes , most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .
Since people are becoming evermore used to the tricks commercials use , advertising companys look everywhere to find ways of selling a product as effectively as possible .
In conclusion advertisements often can achieve the opposite and get very annoying .
These can still not be critized , since we live in a consume based society and there is no indication that this will change in the future .
