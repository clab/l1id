Today , it is enough for a lot of students to learn facts about certain issues and topics only .
In my opinion it is not enough to learn facts only .
A student has to focus on how to understand an idea and a concept .

First of all , a student should understand an idea to build up his own opinion .
He gathers ideas of several people and tries to make up his own mind .
Understanding the idea gives the student oppurtunities like duscussing about it and create other ideas .

Another important point is the understanding of a concept .
When a student understands a concept he can transfer this pattern to other issues and compare and contrast them or add information .

Also , he can modify different things which he does n't like about it .
Learning facts does n't give students the possibility to consider whether a fact is good or not .
He just learns it and doesnt even think about it .
In contrast , understanding ideas and concepts allows a student to discuss and talk about it because he has enough information about a topic .
Beside this , a fact is not modifyable that means that a student might talk about it but he ca n't add information .

A fact represents statistics or particular issues which ca n't help students to transfer ideas or concepts on other things .
Understanding ideas and concepts make it possible to spread out your knowledge on other fields .
For example , a student should be able to use the ideas and concepts , which he learned during the lessons , to create other sentecnes in a exam .
