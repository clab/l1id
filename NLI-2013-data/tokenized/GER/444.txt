During the education , the studies and even when deciding for a job , people are often put in front of an important question : Is it better to get very deep into one specific subject or to keep a more broad mind .
There are several arguments supporting both sides .

On the one hand , the amount of knowledge and information is getting always bigger nowadays because of the internet and the globalisation .
So if you want to work on a special topic and produce or design products or even develope new technologies , it is very important to really understand this topic .
And because of the enormous amount of information mentioned before , one has to specialize in this single subject .

On the other hand most inventions and developments made today , are just a part of a bigger system .
So after inventing and producing very special elements , there have to be people who do not neccesarily understand every detail of this element , but who know how to put them together to one big and working system .
They have to keep all aspects in mind and they also must know where to look if something does not work .
Very specialized peole would have no chance here , because they only understand their own component .
So broad minded people are needed .

Another point is that people speciaized in one single subject often have very big problems when communicating with other people specialized in a different subject , because they know nothing about it .
Here broad minded people are very helpful to connect members of different subjects because they have enough knowledge in both areas .

Finally one also has to see the situation out of a very pragmatic point of view .
If you have to leave the company you are working in because it goes bankrupt or whatever , you will have to look for a new job and of course the chances to get employed in a new company is much bigger if you can work in a broad field , than if you only can do one specific work .

Taking everything into consideration , I have to say that nowadays , specialists are very important in our society .
But people with a broad knowledge of different acadenic subject are definetly needed and at least as important as specialists .
