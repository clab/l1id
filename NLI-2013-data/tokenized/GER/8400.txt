I do completely agree with this statement .

In my opinion , necessities of higher education have changed tremendously in the past 50 years .
As human knowledge exploded during this period of time , requirements for higher educations changed as well .

Today , because the amount of information available is so enormously big , nobody can be able to know everything any more .
It has become more important to learn how to find facts at the moment they are required than in fact knowing them by heart .
Nearly all information is available at any place and any time on the internet , so the problem has changed from having a certain piece of information to finding it .

Schools and University cannot teach all facts , even just in a small field , any more .
They can , in my opinion , only supply an overview and basic knowledge on their field of studies .
Any further information is just to be found and immediately used when required .

As everything becomes more intrepid and complicated , I find it important to develope a certain specialisation on a very particular , small field of knowledge to be successful .
Therefore , I need to understand basic ideas and concepts of all the concerns and issues , my subjects and job requires .
But the factor that makes me really valueable for my employer , for example , is the individual , very precise knowledge I have on a certain field , which I can , of course , integrate in greater circumstances by my basic knowledge of the subject I 'm working on .

This is why I think the statement is completely right .
I would even go further and state that it gets also more important to individualise one 's education independently , as I described above .
Private studies others than the ones offered at universities , schools and by employers will become as important as the classical ones considered as higher education .
But for studying these , the understanding of ideas and concepts will be the main issue .
