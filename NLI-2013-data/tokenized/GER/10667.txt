I really aggree with this statement .
To my mind , it is necessary for success to walk on new ways .
This is the only opportunity to solve and to get along with problems in a successfull way .

The first point to mention why I think that the statement above is correct is that people who only repeat their normal way of life do not focus on alternative sollutions .
They have their known scheme to solve problems in their daily life .
This might be for them a satisfying opportunity to live and to relax in their personal sphere .
But this relaxation is the point why they are not successful as other people are .

You have to take risks and to try new things to reach the level of success .
Your personal experiences and your knowledge make you understand the world and to react in several daily situations .
But success is the product of knowledge and looking forward .

Risk is an essential element of looking forward .
Only by braking out of your normal life you can discover new perspectives in your job and your private area .
To make it clear , I am not in the opinion that somebody should risk his life every day .
`` Risk '' means to go an alternative way .
A way , you wont go by reflecting only on your experiences .
You can for example look for a new job when it offers more chances for your career .
People should not only look on the money they can earn in their professions .
They should more reflect on their career opportunities .

Let us talk about a young business man .
He can open another coffee shop near the central station , the third in the street , or he can develop a fundamental new concept of selling goods .
The research work before may be cost intensive and can be a risk .
But when he has established a new product or a new selling method he is the only one having this advantage .
This is a way of success .

I think every person is curious from the birth to death .
But the experiences we collect during our lifes make us a bit tired .
To my mind , People who save this curiosity are more successfull than other .
Children try more .
They risk more .
This is the reason why they are so successfull in growing up in a relatively short period of time .

You can only be successfull by thinking different .
