Over the past centuries , pedagogues all over the world have been discussing whether it is more effective for students to understand ideas and concepts or to learn the facts about things .
This debate has not been won by one side or the other and one can only state a personal preference on it .
Personally , I think that a child or student will gain more from understanding ideas and concepts and from being able to apply this knowledge than by a mere memorisation of facts .

To learn facts often means to memorise something written in a textbook or something heard during a lecture .
But how effective can this process be ?
Will it enable the student to apply what s/he has learned ?
I do not think that this is the case .
I went to University in Italy where the school ( and university ) system is still based on memorisation and in my experience , students there will learn facts , memorize them until their exam is due and then forget about them .
In most of the cases , they were not able to apply what they have learned .
An example : they were very good in the subject of English grammar , knew the difference between all four German cases , but when it came to speak English or German , they would not be able to pronounce a correct phrase .

The learning of facts can often be very boring .
The student has to concentrate to memorize something s/he might not even understand ; often it is a theory that s/he can not relate to .
To learn the facts is important because it gives the student necessary background information , but it is much more fun for a student to discover some facts for him/herself .
In a kindergarden class , the kids would definitely be more interested to have a frog in their classroom , to observe the animal and learn about it this way than by reading about it in a textbook .
They would understand much better what the teacher is talking about if they can experience it in person .

Of course it is important to learn facts .
But in my opinion it is a traditional , rigid way of learning that often does not respect the inborn curiosity of ( young ) students .
Like in many other cases , a mixture between both theories would be a good solution .
First , the facts should be told .
Then ideas and concepts should be understood by the student , so that s/he can apply what s/he has learnt earlier .
After all , life is not just about facts , but about the ideas and concepts that lay beneath these facts as well .
