Although I understand people who think that young people nowadays do not spend enough time on helping their communities my experiences led me to disagree with this statement .
Nevertheless , there are reasons to believe that this statement is true .
Young people nowadys are often afraid of remain jobless after finishing university .
As a result they spend all their time on preparing themselves for their professional life .
For example , most of my fellow students spend a lot of time on making internships , so there is no time left to voluntarily participate community activities .
Further more the people in our society are getting older and older whereas the government has less money to spend on social services .
Consequently , there is a need for young people who give time to help their community , especially in homes for the elderly .

On the other hand giving time to help the community where you live in , can however be important for your professional life .
In spite of the fact that you are not dealing with the topics of your study while working , for example , in home for the elderly it might make a good impression of your social engagemant if you apply for a scholarship .
A lot of students know this and therefore it is often the case that students engage voluntarily in community projects .
Furthermore there are a lot of people in my social environment who are really interested in politics and the development of our society .
As a result they participate in local political projects or in one of the existing political parties , which means that they also give time to their community .

In view of the fact that I know a lot of young people who engage in their community my conlusion is that it is not true that young people do not give enough time to help their community .
