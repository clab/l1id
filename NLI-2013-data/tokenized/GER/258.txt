Knowing and learning facts is important , but it is not everything that is necessary to live a successful life .
The statement `` It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts. '' is absolutelly correct .

What advantage do I have , if I can name all presidents of the US , or if I know all distances from the Earth to the planets if I do not know how to use this knowledge or where to refer it to .
Factual knowledge , in my opinion , is simply usefull in quiz shows .

On the other hand , if a student understands the idea and the concept of a problem , he or she is going to succeed .
If the student understands the problem or the idea , he or she will be much more likely to solve it .
Factual knowledge may only underpin the action but it is not going to lead to a solution .

An other aspect stating the importance of the understanding of ideas and concepts , is the fact , that those students will remember things easier , because they are able to refer it to a specific topic .
They may also be able to use this earned knowledge on other things and be able to understand those things faster .

By understanding ideas and concepts it will be much easier for them to remember facts , without even pointing them out as facts .
As an example , let 's have a closer look on two students taking a history test .
One student has simply studied the facts , has learnd the years and the events , but does n't know how those events connect and refer to each other .
It will be hard for this student to answer a question that asks to summarize or give an own opinion about their actions .
The other student on the other hand , focuses more on the `` why-questions '' , such as why did they do this or why did it end like this .
Even if he does not remember the exact years , he will be able do answer difficult questions because he knows how everything is related to each other .
It will be easy for this student to settle back in this time and act accuratively .

Taking everything into account , I think that students who understand the ideas and concepts will remember facts automatically , because they are able to refer them to something they are familiar with .
Those students who simply learn facts , are most likely to forget them as soon as the test , etc. is over .
And in my opinion , that is not the goal .
The goal for each student should be to understand the ideas and concepts and remember them as long as possible .
