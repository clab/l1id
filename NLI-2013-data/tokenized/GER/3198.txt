There are many possibilities for young people to help their communities .
They could engage in policies , give sports lessons , take part in the Red Cross or be active in their church .
But , in fact , there are quite few people who actually do some of these things .

What are the reasons for this ?
One point could be that young people feel little responsibility for their community .
They have to think so much about themselves , about how to plan their life and how to organize their career , that thinking about others seems not to fit in .
They just live according to the sentence `` If everybody thinks of themselves , it is thought of everybody '' .
One should not call all of them unfair , some of them are simply overwhelmed by all the things they have to manage in their own life , so that they cannot concentrate on others .
And for some of them there simply is not much time to engage for other things than for school or for university .
Many students I know have to work very hard to be successful in their field of study , so that there is only little time to concentrate on other things .
The time they have , they prefer using to meet friends or just to relax .

On the other hand , not engaging in ones community is , of course , very comfortable .
Knowing that there are people who do the work makes many people think : `` Well , why me if they do it so well ? ''

And one may not forget that for many people there is not much that they regard to be worth to engage for .
Most young people in our society live quite well , they have chances for their future , the society they live in is shaped by a stable democracy .
Why fighting or engaging for something if everything seems alright ?

Another point I consider to be influencing is , that many young people would like to engage in their communities , but they just do not know how or who to ask .
Perhaps approaching students and proposing possibilities would make them think about getting active in their community .

On the other hand , one should not forget all the young people who really sacrifice much time and nerves to serve their communities .
There are always people engaging in a school or in different clubs who offer their talents and also their time for so many other people .

So one should not forget to regard the stament in an appropriate way .
