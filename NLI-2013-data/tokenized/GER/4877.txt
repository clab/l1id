First I would measure that I agree with tihs statement .
A great number of advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I would give two examples to explain my opinion :
A good example you can find in politics .
Next to an election the politicians show their programm and everyone of them emphasize that his programm is the best and solve all of the problems the nation has .
It 's like a competition .
The advertisement visualize the programms , send some television spots and organize big public events to present the candidats of the election .

But when the election is over most time the winners ca n't solve the problems .
The national economy do n't grow up and there will be not creating a new street through the town .
The people will experience that all that big competition was a fake .

An other example are television spots for a kind of product , for example furniture , cars , food , and so on .
When the producers make the television spot they use big lights and there are people in the spot who looks very good .
The purpose is , that they would take the product in a `` goog light '' .
Food appears very healthy and the car is blinking in the spot .
The consumer see that spot and is really exited to buy this product .
I can say this about my behaviour , too .

Last week , for example , I saw a spot about a new coffee taste .
The next day I 've run to the supermarket and I 've looked about the product .
In front off I see that the coffee cinsists sugar and that you have to put it in water to drink it .
Thus I realised that the advertisement had done the best to make the product seem much better than it really is .

In assumption I can say that we have to really pay caution every day , that we do n't are
