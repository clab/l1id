As education is one of the most important sources to build a strong workforce , and western countries depend on their people as a resource , the concept how students learn is discussed in ongoing debates .
Some argue , students should focus on facts and learn the important past events by heart , while others claim to understand ideas and to have the posibility to make transfers of different concepts is of more value .
However both is im

Today , we are living in a changing world .
That what might be true today , does not have to be true tomorrow .
Therefore , adaptation and flexility are very important skills .
If students were to learn only facts , which could easily looked up in the library or the internet , they do not learn any unique skills .
As well these facts might be proven to be wrong , if not tomorrow than the day after .
To build all ones knowledge on facts is not very secure , neither provides it the confidence one needs to be successful in this world .

Anyway , I believe it is important to teach students some basic facts in different subjects like maths or history .
A lot of theories are based of these facts and one could only understand them when the facts are known .
The theories a students should learn during his educational life found in a great deal on the layed down facts .
Therefore it would be the wrong approach to leave out the facts completely of a student 's curriculum .

Having build a stong basis with the most important facts , the education should furtheron focus on the concepts .
students should learn what history has learnd the human race , what the backgrounds of certein decisions have been , and furthermore how this can be transferred into our present or even into the future .
To understand the idea behind the constitution of the US , explains how the Americans became to what they are today .
Understanding and adapting is far more important than knowing the exact date of the signature of the constitution .
This could be found within one minute by searching in the internet .
To be able to explain consequences and to infere possible results is only possible if one understood the idea behind .

To come to a conclusion , the question is not whether education should only be based on facts or on understanding complex ideas , but how to bring both in the best way together to prepare the generation of the future for there daily tasks .
To know facts is the basis to draw the interdependences between situations or people .
To know when leads to the question why , and this drives our world into tomorrow .
