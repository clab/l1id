Yes , i defenetly agree with that statement .
I 'm finishing my studies for mediadesign in Berlin and during them i got some informations from different advertising agencies .
If we take a model for example , which will be on the next `` vogue '' cover ( a fashionmagazin ) , so she or he , the model will be the product for this magazin-cover at this time .
This magazin wants to sell any kind of image , so the model has to look pretty , modern or somehow , so the people who work in these advertisment agencies are going throught a pictures which any photographer have shoten and they are working over it , sometimes even days , so if the model on the picture has for example a spot in the face , it will be removed in the computer , by programms like photoshop , which make it possible .
Even me , a student who often designs brochures and invitations have to make some pictures looking better than they really are , like the lights , the colors , contrasts etc .
So i can unerstand why these advertisments are doing that .
Pictures or Objects in general will be caught by our eyes first , so if there is a banana on a poster in a busstation for example , we ca n't really smell it , but we can see it and if there is a banana which is looking green , as they often do at the beginning , we will maybe not buy this brand , but if you imagine a banana on the picture that has a beautifull strong yellow color , we as human beings would think in our mind `` this banana , that is from jamaica , semms to be tastefull , i guess banana from this brand are qualitativ , healthy and good '' .
This is how we normally think , but of course there can be a lot of disappointments of it , after bying these advertised products .
