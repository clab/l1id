There is an enthusiastically held discussion taking place at the moment at my university in Heidelberg .
Students and professors are discussing if it would be better to have a more broad knowledge or if it is preferable to specialize during the studies .
I think that a specialization is better .

One of the reasons why I think it is better to specialize is the professional career .
People with higher qualification in a certain area usually earn more money than unskilled or semi-skilled workers .
The higher your qualification , the higher your sallary .
I study translation and I know that only translators with a specialization in a special area , like engineering , accounting or medecine , have the opportunity to find a job and earn some money .

The second reason why I am in favour of specialization is self-confidence .
I have made the experience that I am becoming much more self confindent when I have the feeling of being an expert in something .
Translation is a good example again .
Only if I have learnt all the necessary vocabulary and all the grammar rules I feel competent and able to do my job appropriately .

Another reason to specialize is the life-long learning aspect .
If I once have a certain kowledge I should continue to learn , and this is true for my whole life .
If an engineer , for instance , needs to work in a foreign country he can still learn the appropriate language .
But first of all , he needs to be an engineer .
He still has enough time to learn additional competences when he needs them .

I am absolutely convinced that it is wright to continue with my translation studies before I switch over to learn anything else .
I am sure that this is the right way in order to earn my own money after university and to feel self-confident in my everyday life .
In addition , I can still learn things in other scientific fields when I have my university degree .
But to earn this degree is the most important task for me at the moment .
