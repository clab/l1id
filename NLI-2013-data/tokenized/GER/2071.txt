In my view young people enjoy life more but moreover in an other way .
Three arguments are on my mind why I am able to sign this statement .

In the first place young people do have much more free time .
While young people are normally finished around 5ish with school , adults have to work longer .
Furthermore young poeple have more holidays and are free on the weekends .

My father has his own enterprise .
Normally he returns home for dinner .
But while he is still working , I watch TV or I play tennis with my brother .
I guess sometimes he could use more free time so that he would be able to do such activities and just enjoy .

That brings me to my next thought .
Older people have more responsabilities than younger people .
According to that , adults need to invest more time into complex things such as taxes or bills .

My fathers company counts 300 workers .
He is responsible for everyone .
If you have to keep up with such a big responsability , your day can be stressy .
Young people do not have to worry about that because they count on the help oh their parents .

Finally young people have more energy to do activities .
It is natural that a young body is fitter than an older one .
The bones are still young and the body of a young person is still growing .

When my mother an me go for a walk up the hill she is the first to make a break .
My legs are younger and I am able to wlak longer distances because of my condition .

In conclusion there are several reasons why young people enjoy life more than older people do .
The most important is that young people have more free time .
In spite of that older people enjoy life too , but in an other way .
