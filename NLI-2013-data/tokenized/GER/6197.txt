The question of how many cars will be in use in future times is very significant , in particular with regard to the enormous damage the use of cars cause to our environment and the shrinking oil supplies of the world .
It 's a matter of fact that soon we wo n't be able any more to drive as many cars as we are driving today .
Thus , we should think about alternative solutions in order to come from one spot to another .

Maybe today 's cars are the less pollutive ever , but nevertheless the air pollution caused by everyday traffic is still enormous and nearly unbelievable .
This air pollution does not only affect future generations , but we as well feel already the consequences , such as a constant elevation of the world 's average of temperature , leading to a dangerous shrinking of ice in the mountains , or unknown climatic catastrophes such as Hurricanes .

Because of these climatical changes and their direct impacts on our lives I think , that soon the question , whether to drive by car or to take a train , will no longer be a personal decision .

Besides , the costs of providing an own car increase more and more .
When somebody drives a car he 's totally dependant on the oil company 's will .
It is true that they are defending the high costs by bringing forward the difficult political situations in the countries where they are exploiting the oil , but for the consumer this does not change anything : he has to face the high costs .

Thus , these high costs will soon oblige the people to consider alternatives , because they ca n't afford the amount of money that is necessary .

And even if the costs will reduce to the former level , oil exploitaton remains a temporarily limited exploitation , because it is no renewable ressource .
So , sooner or later , everybody has to change his habits .

In my opinion , a future vision of streets with only a few cars driving , is a positive one .
The best thing I can imagine is a world in which nearly all places are connected by a train network .
The construction will be expensive but it will be worth it because everybody will use it , in particular if this kind of travelling offers accomodate prices .
