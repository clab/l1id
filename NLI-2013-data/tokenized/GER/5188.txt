In general I agree with this statement .
To support my opinion we should have a look on the markt of the 21st century .
There is too little space for all the products that companies can produce and sell to consumers .
So there is a big supply surplus on the market and every company has to look for a way to get the consumers attention .
Big marketing studies were done in the last years to teach the company how to sell more products .
Ther are 3 strategies in advertising a product .
The price strategiy , the product strategy and the promotion strategie .
The markteting strategy wecomplain in the statement is the promotion strategie .

In this strategy companies make their products in advertisments much better than they really are .
This marketing strategy gives the product an additional value and according to this an additional reason to the consumer why to buy the product of this or that company .

But in realety the consumer is confused .
he is overloaded with information of the advertisements .
To escape this confusion he often compare the prices of the products and not the additional value .

It is also a fact that a consumer will not buy a product again that could n't gave him what he expacted .
Thats no problem in the short therm but in the long term mouthpropaganda will lead to the effect that nobody will buy this product anymore .
In my opinion the best strategy to advertise products is the product strategy .
In this strategy companies look for a niche where they can satisfy
