Is it better to know a little bit about everyting or everything about one topic ?
This is a question that every student faces during his academic career .
But no teacher will ever answer it for you .
In order to find an answer , there are many different levels that must be considered .
It will be usefull to look at the effects on the academic life , personal life and personal relationships .
Personally I believe that a broad knowledge is much better for most people .

For your private life and personal developement a broad knowledge is more valuable than spezialized knowledge .
A broad knowledge helps you to handle all kinds of different situations .
You always have an idea what kind of solution may resolve the problem .
For example if you have some knowledge about law , you can resolve many problems by yourself without an expensive lawyer .
You could also help your friend who would be very gratefull .

Considering personal relationships a broad knowledge normally is more important .
Broadly educated people are able to communicate with everyone about everything without getting embarassed .
In contrast , people with very specialized knowledge are likely to get a little lonely .
They often talk to people with a similar knwoledge .

If someone wants to become an scientist and do some research , specialized knowledge is much more usefull than general knowledge .
These days there is a specialist for everything and it 's not easy to find a topic to do research on .
You have to know almost everything about your topic .
So it 's very hard to get a board knowledge besides .

So I think a broad knowledge is much better , unless you want to become a scientis .
Broadly educated people perfom better in their private live and are more sociable .
They easier communicate with other people about all kinds of topic .
But this is a choice that everyone has to make for himself depending on his plans .
