There are many opinions occuring about whether young people or old people enjoy life more .
I actually do not agree with the statement `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' at all .
I do n't think that old people have more fun in life than their younger companions either .
But I am not saying that not anyone on earth enjoys his or her life .
I am just trying to say that it depends on the person himself regardless of his age .

A man , 80 years of age could be the richest man on earth but may still not be satisfied with his life because he wants to be young again .
Therefore he does not enjoy life .
And on the other side a teenager is unhappy about his life because he does n't have the money and right to do whatever he wishes to do because he still lives in his parents house .
All the teenager wants is to get older , so that he can do all the things that he always wanted to do ( and of course the money to do it ) .
And the funny thing is that both illustrations could be the exact same person , only in different life stages .

But it can be different , too .
As a young person you can enjoy life by going to school , meeting friends , doing sports , etc .
And just because of the fact that you are old does not mean that you cannot have the same fulfillment in life as a younger people do .
You only do different things which you could have never thought of when you were younger .

So what does that mean ?
You could have all the things you 've always wanted and still be unhappy .
It does n't matter if someone is young or someone is old .
If that particular person does not have the right attitude to make the most out of the situation he will never be happy and finally enjoy life .
A young person can enjoy life as well as an old person does .
It is only important how he thinks of himself .

I believe it is your attitude that determines what kind of a life you can have .
You can enjoy life or make it a terrifying time while being on this earth .
Nobody can make you feel happy , but YOU .
