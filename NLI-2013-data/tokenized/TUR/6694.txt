Transportation is very important issue of not only our century but also future .
Most known and used way of transportation is using car .
However , some factors like scarce energy resources , increasing number of car accidents and environmental pollution will decrease usage of cars .
As an inevatible result of these facts , in twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Firstly , world stock of energy resources decrease everyday .
When a resource will become more scare , it will be more expensive in future .
As a result of this economic condition , people will prefer public transporatation like busses and trains for cost saving .
That is to say many people will give up their personal cars .

Second important point to consider about this issue that car accidents cause many innocent deads more than wars .
Using car will be more unsecure due primarily to increasing number of fatal car accidents .
Statistical data show that possibility of occurance an accident or dead from an accident is much lower for trains and airplanes than car , so , other ways of transporatiton like trains , airplanes are more secure .
As above montioned there are two sides of this issue .
First , people will give up car usage for their life security .
Second , people will afraid from being responsible from dead of others .

Environmental pollution is another reason to decrease usage of cars in future .
Every car release much of gasses which damage environment .
Today many governments and NGOs begin to attack pollution caused from car usage ..

All in all , world 's scarce energy stock , car accidents and environmental issues will decrease number of cars in use .
That is to say , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
