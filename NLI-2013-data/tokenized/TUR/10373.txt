I strongly belive success requires to try new things and take risk in the life .
Everyday is first day of rest of our life and can be a new refreshing start .
A new start / change gives more energy to accomplish .
As we all know ; all methods and ways change by the time .
Even the way we think , we see the world need to be changed as well .
The way people travelled , dressed has been continiously changed over years .
The way govermenst admimistrates , companies advertises changed as well .
Even today war strategies changed .
Keeping same way and insisting in doing things old fasion way can not be a key for success .
We were not burn as a fully experienced educated person .
During life or school we continously learn and experience things .
One time things we thougt was best to do may not be right to do later .
Even the the right things we have been doing may not be best to do an other time .
I exprienced these from my own life .
I worked as a pizza maker for 3 years in the past .
I was a good professional pizza maker but i was not happy with may job and never felt i was successful .
I never thought it was right for my caracther and abilities .
I wanted do a different job have more action involved .
I took risk of changing my job and established a company .
Now i sell overseas and earn lots of money .
I go different part of the world and do different things every day .
I feel more happy and successful .

Successful is the level of life makes you happy .
If you dont feel happy with what you have or what you are doing you should take risk and change it .
