This essay will discuss the overall advantages of having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects versus specializing in one specific subject .

I will begin by stating that the particular enviroment and situation a person is in does determine the outline of the necessary knowledge .
Since this is the case , let us observe two different cases where things may differ to a certain extent .

First , I would like to consider a student who is a freshman at a 4 year college .
Until he chooses his major , he will have to start accumulating knowledge in many different subjects in order to have enough information to determine what he really wants to focus on .
Once he chooses his major , he will then start specializing on one particular subject .
But , at this point , it is very important to observe that he still will need to be studying other broader subjects to enhance his development as a whole .
Thus , even the choice of a single focal subject is enabled by understanding a spectrum of other broader subjects .

Next , let us imagine that this student has graduated and joined the work force .
If we simplify things for the sake of argument , we could have two different situations on our hands .
In one case , the student prefers to stay in an academic enviroment and teach .
To be able to get a college teaching position , for example , he will have to specialize even further on his chosen path through higher education .

But , even while focusing further , he will try to increase his knowledge of subjects related to his own particular subject since this one of the fundemental requirements of becoming a good educator .
On the other hand , if he chooses to join a company , the people who hire him will probably expect him to be versatile and function in different divisions of the company .
Again , as I stated before , I am oversimplifying these situations due to time and space constraint .

In conclusion , even in situations requiring focus on a specific subject , a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a must .
This enables one to become a well rounded educated person with enough information in different subjects wh see the bigger picture whenever necessary .
