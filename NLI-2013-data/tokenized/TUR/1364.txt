I am disagree with this knowledge based on many academic subjects .
I believe people should be specialize on one subjects .
As the whole academicans know , specialization just include of this academic subject 's improvement .

In the world history , development really related with specialization of persons .
For example Alexander Grahambel just have experience based on telephone so that he could not be interest problems politcs within academic level .
Especially this specialization getting more important when the academic areas becoming more developed .
After the industrial revolution whole academic areas clearly and quickly improved .
this development process directly has relation with specialization 's expanding in academic enviorements .
Thus , too many academician found new tolls , methots mental way for developmets of those specific areas .

I think humans owes to those specialized persons for our current developed level .
We are appreciate those person
