It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I agree with the following statement .
Students are young and generally do not enought experiences for their life .
They do not responsibility for their life and they are generally very busy on their life .
Thats why , there are many reasons for my support idea .

Firstly , they are young and they have not done enought experiences for their life .
I am a Faculty at the Dokuz Eylul University in Izmir , in Turkey for seven years .
I have studied a lot of students .
In my experinces , they understand and believe ideas and concepts because they are so young for life and they have not done anythings .

Secondly , almost all students are very busy .
They learn a lot of things .
They have studied on their life such as homework , listening , reading , speaking and writing .
However they have not had any experinces such as earning life , earning money , doing help anybody etc .
Actually I do n't know another countries but at least , in Turkey is this .
Our curriculum teach generally good math , geography , history , biology or anything but it does n't teach life knowledge , This is big mistake and Turkis educational system and its curriculum has to be change .

Finally , they don ' have enought responsiblity .
In my view , this is educational system 's problem .
For instance , in Turkey almost all students go to secondary school and high school .
They study and they do homework .
Neverthless , usullally they do n't do any home made .

In my opinium , if we succed for new generation , we have to learn life 's facts and we have to give more responsibilities .
We have to change our traditional educational systems .
They have learn life , world , and world 's problem such as war , peace , environment , conflict and etc .
Because , tomorrow life for them .
