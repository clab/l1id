I am agree with this statement .
Young people are becoming more and more selfish everyday .
They are beginning to care about themselves only .
There are mainly three important reasons for not giving enough time for their communities ; they have more duty every day , they become to care about themselves only , and degeneration of communities .

The first reason why the young people does not help their communities is they have more and more duty every day .
If we look at the past times , we see that the life is more simple .
People are not have to do lots of work at the same time .
But life is becoming more and more complicated everyday .
For example , a child began to go to school at three years old , and he keeps to going school at the age of twenty two .
Maybe he had to work when he is a student .
This gives lots of responsibility to the young and so he does not have time for helping other people .

The second reason is that they become more selfish compared to the past .
Nowadays not only young people but everyone seems to be care only themselves .
People are aware of the situtation that everyone lives alone and dies alone .
But especially youth are more likely to be live alone .
This thought causes young people does not care about community problems .

The third and final reason is degeneration of communities .
Nowadays some bad people are using some good people for their needs in society .
And so good people start to think that why would I help a person without any reason .
The main point is people became to not able to see the purpose of helping other people .
Thus young people do not spend their time helping to other people .

To sum up , nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because of three main reasons .
I do not think these are all their fault also the societies are responsible of this situtation .
Yaoung people are immitating the older people .
They are just doing what they have seen .
