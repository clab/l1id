in order to analize this statement we should first look at the definition of the advertisements .
then according to the information we should put the right and the wrong part of this statement .
how the advertiser make the product seem better and if they dont what would happen ?
in this essay i will try to answer these questions and explain my ideas about the subject .

the advertisement is made for show the new product to the public .
like all the product , this particular one might have some good and some bad qualities , advantages and disadventages .
however the advertisers dont have to show the negative side of the product .
they usually only emphize the positive ones adn adventages of the product .

this bring us to the second question .
not showing the disadvantages is the same thing making the product seem much better then it really is ?
i think no it is not the same thing but it is a little bit hypotrethic .
Since it count as a crime not mentioned about the negative effect if it harms people , advertisement also should consist both negative and possitive side of the product .
the amount of the showing each side should be up to advertisers but people should informed all aspects of the product before buying it not after reading the tiny little warning which pop up after opening the box .

however , since every product in our life has a side effect , it might become paranoid if every advertisement talk about how harmful the product is .
to sum up i agree with the statement .
yes the advertisement make the products seem much better than they really are by showing only the good part of the products .
however it will be more caotic if the start to tell the whole truth about everything about the products .
