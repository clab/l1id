If you only do what you already know how to do well , you would definitely be good at what you are doing .
But to achieve success or victory , you need more than that .
It is quite impossible to say that success comes without any pain .
In order to be successful at one thing , you should accept to take risks .
That 's why in my opinion successful people are those who dare to take risks .

We can see a lot of examples in the history showing that successful people always take risks .
For example during Second World War , Churchill made a very risky plan and ordered to all allied forces for a surprise attack .
If his plan was unsuccessful , it would have led to the victory of Hitler over the world .
But Churchill made it and became victorious , that victory also made him one of the most successful stateman of the history .
The essential point in his victory was the courage to take a risk .

We can also state that in business , rich and successfull people are always the ones who took a lot of risk in their lives .
The famous deed collector Donald Trump is a recent example of success .
After his bankrupt several years ago , he did not stop working , in contrast he took more risks to build up his empire again .
And finally he became very rich again , that was his success by taking risks .

Furthermore , taking risks and trying new things are not only a way to success but also a crucial step for self improvement .
People can gain more life experience by taking risks and trying new things .
On the other hand those who choose to do only what they know to do and nothing more , can not go further and be successful .

Finally , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks because as they say `` No pain , no gain '' .
