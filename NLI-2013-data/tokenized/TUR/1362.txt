One may argue that it is suitable to get broad knowkedge in many academic fields or just to specialize in one subject In my point of view it depends on your life expectation and where your plan to use your knowledge In academic world nowadays it is almost impossible to think the contrary of being specialiazed in your field that you are aming to Without the speciliazation how can the industrialization may occur All the technology we are using requires much sophisticated knowledge each days In addition to this it is very surprising to constate that the fields we specialized may become a general area of study because it may be divided into sub catagories There is no doubt that it is essential to have basic knowledge about the related fields For example engeneering in aviation does require a broad knowledge in jet engines metals air dynamics etc According to the field or your work you will choose you will be faced to have to broden your knowledge
