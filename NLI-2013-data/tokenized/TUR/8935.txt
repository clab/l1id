I do n't agree the idea that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
From my point of view , understanding the ideas and concepts and learning the facts have equal importance because at first without facts ideas and concepts ca n't be understood .
Let me explain this with a personal experience , I 'm studying textile engineering at university , in all classes our lecturers tell us the facts about textile materials and the facts about how they are produced .
And then we argue on how we can improve the material qualities and production techniques and in the end of the lesson lecturer gives his/her ideas about them .
By this way we learn the facts about the materials and production techniques and understands the ideas and concepts about improving them even we can create our own ideas .
But if we do n't clearly know what the features of the textile material are and how it 's produced we can neither understand the ideas of the lecturer about improving them nor create our own ideas .

Secondly , if you both know the facts and understand the ideas and concepts about a certain topic then you totaly know the topic .
For example in an arts class if some examples of drawings of Leonardo Da Vinci are shown and the dates of them are given , it 's good you have seen how Leonardo Da Vinci 's paintings look like .
But what about the idea behind these drawings ?
If the lecturer tells you his/her opinions about what he might think while making these drawings or encourages you to imagine Leonardo 's mood while making these drawings then you can have a total knowledge about Leonardo Da Vinci 's art .

In conclusion in order to gain the exact knowledge of a certain topic at first students should learn facts and then understand ideas and concepts .
Education system should be organized according to this logic from primary school to university in order to raise well educated and intellectual students .
