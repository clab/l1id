Education of students is very important so we have to be carefull .
Some people think understanding ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts .
However , I disagree with that and I think not only students but also adults must develop themselves with facts .
People must be realist ; this makes people more successfull and powerfull .

Firstly , I think schools should produce more realist peoples and since child had started primary schools this education has been started .
Realist people can be more successfull as we can see in history .
For example , Napalyon Buenoparte , was inteligent and realist .
He has seemed always realist since he born to now .
As we can see three of his word ; a person had came to talk with Napolyon when he was going the war , and he asked ` Why they always do wars ! ' and he answered ` Money , money , money ' .
I think it is a very good example for a successfull realist person .

On the other hand we can see in history failed people who were dreamer .
Many kominist are very good example for that .
They lives for ideas and concepts and they cannot do anything for peace or any good things for humanity .
However , other people who were realists are all written in history books .
As I can see it one picture from my sit when I am writing my essay , Ataturk who is the founder of the Turkish Republic .
He was certainly realist because even Ottoman Empire 's dreamer behaviors and force on all people , he behaved realist and established this modern country .
He knew where Turkey was and where others were , and he tried to develope like other developed country such as Europens and Americans

In conculusion , I think childeren must grow up with facts if they wants to be a successfull person and because of that we must educate them in that way .
