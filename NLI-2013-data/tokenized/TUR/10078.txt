There is a statement here about being successful .
It says : successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

I want to express my opinion by giving examples from real life ; First , look at Ataturk 's life .
He attempted to save his country with his friends and at the end of the war he achieved it .
Indeed it was not a new thing .
There are , exactly , similar conditions and successes in turkish and world history .
But after the war he tried to found a new country which is governed by citizens ( although this term was new for the turkey in those days ) and try to bring democrasy culture here .
After all of these , he is remembered as succesful man and a leader .
In conclusion , i can say that trying new things and taking risks can help you to be succesful .

But ...
In the twentieth century businessmen found a new business strategy : frenchising .
There are lots of chains of companies and you just contact with them , giving them amount of money which they determined and you can be successful in this way .
That is a way of success without taking risk and without finding new things .

After these instances how can i conclude ?
And do i have to ask this question : what is success ?
To answering these questions is not easy but i want response in my way ; if you just want to be successful person who lives in high standarts you do not have to take risks .
But if you want to be a successful person who will be remembered untill the end of time you must take risks , you must find new solutions to old problems .

At the end , i just can say that i agreed the statement and i have to add that at the same time i disagreed it .
I hope i profess it well .
