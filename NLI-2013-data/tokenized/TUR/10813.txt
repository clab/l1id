In businesslife successful people like to work in different type of works .
They do not want to work on the same project or work for many years .
They like expanding their works , creating new ideas and taking some risks .

I think successfull people have some properties such as creativity and bravity .
They always want to make new projects new ideas .
Becaue of this when they are doing a good job , after a while they could easily get bored and begin to think new projects .
For example think that you are the owner of a big PC software company and you are the best in this job .
You make software programs for only businessmen , after a while you will begin to think expand your job and take some risks .
But while taking some risks you know that you have a good backup and you could use your experiences .
So you could make some prducts such as PC games and you could begin to sell these products .
While taking these decision people could think that this is a big risk but you have got a big experience in PC software and tou have got a well educated stuff .
By PC games your popularity will increase because your amount of customer will increase and using rate of your products will increase .
By expanding your work you will have a chance to work with new people and you could get some advices from these new partners .

If you do n't thik to expand your job and make new projects after a while you will begin to get bored of your work .
You will not be able to create new ideas and then you will begin to loose customers .
By the years people will not think that you are a successful person .

These days everything changes in a very fast way .
If you do n't get use to this situation you will not be able to success your work .
In businesslife people always have to think to expand their work ; take some risks .
In conclusion I could say that if you want to be a successfull person you have to take some risks ' make new projects and create new ideas .
