I totally agree with this statement .
We are in an incredible period of time that technology is growing too fast .
This brings some consequences and influences in all things .
The vehicles , especially cars are one of those things .

Firstly , I think the use of the public tansportation will get higher .
The high technology provides us to improve the qualifications of the vehicles that we are already used .
For example , because of the speed of the trains , subways and plains , people prefer to use this kind of vehicles .
They will not want to take the risk of being late for anything .

Secondly , the high rate of the accident of cars will lead people to invent some solutions about that .
Using the high technology , they will create some other vehicles other than those we use recently .
For example ; the vehicles which will be used for the transportation through the air or under see and which are more safe than using a car .
These situations cause people to reach anywhere more fast and more safely .

Lastly , dispite of the high technology , people may prefer basic vehicles for transportation like bycels .
The arrangement of the roads and bridges will be better completed
