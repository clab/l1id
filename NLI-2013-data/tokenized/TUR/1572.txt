I disagree .
In an academic subject you have to specialize in one spesific subject .
In an academic career you have to improve yourself in one topic .
Your knowledge have to be more specialized than ordinary people .

Honestly broad knowledge is an asset for an academic career but it is not enough .
In academic subjects you have to your own thesis , hypothesis , researchs and also stastistical results on your subject to promote .
Academicians are the people who leads to the society .
By their opinions and knowledge our life become more qualified .
For that reason they have to be specialized in one spesific subject .
University life and enviroment has to supply them all the equipments they need to specialize .
Broad knowledge in many academic subjects , supports to discuss and create new things but not enough .
All over the world assistants and professeurs are remembered by their research reports and thesis , they have to work hard and help each other by sharing their researchs .
To find out something we have to focus on a spesific subject like Einstein , Archimedes .
