Do successful people try new things or do what they already know how to do well ?
I think successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks because a person can realize their abilities , meet luck or find the suitable choice after trying a few different things in life .

First of all a person needs to try things in order to realize their abilities .
For example , I learned how to play the piano when I was in third grade .
I was playing it well but of course , I was n't a virtuoso .
Taking a risk that I might be unsuccessful , I decided to start painting last year , and I saw that I was more talented in painting .
Actually , now I am quite successful that think I will study design in the future , but if I did n't take the risk , I would 've lose my chance to realize my talent .
Therefore , I believe that a person should take risks in order to explore himself/herself .

On the other hand , a person can meet their luck trying to find the best for themselves .
For example when you decide to do something new like starting a new job your chance of being successful is equal to your chance of failing .
As a conclusion , it is always worth trying .
For another instance , you have the chance of winning the lottery when you play it , but if you do n't , you ca n't win anthing .
I think you should take the risk of losing .

Last but not least , you can only find the suitable choice for you after a couple of trials .
For example my aunt was a tailor , but she wanted to open a restaurant .
In spite of the discouraging thoughts of our relatives , she opened the restaurant , and now she earns better than she did when she was a tailor .
So , she was successful with her new choice .
The same idea can exist whan a parson needs to choose a school .
You can always try one considering the chance of being sucessful and if you do n't like it , you should have the courage to take the risk of quiting it .
Because you might be more successful in another .
People should try new things in their lives in order to find the most suitable for themselves .

Successful people are the ones who try new things and take risks .
People should always take risks to be successful .
