Young people enjoy life more than older people do because of many reasons .
Having many responsibilties is a reason for that and also bad situations can not be forgotten by the old people .

Firstly , old people have many responsibilitis for their life .
It is the most important reason for old people can not enjoy life as much as young people .
They have to think before every choice that they and may be they can not understand thats enjoyment at that time .
People have to think about their careers , money , family life , and also their children 's life .
These important problems can not give time think about the to live for their enjoy .
Old people always have many jobs to do and they forget about the life 's good abilities .
Nowadays , working people do n't spent their time for any other good thinks .
They always work .
Going a picnic is a really good enjoyable thing for a child but not for an old person because he or she thinks many thinks in his or her head .

Secondly , young people have no or little experience in their life .
So they can learn something by doing them .
Doing something at the first time always give more enjoy to the people .
But the old people experienced them before and it is not as much enjoyable as the first time .
After living many bad or good situations , old people forget taking good tastes from life .

As a coclusion , young people have opprtunity to spent good time for themselves but old people not .
Young people have many good goals for their life .
tahy like to live and take enjoy more than old people .
