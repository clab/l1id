Nowadays many people look for ways in order to decrease the number of cars in use .
Although I would like to see that quantity of automobiles on decreases , I do not believe that this is a possible trend for the near future .
Simply speaking , there are more incentives for people to buy and use cars than there are reasons to abandon them .
I will try to make a short list of these incentives .

First of all , the population on earth is growing continuously , which means that there are many new people who want to have cars .
As a result of huge advertising campaigns carried out by automobile firms which want to maximize their profits , a social image has been created for cars .
People now think that a car improves their mobility and is an indicator of their socio-economic status .
Moreover , young people also want to have their own cars , which makes them `` cool '' .
As a result , the demand for new cars is very high in almost every country on teh world .

Another trend which would avoid a decrease in the number of cars is the unpopularity of mass transit systems .
Since the cities are growing constantly and funds of governments and local administration cannot grow as rapidly as cities , it becomes harder to travel within the city using the overcrowded mass transit systems .
Therefore , many people prefer to have a car and use it especially in the busy hours of the day .

Due to the fascinating technological advancements , it becomes easier for people to buy a new car , because technological advancements enable a decrease in prices .
Bank credits and other kinds of financial assistance are offered to people who want to have cars and most people use these opportunities to have a new car and keeping the older one for other members of the family .
In the early 21st century , it is now widely accepted that a nuclear family has more than one car , sometimes even all members have their own car : Another inclination which hardens a worldwide decrease in the number of cars .

The continuous growth of population coupled with the strong social image of automobiles , unpopularity of mass transit systems and price decreases indicate that a decrease in the quantity of automobiles is not possible for the near future .
Considering the environmental dangers of having moer cars , on the other hand , governmental and non-governmental organizations should seek and promote options other than cars .
