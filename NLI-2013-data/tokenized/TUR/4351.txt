Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
The youth is preferring personal life style instead of common one .
They thinking more of themselves than the community that they are the part of .

One sign of this is coming in the representation of their nation or country .
A few decades ago it was easy to tell someone 's nation by observing his attitudes , clothes , and behaviors .
But today it is impossible to do .
Especially young people care their own appearance despite their customs .
They are not conveying the culture to the future Now you can see a global wearing style .

Another sign is they are getting more rude .
I will explain this with an example .
When I was 16 years old I was taking city transportation buses to go to school .
The buses were usually crowded that more than half of the pessengers had travel by standing up in the buses .
For the young people like me , it was impossible to take a seat in the bus while older people or ladies were standing up .
We were always giving our seats to the older people , no matter how old they were .
But today young people never cares about the others , even they do n't care sick or handicapped people .
They keep their seats and enjoy it .
So sharing the seat is a way of helping the community for me .

If someone wants to help his or her community he or she has to think about the economical aspect also .
the people of the community should prefer buying domestic or national stuff to help the economy .
But I do n't see this in the youth of the day .
They are just crazy about the brands and they usually buy foreigner goods to make show .

There are many other ways to help the community that the young peaople can choose but today they really even do n't think about it .
Finally without venturing too much into the field of speculation we may conjecture that today 's youth is not giving enough time and energy to helping their community .
