Successful people are the people , who have risen in their work and social life .
They have happy lives and good living conditions .
Moreover , they can apply the new things and technologies tio their life , which is very important in today 's rapidly growing world .
In order to understand this fact , the reason behind the success and the ways of succession should be investigated .

In order to be successful , people should try new things , because if they would not take risks in the life , they would repeat themselves by doing the same work .
As a result , they would not take any risks in the life .
Because if a person do not take a risk in his life , he could not experience anything .
However , the most influential way of learning something is experiencing it .
Without any experiences , he could not learn anything new and he could only do something that he learned from the books and he will repeat himself in all of his life .

On the other hand , if he does not afraid of making failures , he would take risks , and even if he fails he would learn something new and he would not repeat the same mistakes , again .
It makes him a more successful person , because he could make lots of works and he would have a greater vision .

A person who do not afraid of taking risks , would also be more familiar with the new technology and the changing demands of the society and his work .
If we think about a person who close himself to the new things , he would repeat himself at that work .
However , his work would be changed according to the new technologies .
For instance , a worker in a company could find a job with using a typewriter , fifteen years ago .
However , if he did not develop his skills and thinks that he is good at typewriting and continue to work with it , he could not rise in any field , because it the computer era and everybody should learn how to use computer .
If he took risk and lose some data when he was learning a computer , he would be a more important worker in his company .

As a result , in order to be successful and rise in the life , people should open up themselves to the new things and they should take risks while trying or learning new things .
Because it would protect the person from repeating himself at the work he is doing well .
As a consequence , it would not let the person to stay behind the era that he lives .
