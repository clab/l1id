Life is the best present for all people from god .
Everbody use it in so many different ways , so many different places and inside completely different people .
Also in every ages life become different too .
However young people do n't enjoy life than the older people every time due to chracter of humans and believes of people .

Chracter of human determine every detail of the human life .
Some people can kill themselves im the spring of their life and some of them try to survive after a terrible accident and a few of them achieve incredible works after they are 70 .
This is completely independent from the age .
If a person is optimistic , if his or her family support him in his bad terms , in big troubles .
If they have good friends to help them people enjoy life even after 100 years old !

Believes of people can also make difference in human life .
Consider about a child .
Whether his mother dead after a horriable accident , how can we explain this complicated situation to him .
His life become a nightmare all over his he can not enjoy his life .
However , if we explain everthing in religion side and we said him ` your mother is in the heaven now and she is happier than us` , everthing in his life make sense after that .
Then he can enjoy his lkife forever .

To sum up , Enjoying life is not about age , it is about character of people and human believes .
The happiest person in the world could be 80 years old .
Unfortunately , most of the people who killed themselves in the world are young people .
If a person can not understand the meaning of life he can not enjoy anything but if a person is optimistic he can write love poems just only looking at the sun rising !
God bless us ...
