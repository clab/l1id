I agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I have couple of experiences and reasons to support my opinion .

First , it is always more fun for me to travel with a group of people .
Since I consider myself a social person , it gives me a great opportunity to make new friends .
For example , I had such a great time in my last trip to Italy .
We visited the historical places during the day time and enjoyed the delicious Italian pasta with a glass of wine and laughter at night .
It was incredible .

Furthermore , a tour guide is very very important for a travel .
I believe that it helps a lot to visit the new places with a person who already knows about their histories .
It is harder for me to read it from a book .
Also , I have a short term memory on those kind of things .
The first time when I went to Barcelona by myself , I had already forgot the story of the famous sculptures , so it did n't make any sense to see them without the particular information .

Finally , I think it is much better to walk around with a group of people .
It attracts the local store owners .
They tend to be more kind because they realize that it is a group of tourist who know nothing about this place .
Also , a tour guide helps us to get discounts for the souveniers from the stores he knows .

In conclusion , .
although I preferred to travel alone at the begginnig , I realized that it is more fun when I travel with friends or my future friends to be .
That 's why , I believe that it is much better to travel with a group of people and a tour guide
