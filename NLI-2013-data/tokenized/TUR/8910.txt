I completely disagree with this statement .
Ideas and concepts can be learned easily but the most important thing is practise to them and it 's more difficult than learning .
In school we learned and sometimes memorize a lot of things .
From the age of 7 to almost 21 we just try to listen our lessons , read the books , do our homeworks .
During all this learning period students are just passive factors , they just listen .
When they involve actively this period , `` learning '' reach the real target of it .

If students only learn ideas and concepts and they ca n't find chance to apply to real world or practise , this ideas are only takes place in brain for a while and then they will be forgetten .

I learned a lot of theories , ideas but I do n't remember anything about them now and I ca n't use this information any area of my life .
It 's more functional for children to learn facts rather than ideas .
This make their life easy in the future and learning process is more efficient in this way .

Today our education system 's based to this ideas which is mentioned above .
Teachers only try to give framework about ideas and concepts with this method students trying to just memorize and they have n't ability to research , because their task is only learning limited source of information .
They do n't understand the real taste of learning so learning process is getting unsuccesfull .

Education also shapes the identity and character of a person .
When a child learn from the school and teachers that learning is just reading , he-she may be person who dose n't affort to change or learn anything .

Students have to learn facts , so they kno
