There are ingreasing people thinking that understanding ideas and concepts more important because if they learn ideas and concept they will learn the subject easily .
They have many ideas about the topic but they do not know why this is like this and don not think about topic they only memorize the topic and ideas but it is not true for people in my opinion they learn to understand ideas and concepts has two benefits for them ; learning the topic easily and do not forget very easily .

First learning to understand ideas and concepts play important role in learning easyly .
If peole learn cocepts and ideas they learn easyly because they learn its details and reasons .
People learn thing with details they know about it almost everything and they have a lot of ideas about it .
if people have concepts about topic they learn easily too , because they know its much important thing in the topic and if they do not know every thing only they know concept and idea they will solve the problem easily so learning ideas and concepts are important in terms of learning easily Second learning to understand ideas and concepts contributes to not to forget easily because if people know the ideas and concepts they will learn its reasons so they do not memorize it .
they learn its much more important ideas and they know important concepts .
they forget it very long term and they use this information very long term .
Also people want to forget very long term so they learn to understand ideas and concepts .

To sum up learning to understand concepts and ideas contrubutes to learning easily and learning to understand ideas concepts and ideas conruutes to not only learning easily but also forgeting it very difficultly .
In the future I think more people think that learning ideas and concepts more important .
