I agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
In my view there are some reason thats why I am think the travel with group .

First the tour select the the most beautiful places and also most important historical building .
The second is the travel with a group is much cheeper than travel alone , with his or her fammily or with couple friends .
Every thing is much cheep ; airplains ' ticket , hotels , foods without your own shopping .
And also While you travel with group you can meet some people create a new relationships , In addition you can keep your friend ship after traveling and it will be good memory for your future .

The tour give a guide who responsable to explain where tourist travel .
He give a some information about the buildings , museums .
A you can learn about the country of history , culture and tradition .
If I travel alone I just travel around the city or look the buildings and skip .
Or you have to read the book , tourist guide and travel which is not good for me .
In every tour there is a free time and you can ask the some interesting place or shopping canter to go , he or she advice to see good places .

In conculsion , because all this reason I prefer to travel vith tour .
And I believe that it 's more enjoyable .
