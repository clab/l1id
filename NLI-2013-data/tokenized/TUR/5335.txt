WHAT WE BUY ?

We are living in a world which is highly industrialized .
This industrialization automatically brings the increase in the consumption - consuption in any way such as cars , clothes , machines , etc. - That is why we also face with the advertisement industry .
The more we need the material to consume , the more advertised producs we face .
Thus , those people who are in the business of making advertisements use different types of methods to convince their customers , one is obviously to display their products in a much better way than they are ,

To begin with the the techniques used in advertisement making , we generally face with the visual materials on TV or magazine commercials , even on the billboards .
The product is displayed in a manner where you can really get fascinated that how the material is really impressive .
If we take the advertisement of a mascara , called X , as an example , we can make the scene as : there is always a very beautiful model who uses X and she could make an imressive effects over people with her glorious eyes .
An ordinary woman watches this commercial and can not stop herselt to buy a X in order to make her eyes as beasutiful as the model 's .
However what comes after ?
The X can not show the same effect as it has made on the beautiful model .
This is really a basic illustration of how the advertisements sometimes forget about the ethical norms .

On the other hand some people claim that this is not true for all the cases , There can maybe some loyal companies which wants to be virtuous towards their customers , but their numbers are really quite limited .
The main rason for a company to display its product in a better way 's to get profit .
Most of the companies generally have their specific people and project groups who are responsible of making advertisement .
Furthermore the company is ready to sacrifice a huge amount of money to improve the advertisements of its producs .
This is du the fact that they are aware of the future income .
They know that if they illustrate their product in a much better way by using different techniques such as paying a lot to the beautiful models , the people can consume more then the normal time .

To sum up , although it is unethical for a company to give a different image of its product , they unfortunatetly imply this method .
The amount of money they would earn after a good advertisement can block the eyes of the producers /
