As far as I am concerned from my own life ; young people really enjoy life more than elderly people .
Having fun from life is a wide range area for debating .
However ; fun is a fun !
Needless to say young people do it in a more efficient way in their whole lifes .
We can see it from many examples from thir life styles .

Firstly ; there is an energy inside young people for doing many activities .
They really want to learn life by trying different and excited activities .
Most of them are enjoyable ones which show differentiation in different people .
By way of illustration ; driving faslty is an exciting hobby for young people .
However it is too hazardeous .
Therefore old people do not want to this as a hobby for living more !
Eventually they know the risk of it 's results .
Anyway it is an enjoyable activity in closed areas .
Is n't it ?

Secondly ; young people are rather interested in technology instead of using the ancient models of technology .
It has many enjoyable products like play station ; computer games ; cell phones ...
etc .
Young people would like to buy new products ; whereas the elderly people could not get accustom to the new technology .
Thus : they use the old models until they broke .
Playing a play station game has been my best hobby since my child times .
You really become more relax than anytime in your life .
Because its games include interesting characters and also places which you have never seen before .
However ; according to elderly people it is a waste of time .
Isn ` t it a boring thought ?

To conclude ; the life is too short ; then why we do n't enjoy for feeling more happy and relax ?
I think older people could not think the importance of enjoy .
They may be do some enjoyable events but presumably it is not enjoyable for younger people .
It is high time that they should enjoy life !
