This subject could be considered as a mixed blessing for society and for me .
I agree with this statement but also being old have disadvantages it does not mean that older people not enjoy life .
Altough young people have more available for fun from their health , there are also older people like young childerens in their sixties .

I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people .
To begin with , young people have more abilities and energy to spend their times and acting a active role in the social activities .
They can go wherever they want and they can enjoy with the society like concerts , cinemas , theatres .
Also they are spending most of their times with their friends at school so they are always in a communicaton .
On the other hand , older people have not got the full physical abilities like youngs as they they are old .
They can not even walk without any help so they can not be able to see their friends for talking and sharing , resting and strolling .
So when teenagers want to have fun there could not be a chance for them so they become uncomfortable becouse they need to walk , run , talk as they also have the responsibility of being a teenager .

On the other hand there are some exceptionals both for older and younger people .
Some teenagers do not like being with other people and they do not love anything .
So I do not understand how they can enjoy life without loving anything to do and complaining about getting bored .
Despite of being older , I can see them , especially woman , in their sport cars and driving through most popular avenues , shopping with their friens , play games , having parties .

To summerise , we should not consider the statement like young people always enjoy life more than older people do because it is not something related with the age .
It is something coming from the inside of the people and have the ability to know how to enjoy life .
