When a person interest in one subject he can protect his or her motivation about the academic study .
Secondly , keeping an order , combining the information about the subject makes a person expert and helps him or her to use and outsource .
Thirdly , coordinated and specialized informaion is always helpful for a person .
It also brings the happiness and walefare to individual 's life .
Another important reason is that creating new theories or inventing new things .
orders and specialized knowledge can easily produce a new ways , theories , inventions etc by the help of its scientific history and exprience .

On the other hand , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects has many disadventagous for an individual like disordered knowledge , unhappiness , endless force for the aim etc .
Picking up some thuing from every subjects may make a person feel learned or satisfied but not intellected .
Every cookies and disorderd things in mind causes strorm because a mind never achieves to coordinate them .
Intellectual satifying is a influencial poison for a people who choices the short way to an information .
Another thing which is the harmfull result of second idea is loosing the way on academic life istead of being creating man for the science .
