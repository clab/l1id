Many consider traveling to be one of the fundemantel value to develop your point of view in to the world .
Traviling alone sometimes can be hard for people .
On my part , I agree that travelling with a tour guide has more benefits than travelling individually .
With a tour guide , youn can safe time and recieve more information .
On the other hand , traveling without a tour guide gives you freedom .

First , safing time is really important when you are on the trip .
By a tour giude , you can schedule your time .
For example , in trips , there are some schedules which offer a lot of place to visit for visitors .
In this schedule with a tour guide visitors can see many places in one day .
They have a chance to visit many places and see on

In addition , when people travel to somewhere , they would like to learn some information about the place .
With a tour guide , receiving information is easy for visitors .
For example , in foreign countries visitors have to translate some information which is about the place .
people do not have a chance to translate all foreign languages .
A tour guide can translate the information for visitors .

Hovewer , Depending on someone sometimes feels visitors boring .
When people travel to some places , they sometimes want to feel free .
Without a tour guide , they can do whatever they want .
For example , they can go shoping , visiting some places , eating their launch or dinner whenever they want .

To sum up , travelling with a tour guide offers many advantages for visitors .
Saving time and getting information are really significant things to travel .
