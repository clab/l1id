Learning the facts and understanding the ideas and concepts are actually the most significant elements for students but i agree with the given statement and think that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
I think there are some reasons make students behave this way .

First of all , we are all in a very competitive school environment and we have to get high grades at school .
In order to get high grades we have to study very hard .
But while we are studing we see that the ideas and concepts are more in important in the exams than the facts .
I maen the teachers ask us about the specific methods , ideas or the concepts rather than the truths or facts .
Therefore in order to be successful we deal with the important points of the exams and it is certain that ideas and concepts are more important in the exams .
I can say that i do the same thing and i deal with the concepts and ideas more than i care about to learn facts .

Secondly i can frankly indicate that today students are lazy .
Learning the facts need more skills like critical thinking , assessing the issues and clarifying the different aspects of them and etc. but on the other hand understanding the methods , idaes or concepts is something more easier .
To be able to understand the ideas or concepts you do not have to think of it detailly , you can only study the course materials and maybe memorize them .
Thus i can suggest that understanding the ideas is more easier for students than learning the facts .
That is why they find it more important to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .

Another element make students feel this way is the education system .
I can give examples from my country .
In Turkey the education system leads students to feel and behave this way .
For instance in our history courses they just make us to memorize the ideas and the concepts instead of giving us information and background about the facts .
We memorize the dates of the wars or important events during the reign of a sultan but unfortunately we can not deal with the realities .
Hence i can indicate that education system is a very basic and significant element at this issue .

All in all , it is cartain that students find it more important to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts but i hope one day it will change and we will start thinking of the facts more than we do today .
I think this will be a very significant milestone in students education life and more creative and good skilled young students will be trained .
