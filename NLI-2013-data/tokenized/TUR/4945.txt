Although many advertisements try to make some products seem better , I do not agree with that they are succesfull .
Because the advertisements can not hide the reality .
Also people investigate the products with all details before buying them .
It is not very easy to make a product seem much better than they really are .
So it may cause some problems which customer complain about .

Some advertisements may illustrate that their pruducts have awesome results .
However , the truth can not be covered forever .
If you buy something which promise a good result , you may be disappointed .
Because you want to see the the results which they offer in their advertisement .
When you see the reality which is opposite , you will not suggest this product and it will cause to decrease the number of customers which may want to try it .

Also many people investigate the products before buying .
They read the comments which are about the products and they want to see some formal certificates which guarantee claims of products .
So they do not believe easily to advertisements .
After they finish their searchings about the products , they pay money for the products .

The advertisements are used for informing people about new products and technologies .
If advertisements do not reflect the realities , it can cause some problems .
It can decrease the reputation of products .
So the companies get difficulties to increase their profits .

I believe that most people agree with me .
Since life gets harder and more expensive , People think second time before buying .
So the advertisements can not be very efficient if they try to make the products much better .
