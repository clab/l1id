There might be a group of people who do not work for their communities as well as there are people who work hard and show great effort to improve their communities .
I agree with the fact that there are more people working hard for their communities than who do not care for them .

Firstly , people who have the right moral attitudes and behaviours should be aware of the envoirment they live in .
And they should always try to develop it for the better .
I assume that our world have enough conscious people to do so .
Therefore people may be able to leave a liveable world to their children and the others who come after them .

However , they might be very busy with their careers and their lives , improving our envoirment and developing it must include one of their goals .
Having a good life should not be the only thing they care for or rely on .
Likewise they wo n't have better enough lives in an uncared community .
They ca n't live without caring for one another .
There are people that suffer from hungar and the wars that damage their homes .
I see on tv that a great number of people are working to make the conditions better .
They try to find them places to live , adopt the children who have anybody left and fund for their loss .
Even for the people who do not take action at all , there are campaigns avaible everywhere .
It is the easiest way for them who do not stand up from their chairs they sit and at the same time they would still be helpful .

To sum up , if people consider the fact that this world is not only ourselves but everyone 's who lives in it , they will probably be more helpful for their community and try to change it for the better .
