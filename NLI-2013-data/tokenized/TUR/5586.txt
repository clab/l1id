For decades advertisements have a very strong effect on consumers .
All companies are using the power of the advertiesement .
But when they are using this power , are they fair ?
I do n't think so !
However they always tell about the positive , the most charming parts of their products , not the efficiency of it for example .
In advertisements the people only sees the better parts , even with exaguratted .
The most typical example to this is `` call and buy '' products , which appears on tv all day long .
There is a product called `` Body Shaper '' for example .
In that advertisement you see women with a very good shaped body and men with full of muscles .
The people who watches this advertisement begin to think that ; they shaped their body with this great invention , there is no reason for me either to achieve .
In that advertisement the firm also show some animations about the muscle groups which would get strengthened .
All of these are made for to fool you actually .
The people you see in that advertisement are always in body building centers .
They even not used the device once in a lifetime , only for that advertisement .
When you start to use that product you feel pain in your back and no positive effect to your body strength , you pack it up and put it into your closet .
There are some magic knifes for example that cut everything .
Every knife has a particular job to do !
But when you buy these knifes you see that there is a little problem with them .
They wo n't cut after a few tries .
But in the advertisement the chief cuts anything he wants .

Examples can be expanded , but the main point is that every firm try to pretend their products better than they are in real and when you start to use that product you see that it 's features are exaguratted .
Firms should n't do this but nobody can stop them .
