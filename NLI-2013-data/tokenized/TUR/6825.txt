People who live and work in big cities have to deal with traffic .
It may take even more than a few hours of their lives everyday .
If there were fewer cars , the problem would be solved .
But how to decrease the number of cars ?
The solution is mass transportation .
I believe that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there is today .

The city planners are working on new roads as well as new ways of mass transportation .
Especially underground or lightweight railway systems are getting popular .
When the quality and the number of these mass transportations increase , there will be less need for cars .

The cars are causing air and noise pollution all around the world .
The hybrid cars are being developed but not being used .
On the other hand , new mass transportation vehicles are not polluting the world .

Mass transportation is economical as well .
It contributes to national economy as well as household economy .
The fuel energy cars are using and the time spent in traffic are bad for national and international economy .

The world is going through an important phase concerning world peace .
The wars started for gaining the use of petrolium are increasing rapidly in the Middle East .
These wars are started because of petrolium corperations and their urges to have more power .
The companies are also pressurising the governments to increase the building of roads and selling of cars .
If people and governmen

I believe that people and the governments will come to an understanding that mass transportation is a must for the whole world .
Mass transportation will improve world economy , decrease pollution and traffic .
