When I was a litle boy , I always thought about `` Why does Uncle Can look sad ? ''
.
It was the times that I tried to create new thoughts in my mind and tried to find why we happened to be alive .
Uncle Can always looked sad and he always said he said something to deal with in his mind .
I tried to find and solve what he had in mind with my insufficient logic - like I said , I was a little boy then - , which i solved lots of times .
However it did not matter how many times that I have solved his problems .
It just made him to create more .
Then I understood that it is not just the `` things in his mind '' , but there is something more which is socially structed by human beings and our culture .
As time goes by , we grew up and as time goes by we have more and more responsibilities which are given to us by our society , which is the fact that makes older people more stressed than younger people .

When we are talking about society , we have to stop and focus on the culture of society and socially structed situtations .
In this example that I will give , one may see things more clearly .
When I was at elemantary school , I just had to pass my courses , then I attended to the highschool , now I had to pass my courses and be accepted to a well-known university .
Now I am studying at Bogazici University which is really famous in Turkey .
However my missions continues to increase and advance while I am succeding and going on .
This may seem a story of one .
However that is not the truth .
The truth is as a human being grew up , he/she will have more responsibilities which makes us more stressed than yesterday .
Why do you think old people loves to look at old pictures ?
It is obvious that he/she wants to be like in the old days , the olds days that he/she had not any responsibilities .
It may be seemed like only constructed society is to be blamed .
However that constructor is us .
Human beings create society and society creates human beings .
We cannot really seperate them .
Human beings are well known as progresive and ambitious and that is why we are always trying to better and more powerful , that makes us stressed and unable to enjoy life day and day .

To sum up , as time passes we will become sad and old .
Because that is what we created by wanting more and more .
In this post-modern world , we are stucked in our created destiny , which is as we get older we will enjoy life less than younger people .
