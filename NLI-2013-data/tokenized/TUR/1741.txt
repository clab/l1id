I completely agree with that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subcject .
I have allways been someone who interests into on several academic subjects such as politics , astronomy , byology and phsycology .
It was not possible in my unioversity to study all of these subjects art the same time therefore , i choosed the politics as a major .
I believe in that i would be able to be quite succesfull on all of them at the same time .

Choose of major at univ. depends on persons individual interests besides other less influental reasons .
However , it can not be restricted by only one subject .
A person can be succesfull on several subjects rather than one spesific one , such as most of the scientist in history .
Da Vinci was not only a paint but also an inventor of his age .
On both of these fields his succes can not be ignored .

Specialize in only one spesific sucject allways sounds me boring .
Sometimes working on a person having phsycologic problems can be more enjoyable than study a physical promblem .
Likewise , study for politics can be boring than working on a person 's phsycological problem .
Therefore it can be said that we can rest while working on a different subject than the subject we had to work on much .

Business life in my country doesnt shape with the science indeed .
You can be a good Phsycs resarcher but that doesnt help you to make your life easily .
In order to earn money knowledge on several subjects is more useful , especially in my country .
Thats why most of the students tries to make MBA in all around the world besides their own major .

Consequently it can be said that knowldge of several academic subject is definetely better than specialize on only one specific subject .
Even though many other of the reasons to work on several subjects can be added so , only three of them described above .
We can gain more benefits with the broad knowledge on many subjects rather than one academic subject .
