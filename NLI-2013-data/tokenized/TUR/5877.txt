There are some fluctuations in usage of some items while the time pass and the technolgy improves .
Some people thinks in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , but I do not think so .

There are some items which their usage is decrasing day by day because of the improving technology .
They replaced by their improved ones , like walkmans .
In the past , we listen music by walkmans very often but nowadays we prefer mp3 players that are more easy to use and have high music storage capacity .
Like walkman , cars are improving every day but they are not replaced by another trasport vechile .
People still need cars for trasportation , but ofcourse with newer modals are preferd .

In Turkey in 1970s , every family has maximum only one car .
Because there are very small production of cars in Turkey and it is very expensive to buy a car .
In general people has not enough power to purchuase a car .
Moreover having a car is not very nesscesry for every one because cities were not as big as today .
Throughout the passing years , our country becomes to have better financial power and production quantity of cars increase while their prices are decreasing .
So now nearly all famillies has a car and some of them has more than one .
The reason for having h'gher amount of car is not only the low prive , in todays world every individual needs to own a car for fast and easy trasportation .
We are in the technology age in which time is money .

In conclusion , ofcourse there are some items which loose their importance and thir usage decreases when the time pass .
I think not only cars will keep their importance , but also their uasge will increase in twenty years .
