Many people cannot decide whether having broad knowledge about academic subjects or specializing in one specific subject is more beneficial for individual 's career .
In my opinion , people should focused on one topic and specialized in it .
By having deep information and significant experiences on an issue , people will gain some important advantages such as finding a good job , salary opportunities and becoming an expert in an area .

First advantage of specializing in a topic is that people can find a job more easily compare to other people .
Because , companies today generally looks for people in a specific topic .
The reason for this is that today 's companies are working on a detailed subject .
It is clearly seen that there are not so much companies that works on differents areas .
Therefore , this situation pushed the companies to find people that have important experiences and knowledge about their job .

Secondly , in today 's world , if a person is an expert in an issue , then this person takes high salary compare to other employees .
Because it is hard to find an expert for companies for a job position .
Therefore , big companies can give high salaries to these people .

Finally , technology forces people to become an expert .
The main reason for this case is that technology is developing day by day and it is not possible to have `` enough '' information about a topic .
I stated that because if you want to produce something or create a product , you should have detailed information about it .
By only this way , people can be creative and valuable in their companies .

To sum up , having detailed knowledge about a topic will become people more lucky than other people .
They can get high salaries and they can be `` wanted '' people among companies .
If people chooses the second choice , than they may not be special in the market .
