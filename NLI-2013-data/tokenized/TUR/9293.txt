I agree with the statement given .
because it is important to teach the students to understant what they are being tough .

There is an old chinesse saying that ; if you want to save somebody from his or her hunger , you have to teach him or her to how to hunt instead of giving him or her ; a fish to feed with .
if a student or a child does not understants the ideas or the concepts that are being tough to them they will simply memorize the subject but not learn from it .

Some school systems or training programs are build on the student or the attendent to memorize what is being given to them which does kill their imagination and does not prepare them to life .
for example couse and effect can be tough to a student in a science class and most of the childeren if not interested specificlly will not enjoy the science class as a social science student I hate it .
If a child does not understant the reasons of a couse and effect situation she or he will not use it to understand peoples reactions about her or his actions .
If a science teacher teaches you the couse and effect principal via giving you examples of your ordinary life , examples of what you do dailly actions you will understand what you learn .
if not just make it an experiment in a lab class you wont remember it until the examination time and after that never .

When you memorize something it is a great risk fort you to forget it .
and it will happen because our brains are like computers .
As we do to make our computer when it is full wiht information and becasue of that its speed slows and does not work more effectively .
We must delete some old informations to get new ones .
And the first information it will delete will be the one you do not remember or do not understand why it happens , the one it is put in without any meaning .
If teachers and parents are the ones that shapes our personality and future they must be very carefull to teach the young minds with a great hunger how to fish not to give us a fish just for once .
