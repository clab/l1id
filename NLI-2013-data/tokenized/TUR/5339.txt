All the business companies produce in order to sell their products and make profit .
They need advertisements to increase the demand for their products and convince the people to buy them .
In these advertisements , the companies generally try the best thing for themselves , they try to find ways in which they could make people buy their products to get their products sold and make a high profit from the business .

The purpose of advertisements is first to inform the possible consumers of the product and secondly to make them buy their product instead of the products of other companies if present .
The information about the product should be well-prepared in oder to sell much of them .
However , in most advertisements , the products seem much better than they really are .
This fact should be anticipated because people buy things of which they think it is the better one for their needs .
Being aware of this natural fact , the companies advertise their products in a way that they look better than their actual qualities .

Advertising a product in a way that it is shown in better quality than it really is might have also bad affects for the companies ' reputation .
The real fact about the product in poor quality may prevail in the general public leading to lower purchase rates for other later products of the company .
The companies should balance the misinformation they give about their products in advertisements by considering the fact that it may eventually result in failure in their future business .

To conclude , in most advertisements the products are shown to be in a much better quality to attract consumers attention to them .
This is normal from the perspective of the companies , since they want to have products which are sold much .
