Advertsiment has been one of the foremost discussion issue in my country as in many parts of the world in the last few decades .
Altough some people do not think advertisments make products seem much better than they really are , dominant people think vice versa .
According to the dominant people companies think their own budget , so their advertisemnts do not show true products .
And I also think like dominant people .

One of the crucial reasons for my belief is companies behave selffishly and they do not think the customer price .
Companies show their products more attractive .
That is why people want to buy this things .
And as the time passes people are able to understand this products are not useful and beautiful as much as shown in the advertisement .

Another reason for my belief is , people always want to have much more attractive products .
Especially nowadays people do not think their needs instead they almost think atractiveness .
In addition to this , companies know this situataion beacuse of this they advertise their product much better than they really are .
Thus , this situation is good for both side , companies and customers , nobody complane from this situation .

The last but least reason is that , companies always compete with each others for having much more reputation .
Due to this reason They always want to show their products more useful and more qualty as well as more attractive .
Hence , they want to advertise their products more efficiently .
Moreover , sometimes products are not related with real ones .

Taking the points I have mentioned above into consideration , it would be appropriate to say that companies use advertisement to have a bigger pforit .
In addition to this , they use customers to acchieve their aims .
Companies think selffishly , and they use people 's feelings which about the having more attractive products as well as they reflect their competitions to customers .
All of these reasons I strongly hold the idea of advertisement make products seem much better than really are .
