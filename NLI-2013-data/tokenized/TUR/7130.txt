The traffic , the huge amount of cars in the ways or streets and the problem of road travel is being discussed for many years .
It is wanted to be solved and to solve this many solutions are developed .
I do n't think this problem will be solved in twnety years and i do n't think there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
There are two reasons why i think like this .

First reason i think the manufacturing never stops .
I mean the manufacturing of the vehicles such as cars buses which carry people one place to another and occupy the roads .
The firms produce many many vehicles every year and there is an absence of the rules about the older cars .
Furthermore , older cars can be the main problem about traffic .
The newer ones fill the roads every year , every months and even every day .
In contrast , the solution is being thought that underways , undersea travel , metros , railways and sea travel may be considered to reduce the traffic jam and so do the number of cars in use .
But i do n't think it is enough .

Secondly , people usually choose their own vehicles to travel beacuse of many reasons , For example they may want more comfortable travel by their own vehicles and moreover it may be cheaper than the others .
Besides , the trains , for instance , carry many many passanger in a day , however these many people can disturb each other when they are in the train .
Therefore , there may be little decrease in the number of the cars .

To sum up , there are two reaons i mentioned above that it ca n't be possible that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years with todays technology .
Besides , the firms have to produce more and more cars to exist and the people will always like comfort and their own cars .
On the contrary ; may be flying cars can change my mind if it is possible to manufactured .
