As people grown up , while attending at the school or on the way of making money for themselves and their family , uses their previous knowledge and applies the theoritical education , gained before , into practical solutions .
Decions make sense how to plan their life and reach to a point .

A hard working person , who has given the right decions and reached the success would be happy .
Because the life plays many games on people and not everybody can suffer from , but the luckiest ones do .
It is really so hard to be successful .
So a successful person does n't take much risk .

For example , the person , to be a doctor , an engineer or any other difficult proffession , should work hard , spend more time on the education than having fun and traveling outside etc in the period of being a student .
After beginning to make money and may be marriage and having babies , he would thank God that he has a job makes money and earns enough for his family .
So he would n't risk a successfull life story but just do what they have already learned in a tough way .
Successful people are the ones , who does , what they know how to do well .

But the lazy people can not reach success that easily .
Becasue they have not been well educated and have not been qualified , they can not gain abilities to survive the life .
They find life to be very difficult about money just because not having a good job because of the lack of education .
In this point of view , such people who has not much ability but has the only chance to be rich easier , for instance to gamble their whole money or find a way of making legal money by business , may take risks rather than doing what they already know how to do well .
Despite they have nothing doing well , so they have nothing to loose .
