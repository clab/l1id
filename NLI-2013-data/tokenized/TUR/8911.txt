As time goes by , many different education syles are coming up .
They all aim to develop the learning process .
The future of our society will be destined with our young generation ; therefore they should be given all the materials to improve themselves .
Nowadays there are two conflicting ideas about how to teach the students , to let them learn facts or to focus on the understanding of each concept .
I definitely agree that it is more important to really understand the causes , the effects and the context of an issue , because it encourages self effort , research and improves learning .

First of all , the students need to learn to do things on their own .
They have to work on it and participate in the learning process .
If the teachers just give the handouts to the children and let them memorize each fact , they would not benefit from it .
The teacher should make them think , how this fact relates with the other topics .
To take advantage from the lecture students need to generate ideas about it on their own .

Second , the students will be encouraged to do research , when they get the concepts and ideas .
The student might know that there is a fact of ` gravity ' , but if he also knows how Isaac Newton has found it , which thinking ways he tracked and reached this solution , he will have the ambition to go further and try to create concepts of his own .

Last thing to mention is about the efficieny of learning , Facts or formulas , which have been only memorized , are forgotten in a short time .
But if the student is familiar with the concept and understands it fully , he can remember it even many years later .

To conclude , we should be really careful about how we approach the students when teaching them , because it can affect our future and the best way to equip them with the information they need seems to making sure that they go beyond facts and get the concepts and ideas .
