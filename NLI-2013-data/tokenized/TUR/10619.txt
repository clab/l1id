Throughout the history , there have been many successful people who have tried new things and taken risks instead of doing what they already know .
It is also argued whether the reason of this behavior is .
In my opinion , it is fairly true that most of these people do try new things .

The first reason why they try new things is that they really feel that they are mainly satisfied with the subject they are already specialised in .
Many scholars point out that the rewards obtained , appreciation of public opinion and that person ' s surrounding make this successful person feel that he or she has done so many things and accomplished his or her mission .
In other words , the main objective that he or she has aspired to succeed is done and there is no more steps to thrive .
Because we are all humans and want to taste the good side of life , we want to be whipped by an external force to continue .
That is why people who have already accomplished their objectives want to see new ones that will keep them fit and ambitious .

The second reason why I allege that successful people try new things is that they want to thrive much complex , hard and far - fetched seemed objectives that have not accomplished by someone yet .
Seeking out a new but also harder aim drives these people to focus on a risk - taking objective .

Lastly , these people seriously feel that they had to prove everyone that they have not achieved all objectives and have made through any hardships by luck ; they have done everything with their own aimable disposition .
That is why they want to show their surrounding that even a thrill - seeking and harder objective is not difficult for them .

In conclusion , it is vital to note that these successful people have already showed that they are qualified and prosperous ; but they want to achieve a harder one that will keep them striving to succeed another objective and also prove others that the current position of these successful people is not a simple luck .
