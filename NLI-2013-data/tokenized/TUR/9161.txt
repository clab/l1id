I must say taht I am totally disagree with the statement given .
Ideas and concepts are fictional , created thoughts on specific questions .
These are developed by someone and might be accepted as a fact in the society even not at the beginning .
For example `` democracy '' .
In modern societies concept of democracy has created its own myht .
We see democracy as an ideal which all people should respect its institutions and live according to its rules .
In our eyes democracy is universal .

However , only 64 years ago , in the heart of Europe a man raised his voice against the democracy and millions followed him despite his brutulness paved the way for a war massacered millions who followed him and other millions from different nations .
The reasonne behind this is the ignorance of the facts of German people devoting themselves to the ideas and concepts of race superiority , dictatorship and Fuhrer .
Under the brutal regime of Hitler junta , they not only ignored what happened to their neighbours but told their children to do so also .
Hitler was successful because he could play with the ideas and concepts as he liked .

What I mean is as the ideas concepts are the products of whether an individual or a society they may not reflect the rights or the facts everytime .
They show most of the time what the bulk of people think , but these thoughts might have nothing to do with the facts .

A solid education system must be based on the facts as well as ideas and concepts .
If we do not give the chance students to learn facts and the concepts and ideas built on them one part of the education will always be missed .
I remember when I was at school of law .
Roman Law was one of the toughest of the lessons , especially the relations in the families .
As a concept Roman Law , in my opinion , alone cannot explain the fictitious relations between for example bride and her father in-law .
In ancient Rome when brides come to his husbands family , she is accepted not as a bride , but however as the daughter of the patria familias .
To understand the reasons we must look at the facts provided us by history and sociology .

To sum up , my own experiences has shown me that learning of the ideas and concepts must walk in hand with the facts in education system .
Otherwise easily misguided by wrong ideas , students might not find what the real world is .
