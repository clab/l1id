I do n't agree because first its under conditions law , second to able to make an effective advertisement needs money .
And that means if you are successfull you have money and you can make advertisement .
Third if an advertisement is lying that will increase sales for short term .
In long run consumer will chose the trustable producer .
So the advertisement can'not be in sight in long run .

First the advertisements are under control of law .
it has very big punnishments to lie costumers .
Everyone had paid attention to to the speaches at the end of advertisements like `` batteries not included '' or `` each sold seperately '' .
Of corse that 's not the biggest example to the laws about consumer protection .
but they haveto tell people even if it 's just battery .

My second arguement is money .
If you want to make good advertisement you will need a lot of money .
In turkey there was a TV mafia serial named `` Kurtlar vadisi '' .
At the final of the serial Sharon Stone and Andy Garcia was acted as the worlds mafia leaders .
And the producer paid 500 000 $ each of them .
that means 1 million dolars for one and half hours TV serial .
Producers efford this crazy amount of money from advertisements .
And the firms make the advertisement are really big and successfull companies .
To became successfull you have to be honest to your customers .

Third if producers lie costumers it make the sales better at the test time .
After then the sales will reduce .
And every one will remember the company as a lier .
Do you pay attention how many advertisement we saw in a short time and we never heard this companies again .
This is like natural selection .
If you are good you can live As the examples companies cannot cheat the costumers by advertisement .
Exactly no one expect wings from red bull its a little bit commedy .
Everyone can understand that I think
