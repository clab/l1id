Car usage gets larger and larger in time being but in my opinion in twenty years there will be less cars in use that there are today .
There are several reasons why I think so .

First of all cars consume fuel oil while working , this will became the main restriction of car usage in twenty years since the price of fuel oil gets higher due to lack of founding it around the world .
Moreover , usage of fuel oil causes environmental pollution due to the carbonmonoxides provided after fuel gas usage .
Even if some people believe that there will be a solution of this problem with new energy sources like natural gases since it will affect the performance of the car I think natural gas usage wo n't be preffered by users .

The second main problem with car usage will be the lack of parking places around the world .
If the number of cars gets larget the people will not found places to park them and would preffer to travel with something else for example buses insead of individual cars .

Third the recovery of cars gets expensive and harder in time being .
Since solid waste aroun the world becomes a bigger problem in time being production of solid waste will be tried to reduced expecially by goverments .
This situation will cause highering the taxes of cars and this will affect the car owners badly .
As a result people will not prefer to buy a car .

Fourth and last I think that technology will improve in twenty years such that there will be new and usable transport vehicles around the world used insted of cars like smalll personal planes etc .
This will cause a reduction of car need .

To sum up , in my opinion expenses of car usage , environmental problems that car usage cause and developing alternatives to the cars with improved technology will cause a reduction in car usage in twenty years .
