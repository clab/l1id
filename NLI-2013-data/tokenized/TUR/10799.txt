In order to be successful , do we need to try new things ?
Or , should we stick to what we know how to do best ?
Do n't we have an intirinsic cruiosity ?
So , what makes us frightened to try new things or should we be brave enough to chose not to do what we already know best ?
Could we imagine any progression if we did not try any new thing ?
As a successful commander Sir Winston Chirchill has a saying : `` The first of all values of man is courage '' .
I agree that in order to be succesful people should be brave and try new things .

Let us first look at to the history and pick up Mr. Edison .
He invented the lamb after tryind 2000 different ways leading him to dissappointment .
He tried `` 2000 new things '' and came up with the lamb .
Likewise , we can consider Darwin and his theory against creavitism .

Besides , being historically proved our intrinsic cruiosity always leads us to try new things .
People always wonder about what we do not have or what we have never seen .
We wonder what it feels to be Popstar , or we go on a vacation to see a part of the world .
Since it is our nature why should we resist it .
It is like to be a carnivoriuos loin !
Can you imagine such a lion survive or become successful .

In order to be successful people should try new things .
