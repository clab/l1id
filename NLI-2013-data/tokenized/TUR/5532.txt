Yes advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
We can cahange their seem with computers ot other Think about an apple , you can find it everywhere so what should you do to sell more apple .

So more people can buy it .

Or think about a washing machine you have washing machine factory but your machines quality is n't good .
So how can you sell them .
You must take an advertisement video about how your machines are very good and say some lies then give it to tv channels to show the people you can sell lots of machine and you can add your money to money .

Yes there are also good products which have advertisements if you have one of these products it 's no problem you can sell it very easily but you have n't got good products you must make better advertisements .

But there is one thing importent after you sell your bad product you could n't sell it again to the customers who bought it , So it would be nice to sell really good products .

How can we understand that a product is really bad ?
of course it would be cheaper then the good one .
Ancient Britishes say that `` i 'm not a rich enough to buy a cheap product `` .
What a true phrase is n't it ?

So we must n't buy cheap and unusefull things that we watch their attractive advertisements on tv we must first search their quality then we can buy them , So bussinnessmen may be do n't sell us bad products .
