There are lots of people in the world .
Some of them just do what they already exactly know how to do well because they affraid of doing something new .
They find that it is risky and also they think to not succeed .
However , the situation is a bit more different from just their tought .
If you look life of so many today 's famaous successful people , you will easily see that they did not make only one job , they change over their jobs without affraid to not be successful .

I do not give you a familiar example .
I try to write life of my best friend and his decisions .
Name of my friend is Ahmet .
He was attended to Industrial engineering department of Marmara University .
He gone to his school two years and one they he decided to change his department to Computer Sciences which is really different from his own department .
Subsequently , he worked hard and indeed he also attended to that department which he had wanted .
After he graduated , he start to work as a refree for soccer games which was directly diverse with his educational department .
He took to step very rapidly and raised to linesman position of Turkish super league into five years .
Do you understand now what i mean ?
He made a lot of changes in his life .
Eventually , he reaches the success .
I think he may change its job someday in the future .
However , I always believe that he will succeed whatever he does .

In conclusion , I want to tell be not afraid when you made decisions which affected whole your life .
Only be diligent and make what you want to do .
You see you can succeed just like Ahmet .
