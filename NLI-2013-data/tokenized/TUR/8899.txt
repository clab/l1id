I agree the idea that it is more significant for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
First of all , many of the students would prefer the easier and quicker way of understanding .
Understanding ideas and concepts is easier for a student to manage the information .
If a student learns a new thing , she or he would first ask the ideas and concepts of the thing to realize the conditions of the new information .
This way always seems more practical to the students .
I also would prefer this way , since understanding the main idea by explaining both ideas and concepts would make me understand more easily .
Facts are longer and harder way for most students .
Since learning a fact contains many details in itself , it would be more complex for a student .
Learning facts also takes longer period than it does in understanding ideas and concepts .
This is mainly because of its complexity .
If I would be introduced to a new topic , and given the specific information by learning facts , it would take me longer and harder to learn that topic .
Because I have to analyze the fact first and then the related things that effect the fact .
However , to understand ideas and concepts would supply me in realizing the new topic by giving specific information by ideas and concepts .
