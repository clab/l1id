In normally , as a nature of fact , young people and older people have some different ideas and approaches even to the same situation .
Therefore , I completely aggree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This is because due to the following reasons .

To begin with , young people and older people have different attitudes and experiences , so they are not expected to behave similar against the same situation .
For instance , young people can try to enjoy life by travelling , dancing , doing so many sport activities such as swimming , tracking , skiing and so on .
However , in general , older people think to live a more stable or routine life and they usually do not want to enjoy life by doing whatever young people do .

Furthermore , young and older people of course have different metabolism which means their hormones are really different to each others ' .
Therefore , one can not usually expect to someone , age of 75 , to make bungee jumping from a skyscraper but as you guess , a young boy try to feel this adrenalin in his vessels by jumping from 250 feet height .

Moreover , similar to these , young people have no such a hard responsibilities for their families or someone around them .
However , many older people are grandmother and grandfather so they always have to think not only themselves but also their childrens and grand children .
For example , think a boy , at the age of 15 , he/she can go to a holiday for two or three months with his/her friends because if the schools are closed , they have a great time to make whatever they want , but older people have a limited time to do so .

In the ligth of above discussion , last but not at least , I wish to conclude by saying that young people enjoy life more than older people due to their different experiences , different hormonal metabolisms and different responsibilities as well .
Therefore , as a young and dynamic boy , I try to do whatever and whenever I want because I do not want to say when I am 65 years old that I wish ...
