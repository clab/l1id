Many of the people in the world think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , some of the people think that older people enjoy life more than young people do .
I aggre with that older people enjoy life more than young people do , because of that they know time is very fast and life gives people only one time .

Young people always have problems with their life .
they never think time is very fast .
they only live without scare of death .
for example i and my friend always have problems .
because of our promblem many of time we dont want to do any things .
we often speks about our problems .
we think to go to holiday for reducing from stress .
nonethless we post pone it to other summer and other summer never come so we never go to anywhere .

On the other hand , older people think time is very fast .
For an example my grandmother always tells me she didnt understand how was she be a older woman .
She says that ` i fell myself as a young girl if i had a change to live life again i would travel all over the world` .
she always goes cinema for to watch movies .
she goes abroad often to visit other countries which she did'nt go before .
moreover my grandfather is too interesting old man.he is a good tenis playe .
He plays tenis every day .
he takes lot of interesting photos to tell life .

To sum up , like my grandmother and garadfather older people lenjoyl
