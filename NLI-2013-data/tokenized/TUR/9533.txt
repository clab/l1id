Sucecesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
trying new things and taking risks are the significant parts of the succes ' i completely agree with this idea and my arguments for that point are listed as follows

Firstly , humanbeing has been trying many new things since the initial days of the life this is the source of the improvement , for instance the telephone is invented by graham bell , why ?
because he was looking for a nwe thing which he needs in his life and it was completely new thing maybe he took risks because it wouldnt be a succesfsful device and after the bell we communication improved and for the present there are mobile phones in our lifes also mobile phone was the new thing before 5 years but now we are looking for some new things ..
admittedly graham bell is a succesful person because he tried new thing and took risk

Secondly , being stable is like a death , movement is the foundationstone of the world .
hence the person who doesnt perform anything in his life has to fall down ` for instance foreign languages i have been learnin italian for 2 years , at first it was a new idea for me and i took a risk because of the limited speaking region of italian but i spend many times to learn it and for the present i am working in italian company , i am not sure that if i am succesful person but exactly it effected my carrier .

To sum up ; succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
because they know that the world never stops even is known how to turn arround it .
