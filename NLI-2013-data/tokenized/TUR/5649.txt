With the increasing of instant communication , advertisements have become much popular .
And nowadays most of the adverts are shown by TVs .
These advertisements includes from very useful products to the products that cause regretfull days for customers .

There are so many situations we are encountering today .
How many of us rushed to a market to buy a very simple product that pulled us like a magnet ?
It can be a pen or a HI-FI .
It does n't matter .
But there are many other products that do the same job like the adverted materials .
And also , they can be much cheaper than the adverted one .
But it does n't matter .
Once we are hypnotised with the advertisement on a TV channel , no one can make us buy the other crappy thing , or it seems like a crappy thing .

So many feedbacks are made by the customers till today about lots of unsatisfactory things .
And what is more ; these can be a material that was being advertised over media .
I also encountered such problems .
Once I brought back a bad book that became very interesting for me with an advertisement before I bought it over Internet .
This was becouse of that shinny advertisement .
If I had see the book in a store before , I would even never touch its cover with my precious fingers .
It was just a game played over those easly effected customers who watch advertisements , like me .

Also , there are so many movies that we wanted to see them so much and jumped into the cinema saloon and running away with an incredible speed after the credits .
Even there are lots of people rushes to the exit door of the saloon during the movie breaks and never come back who ca n't resist .
But as you think ; these movies had been advertised so successifully before the watchers spent their hard earned money .

In conclusion , it is possible to show a product much more better than they really are with an advertisement .
As this happens so much , especially nowadays , do n't buy a product or go to a cinema or even reserve a holiday before hearing some comments .
