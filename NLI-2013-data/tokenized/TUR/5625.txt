The humankind always need to buy supplies , meterials or food to live .
Advertisements are playing a big part in people 's choises of buying food , materials or supplies .
There is lots of arguments about the topic which we are discussing about .
Some people assumed that while advertising something you always have to describe the quality of something .
In that case they think that advertisors is always telling the truth .
But some of us thinks that advirtisors are not saying the truth about something they advertise .
I agree with the second idea .
I have very important reasons and examples to prove it .
These are my following reasons .

Firstly , advirtisors are not telling the truth because they want to eleminate the prize factor .
For example , if I were an advertisor and if my products are very expensive , I will describe the qualities of the product and I will never talk about the prize .
And sometimes i will not tell the truth about my product .
So people will think that product is in high quality , it is normal that product is expensive too .

In adittion to this , advirtisors want to advertise their company .
They show their products much better than they really are , to advertise their company .
So people will believe that the company is good enough to product this value of products .
In that case people will always choose this companie 's products .

The last but not the least , sometimes advertisors lie about the prize too .
They are making complicated sales and advantages to sell the product .
But usually in this sales and advantages people are buying item or product much more expensive .
In this situations , advertisors always mixing our head .

All in all , I would like to say that advirtisors are not telling the truth both of eleminating the prize factor , advertising their company as well as to make complicating sales and advantages .
