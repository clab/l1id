In today 's academic world , one can see increased specification among different disciplines : even in the same discipline there are different subfields on which academicians focus .
Although it is a great way to progress within one field , the disadvantages should also be considered before taking a stance on the issue of the benefits and drawbacks of specification in knowledge / Medical doctors can be used as metaphors while talking about the profundity of the knowledge .
On the one hand , general health of a society depends on the general practitioners who can prevent diseases or give advice for healthy living to the public besides diagnosing and curing basic illnesses .
On the other hand , the medical knowledge is extended to a degree that it is virtually impossible that one person could have all the information available on each and every problem which can occur within the human body .
A specialist can come into the scene where a practitioner 's knowledge about a health issue is insufficient to cure an illness .
Since a specialist is able to know more profoundly on a topic and has more time to be more up-to-date about an issue , he or she will be more help in solving the problem .

It is important to keep in mind that generalists are as important as specialists .
Since speciallists concentrate deeply on an issue by making extensive research in their area of expertise , they tend to forget to see the broader picture .
On the contrary , generalists are able to see the broader picture more easily since they have more limited knowledge about a lot of things .
Seeing from a broader perspective can help people to raise some questions about what is necessary and what is not in terms of scientific reaserch for example .
It can be argued that inventions such as birth control pills are initiated by the general need for an effective mean to prevent unwanted pregnancies .
As an invention which changed a lot of peoples ' lives in posotive terms would not be available if the progress was only depended on specialists who concentrate only one issue .

It is clear that we live in a time where extensive knowledge is accumulated through the course of humanity .
It is very different from the times that it was possible to be a Rennaissance man where Loenardo for example could make paintings and do designs and inventions at the same time .
However , we still need people in academia who know a lot about the general course of the history as well as specialists who know deeply on a given topic .
We need them both to progress .
