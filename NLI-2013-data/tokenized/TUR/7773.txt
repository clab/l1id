There are huge gaps between cultures in the world .
You should behave differently in different countries .
For example ; You can drink alcohol in the street in Europe but you can not drink it in Canada .
Without knowing these things you may be in a trouble .

Finally , if an unfortunate thing happens while you are in a different country , you would not know what to do and you would need anybody to help you .
A guide helps you because he is responsible for everybody in his group .

For me , it is important to have backup that 's why I chose to travel with a
