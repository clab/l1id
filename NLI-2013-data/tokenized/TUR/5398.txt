I completely agree with the statement you have made .
The companies make big investments either on research and development or their workers and they think that it is their right to gain economical benefit out of this by means of advertisements .

First of all , there are many brands in the market that sell products in the same area of interest .
As a consequence of this , the firms need to diversify their products among others and they make use of the advertisements .
Although a product of one firm is n't good enough and well qualified , one may be astonished to watch this advertisement trailer on a television and make a decision to buy that product even if he/she does not need it .

Secondly , in order to persuade the customers that they have the best product presented in the market , these firms invest much money on the production of an ad .
They work with professionals when developing the movie , hire famous people and celebrities that are appreciated and loved so that these celebrities make the people believe that the product they are presenting has cutting edge quality and reasonable price .
These people also aim the children and the youth who are easily get affected and have great influence on their parents when they are making a purchase decision .
These companies have a great knowledge in human psychology so they are trying to do their best to persuade the customers and make their products sold .
They also arrange some campaings that would attract the people .

Next , after your purchase you may see that the product you have bought is not as good as it was seen on television .
Some firms are trustable and some are not and as a result of this you might feel disappointed .

As a result , companies try to sell their products and make money and the thing that a customer should do is to buy from a trustable company and prefer its products ,
