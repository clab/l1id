In my opinion , young people can enjoy life more than older people because of three main reasons which are health , willingness for living faster and more enjoyable and having less responsibilities for in life .

To begin with , it is a biological fact that as the human becomes older his/her health problem increases directly .
As a result of this fact older people have many and different kinds of health problem and these problems prevent people to live in a comfortable way .
For example , if a person is a lung cancer , he/she can not enjoy the life because there is a big problem in his/her health .
On the other hand , young people genarally do not have health problems so that they can do whatever they want .

Secondly , young people have the willingness for living faster and more enjoyable because they have independent and new ideas about life .
For instance , they may want to go to Himalaya mountain for camping and there is nothing to prevent them for going .
However old people do not want such a hard thing because they usually have no energy for that activity and want to stay at home .

Finally , young people have less responsibilities in life .
In other words they are living more independent from other people .
They do not have children or wife to look after or usually their only job is school and they can make lots of plans after school for holidays .
These situations make young people more free and they have many different and creative plans for life .

In conclusion , for living more enjoyable and different life , being a young person has a great importance because young people genarally have no health problems , they have a willing to live faster and more enjoyable than old people and they have less responsibilities in life and for their environment .
