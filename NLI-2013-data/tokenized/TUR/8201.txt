Students always discusss the what we learn from this lessons and always ask each other that can we understand main subjects or concepts .
However these are the wrong questions .
The right questions must be taht it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
I believe that to be able to understand main ideas and concepts is more important to see more easilly see and understand facts of the life and to apply the concepts daily life

Firstly ; to understand the main concepts and ideas is important to learn basic pincibles of the lessons and world .
Knowing only the facts is not benificial to see how thi fact is formed .
Hwever ; if students learn main concepts and ideas they can see and find their facts easily .
To illustrate , without knowing and understanding ideas conceppts of Newton 's law student can not explain the reason falling of an apple from tree .

Secondly , for the following life of students , business life , knowing only the facts is not enough .
At business life , people face with different problems so without understanding concepts of the subjects a oeron can not solve the problem that faced with .
To illustrate in an cement factory , temperature of the kiln must be preserved and controlled .
if there is a problem an engineer shoul b solve the problem .
To solve the problem , it is not enough the know temperature change will give damage the system .
An enginer must be understand all system and basic princibles of the kiln and other instrument of the kiln .
Furthermore , he orshe must be understand basic concepts of teh energy to attempt th problem .

To sum up , for students understanding only facts is not enough .
Besides knowing facts , students should be learn and understand basic ideas and concepts of the subjects and matters .
This makes easy to daily life in business wo
