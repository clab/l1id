Some poeple think young people enjoy more than old people in life , so do I. Old people know the value of life .
They have a lot of experiences .
They know that when they enjoy with life , they lose somethings .
But , young people can not know they will be loser , when they begin to enjoy with life .

To me , all people enjoy life when they are young .
Because , young people neither know , nor consider value of life .
For instance , in Turkey all young people go to the parties , at all .
They spend their time on fun .
If you go to a club in Turkey , you can see young people , but you cannot see older people .

In addition to this example , older people prefer to rest , rather than to go to enjoy .
For instance , in here , old people become retired when they spend a lot of years to work .
After that , they are usually found , or seen at their houses .
Because they find their houses more comfortable than out of home .
But young people use different method , when they are tired .
For instance , in my university , there are parties at the end of all semesters .
All students at the university are found at these parties .
On the other example , young people do n't want to be their houses , when they are tired or angry to anything .
I usually drive my car , when I am not happy .
I like to do speed with my car .
If I become my house during bad time , I become worse .

Finally , young people spend more time to enjoy than older people .
Because , when people are young they do n't know that they will be loser when they spend time on fun , rather than on studying , or on working .
That is to say , people learn the value of life from youngster to oldster .
When young people become old people , they start to spend less time on fun than before .
