Before i begin to write about my opinion i would like to axplain the statements within help of some examples .
To me ideas are the basic structures of behaviours .
Before you act you always have an idea .
For example if you want to become a succesfull lawyer , you have to have the idea to attend to a law school and graduate with good grades and also you have to be socially alive .

I believe that understanding ; even knowing the ideas and the concepts do n't help us to reach to the facts all the time .
Sometimes whatever we do , wo n't be enough for living the facts .

Facts are learned by living , not by ideas or concepts .
For example imagine that you know what an orange is made of .
Or let 's say that the things that we know about orange is - it 's colour , that it 's juicy - is it enough for us to tell about it 's taste ?
Of course not .
Our ideas about orange ca n't make us think about the orange 's taste .
In the end taste is the fact here and the only way we can reach to that fact is by tasting it .

I believe that not only students , but also all people can learn the facts by living , not only knowing the ideas and concepts .
In the world we are living now , all that matters in the end , is the fact .
We need money to survive = that is a fact .
I can earn money by working as a barmaid = that is an idea But what if the idea do n't work ?
There are some things in the world that we ca n't learn them only by ideas and concepts .
What we need is the one hundred percent fact .
Facts hurt people , facts make people happy , facts even kill people .
Another example , when we steal , the place we belong is jail .
That is another fact .
It has nothing to do with ideas and concepts .
People learn from facts and facts make people avoid from making mistakes again .

As i briefly stated above , to me learning facts are more important than understanding ideas and concepts .
