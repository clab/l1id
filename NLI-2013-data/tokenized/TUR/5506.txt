Advertising a product is an effective way for companies to increase their revenue by displaying their products or services in various ways ( TV commercials , posters , shows , etc ... ) .
It can be argued that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Advertisements will never show the disadvantages or problems with a product that is being displayed .
The company of the specific product will only show the positive side of the picture , whereby they will exaggerate upon the advantages of the product .
This is only natural , as they are trying to sell their product and in order to accomplish this , they need to catch the eye of the consumer .
For example , advertisements or commercials of SUVs are always over-the-top .
They will show their SUVs going on the worst possible terrains , showing how effective they are and they will always point out small details that make it `` the best in the world '' or `` better than their rivals '' .
They also point out that their SUV is the one for everyone .
That may not be neccessarily true , as everybody has their own tastes and not everybody is forced to like the same thing .

The specific advertisement i talked about will never show how reliable the SUV is or what problems one can encounter compared with it 's rivals .
Whenever a price is given of the product ( for example an SUV ) , that price is usually the basic model or the minimum that wo n't get the consumer much .
In other words , they are cheating in a way because a consumer who becomes interested in the SUV will find out that for all the facilities the SUV has in the advertisement , there will be a big increase in the money paid from the price given in the advertisement .

The companies know how weak the consumer can be once a successful advertisement of a product is given and will therefore make the product look like it 's the ultimate thing to have .
Their only aim is to make the consumer buy the product .
They do not neccessarily care about what happens after the purchase , as the company has already benefited from the profit being made .

All of the above supports my opinion on agreeing with the statement that most advertisements do make products seem much better than they actually are , as they do not give the consumer a clear idea of what the product is really like .
