I believe that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
It follows that , learning the facts is ineffective for the student as the memorized facts would easily be forgotten .
However , students will not forget what they learn if they understand the ideas or concepts .
Now I shall state the benefits of understanding ideas and concepts rather than facts .
Firstly , a student should try to understand the idea beneath a certain fact in order to remember how that idea works and leads to that fact .
What I mean by this is that , if a student learns the reasons-concepts of a fact it will be much easier for him to use that knowledge in the future as he can use the concepts to reach to the fact .
Secondly , learning concepts makes it easier for a student to see the whole picture or in other words to look in a broader perspective .
It follows that , learning through a systematic path will be more usefull for the student as through generalization and specialization students may learn better .
For instance , when I was in high school I was not able to memorize the mathematical facts such as theorems but then I found it more easy to learn these theorems through learning certain concepts and ideas that are related to those facts .
Furthermore , learning the concepts and ideas appear to be more important as the facts will not be used in daily life situations .
What I mean by this is that as people do need to cope with the problems of life by themselves , it will be more reasonable to teach them the ideas and concepts in order to provide them a model by dealing with their problems .
It follows that , facts do not make students clever although they make them wise .
However , the ideas and concepts can make the students clever if they try to adopt these in their lives .
To sum up , learning the concepts and ideas appear to be more important as they provide a long-lasting and effective learning .
Therefore , instead of learning facts students should try to learn the ideas and concepts as they can remember these in the future and use them for acquiring the facts they need .
Last but not least , systematical learning is the key to achieve success so learning ideas and concepts provide this systematical learning .
