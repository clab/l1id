Success is about struggling about problems .
If it was so easy , then it would n't be success .
That 's why , it is very important people to try new things and take risks rather than only doing usual things to succeed .

Everybody learns new things since he or she was borned .
Here , the point is to use these information accurately .
People easily get used to the information they know .
They get some habits easily as well .
So they start to live with a rutin life .
Because it is not hard , it is so well-known .
When they have to face a diffuculty , they surprice , they do not know what to do .
They do not want to change their lives .

However , a person who always takes risks and tries new things , only tries to understand the situation .
He or she first makes sure that knows the problem .
Than that person thinks about solutions .
If it is needed , then takes risks or struggles .

I believe that life is full of difficulties .
Nobody serves success to people in a tray .
Therefore , people are always ready to face difficulties .
They should not prevent them to achieve their goals .
I strongly believe that to be successful is only about working hard , not about chance or not about capacity .
For example , one of my nephews is very smart .
at school , he only listens the teacher .
He does n't take notes or even does n't ask any question .
After that , if he studies at home only once in a week , he passes all his tests .
But if he does n't studies until his tests , he never passes even though he is very smart .
He has to try too .

Another example is my best friend .
She inspires me a lot .
She recommends me something all the time .
I listen her very carefully .
Because she has lots of experiences .
Her family is not a wealthy family .
So , since the beginning of her life she had finacial problems .
She got worried a lot .
But , it never stopped her for anything .
She could n't take any private lesson to prepare to college .
But after the college exam , we won the same colege .
Now , she work hard to make her other dreams true .

In conclusion , I met many successful people .
The one common thing I saw on them was to believe to try new things .
It brings success .
If people do not take risks , it will be hard them to achieve their goals .
Trying new things always teach new things that might help people in somewhere in their lives .
