I live in Istanbul .
It is a city that there are lots of energy due to young population .
There are lots of bars , diskos etc .
I mean , Istanbul 's social life athached with young population .
This provides young person to an entertaning life .
So , they love and enjoy the life more than older people .

First of all , being young is a strange thing .
You 're slowly get in life , seeing lifes ' good sides and bad sides .
Also you do n't have much experiences about life .
So , you are following life , but you do n't know where it is going .

In addition to that , nice and enjoying things are coming very nice to you .
You are driving car for the first time , maybe you have your first sex experience etc .
These are very beautiful experiments .
You get exited when you do them all for the first time .
These kind of examples makes person much life liker .

At last but not least , older people also enjoying life .
They are travelling world , trying to find new things and trying to find more exitement things .
However , many of them can not finding what they are looking for because , whatever they are gonna find is familiar to them .
This situation breaks their hope of course .

In conclusion , young people loves to live .
They are addicted to live .
Like a man says `` the more you enjoy , then you die '' .
I guess he is right , a man can not continue to get enjoy from everything in his life .
