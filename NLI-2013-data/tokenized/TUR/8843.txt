Nowadays , a lot of students waste time to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because of several reasons .
The first and most crucial reason is school education system because in the exams student need only ideas not facts .
In my country is a very good example to support this idea since our exams in schools include only ideas and concepts instead of including facts and we take mark only ideas .
If we know only ideas we can take good marks and we can our family members happy .
Becasuse of these reasons we do not take care of learning facts .

The second reasons why understanding ideas is more important for student is that to be a successful person in the comming days .
My country is the best one to explain this idea .
If you were a successful student in your school life and you graduated from a well known university , bosses of holdings accept your application and they do not interested in anything about you .
Furthermore if you want to enter a well known university you should only understand ideas and should be successful Universty Enternce Exam .
To achieve these you need only to understand ideas and concepts .

To sum up , understanding ideas and concepts are more important than to learn facts because edutatinal system wants it .
Thus student pay attension to understand ideas .
Altough learning facts are very important , students do not waste time to learn facts because it is not enough to be successful .
