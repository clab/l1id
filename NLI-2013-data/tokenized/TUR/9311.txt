Understanding ideas and concepts are more important for some students .
On the contrary , learning facts are more important for other students .
That is a very complex issue because it depents on the persons .
However , I agree the first statement because of some reasons .

First of all , a student have to understand the ideas and concepts .
After that he can learn and understand facts better .
For example , when I was in the university , our teacher told us ideas and concepts .
After the lesson , we learned facts by our selves .
As a result of this , we could set an interaction between them easily .

Second , people can understand ideas and concepts more quickly .
Furthermore , they can get them more easily because facts can change but ideas and concepts can not change .
Namely , ideas and concepts are basics .
For instance , while I was preparing to the toefl exam , first I studied to the concept of the exam .
Then I started exercising and I saw that that is better .

Consequently , I think understanding concepts and ideas are more important .
Also they are more understandable than facts .
If you understand the ideas and concepts clearly , you can also get the facts easily .
