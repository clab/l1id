I would like to point out that I disagree with this statement .
As a matter of fact you have to learn in school or at the university the basics in each course .
It would be unproductive to start at the end of a special topic .

As an illustration I would like to mention that I study medicine in hannover .
I am in the fifth year of my studies and accomplished about 250 oral and practical tests in a lot of courses .
In my opinion I could say that I have a special knowledge in a lot of medical fields .
As everybody knows is medicine a fluent topic and there is a lot of research going on .
You have to read a lot of abstracts and surely you learn to build your own different view of the world .

Regarding the statement I tend to talk about my doctor thesis , which I began two weaks ago .
Above all it describes certain areas of the Brain and their functions .
I have to read a lot of books about this topic and later on I will prepare any virtual experiments with mouses .

Actually I can relate on my fundamental knowledge of five years of study .
There are some new ideas and also theories concerning my researches so I have to spend a lot of time dealing with those .

According to my dissertation I could not imagine doing it without any medical skills .
First of all you start with a and then you end with the z. It is not conversely .

Furtherore , I think that ideas reveal under specific circumstances .
Only when you consider these circumstances you can probably understand the main point of this idea .

As a conclusion I would like to say the better your general knowledge about a topic is , the more you can talk .
