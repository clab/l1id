I do n't agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

On the other hand , old ages are the best times for enjoying life .
The very struggles that kept you away from enjoying life is gone .
There may be some problems but at old ages people have wisdom and experience to deal with these new problems .

So old people enjoy life more than
