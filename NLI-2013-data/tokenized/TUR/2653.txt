It is generally hold as true that young people enjoy life more than older peolple do .
Magazine articles explaining how to enrich your life are mainly addressed to young people .
In the movies telling stories about different ways of life full of adventures , the actors are young most of the time .
The viewers are generally the youth again .
It is widely accepted by the public that the young people strive to make the most of their lives more than the elderly do .

One of the reasons for this conception is that young people , of couse , have more energy than the older people do .
They have more energy to travel from one place to another , to explore different cultures and countries , to do sports from swimming to playing football from climbing to other extreme sports .
They also feel more energetic than older people when it comes to taking part in different kinds of social activities like dancing or going out at night for a party .

Another reason suppoting this point of view is that older people have a much wider exprerience than the young ones .
Let us take a family for example .
The parents are always less fastidious in making decisions where to travel for vacation , whereas the children are more enthusiastic .
A father will not enjoy playing football as much as his son does .
A child will be more excited on his first day at school than his mother or father on their first day of a new job .
The reason behind all these is that older people have already experinced all these occasions .
While a young person is experiencing something general in life for the very fisrt time , a grown up will not be enjoying as much as the young one does .
Furthermore more , it is psychologically proved that the more times one expreriences some kind of occasion that provokes different feelings , the more he gets used to it .

Consequently , young people do enjoy life more than older people do because they have much more energy and enthusiasm to experience something new , which provides them with different feelings each time .
