The answer is this questions depends on ur own likes , hobbies and life experiences .
In my point of view ; i dont agree with this statement beacuse i like the motor sports and enginees .
Im a mechanical engineer .
Even if the most people dont use cars in the future ; im sure that i wont leave this habit , im going to use cars in the future .
I know my answer is emotional .
The techonologhy is getting more modern everyday .
And the word pollulation is growing up too .
Because of the traffic problem we need to use puplic transporting vechiles like metro or bus .
There are a lot cars on the streets and its really hard to travel by car .
For example travelling by metro is really easer than the indivual one .
And in twenty years the trains will be faster than now .

Acutally im not sure about we are going to use cars in twenty years .
Maybe we will use different type of cars in the future which have the ability of flying .
Its really early to say thats kind of firm ideas like that .

Now we use cruise control in our cars and there are a lot of system that can help to driver .
Who knows whats gonna happen next ?
The most important important reason that i need to suppose this statment is technologhy .
The scientists are working for transporting objects with the speed of light and they succeed about transpoting lights .
Now the turn is for physical objects .
Im sure that they are going to solve this problem and then we will able to travel faster , Needless to say , there will be fewer cars than there are today .
And this the right thing about our future .
Because the world temprature is rising up by cars or which are using oil .
If we want to stop this we need to find different inventions better than cars
