Cars Using With In The 20 Years
In twenty years there will be less cars in use than there are today .
I strongly agree with this statement .
In twenty yearss people must be responsible about their environment and they can reduce to use bad things .

Nowadays , thechnology development very fast , No one think about , twenty years ago , to use an internet and to reach milions of knowledge less than one minute , And i can believe that in twenty years we use different veichles differ from the cars .
We have to because we have lots of reasons to do it .

First of all , oil stock is almost finishing and the scientist seek out the alternative energy supplies .
So , not maybe in twenty years but it occurs very soon , we can use different transportation .
It is very nice to use different things .
Secondly , people knows that this type of transportation cause a pollution .
Not only damage the environment but also the people influence it .
Therefore peole get sick very easily .
If we don not give back bad environment to the children , we have to solve this problem .
Moreover , cars also cause a traffic problems everyday .
When you are live in a big city , in the morning it is too difficult to go to work .
Sometimes when the traffic too heavy , it takse two hours to go work .

In addition , scientists are working a different types of transportation , Forexample they can use solar energy and they try to make a different veichles .
Maybe in twenty years people start to use this type of veichles .
Why not ?
It can be excitement .

In conclusion , in twenty years people use fewer cars than today .
Because of lots of reasons as i mention it .
Important part is if we want to live a wonderfull life , we have to reduce to using of cars .
And try to use to safety and envorimental friendly t
