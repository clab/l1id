People may quickly get wrong when they say that specialzing in one specific subject is better than to have knowledge of many subjects .
To some extent being specialized would be beneficial to the person .
However it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Becouse with the development in science and technology it is revealed that every field is somewhat connectted to other ones , and it is now the time for the most qualifed canditate to find a position to pursue a good career .

Fistly , each day we hear something new about science and technology and most of the time we are suprised to see how differennt fields are linked together .
To illustrate , medical science began to cooperate with computer science and they are using these technologies to learn more about human and trying to find treatment technologies for various health related issues .
A medical doctor should also have at leat a minor degree or broad knowledge in computer science for example .

Secondly , dramaticly growing population brings a problem to the front .
More competition is now waiting for us .
Therefore we should equip ourselves with whatever we could find .
There could be also majoring in different areas .
Consequently , we become more attractive to the employers since we achive more with less effort and we could have a much broader view of perspektif when looking into problems .
For example an engineer with a double major in economics or business administration could do a job almost two people can do and also can be able to think thoroghly with engineering aspects and with the say economical aspects of the problem .
A whole understading to the problems could be achibev by acquiring more and more knowledge about different things .

To sum up , in the search of exellence and success one has to consider equiping himself with more and more knowledge and therefore experience to overcome the competition .
Becouse we now know that every field is linked to each other and we sould have something in our mind when considering problem solution .
