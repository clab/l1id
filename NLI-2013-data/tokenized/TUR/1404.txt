A question on having knowledge of whether many academic subjects or specialize in one specific subject is heavily debated among academics .
It is an apparent fact that interdisciplinary courses are very popular and a lot of academic institutions are offering courses in that context .
Although , I believe having knowlegde of many academic subjects are very helpful to reach a good comprehesion in the studies , I disaggre with the idea in general since I believe that a good academic research can be carried out with the good background in a specific field .

The strongest aspect of specializing in one subject is the power of the deepening in that field .
It is quite useful to have a broad knowledge of many subjects and it might serve to reach a meaningful synthesis when they are put together .
However , if one does not have a comprehensive knowledge in one field , it is surely very difficult to put the information in a framework that attempts to explain , for instance a case , in an academic way .

Let us think about a master thesis that we study on .
If we choose to conduct a case study , it is mostly comfortable to apply more than one theories .
If our master thesis is in social sciences , it is obvious that the case can be defined and studied in that manner .
However , I can put forward that it also creates many misunderstandings and it can end into a huge paper without nothing .
Because if we achieve to specialize on one aspect , we can draw the lines about the case which will help the reader to understand what is trying to be told .
A person who concentrates on one theory can depict the case very well under the guidance of main points of the field he or she deepened .

To sum up , although having knowledge in many fields can sound better than my idea , it is usually better to concentrate on one discipline to reach a better explaination .
