Some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
In a few aspects , I agree this idea , but generaly I do n't agree this idea .
I do n't support the idea that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .
Because , according to my life concept , enjoyment of the life does n't depends to people 's age .
Enjoyment of the life depends on the persons ' characteristics .
In my company , there are two examples to this topic .
The first example is that one of the my colleagues is who is twenty years old is very pessimistic .
She does n't enjoy life .
She acts as if she is going to die tomorrow .
For that reason , she does n't enjoy life .
Second example is that I have a fifty-three years old coworker .
She enjoys life more than my young friend who is twenty years old and very pessimistic .
The old lady is always happy .
She makes plans for nights and weekends for fun .
Every year she travels abroad , takes pictures and tells all of the colleagues .
Also , she is very funny , somedays she praperes small jokes for our young and for pessimistic colleagues to make her optimistic .

Also , I am familiar with that some peoples ' age affect their life vision .
For example , with my mother we go wedding ceremonies , I invite my mother for traditional dances .
My mother sometimes refuses me and says that she is too for dance old , intead of older peoples youngers could play .
I think my mothers age affects her , and diminishes her enjoyment of life .

Some people think that enjoyment of life has coherrent relationship with age , but on the contrary I believe that people enjoyment of life is depend on their characteristics .
As I implied before one of the my twenty years old coworker less enjoys life .
But , on the other side my fifty-three years old collegue enjoys life more than my younger friend .
