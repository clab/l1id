There is a general consideration that young people like life than older people .
Undoubtedly , there are some challenging examples of that statement but it might be accepted as true .
According to data from the survey which measures and compares the satisfaction levels of young and old people , young people are more satisfied than old people .
The results of the survey highlights three main reasons for that .
These are related to life expectation , experience and health .

Firstly , expectations of life vary according to age .
As indicated in survey , there is a strong correlation between expectation such as having a good career and a family and age .
People in older age have minimum level of expectations since they think that they are close to complete their lives .
On the other hand , respondents ranging from 15 to 26 age think that they have plenty of time to do whatever they want .
One good example belongs to a guy who is 16 years old .
He wants to be a president of his country in five years .
Although it sounds unrealistic , it shows his high expectation towards life .

Secondly , young people have less life experiences than older people and tend to feel more excited about the events which they do not have to deal with yet .
Additionally , they like adventures and risky events which they do not predict the results .
Therefore , they can be more productive than older people by creating ideas and innovating new things .
In other words , the idea of having less life experience encourages them to elaborate their ideas .
Thus , this process may reveal brilliant ideas .

Thirdly , young people feel themselves more healthier than old people .
It motivates them to take a role in social events and meet people who they do not know .
They have a variety of opportunities to spend their lives out .
This enables them to improve their skills about life .

Consequently , it seems that young people are more willing to be in real life because of their immaturity .
However , it provides a platform for them to shape their personality and increases the satisfaction of the life .
