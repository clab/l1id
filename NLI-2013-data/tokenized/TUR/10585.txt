It is better to start with describing the successful people ; they have an unlimited brain , they do not think like normal peoples and they are capable to get used to new conditions .
After this description it is not possible to disagree the ` Successful people try new things and take risks rather than doing twhat they alredy know how to do well ' idea .
`Taking risks makes money ' and ` More risk = more money ' is accepted ideas in economy and this idea forces successful people to go on doing something new .

Success is a sick , like using some illegal drugs , when you start overcoming some problems ( we call it success ) you need more to make yourself more successed .
We can say it is not only making some money , it is trying to make ( earn )
ALL money in the world .
That is why succeed people trying to give self-cofidence to their children than teaching some specific formulas .
Successful people has an interesting risk management ability , at the same time this ability have made them successful .

Some unsuccessful people might be succeed , just one or two success are enough for them they can stop going ahead after creation is completed .
We can call their success as luck .
They know that it was their luck and they do not want to risk to loose everything they earned actually they can not do it .
But really successful people , like in the statement , use their previous experience on next job and they know that they can do the next better .

I absulately agree that successful people can not be limited or stopped with just several successes .
Also they agree that ` doing what they already know how to do well ' will kill their successful minds .
Making more succes needs taking more risk idea is in their blood and these kind of people is not programmed to stop after a while .
