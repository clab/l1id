I do not agree with the statement .
This can not be said .
Because i think that every age has its own taste .
So everyone at every age can enjoy life .
But this is related about being pessimistic or obtimistic .

What is enjoying life .
What is the meanning of this .
This chances people to people .
For me enjoying life means being happy .
And to fell happy there are a lot of reasson .
But if u try to be unhappy u can do this it is very easy .

If u are young that means your body let 's u do a lot of thing that u want to .
Because u have more energy .
U can make sports , go out with your girlfriend , go a lot of entartainments etc ...

U can do whatever u want illegally .
And all of these makes u happy .
Also young people have not much responsibility .
And they feel the life endless .
When u get older the taste that u get from life chances .
If u have a wife that u love , if u have good sons and dougters u are the most happy person in the world .
U get happy with the good things that happen to your sons or dougters .
Your vife 's worm hand makes u happy .
Beside all of these if u have grandchildren and if they likes u that makes u happier .
Maybe u have not the same energy as u were young but now u have more reasson to fell happy .

So we can not say youn people enjoy life more than older people and we can not say older people enjoy life more than young people .
Every age has it 's own beauty .
Everything is in your brain , if u teach it to enjoy life it always enjoys life in every age .
So be honest to yourshelf whatever your age is raise your head u can see a lot of thing will make u happy ,
