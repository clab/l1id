One of the most contraversial and hot topic that has been discussed for a long time is that whether an advertisement can change the image of the product in a better way than the product actually is .
In spite of the fact that some people think the product is what it is and nothing can change the quality of it , advertisement is a very effective way to better the product in advance .
The way the product is advertised has a vital importance .
It can show the product much better by using couple of elements .

Undoubltly , advertisement helps to show a product much better that it actually is only if the advertisement is good .
However , what can be supposed as a good ?
What is the qualities of good ?
To be able to answer those questions we need to be really very careful about the strategies we use in the advertisement .
The new technologhy enables us to do millions of things with the cameras .
The colors on the products might be shown much more brighter as it is or the little deficiencies might be hidden when it is advertised .
Besides that the language that is used in the advertisement is very important too .
The words and the tonation must be appropriate to the product that is getting advertised .
For example , in a drink advertisement , a man is getting really thirsty after sport and he is drinking his drink .
The sound that he is making when he takes a sip from the bottle and after he is done the way he talks or stands - feeling of relief - makes a big difference .
However , a person who drinks it may still feel like he is pretty thirsty .
With advertisements , product can be exxagarated greatly .
This is actually what a lot of advertisements do .
They show the product in a superior way like `` if you wear this shoes , you will fly . ''
This technique actually works pretty good .
Eventhough it can help to make the product seem better , once people buy it , they sue the company right away .

As a result , since in todays modern world , there are great ways in the advertisement area , the products can be shown much more different that it is .
Technology and the way of language helps to exxagarate the product and it affects people 's physchology .
Eventhough they feel bad and disappointed after they purchase the product , it definitiely helps to show the product better .
