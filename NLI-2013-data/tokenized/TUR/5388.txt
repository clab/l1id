Experts of the bussiness world determine our era as the era of advertisement .
It is something we are not much aware of .
However , the firms are aware of that .
Probably , we all have experienced buying something that we do not need but we bought just because it was very attactive .
However , there is a fact much worse than this ; they fool us by these advertisements .
Because they mainly make the products seem much better than they are .
Advertisement make the products seem much better in two ways ; by false impressions and by creating brands .

First problem is the false impression created by these advertisements .
To start with we may talk about the main ideas emphasized in advertisements .
According to the type of the product advertisements emphasize features like quality , attaractiveness , functionality etc .
However , most of the time it is only the impression they want to give us .
In reality you will face a bad quality , ineffective , nonsense product just after you bought it .
Forexample , last year I bought a tracking boat .
The advertisement was saying that it is water resistant and you can not damage it for long years .
It absorbed water and the plastic part of the shoes were damaged just in the first use in tracking .

Secondly , the advertisements create brands which also make products seem much better than they are .
It is clear that being a brand in your field is very important in our age .
However , it seems that solely advertisements can create brands .
Even a newly established firm can give the feeling that their brand symbolises confidence , quality etc. by means of some advertisements .
Let me illustrate again with my shoes .
I had bought them believing that their brand was very confidential .
However , they were disturbed shortly and when I tried to find someone to tell my dissappointment I could not find anyone .
Actually , I have learned that it was a mal-functioning firm with no reliability .

I am really angry for being fooled by advertisements which make products seem much better than they are .
Both giving false impressions and by creating brands they make us to do bad decision .
