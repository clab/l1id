Nowadays , some people argue that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
For some people , we are living in a very competitive world and this is a natural concequence .
In my opinion , this is done on purpose .

First of all , there are lots of types of products on the market and consumers have sometimes difficulty in finding the right one .
In these kind of situations advertisements play an important role .
People tend to buy the products which they have seen on television commercials or print advertisements .
However , when people buy the product , sometimes they see that it is different from the advertisement or it is not as good as the one on television .
Indeed , companies try to show their products better than they are ,

Secondly , there is a great competition between companies .
Some companies know that their products are really good and they state it on their advertisements .
On the other hand , some companies are aware of the quality of their products and they know that they can only compete with the good ones if they use advertisements efficiently .
In other words , if they do not claim that their products are good on an advertisement people will buy other products .
This means loosing profits for them .

Furthermore , people tend to buy the products which they see on television .
Owners of the companies know this fact and behave accordingly .
They try to use their advertisements to make people learn their products and buy them .
Besides , they try to influence them by making their products seem much better .

In my conclusion , most advertisements make products seem much better than they are and people do it on purpose to sell more products and to gain more profits .
I think these are normal results of such a consumer based and competitive market .
