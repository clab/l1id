It is important for the students to learn ideas and concepts than the facts .
Student should understand about ideas and concepts in order to develope a way of thinking .
If you try to learn the facts alone you would probably miss the main point .

For example , If you are a student and study on an invation of constantinopolis you should study on ideas and concept in that era .
If you try to learn about the details and facts about the invation you will probably dont understand the events and the ideas of invation .
Idea is to have an important city not to kill the people .

Another example is qeographical topics .
If you just memorize some important information about a country without understanding peoples customs in that country .
You will probably forget what you memorize before .
If you just memorize how many square china is you will miss the most importnat parts like how china became an important counrty economicly .

Even in health class , It is important to learn what is the reqirements an healty place for elder people .
You should evaluate all the requrements with someone elder who you closely know .
You shold maybe discuss about one topic with her to understand he feelings about the topic .
If you just list the requirements you would probably forget soon .

I beleive that if you understand something deeply you should understand the idea and the message first .
Students should avoid to memorize the facts to have knowlage about what they are studing .
Otherwise they would just read the text books and understand nothing usefull for their lifes in future .
