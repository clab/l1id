Education is a very important and vital throughout the world .
But unfortunately there many obstacles for students to go on the right way when they begin to learn .

Educational systems in countries have different kind of aspects and different kind of qualifications around the world .
For example in some countries finishing the classes and exams are so important for students than any other objective so the first aim is to pass the exam and the possible way for this is to memorize the concepts and formulas .
In addition students are generally looking for the previous examples amd questions which help them to pass .
Generally the meaning of education is that when you can pass the exams than you are prosperous Only a few are curious about the facts that are the reasons for these formulas .

In contrast in some countries there are really good indicators for prosperity .
In other say students are diverted into searching the facts they are told that searching the resanos are more important than the results by these information informers are really the pioneers for development .
Devolopment is really possible with the facts or with reasons that lie behind the concepts .
For instance think about the science the reasons and facts are really very important especially when you are a doctor and your main aim is to help people in their operations so to know the fact is necessary for the right and fair act .

To sum up in my opinion it is generally more important for students to understant the ideas than to understand the facts which lay behind the informations .
Awards are generally based on the endings so people are generally concentrated with the outcomes so at this point concepts must be learned firstly .
