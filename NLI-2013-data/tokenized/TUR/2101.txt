With in today 's busy and hard life many people suffer their life instead of enjoying it in my country becouse of economical and other kinds of problems but I think I am the one of the luckiest who can enjoy a part of it .
I do n't see the issue as an age matter but I take it as the ability or opportunuty to enjoy the life .

Although it 's meaning chances person to person , enjoying life means being happy , loving someone and marry with her , having a healty baby and going to a concert or a movie for me .
And I recon these things are all about money at the begining and human effect comes next .
I mean if you do n't have enough money to do these things then you may not experience their pleasure so you ca n't be satisfied .
Another point is the human effect which relates the issue most and it means wish or want of a person to be happy in his or her life .
For example if you have money and wish to go to outside for a dinner , then it is so simple for you to do this .
Otherwise if you have money but no wish or vice verse then you can not have a good night so I think lifestyle does not depent on age .
In adition to these two major points , I must state that your social enviroment has also good or bad effects on your life .
For example you may live in a place where there is no movie therefore you can not go to a movie even if you have maney and wish .

In summary , I live my life as much as I can enjoy it and this depends on my opportunties but so many people may not take a lot of it 's good points in my country and I belive that enjoying life is all about your wish and ability to do so .
