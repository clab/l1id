In fact , people usually think that life is more enjoyable when a person is a teenager .
I actually dont agree with this idea .
I think it depends on the personality rather than the age .
In this passage I will try to explain my opinion .

First let us have a look at the periods of life .
A child usually seems happy with his or her toys .
And a young boy may enjoy the time that he spend with his girl friend .
A young lady may find her hobbies or interests after her work time .
An old lady may be very happy when she is with her grandchildren .
These are really a sight through the window of an optimistic person , are not they ?
Thus , it can easily be seen that a person can enjoy the life at any age .

Although these examples can be expansed , we can sometimes ran into pessimistic people .
When an optimistic person can be happy with his bicycle , small but pretty house etc. an optimistic can look for the ways in order to be worried .
This kind of somber person usually copmplains about unnecessary things like not having much money , not being a famous person , etc .
I think , this kind of pessimist people cant be simply happy even if they are 17 years old .

From this it can be concluded that I dont agree the statement and believe that a person at any age can enjoy the life .
I have talked about the periods of life and gave examples of both optimist people who enjoy the life and pessimists who makes life harder unnecessarily .
According to me , every person may not enjoy life as much as others , however , it shouldnt be forgotten that every age gives the same chance to enjoy .
