The advertisements are widely used from the beginning of the humanity to sell products .
They are very crucial in the marketing world .
Ads simply use the gaps in the human psychology as a weapon to make the humans buy the products .
But in the advertisement world , marketing strategies are very important .
These can completely bankrupt the company or can make the company the worlds most successful company in the world .

First of all , it is important to examine the human behaviours to use the advertisement as a selling tool .
Humans are very interesting creature .
They never know where to stop .
They always want more and more .
The searching for the highest never stops .
Ads use this defect in the human psychology .
Even if the products that are advertised are not tremendous , it is the ads ' quality that make these products sold .
The advertisement companies or agents know that if they can make the ads brilliant , more and more people will want to buy them .
They know that people want to use better products that they are currently usign , so even though the products are not sufficient in quality , more appealing ads prompt the people to buy them .

Secondly marketing strategies are very important to determine the products ' selling rates .
For example , I have been always eating the same brand of sweet throughout my life .
Last year a new brand of candy is exposed to the public and the ads of this sweet was starred by a famous person .
The ad was perfect and appealing and I decided to go and buy that sweet .
I ate it but it was the worst thing that I have ever seen in my life .
After that I searched the financial position of this company and I stumped what I saw .
The ads increased the profits of this company by 200 % .
What an amazing situation , is n't it ?

To sum up , I believe that the advertisements are key features of the selling process .
The ads can make the product more qualified even if it does n't .
The advertisement companies usually benefits the desire in the humans to sell the products .
I am also a human and distracted by the tricks the ads do on me , but I think that buying and trying the new product will not harm anybody .
If you do n't like never buy it , that is how the advertisements work .
