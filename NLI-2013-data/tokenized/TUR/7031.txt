The numbers of the cars increase everyday .
People who do not have cars buy cars .
This will be controversial situation in future , the number of cars in twenty years will increase or not .
Too much cars will cause traffic problem , people will not go their jobs on their time .
In my opinion , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today by the improvements in new transportation systems .

In future , the underground transportation system is going to improve , as the construction technology is improving .
It is going to be easier to build new tunnels for the subway in every part of the city .
The number of the subway station will increase in future .
As a result , people can travel easily around the city .
For example , in one station there will be five or more lines , which will have different directions .
In cities , people prefer to use subways without having park problems , traffic jams , taxes .
Also , the resources of petreloum is decreasing everyday , so prices are increasing and cars become expensive transportation vehicles .

Second reason for not using the cars is going to be the scooters .
As the improvements made in the electricity engines are applied on the scooters .
For example , the segate scooter was started to sell in market and people interested in .
In twenty years people will be using scooters instead of cars .

Third tranportation vehicle is plane which causes in the fall of the cars in twenty years .
As the technology is improving , in future the airplanes will be cheap , easy to fly and small .
So , people can buy airplanes .
For eaxmples , airplanes will take off from the roof of houses and land on where the people go .
Also , airplanes will be much more fast than cars .
As a result people will travel quickly .

To sum up , in future there will be alternatives to transportation with cars .
So , people will prefer new tranportation systems which cause a decline on the number of cars in twenty years .
