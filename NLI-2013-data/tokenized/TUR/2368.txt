In my family there are lots of people both young and old .
Being a young person or being an old person has its own enjoys .
However , I am just 22 years old and I think I agree with this topic .

Firstly there are some enjoys of being an old person .
Being an old person may be gives a fresh feeling .
Beause of the fact that ; older people in my family have worked all through their life .
As a result they know the importance of the time .
Therefore , when they find a chance to travel , they use this chance .
In addition to this they are much more experienced from young people and use teir experiences while enjoying .

There may be some enjoys being an old person ; However there are also some distinct disadvantages .
First of all older people are occasionly reluctant about spending time to enjoy .
They generally prefer to rest that stem from their older ages .
In contrast to younger people are rearlly reluctant about spending time to enjoy .
For example , if a friend of mine call me and propose to go to a bar , at that time I accept him proposal .
Another example ; last summer I went five distinct vacation places for my holiday .
I had enough energy to travel lots of places .
But I think if I were older , I would not go to five different places for holiday .
Probably I went a seaside and stayed there allthrough the holiday .
In addition to these older people always wish to be more younger .
It means that the younger you are the more enjoy you do I think you can easily make out from the explanations I give above why I think younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
Being a older person has its own enjoys but , I prefer enjoying as a younger person
