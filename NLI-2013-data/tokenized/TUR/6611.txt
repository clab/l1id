In many different ways of the transportation , I think using cars are the most comfortable one in our daily lives .
Although there are newer technological ways of transportation such as metro and plane ( preferable especialy for long distances ) , car usage will never decline in future years for several reasons .

Firstly , travelling with your car is different than most of the other transportation ways as you may travel alone in it .
But when you choose a bus or a metro or a plane you have to travel with other people whom you do n't know and whom you may not want to be together .

Secondaly , using cars gives you more freedom as you do n't have to catch up with scheduled times of other transportation ways .
You may plan your travel or vacation as you like , you may stop whenever and wherever you want and do n't have to worry about the restrictions of bus stop points for example .

Thirdly , although some people may argue that fuel stocks will be diminished and therefore there will be fewer cars in use , new technological inventions will always find a solution .
There are some studies such as cars working with solar energy .
Such kind of inventions will solve the giant need of fuel for cars and they will be in use also in future .
Perhaps , their appereance and thechnology will be different then now as a result of constant improves in technology .

Finally , as cars are different than other transportation ways , in their comfort and freedom , they will always be used in the future as much as they used now untill there will be an invention of a new transportation machine as speed as and as comfortable as cars .
