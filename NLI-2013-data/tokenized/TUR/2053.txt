There is a belief that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I am not quite agree with this opinion .
I think older people enjoy life more .
There are may reasons behind these .

Firstly , older people have more money to spend .
Usually people save money while they are younger in order live in prosperity when they get older and retire .
But the youngers have to spend money to buy a house , to get their children educated well and things like that which older people have already taken care .
This is why I stated at the beginning of the paragraph that older people have more money to spend .

Secondly , older people do n't have responsibilities as much as youngers have .
They have finalized all of their responsibilities like raising kids and working hard for a good career .
Less responsibilities not only mean more time to spent for enjoyment but also it means less stress .
I think everyone will agree that a person with less stress could enjoy life more .

Finally , and most importantly in my opinion older people knows the value of every minute they spent and tend to look life in a more positive perspective .
I want to give my grandfather as an example of that .
He always advise me not to worry about the bad things , he says instead think things which are positive .
There is also a proverb in Turkey about this , which is always think about the full part of the glass while you take a glass half filled .

In conclusion I think older people benefits from the enjoyments in life much more than the younger people like me do and they deserve it .
