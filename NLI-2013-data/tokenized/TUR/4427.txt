`The sound of a fat woman is much better when she is far away .
` I totally agree that most of the advertisements make products seem much better than what they really are .
It is like pandora 's box , it looks wonderful but you do n't know what you will be face with .
However there are some reasons why it works this way .

First of all , there are so many competitions in the advertisement world .
If I was one of them I had to do something which would get the visual attraction initially .
For instance , most of us can remember the quisnos sandwich advertisement .
It is not only exhibits the product but also compares it with the other items .
It is full of collars so when ever I am doing something different , it distracts me and even though I have watched it almost hundred times I ca n't help myself to turn around and stare .
It does n't mean that they make the best sandwiches but they do well in advertising .

Second , as we live in the changing world so rapidly , the advertisements must be easy to recognize .
Not only they have so many other options to be displaced but also they should be easy to be recognized .
When I go to a supermarket I see a lot of products and most of them does n't have any match in my mind .
What I really do is , to go to the aisle and pick up the one that I can remember .
Because they make it look better than the others .

Besides , if the advertisement exactly say what it is , I am one hundred percent sure that they will become less attractive .
Think of a sandwich , it would be so bad if the person eating that sandwich in the advertisement , had done something as he actually had thought that it was disgusting .

As a conclusion , it may not be the ethical way to advertise the product but as long as it gets the attention and easily recognizable , that is appropriate in this world we are living .
