I do not agree with this statement .
This essay will explore my reasoning why I do not support the statement that understanding ideas and concepts are more important than it is for them to learn facts .

First , I believe that learning is a step by step process .
Understanding ideas and concepts , and learning facts are both form the crucial steps of this process .
If one step is missing learning can not be completed .
For example preparing a meal requires some necessary steps .
If the cook has all the ingreditens and the cooking pan but nevertheless he does not have an oven there will be no meal .
I believe that it is the same in learning as well .
If someone understand all the key points and concepts but does not learn the facts the learning can not be completed .

Second , this statement does not explain clearly which kind of subjects are the main aspects of the discussion .
As some meals do not require cooking such as a salad , in some subject areas learning the facts is not necessary as understanding the ideas and concepts .
For instance especially in social sciences understanding the issues matter most than learning the facts since students are required to form their own facts through analyzing the ideas .
However in scientific subjects such as chemistry or biology understanding the ideas will not be enough and learning the facts is crucial .
For example a chemistry student can understand that the idea of exploding elements but he needs to know the results what happens if those elements come together .

As being a fourth year Business Administration student I do not remember a time when just understanding ideas were enough for me to learn a subject as a whole without knowing the facts .
I believe that ideas and facts go hand in hand in the process of learning .

In conclusion this statement misses out the importance of the different learning requirements of different subject areas and discourages students from trying to learn the facts .
No matter what is the level of importance of the facts on the subject area , as I mentioned before the learning process is a step by step process .
Thus , without the step of learning facts it will not be completed as it is supposed to .
Many people do not even eat salad without chicken or beef in it , so even salad sometimes require cooking .
Therefore I believe many students may need to know the facts of a subject whey they understand the ideas of it as well .
