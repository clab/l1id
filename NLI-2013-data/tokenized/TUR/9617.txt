In these modern days , every each person wants to be successful .
I do n't know if they want it because of surviving or just for their egos .
I recognized that there are really much more people are becoming successful .
why ?
I think they are doing the right things that they already know how to do well .
There are reasons but first , people can start what they want to do with experience and second , sometimes taking risk can cause to go deep and fail so people would n't have a chance to get things well .

I think experience is the most important issue .
For example my mother always tells me to wear socks but I never do it until I have got a really painful stomachache !
And I always tell my mother not to warn me about anything because when bad things happened to me I understand well .
there 's another example that , my father is a pharmasist and I want to be a pharmasist too .
why do I want it ?
it 's all about my father 's experiences .
he knows everything about pharmact so I can use his knownledge .
I see my father is working and I know how he does it .
I do n't want to be a teacher or engineer while I have already have my father as a pharmasist .

Sometimes people want to take risks but trying new things is not safe at all .
If they want to have a business they have to think about first and they should get informations or help from the people who have experience already .
I think this is such a mindless thing !

Being a successful person is not so easy like leaving everything to chance .
Sometimes people need to be excited , and taking risk is a exciting thing but it may not brings luck .
If people want to survive and have a good life they need to be successful so they must do everything well .
I 'm sure if they have experience they would be lucky because they would make their life easy .
