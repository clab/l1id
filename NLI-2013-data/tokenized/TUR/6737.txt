I disagree with the `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' statement .
Although the form , shape of cars will always change with the choices and likes of people the concept of cars will always be there and the number of cars on the streets will increase until a restricting law passed on that .

People have some everlasting relations with some objects that they will never give up no matter what .
And car is that type of an object .
People got used to driving car , this is a pleasure for them and a different color in life .
Think of a telephone for instance we have internet and we have VOIP ( Voice over IP ) technology which enables us to speak on internet without any cost and with anybody all over the world , did it cause in less number of phones at homes ?
or did it reduce the number of celluler phone sales ?
I dont think so because people got used to speaking on the phone and this wont change at least this wont change in twenty years of time and people will go on talking on the phone just like driving their cars back home .

There might be other transportation alternatives and they might be cheaper too in twenty years of time but that wont change the car sales , actually it might even increase because population of the world will increase .

In conclusion we can think driving car as a all the time activity , it will not get fewer but increase .
