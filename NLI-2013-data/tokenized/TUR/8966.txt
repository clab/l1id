I believe that understanding the ideas and concepts is more significant than learning facts for students .
There are two reasons which make me think like that .
First , when the student try to understand the main idea of a particular subject , it is easier for the student to examine what is really meant .
By this way , the student gains the opportunity to think and critisize the concept of the subject .
When the student has the ability to critisize , the student may draw new conclusions for that subject , I mean the student may have a different point of view , and discuss its advantages and drawbacks with his classmates and professors .
This really helps to improve the thinking skills of the student and very useful for further researches such as attending a graduate program after the school , if he intends to .
Second , as we know the human brain is open for new ideas , memorizing what is told in the class would not be helpful to the student for his upcoming classes .
Because when you just memorize the facts without knowing its causes for a specific time period , for instance memorizing classnotes before the exam , it is inevitable to forget all of it after a meanwhile .
To conclude , I think learning the reasons for a certain subject is for the student 's own good to understand a specific subject clearly .
