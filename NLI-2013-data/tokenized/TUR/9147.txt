What is the best way to learn ?
To stay on the main idea and learn the facts or understand the idea , consepts and be able to demonstarate your ideas ?
Learning the facts is not the answer all the time .
It is known from all the researchs and technics that has been used to teach to students that , giving the facts and trying to use this limited facts from that given information is never enough .
Is that what a students needs ?
A student should know why it happened like that , how did it happen ?
What was the cause to that ?
What would happen in a different case ?
They need to question these .
This is how the doors to their minds should be opened .
School is not the place just to teach students , it is a place to let the students learn , to learn how to learn , to demonstarte the ideas they have and to discuss about other ideas .
This is the way how people communicate , find new ideas , invent new products .
This is how we became .

I 've heard about a lot of student failing on their major work areas just because that they have only the facts they have been thaught .
Whenever there was any outstanding problem , that limited knowledge was not enough for them .
Facts were not enough for them to find the solution .

It is not questioning the education system , it 's about us .
We need to know how to let the new generations go .
Improve theirselves .
Do better , not for us but for theirselves .
