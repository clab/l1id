The meaning of being succesful can vary person to person .
Some people go on doing the things that they believe they are good at , while others prefer to try new things despite the risks that they need to take .
I think a successful person is the one who likes trying new things and not being afraid of failing .

A successful person should not be satisfied with what he or she has achieved .
There can always be another areas to explore .
I think it is very important for a person to be willing to improve his or her qualities by trying new things .
By that way , this person can see what other areas she or he is talented and interested in .
For me , a person is a successful one when she or he is open to new things and get the success at the end .

Doing what you have always done is not a good way to show your success .
If somebody is good at some activity and has just this achievement , it does not mean very much to me .
The real success can be observed when a person tries to be successful in a new project or an area .
For example , I am good at swimming and I have had many awards from various competitions .
But I also had an interest to play chess .
I have taken course for it and I am now a successful chess player .
With that success in new area , I see myself more successful and talented .

A successful person should be able to transfer his or her success from one area to another .
Having confidence that you can be good at in different area and take risks is an indication of your motivation be successful and this is a characteristic that I believe a successful person should possess .

In sum , I consider a person as a successful if that person gives importance to improve her or her qualities by trying new things , avoids from only doing the things she or he knows well and opens to the new experiences .
Moreover , I think a successful person should be good at transfering his or her ability to various situations .
I also try to be a person having such characteristics and motivationg myself to trying new things and not to fear from taking risks .
