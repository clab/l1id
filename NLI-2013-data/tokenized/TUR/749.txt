Broad knowledge is very important in academic life .
A person who wants to have an academic career should be aware of a lot of academic issues .
However specialization makes people more successful and unconfused .
So I do disagree the statement .

First of all , it is obvious that people who have academic careers , should have a broad knowledge of not only academic subjects but also the global issues around them .
However specialization is needful for academic periphery .
Let us imagine a professor ; when a student ask some general questions about his or her research project , he can answer them but if the student asks some specific questions , the professor can not be satissfying in details .
Brain has a capacity of knowledge .
If a human behaviour focus on a lot of issues , he or she can be aware of much more things but can not know anything in details .

Secondly , when we look at developing countries , we see that specialization is the main point in this development process .
People do what they know best .
Without argument it is clear that entellectual knowledge is important in social life and benefits people to have a vision of life .
However , in the academic career specilization make the people successfull .
People have a peception capacity .
Therefore people should choose the subjects which are in their perception of academic career .

In the conclusion , all of those reasons show that , person who want to succeed in his or her academic career , should specialize in some subjests .
The academician can be confused on the other option .
People should do best in their working life .
Making best happens only if specialization happens .
Broad knowledge brings broad intellegence , it can be denied .
However focusing on his or her work makes academic person more clear about his or her knowledge .
