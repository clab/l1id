People in all over the world have education during their lifetime .
The education never stops .
It is impossible to learn everything but it is better if a person have information about everything as much as possible than keen on only one subject and do n't care about the other points .

First of all , people judge the others not carefully and it is really difficult to change their ideas .
For example , in a crowded place where people discuss their ideas , people may talk about every topic and if you are not have an idea about the subject , people do n't think about your knowledge in another subject .
So they would think that even you are uneducated instead of searching you about more .

Secondly , having information about other subjects help another subject to understand easily or better .
For example , in botany , it is also necessary to have information about chemist to critise and understand the chemistry of the plants .

To sum up , to have a little idea about everything is better than to have an amount of knowledge in one subject .
Being not only a succesful but also a respectful person is very important in a person 's life .
