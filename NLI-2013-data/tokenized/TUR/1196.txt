To know a few from everything , or know only one thing better than anything ?
Nowadays , most people know lots of things but they know it undetailed .
I think knowing one thing , and knowing it detailed is better than knowing plenty of things undetailed .

To start with , being an expert in one specific academic subject is better than being a newbie in plenty of academic subjects .
This also makes a person think more knowledgeable .
For example , imagine two people who graduated from same major in university , works in the same company and both in the same department .
One of them knows only about his department but knows everything about it , and the other one knows a little about his department , and also knows about other departments .
If their manager had to choose a person for a project about their department , he will choose the one who is knowing more things about the department .
Thus shows that being an expert in one specific subject is better than knowing plenty of subjects .

Furthermore , knowing too much thing disattracts people from their job or situation which makes them more unsuccessful .
This also proved by many scientifical researches .
The research shows that 4 out of 6 people disattract from the subject if they do not know the subject too much .
It also a disadvantage for people for looking out for jobs and doing good things such as good projects , and works .

There is also one more positive thing for specializing in one specific subject .
People who have experty in one academic subject can make more process quickly and have more trust unlike the other people .
With the advantage of knowing deeply an academic subject , they can make process quickly with a few mistakes , and also they would not lost their confidency while doing it .
For example , a student who did specialize in one specific subject can make a better homework than a student who knew a few things about the subject .
This situation proves that specializing in one specific subject is more better .

To sum up , I can say that I totally agree with the opinion which states specializing in one specific subject is better .
If there is more people who specialized in one specific subject , there will be more success all over the world .
At last , we are all human , and we can not know everything perfectly , so we should do the best thing we can do , and be an expert about that subject .
