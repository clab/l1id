I think that every age has a different joy throughout a human 's life .
Young seem to do more activities and anjoy a lot but this does not mean that older people do n't enjoy living .
They also have fun but in their own ways .

Young people have less responsibility so they are more careless .
They only try to spend their time enjoying themselves .
They live for the moment without thinking about past or future .
They have more energy so they get involved in physical and outdoor activities such as sporting games , concerts , parties and parks more often .
They are much resistable and strong which lets them to be able to take more risks .
During school years there would be a lot of friends around to spend time together .

On the other hand , as people get older they take more responsibilty so they change .
Usually , after school they start working and later they get married .
They become more mature and they learn to enjoy life in other ways .
They may not go to parties , take risks or have a plenty of friends but having success in work , maintaining a happy family , having a pleasant dinner with old , trustful friends are joys of life that ca n't be replaced with anything .
As people grow they see the world from a wider perspective so life becomes more meaningful and tasteful .
Humans may get older and may have some disabilities because of age by time but living with good memories and seeing their grandchildren is much valuable than going into pubs .

In summary , in my point of view it is very superficial to think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
People enjoy every stage of life if they live a successful and honored life .
People should live their lives in a way that when they look behind they should not regret anything .
