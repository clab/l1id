As you all know many students choose to learn what it is written in their books rather to see the main idea behind it .
This leads to developing generations , who waits for others to think and accept their ideas as a truth without questioning it .
So it is very importent for young people to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .

Firstly , when you are taking a math class or any other subject related to science you have to learn the main principles of the subject in order to succeed .
For example you cannot just say something falls down when it is dropped .
You have to know that there is an external force called gravity , which keeps all subjects on the ground or make them fall when they are in the air .
Without understanding the main reason or thinking about the cause you cannot make any progress for yourself and the others .

Secondly , it is not only true that someone should learn the main ideas for the science related subjects .
Also in other areas like history or politics ( especially in politics ) you should know the reason why something happened or going to happen .
Unfortunetlly many students believe that history is only about learning wars or important charecters in order , but history is more than that .
Without the background information on the facts , for example the WWII , you will never understand why the Americans have to go into Europe in order to support England .
In this example it is important to understand that England was the only country against the Nazi-Germany and needed help in order to prevent the groth of Nazi-Era , but without this information it will be just another war in the human history .

Finally many students say that they have many thinks to learn and to understand the idea behind everything requires much time , but that is only a misunderstanding .
Especially in engineering subjects , such as programming , you cannot learn every single command , because there are to many of them !
The main points of programming is to know how to build an algorithm and how to translate it into the programming language needed .
The rest can be done by everyone with a little experience in computers .

To sum up , facts are nothing compared to the ideas behind them .
In order to take an important part in the society people should produce their own ideas , otherwise they will be nothing more than a slave .
In order to do that you need to understand the main ideas .
