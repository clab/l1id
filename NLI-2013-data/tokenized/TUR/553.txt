I both agree and disagree to this statement .

First of all , I believe that a person who lives in an academic environment should have a broad knowledge on a number of subjects .
Because the solutions to todays problems require a broad knowledge from various areas of science .
And those areas are usually interrelated to each other .
Whilst trying to find a relevant solution to an issue , a person could face many problems from a different area of science .
So , the person should at least be familiar with the most basic principles of the related areas .

I also believe , people with a broad knowledge on various subjects can easily understand the problem , find out the relevant options to solve it , and refer to the right fellow academics to get the right answers .
If one does not have a broad knowledge , he/she cannot find the way out of the difficulty he/she may face .

On the other hand , the in depth specialization in a subject is a must in todays academic studies in order to be able to get to the right solutions of the problems in a particular subject .
Todays scientific problems require so good and in depth knowledge that one should be a subject matter expert to conduct relevant procedures in order to get relevant solutions .
Who would think , without the special knowledge in the subject one could be successful ?
