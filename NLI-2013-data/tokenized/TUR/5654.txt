I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
Most advertisements use emotional figures , present the product in a way that is very appealing to the consumer or attacks the competitors by claiming that their product offers more quality per unit price .
These are the tools that advertising companies choose for products generally in order to convince the target consumers to buy ; however they can be misleading and consumers can be disappointed after their initial experince .

First of all , using the emotional figures in the advertisements is a method used very much recently .
We can see speaking cows playinf football in a milk advertisement or several cartoon figures that are the favourite ones for children .
This method especially influences the kids very much and they insist on buying that product .
However , the advertisment does not promise a quality for a repeated buying , Additionally , intoducing a product in a very appealing way can be an exaggreation .
For instance , advertisement may say a chocolate is very tasteful that you can never want to share it with a friend , but it may be that it does not taste good .

Lastly , some advertisments attact competitors rather than just claming on their products and present a comparative advantages like lower price per quality , highest effectiveness , having the most beneficial fuctions .
Nevethelesss , this method also can be very misleading .
For example , a car can be cheaper than the other cars with the same quality and functions , nonetheless it can have lower sustainability or less terms on guarantee .
Being cheaper does not mean you will be satisfied with its quality .

In conclusion , the methods used in the advertisements can bve very misleading can cause use make wrong decisions about the things you need and you want to purchase .
Sometimes , less appealing and aggressive and dull advertisments of some products can offer a much more quality or compensation for the needs and preferences .
