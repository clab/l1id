I do not agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than old people do '' .
Many old people might enjoy life more than many young people do , since they know more about life because of their age , or they know that they are close to end so they want to enjoy it as much as possible before it is gone .
Enjoying life is not related to person 's age .
It is more related to individual 's personality , or the life conditions that individual has , and the accidents or luck that the life brings to an individual .

I know many young people who are dealing with many problems of life rather than enjoying it .
Financial problems , or career concerns are the main topics that makes young people too much stressed about life .
However , when we look at the old people , it is not hard to see on their face the scarces of satisfaction and awareness .
They were slowed down , they ended the competition with other people , and just try to enjoy the life after accepting it as what it is .
Therefore , it would be invalid when someone claims that young people enjoy life more than old people do .

Mainly , enjoyment of life is mostly related with personality .
In spite of many difficulties and the rapidness in their lives , there are many young people who enjoy life .
Maybe , those are the ones who can balance their enjoyments and responsibilities .
While they are holding a lot of hard work , they also leave some time to have fun , dealing with friends , families and social activities .
Someone might have a positive motivation of life , which makes him/her optimistic about the facts , and leads him/her to enjoy the life .
Some others might have negative motivations that they only see the negative aspect of the facts and can not be able to enjoy life because of their motivations .
Some people might be too much concerned with the only `` responsibiliy '' or `` career '' part of the life that they do not allow themselves to relax , spend time with friends and experience the enjoyable and easy parts of the life .

To sum up , enyoying life is not related with the person 's age .
It is more related to person 's character , the person 's perception of life .
There are many young people who do not enjoy the life because of their negative motivations of life or because of the other priorities in their lives .
There are many old people who enjoy life more than many young people do because their old age give them the awareness of life and the rapidness of time .
And those motivates them to enjoy as much as possible when there is still time .
