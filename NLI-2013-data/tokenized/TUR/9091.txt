In my opinion it is more important to understand ideas about a lesson .
I believe that students has to focus on main concept of issues .
By learning facts , students can gain only the information .

As for me , first reason for it that when students focus on the main idea of any lesson , they might improve the idea , and they can add different types of ideas to it .
Because i think that younger brains usually open for creativity .
So if a teacher depends on teaching facts , he/she may cause lost of creativity in class .

My second reason is , if students think about concepts and try to understand the idea , they can produce questions to teacher .
So when they are asking these questions , they may understand and learn all the facts of lesson .

In the class , if teachers pay attention on giving the main idea , they can help to raise in numbers of innovative individuals .
Because i believe that any student who ask questions by using `` how '' and `` why '' can learn all structure .

When i was in high school we had two chemistry teachers in one year .
Our first chemistry teacher always asking elements properties whose students has to know from periodic table .
So we should know all elements from that table .
Otherwise we sure that we ca n't pass the lesson .
After his retirement , we had a new teacher for chemistry .
She was always giving research homeworks in the class .
Also we had to prepare projects with our classmates .
After that we got start to understand that how chemistry and it 's theories works .
We were staying in library for hours .
We were reading articles about our homeworks .

In the end of the year we gained a scientific point of view .
And now , it 's really hard to remember of any elements from periodic table .
