Some people do n't want to take a risk they want to do what they already know how to do well , on the other hand some people want to take risk to reach successful people .
I think people should take a risk to save money , to learn new things , and to use their experience .

Firstly , people should take a risks to save more money .
Althought each risks have many different problem , it usually have a lots of money to save same percentage of risks .
For example people who want to be rich he or she must take a risk to reach him or her goal .

Secondly , people should take a risks to learn new things and new work .
They should belive that they can do different kind of working .
For instance , people who have good job and good life standart should bored same conditions and same life style .
They need to have new things to reach good life standart .
This new thing can help them to feel better , because for a one psycologic searching ; when people make new thing , they can feel better .

Thirdly , people should take a risks to use their own experience .
If one person have good job , he or she must have some experience in his or her working .
When he or she use own experience , he or she feel better than before , because he or she can understand having a experience .

In conclusion , people should take a risk to enjoy their life and to save some things that I write on the writing .
Theese things can help them to reach succesful people .
