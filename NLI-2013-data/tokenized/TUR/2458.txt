It is always discussed whether young people enjoy life more than older people .
Old people may have the experience but young people have all the fun .
It is clear that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

Firstly , young people are more open-minded as opposed to older people .
older people have always that prejudice about a new topic .
On the other hand young people are always eager to try and experience new things which are very likely to be amusing .
But old people generally do not want to try new things , instead they prefer to sit at home and watch tv .

Moreover young people have the ability to perform hard physical tasks but on the contrary old people are not able to skydive for example .
A young person can easily do it but an old person cannot .
There are various examples like : diving , horseriding , mountclimbing etc .

As the time passes the society changes , the traditions change .
Young people are more familiar with the trends than old people are .
For example my grandfather does not know what an ipod is .
That would make them behind of the social phenomenas .
They cannot keep track of the changes that young people can easily adapt to .
Technology advances , we all know how to use computer and chat but my grandmother does not know what chatting is .
Young people are more familiar with the technology and they use it for fun on the other hand old people ca n't .

Young people may experience new things .
That is what is great about being young , you do not make mistakes , you experience .

Young people do not have restrictions such as kids , they do not work as the older people do .
So they can go where ever they want and whenever they want .
They can travel more freely than older people do .
They do not have the responsibility of the kids and they have much more time for themselves .
They do not have to go to work everyday instead they may go see a football game in a different city .
They do not have to make money , their parents send them money .
As the time passes people get lonelier but young people have all their friends to be with or to talk to .

To sum up older people may have the experience that young people do n't have but it is clearly obvious that young people enjoy life more than old people do .
All living creatures get old , but they should live and enjoy their life while they are still young .
