Obviously , the aim of advertisement is to make products seem much better than they really are .
I do n't see any point to disagree with this statement .
If a certain advertisement is failing to stimulate this impression , this means that this advertiser is simply a bad advertiser .
However , this does not mean that advertisement is simply a lie and advertisers are wellcomed to lie given advertisement is the art of lieing ! .
Advertisement also has to have its ethics .
The positive impression in the minds of the consumer is to be created not by outright lies but by emphasizing the attractive aspects of the product in question .
If the product in question is an expensive and good product , many advertisement wisely omit to mention its price .
If the product is cheap , the advertisements would proudly emphasize its exact price .
This kind of selective speaking is true not only for commercial advertisements but also true in our daily lives .
If we were to mention a certain man , one can only mention his positive sides whereas another one can only speak of his negative sides .
Both men would still be talking the reality .
As long as people speaking about a third person and as along as the advertisers while presenting his product are honest , there is no ethical question .
To lie outrightly and to speak selectively about reality are two different things .
In a commercial world , it is not realistic to expect us to criticize their own product !
The advertisements also perfectly know the weak sides of the consumers .
They know what attracts them and what distracts them .
Using the insight of pyschology , they benefit from the temptations of consumers .
But this is one side of the coin .
The consumers also know how advertisemnets are .
They also learn that advertisements polishes the products and aim to create a fairy tale image .
The consumers use advertisements for knowledge .
They are not stupid enough to be deceived by the advertisements .
They are educated by the advertisements themselves of the characteristics of the advertisements .
A typical consumer is more or less able to distinguish what is real and what is fiction in advertisements .
To conclude , although I agree with the statement , the statement has to be qualified .
Recognizing the fact that advertisements make the products look better than they really are does not mean that advertisers are a bunch of criminals lieing unashamedly to the whole people .
They make the positive sides of the products accessible to the consumers .
It is up to the consumers to make their decision and to agree or disagree with the advertisers .
