There are two existing views about the expected number of cars in the future .
One might think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
However , others might think that the number of cars will not be fewer in twenty years , even that number will increase .
I also believe that the number of cars in use will increase as the time passes .

First of all , I believe that the number of cars in use will increase gradually within time because when we compare today 's situation with the past , we see that the number of cars in use considerably increased within time .
Since I believe that the past is the mirror of the future , I also believe that the number of cars in use will increase in twenty years as it did in the past .

Moreover , I think that the number of cars in use will increase as the time passes as a consequence of growing car industry and by the help of media and commercials .
Since there is a growing car industry all over the world , the producers produce as much as they can .
Most of the people can find a car that they like .
There are variety of cars and at least one of them take the attention of the consumer .
Moreover , by the help of media , the cars that are produced can be easily seen and discovered by the consumer .
It is hard to not get impressed by the appealing car commercials .

To sum up , despite the fact the some people believe that the number of cars in use will decrese in twenty years , I strongly disagree that it will happen .
Such as the incrase in the number of cars in use in the past , I think it will also increase in the future .
Moreover ; the growing car industry and the effect of media will support that increase .
