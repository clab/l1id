If it is about students , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
There is pro and con for this issue .
However , i think it is much more important to learn about ideas and facts .

First of , we all sure that education is the most crucial subject that influence a societys development .
Today the competion between countries and companies is global .
So how can you differ your product or company from the others ?
The answer is creativinity .
If you can think different , you will eventually produce different and live different than others .
To improve creativinity we should urge the students to think different .
Nonetheless , it is impossible if you just make them learn the information .

Secondly , we have to consider the aspect of learning .
The natural way of it is experience .
That is why the best schools around world have also the best labs .
You should let them experience by themselves .
Since the experince is the most valuable and the expensive knowlege .
Just consider how the civilizations rise .
It is more permenant to help someone to comprehend someting than to force them to learn .
I think , this is the problem , which we have in my country , Turkey .
For instance , I study engineering .
The more i make experiments , more i feel confident about my knowlege .
Therefore , it is more essential to learn the ideas and the concepts .
If you just memorize somethink , believe me you wo n't keep it for a long time .

Third of , we also should consider the joy of learning .
Would it be enjoyable just by learning the facts .
For example , lets think about the magnetism .
I can assure is is quite boring if you just give the facts to the students .
On the other hand is really interesting when you see it yourself in a lab .

In conclusion there are many ways of learning .
Learning by understanding ideas , concepts and principles could have some drawbacks .
However this wont change the fact that it is the best way .
