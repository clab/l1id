We are living in a consumption world .
In such a buy-consume-rebuy world advertisements constitutes a great part of our lives even though we are not aware of it .
Have you ever watched a match or a series in TV or walked to your local market without seeing any advertisements ?
I guess your answer is no .
Many of these advertisements are showing us how their product is really nice and high quality .
Do you think are they honest ?
My point of view is that most of these advertisements make products seem much better than they originally are because of the competition both in the market and between the advertisement companies .

The first reason why most advertisements show products better than they really are is that there are many companies that are selling the same product .
Therefore , there is too much competition in the market .
To be able to compete with other firms and stay in the market , companies spend unbelievable amounts of money in advertisements and show their products as the ` best ' product that is in sale .
As an instance , in my country a candy brand called Ulker made an advertisement in which there was a quote saying that `` you can forget its name , but never its taste . ''
When i ate this candy , i saw no difference in its taste than any other brands ' candies .

Secondly , besides the competition between companies that spend money to these advertisements , there is also competition between advertisement companies .
To make their advertisements liked by the companies that hire them they should prepare the advertisements such that they will persuade the company workers that this product will be sold .
Therefore , most of the time advertisement companies are exaggerating the features or the quality of the products in order to be liked by the product owners and be hired again in the next time .

All in all , because of the competition between companies that are producing the products and the companies that are making the advertisements , most of the time the products advertised are shown as better than they really are .
Thus , consumers should be careful about those advertisements and should not rely on them .
