Nowadays people are discussing that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I think most people , including myself , do n't agree that claim .
Because it is superficial knowledge , does't help you for your job , you do take poor grades in the tests which is related to your major .
Also I can count several disadvantages about the broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Although you learn a lot of knowledge .
they are all superficial .
For example , you are engineer and you took art class when you were in university .
One day perhaps you will meet a painter and start to talk about artm .
What will you say about art that attracts the painter .
Nothing , only you count the names of the artists .

Also this knowledge doe n't help you when you apply for a job or during your job .
If you focus on your major more , you will be more succesful in your job .
Statics show that people specializing in one specific subject are more happy because they are more successful in their jobs .
Also successful work life means that a good profit for you , because successful men earn a lot of money from their job .

If you focus on your major 's lessons , you will be successful not only in your work life , but also in student life .
That means you are killing two birds with one stone .
You will be more successful in your lessons because you can make relationships among the knowledges .

Taking everyting into consideration , I can clearly state that specializing in one specific subject is better .
Special person make specializing in their subjects .
Thats my motto
