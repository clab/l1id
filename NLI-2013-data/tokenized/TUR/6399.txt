As time goes on , there occur technological developments that make our lifes easier .
All of these technological developments provide us a more efficient time usage .
Car was the most important technological development that have ever been made up to now .
However , today we faced with some problems in the usage of cars .
This problems made me think that in the following twenty years , there will be fewer cars in usage than there are todays .

Now , most of us are complaining about the time we spent in the traffic .
This means that , this technological development `` car '' does not provide us effective time usage now .
Then , we need a better technoloy than using cars as soon as possible which will decrase the usage of cars .

As I mentioned above , one of the reason for the decrease in the number of cars can be the technological developments we will have in the following years .
However , this cannot be the only reason in the decrase of this number .
The second reason can be that the decrasing energy supplies to work our cars .
When the energy sources decraeses , the money that we have to pay for it increses .
Then , day by day , it is getting more difficult to pay this money to buy petrolium for driving our cars .
This is the second supporting idea about why i think that the number of car usage will decrase .

This are some reasons to explain why I think there will be fewer cars in usage in the following years .
I hope the developments in technology provides us better ways to travel .
