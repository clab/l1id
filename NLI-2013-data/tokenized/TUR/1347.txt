When the conditions of the today 's academic and business environment are considered , it is a better idea to specialize in one specific subject than trying to get pieces of knowledge in many subjects .

In the very begining of the evolution of science , many scientists used to deal with a variety of areas .
For example , the ancient Greek scientists were both mathmeticians and philosophers at the same time .
It was true at that time when the conditions of the agricultural society was taken into account .
There were very few people interested in science and they used to deal with many subjects at the same time .

However , many several branches of science are formed in history with an effort to specialize in different topics .
The today 's world necessisates this progress .
For example , as the computer tecnhology improved , different sorts of specialist began to emerge in this area .
In my opinion , specializing in one subject gives you the chance to focus on this topic .
For instance , you may have some knowledge about the hardware of computers , some about programming but you cannot deal with a problem which envolves a huge knowledge and experience about a specific situation in one subject .
If it was possible to learn all the things about many different subjects , people would do that .
However , a life of a human being is not enough for this .

Favors of studying in many different academic subjects argue that it may give you the possibility conduct a research with different aspects of it .
Although these statement is partially correct , my suggestions would be conduct the same research with many specialists in different subjects .
I believe that the second way would give better results taking the each individuals own specialization into account .
