Enjoying the life is one of the most significant steps that each person should experience .
There is no clear cut answer to the question if young people or older people enjoy life more .
I think that it is not related to the age but the situation of the people .
Moreover , people have different advantages at the different ages .
Some advantages of the young people to enjoy life are their energy and money .
However , on the other hand older people have more time and more experince .

One of the biggest advantage of the young people to enjoy life is their energy .
They are much healthier than the old people and have more willingness to do more thing in order to enjoy life .
For example they can travel to the other countries , while it is not very possible for the old people .
However , energy is not enouhg , time is also required .
When we consider that most of the young people have to work , old people have more free time for themselves .
They are mostly retired and do not need to work so they can enjoy the life better .

The second point is that enjoying life means money .
For the young people that is not a great problem since they are working and earning money .
In contrast , for the older people it is not easy to enjoy the life with luxury things , because their salary from the retirement is not very high .
However needless to say is that with the experience that they have gained for many years they can find the way to enjoy the life with less money .
Many of the older people have traveled and enjoyed the life since many years , that means that they know very well the cheapest places and things to do .

In sum , I disagree with the statement that ` young people enjoy life more than older people do` .
Based on my personal experiences I can claim that enjoying life is not dependent on the age , but on the situation .
As I pointed out above , young people can have the energy and the money needed for enjoying the life , however that is not enough they need also time and some experience that the older people have .
