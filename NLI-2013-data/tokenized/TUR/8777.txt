To be able to take part in the competitive world , people must be more qualified than before .
Everyone is trying to improve their skills by attending to certificate programmes , seminars , internship programs or attending to the top ranked schools .
The education they get there is a big step for their careers .

Especially students feel big pressure on themselves , since they do not know where they will be after they finish their education and if they will be able to play a role in this global world .
Hence , they try to do their best at school by studying their courses , doing homeworks , getting good grades .
However , after they complete all these requirements they may not reach their goals unless they .
learnt to understand the ideas and concepts .

The education system forces students to learn what is written in the course materials .
It is easy to memorise all the facts in the books and get good grades .
However , these learnt facts will be forgotten quickly and easily .
Hence , it is important to understand the basic ideas behind the subjects and question everyting to gain permanent knowledge .

For instance , a student taking a political science course may have an assignment about the differences between political views .
He may study the different types of views like nationalism or fundemantalism .
If he understands the basic idea behind those , he will never forget or confuse them .
However , if he just learns the facts it is possible that his knowledge will not last long .

As a student , i believe that it is more important to understand the ideas and concepts than to learn the facts in order to gain permanent knowledge .
If a student is aware of the subject , he will be more likely to improve his skills and qualifications .
In my opinion understanding the consepts is the core for self development and may give you the chance to play a big role in the competitive world .
