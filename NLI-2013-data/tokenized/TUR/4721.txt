Have you ever thought about the advertisements on TV , magazines , or newspapers ?
Are they really showing the real value of the products ?
This discussion is still talking among people and scientists .
There are many companies producing new products .
So , they have to sell these products in some ways .
One of the most effective way is advertisements .
How do the advertisements show this products to us ?
According to me , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
There are two reasons for this : the companies cannot spend much more money for their products than they spend now , and there is no good reason to trust advertisements .

First of all , the companies are playing an important role in this schene .
Why ?
Because they are producing lots of products .
When they are making these products , they have to be careful about the prices and quality .
These two things are very opposite .
If you want to make a good product , you should spend money for this , or you can just spend little money for your product , but it cannot be a good production .
If you became a manager or owner of a factory , which would you prefer ?
Companies in this sector are producing their products with cheap costs .
So , the products are not really qualify .
After that , they will sell these products , but how ?
Advertisement is a good answer to this question .
They will you TV , magazine , or newspaper for their products .
In this time , advertisements show these products seem much better than they really are and people are buying these products .
In business life , the important thing is to earn lots of money from their produts by using advertisements .
So , these advertisements are very useful for selling them .

The second thing is that there is no good reason to trust advertisements .
For example , on the magazines or newspapers there are some products to become thinner and they are giving a chance to have a good body shape for people .
In the advertisements , there are some effective pictures in order to sell these products , but how can we trust these products ?
There is no good reason and also these medicines or products can be very dangerous for our body .
Maybe we can die because of these products .
If you want to have a good body shape , you should go to doctors and take some advises from them .
You sholud n't believe these advertisements if you want to be healthy .

Consequently , there are lots of advertisements on media and they are introducing many products .
We should't forget that these advertisements are making products seem much better than they really are .
