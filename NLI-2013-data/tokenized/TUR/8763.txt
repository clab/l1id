The humankind always need to education therefore education is the very important aspect of human life to reach high life standards .
Ideas and concepts are most important part of education .
Some assumed that it is the most important for students to understand ideas and concepsts in controray to this some think that the best for the students to learn facts .
I totally agree with the first idea .
These are my following reasons .

The first reason for my belief is that , the students must learn the ideas first .
Because the ideas are important and also the concepts .
Students must give pay attention the ideas and concepts than the facts .
If a students learn the ideas and the concepts the student can learn the facts by time .

The second reason for my belief is that , the facts are not important exactly .
Because the ideas make the shape to the facts .
So the its concept is important so it is related with the ideas .
If the student learn the ideas first he or she can prepare the fact before and he or she can look the fact in different ways .
This is the important .

In the other hand the facts are the important some times to look the objects truely .
Some think and say this students must learn facts first to prevent him or her to the lies .

For all these reasons i therefore believe that , It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
This idea is related with both give a shape to facts and prepare to the facts before .
The long and the short of it is that the ideas and the concepts are more important than facts .
I hope the students do n't disregard what i mentioned !
