I am a young person and I agree with this statement .
I thing we do not give enough time to helping our communities .
In fact we do not give enough time a lot of things .
For example we do not read enough or we do not go to cinema and theatre enough .
We spent huge times for internet chat and computer games ...
etc .
And I thing chat and computer games are very unnecessary things .
But unfortunately chat and computer games have commoned very easy and fastly .
I thing we correct this situation shortly times .
If we do not correct this situation our young people will give up helping their communities .
For example Using the telephone has decreased since the internet commonly .
Young people chat with they do not know everyone .
And they do not know that they are lier .
Also young people do not give enough time our friends .
We choose play computer games or chat .
So our friends is decrease .
Finally I think we are giving enough time to helping our communities .
