Every grandmother talks about the good-old days , when the younger were more helpful the old ones , respectful for family values and community culture .
Well , somebody has to tell them back that the times have changed !
I agree that young people are not like in the old times , because they are more individualistic , they have less time for family and community but more for work .
Also the old ones have changed !
They are more healthy and socially active , so they do not need younger ones as they did in the past .

First of all , everbody will accept that we are now living in a society where everyone lives an individual life , rather than as a part of a community .
This individuality has physical aspects and also cultural aspects .
For example , the number of people working in cities or even countries different then where their family live , is going higher and higher every year .
How can somebody be helpful to his community , if he is 1000 miles away ?
This is physically not possible .
And culturally , with all the media and advertisement bombardment telling the people that the only important thing in this life is themselves but nothing else ; how can young people not be individual caring about only their own lives ?

The times have also changed in terms of the time which we must spend for things other than family isues .
Young people have to spend much of their time in their school and work .
They can not even find enough time to deal with all these , actually .
That results in less time for the family and community again .

Lastly , the old ones also changed !
They are healthier , and socially more active than they used to be .
They need the younger ones less and less by the advances in technology also .
Which means it is not only the younger ones that have changed .

The world we live in is certainly different than what it had been before .
One of the results is that younger people are not into their comunities as much as they did in the past .
They are more individualistic , they have less time , and actually the older ones needs them less , too .
