no i don t think its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject because knowing a subject very well makes you an expert so you can share your knowledge with people when they need if you have broad knowledge you can easilly confused when someone ask something to you and you can do a lot of mistake when you are talking and it is not good for you in my opinion you have to be a expert in one subject it can be about job or it can be about some academic subject or it can be sports so you can be very important person and also you can make a lot of money by this way you can be famous if you are good at in something populer or important for example if you are good at american history you will be the man that people look for you in everywhere people look for or ask something or newspapers want to make interviews with experts of something on the otherhand if you have broad knowledge for everything you can also talk like experts but nobody cares you in society you can be invisible so all you have to do work hard however its not easiy for a lot of people but as i said you have to work
