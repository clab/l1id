I agree with the statement because people who takes risks and i f try new things has more chance catch the success rather than the other people who lives with the things that they already know .
Expanding the limits and discover new areas is so important .
If person has a tentance to take risk will realise that it is worthed to take risk although there is a chance to fail .
Successful people who try new things are more unbeatble and stronger than the others .
They have more reasons to live and taking risks makes them exited and ambitious .
When they reach their goals they become a person who is happy to live and who feels alive .
After exploring new things it becomes an addiction and they want more new things and more risks .
If i would give an example from an artist , for to be successful he \ she needs to learn new things and follow the improvements around his world .
Those exploratons and experimentations opens a new worlds of creativity .
artist should be open to the whole universe after that he can create an uniqe work of art .
They should take risks to discover his limits and to develop his abilities and skills .
For example there is an performance artist on stage and he needs to be brawe enough to prfor his show he should take risk without thinking what does the auidience thiks or reacts .
He should try new things on stage with combining his exprience and knowledge .
Think that he tried and had good reaction from auidience or they did n't like the show .
His benefit here is this ; he discovered his limits next time he will be more exprienced than before .

Those are the essential steps for to be a succesful person .
You need to try new things and take risks and expand your limits for to feel alive and happy .
