Being a successful person is not possible for most of us .
There are only small amount of people that are shown as successful in their lives .
According to the authorities , the most efficient strategy of becoming a successful people is experiencing new thing in our lives .
However most of the people do not agree with this idea .
They show experiencing the same things that we always do , as a more suitable way of becoming successful .
I think the first opinion is more effective than the second one because of lots of important reasons .
The most important ones of these reasons are orginality , creativity and expanded experience .

First of all , trying new things gives us the chance of being original .
If we continue only making the same things , we lose our opportunity of becoming the leader of an experince .
We can not show our difference from the others and become an ordinary one .

Secondly , experiencing new things and taking risks make us more creative people .
For most of the scientists , creativity is the basic skill of a successful person .
By this way , we find the chance of using our imagination and creating new things .

Moreover , having an expended knowledge is anther characteristic of a successsful person .
New activities expand our basic knowledge and make us well qualified persons .
Near these , they make us more enthusiastic about new activities and encourage us to try our own plans .
we can make true our plans .

In conclusion , we can say that trying new things and taking risks are fundamental activities for becoming a successful person .
Because these activities give us the opportunity to supply our originality and creativity and also to expand our knowledge , these activities seem as neccessities for becoming a succcessful person .
if we really want it we can achieve to become a successful one .
