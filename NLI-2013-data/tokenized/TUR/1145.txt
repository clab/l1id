Academic studies are made for human being , every research should take the science one step further .
To focus on this purpose one needs to specialized about a subject .
To be successfull about it there are three steps to be followed .
These are focusing on the subject , gathering information and time .

A lot of things are explored up to now , when we look at the picture of the explorers whose findings caused humanity to live in more comfortable conditions living between the library , laboratoury and their home is their common habit .
At this creation process loosing determination can break the information chain that caries to success .

To get a new exploration one needs to know all old theories and approaches to the subject , so that he/she can study about the topic more effectively .
Visiting to other libraries , contacting with other academicians who are studying on the same topic are some of the ways to gather information .
During this stage if academician needs a backup from an another scientis , let 's say if a mechanical engineer needs a mathematician at modelling a new engine systems oil flow he can go and study with him .
He does not need to be an expert about it .

Creation takes time and as we can see from old scientists time one needs to be ready to give his all life time to his/her studies .

At last serving for humanity wants his servers to give all they have to it , and for to have all one needs to know everything about his/her subject .
