I agree that successful people try new things and take risks .
If some one would like to become bigger he should take risk because some obne does not know things work or not without trying .
Even you doing some thing already know you have develop your way of doing and folow the modernism that brought by the age that we live .
Every day needs of people and treatments toward the life are chanching .

I would like to illustrate my opinion with an example .
I would like to tell you about a simple farmer who was becoming the king of oil producer in Turkey .
It is not important the name of the person but its is important the way that he done things .
This person used to grow olive and sunflower in Izmir one of the biggest city in west Turkey .

And he thought to produce olive and sunflower oil rather than sell his production .
He could earn much if he produce oil from the plants that he growed .
An d bought an old oil factory and started his own company .
He worked day and night and won the belife of the consumer and growed and growed .

The second of the person life wich also demonstrate the benefical site having risk to try new thing that .
When the date showed late sixties people have started to chanche their way to buy oil .
They before pereferred to buy 20 kg cans but now they buy 2 kg pet bins .
So our hero see need of the new needs and bought some new machinery to produce the pet bins that the oil factory .

Finially , I can say that if this person did not try new things to do , I thing he has still remained as a simple farmer .
