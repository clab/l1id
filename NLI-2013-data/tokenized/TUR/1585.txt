As far as I am concerned , I totally agree with the statement stating that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one specific subject .
The reasons that why I think like this , are the followings : general academic knowledge within a broad range is a required item for the increasing interdependency between certain academic fields and provides the ability for the people in order to adopt the common language in the academic environment .

Firstly , nowadays , academic fields begin to be very correlated with each other .
For instance , I am an undergraduate student in a bioinformatic major and I am taking courses from computer science , biology , electronics and statistics .
Since there begins to be believe that integrative approaches may be more successfrul from pure biological , computational and statistical approaches , lots of academicians from different fields come together , share their ideas and efforts to provide a productive effort .
In my internship , I witnessed this working environment very closely in Stanford University , because we are colloborating with the Medical School as the Statistics Department .
In order to understand these common approaches , I had to gain a knowledge about both medicine and statistics .

Apart from this increasing connection between certain fields , there is a common language in the academicians .
For the people aiming to be a academician in the future , it is a must to have a general knowledge .
Since they have a lot of friends of academicians from various areas , they have to interact their colleagues in the academic environment .
They must perceive even a little about what their friends are talking in their fields .
They must express their ideas about various fields in an academic talk .
They can obtain this ability by trying to learn about different fields .

Because of the above mentioned reasons , I would prefer to have a general knowledge than specializing in a specific field .
