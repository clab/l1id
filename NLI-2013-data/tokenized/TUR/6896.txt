I think It is very possible to be decreased the number of cars or vehicles in the very near future .
Nowadays , number of the cars increases especially in big cities day by day .
Our lives become harder and harder while this number increasing .
People spend their hours on roads just to be able to get to their offices or schools .
Tranportation can easily be a chaos .
On the other hand energy resources are limited to supply energy for the unlimited number of cars .
Excessive number of cars also causes air pollution which is a big problem .
Scientist are also trying to develop alternative ways for supplying energy such as cars run with solar energy .
But energy supply will remain an important problem as long as new cars are produced .

Dozens of new cars enter to traffic each day .
But this cannot be unlimited .
Even for today , people have begun to find effective ways of transportation .
These alternative ways can be public transportation , subway or motorcycle .
According to my observations most of the people prefer public transportation instead of using their own cars .
I think people will have to stop using cars in the future even if they do n't prefer .
Because natural conditions wo n't let them pollute the environment so much .
Maybe , it will be too late for taking this decision .
There is no resource in the world that we can use unlimitedly .
With the rapid improvements on technology , some genius solutions can be found .
Maybe , we wo n't need cars in the future and return our nature .
