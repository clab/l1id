I agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts are more important for students than learning facts .

If a student invests his time to understand the basal ideas and concepts on a matter rather than just learning the facts he can use these in similar subjects .
Generally humans tend to do just as much as neccesary to solve a problem they faced .
So many students are just learning the facts to pass exams .
But they often seemed to forget the importance of ideas .
As an example in my first year in mechanical engineering I learned in my material sciences course not only the facts or calculations for the exam .
I used very much time to understand the consepts of structure of materials .
After I passed the exam that I could really understand the basics of solid mechanics and it helped me very much for my preparation time for this course .
I have seen that my investment really paid back .

In other hand the concepts or ideas are more likely to be reminded in later years .
The learned facts can replaced by new ones and you could not remind them even after some days .
As we are students and learning the subjects to use them we have to call them whenever we need .
For example I have been a very good student in high school and especially in physics .
After I begin with the university I have seen that I could not remind some formulas in physics which I used to know .
But with my understanding for physics helped me to derive them for very basic formulas .

Hence when trying to learn a subject it better to use more time for understanding then just learning facts .
