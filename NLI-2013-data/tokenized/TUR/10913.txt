There are many characteristics of successful people such as intelligence , knowledge , patience , openness and courage .
In my opinion the most important one is being open to new things and taking risks .
For this reason , I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
There are several reasons for my choice and they are the following .

First of all , these people are successful because they always update their knowledge in their area and also improve themselves continously .
In addition , they do not always stay in safe part they have reached in time but rather they look for other ways of improving themselves and ask for more information and more success by taking risks .
For example , the founder of our republic , Ataturk was a very successful soldier in Ottoman Empire but in time he took risks and left his position in Ottoman military in order to make leadership to Turkish citizens in the independence war .
As a result , he had lots of enemies , however , he served for Turkish public , played an important role in independence war and finally established the modern Turkish Republic .

Secondly , even if you are found successful at a point , it should be boring to maintain your knowledge at the same level for years , not trying new things and not taking risks .
The people who are found successful , in fact do not care about being successful and they do not hesitate to take risks that may result in a failure .
By this way , their experience and knowledge develop overtime and they take failures as an important part of their future success .
For example , many of the inventions made in the past were invaluable results of the new point of views of these successful people like Einstein and the return of the risks taken changed our lives all around the world .

In conclusion , I believe that being always curious about new things , taking risks , trying new things make a person successful and they are also crucial for me in my life .
