Nowadays it is considered as a very popular topic that one should have knowledge of many academic subjects or specialize in one topic .
Many people ignores this topic but it is very important for the university students and ones who have an aim to have an academic career .

Opponents of the idea ` having one specific subject ' consider that one should have relative subjects like maths and physics , so when they see an Integral in the middle of a physics lesson , they should avoid the problems with ease .
Moreover they think that one can earn much money when s/he has two or more subjects .
In addition to that it will ease the communication between student and teacher , when they have many things to talk about .

Although in first sight it is seen that one should have many academic subjects , it is not like it is seen .
First of all one should know a lot of things about Maths if she/he is a physician .
So s/he does n't have to make longer his/her study and be also an mathematician .
It will bore the teacher when s/he is young and a university student and s/he can change his/her plan being an academician .

In addition to that it is always considered that one can earn a lot of money when s/he has two or more subjects .
The answer is simple : No !
The academicians are paid by the hours that they teach .
No one pay you much money even if you have ten subjects or one .
The payment is always the same .

Thirdly physicians do n't have to know much about psychology .
Because thay have no time to spend with another subject for just finding a topic with students to talk about .
If they want to talk about something they can talk about football matches , TV programs etc ..

At last we should consider that academicians are busy people and they are being waited for the researches and new technologies .
The second subject will reduce the chance of discover the new part of the modern life because thay wo n't have time and energy to focus on the new researches .
If everyone could do just his/her own job , the world would have been probably different and lovely ..
