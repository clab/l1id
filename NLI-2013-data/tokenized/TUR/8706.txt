Education has been avitally aspect of human life .
People are born then firstly want to learn or do something .
Therfore , learning is the best point in this statement .
I do not agree that to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
In terms of the two most remakable factors are emotion and necessity .

The first and most significant factor is emotion .
It is true .
People need learning something .
It is an emotinal action .
Therfore , emotion is very important for student .
For example , a business student want to ask a question about economics so the student just want to learn how about this title .
It is the prime factor of learning is important for students .

The secondary very important factor is necessity .
We have to learn how we can be alive .
Since the old centuries , people have researched and they learnt how we can survive .
Learning is necessary for our life .
Actually students have to know much knowledge about their major study courses .
Students especially must to learn everything about theit depertmants .
I give an example that if a doctor did not know how he/she helps a cancer problem , probably the doctor can not be a real doctor .
Learning is necessity for all students .

Taking these things which are emotin and necessity are most important factors about my disagreement .
To learn facts can be provide good education for students .
Consequently , understanding ideas is important but learning facts is more important for students .
We can see this thing our whole life .
