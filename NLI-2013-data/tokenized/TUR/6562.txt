There are several things that makes our life easier such as computers , planes , cars and cellphones .
There is a statement about cars : `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today . ''
I can not agree with this idea at all .

First of all i do not believe that there is going to be an invention that would take cars ' place .
The cars are the easiest way of transportation in daily life .
As long as someone do not invent a machine that can fly between short distances and is cheaper than a car i will not sell my car !
Addition to that we use cars for public transportation too .
I would n't be able to go somewhere i do not know if there were no taxis .
What is more twenty years is too short to make an invention that can beat cars .

Although i really wish the number of cars to decrease in twenty years .
Cars are good for transportation but what about the environment ?
They cause air pollution and the gas poisons people .
Every passing day the situation is getting worse .
People die from lung cancer .
There is also a big problem called ` traffic jam ' .
I think all of the big cities suffer from traffic jam at the rush hour .
This cause city people to be more stressed and depressed , than the country people .

The cars have a lot of advantages but i think disadvantages are more .
I use my car not because it is fun , because it is a necessity .
Unfortunately i can not agree with the idea that says `` The number of cars will decrease in twenty years . ''
.
By thinking of the sentence `` Necessity is the mother of invention '' I hope there will be a better way of transportation in the future but i do not think there will be an important invention in twenty years .
Therefore I do not believe there will be fewer cars in use than there are today in twenty years .
