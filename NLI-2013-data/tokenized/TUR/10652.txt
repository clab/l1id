All over the world , if we examine the present and past , there is two kind of person , one who serves their life in the known ways , just simply survives and the extreme ones who make new things try to find new ways and takes risks which can not be taken .
I am totaly agree that successful people are the ones that who try the new and take risks even if I can not be taken before .

Firstly , success is something like not to be done by everyone , in opposite you can say that reading is a success , but nowadays it is not because everybody can read .
In that point it might be a good example to give the Wright Brothers flying expriences , 100 years before they tried to fly , and they took the biggest risk which can be caused by death .
They were successful inventors .
And I think that is the meaning of success .

After that I can be known that the times that risks are taken might be the break down of the history , and if you dont take the risk you can not survive .
In the history , there is certain times that whole future is in the hands of a human being .
One cannot say that the risk of Hannibal to pass tha Alpines ( the Mountain above the italy ) in the middle of the winter was not a risk , but at the end he reached with his chosen army to the center of Italy to Rome .
He was a successful soldier .
Sometimes if you dont take risks you cannot survive .

Finally , trying new things is one of the most strong way to be successful .
The other ways done by lots of people lots of time and you can see that they all not did anything new .
For example , the great experimental physicist M. Faraday , try the new way of understanding the unknown area , and until he was shown on the scene it might be tried these experiments over hundred times .
Of course he is a successful man because he tried the new and think the new .

All in all , the whole world is turning over the successful persons hands , and if you tried to look up their most attracted works they tried the new , they take the risk .
