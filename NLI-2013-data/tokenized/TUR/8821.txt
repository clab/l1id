I agree this idea .
It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The students should find a new ideas or new concepts for the our future .
If they learn only facts it is bad because they will be afraid from the facts than they can not to find new ideas or they can not learn the concepts .
For example when my father start to fruit business he tell me about the business and some information about the money i said this is very big business and we can earn lot of money but when he started to tell me the facts i afraid of that business and i promise myself if started to work i will not do fruit and banana business .
Now i am 18 years old and i dont do that job and i can not find ideas and i didnt learn any concepts about this job i am very upset now and than i promised myself again and i will never learn the facts before i started the new job .
I want to mantion about that now my father the best in the banana business because he always learn new ideas and new concepts .
The students should learn and understand ideas and concepts .
When we started to new projects or new jobs we have find and learn new ideas and consepts than i think we will see the facts .
The life is hard and every time you have to learn something and you have to learn ideas and concepts .
