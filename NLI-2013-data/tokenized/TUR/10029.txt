I agree with the statement that mentioned above .
For example a bussiness man should attempt new markets or develop new strategies in addition to their rational states .
Because envirement always changes with it 's advantages and threats .
So If a bussines man wants to survive and gain more benefits than the others has to differ hisself with their risks .
Everybody knows investing is a critical case .
If you really do not know the rules or other parameters in the market that you attempt to exist , you will lose your money .
It is clear that it contains risks because you are a new character in the market .
You could be beaten by your competitors .
The information and skills is a key point to accomplish the new situations risks and threat .
You shoul have skills and information , lack of information could sink you .
But if you have information , and qualify enough with the state of brave you could benefit and defend yourself from the threats of the market or somoething else .
Surely seeing the future is an ability but you can estimate the future conditions with the today 's informations and trends .
You can be the best at what you are doing at , but if you do not improve yourself to an advanced level , you will see somebody has already done .
And has already benefiting that you could be did if you had not been a lazy one .
A Sweedish king said ` I would be at a position of winnig with the help of the lossings that i had ' .
This life i think not for the people who does not improve himself or has a lack of brave emotion , There will be always risks but we all have to try to accopmlish , and let to lead ourselves to advanced levels .
