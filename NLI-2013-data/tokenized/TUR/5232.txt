Today the most challenging area in the business sector is ` marketing` , which is how to advertise your product so that it will flourish among the competitive products and then be sold , As the challenge increases , the main actors in the sector try to come up with innovative ideas in order to survive in this cruel world of business .
These main actors are advertisers , who actually present the product to the comment of the buyer , Through a considerable amount of time , enery and money spent on the analysis of the sector eventually has begined to create its ` own ' marketing strategies , The most tricky and throuhly successful strategy is to introduce an advertisements that make products seem much better than they really are , This method of ` diguise ' brings one of the hottest issue in the sector : Violation of the ethical considerations , Some advertisers and the companies who hire them think that there cannot be any rules for this game , They claim that they do not insist on the customers to buy the product that is advertised with having told that it has the best feauters compared to similar products , So it is up to the customers whether to choose buying the product or not , On the other hand , some companies emphasize the importance of the some set of ethical values that set the sector in a balance so that it will last , Among these two different perspectives , I think the exclusion of ethical considerations would not harm the sector or the so-called balanced ,

Now , it would be beneficial to grasp an example and see how the two different approaches handle the case .
Soap is an important product in the FCGM ( Food and Consuption Goods Market ) and probably we are encountering dozens of advertisements on how well ` their ' soaps are , Before going any further , it is incredibally crucial to state the goal of each company regardless of its scale , sector , private or public status : To make profit ; make more money , Remembering this goal , it would be easily concluded that any department in the company seeks to contribute to this profit in a way that department performs , For the marketing department , the way is to advertise the product best so that it will be sold and company will get a profit in return , If you target to make more money , back to example , you have no choise other than selling your soap brand , And if you lack of some quality or price specifications , the only choice to follow is waiting for you : To lie to the buyer ; or in a more kindly way , to exaggregate the features of the products , Any marketing department and advertisers have not the luxury of betraying the ultimate goal of the company .
So it is extremely logical to exaggregate the features of the products in order to make your products seem much better than they really are when you cannot meet some crucial specifications such as quality which is one of the traits of the prducts customers are seeking to buy ,

On the other hand , the ethical dimension of the issue is still a big question mark for those who see the ethical and moral values much more prior and important to making profit ,

In conclusion , it depends on your conscience to lie to your customers or not , I agree that most advertisements make prodcuts seem mcuh better than they really are ; however , due to the reason I stated above , this kind of a marketing strategy just serves to what it is supposed to , If I would be an advertiser and meet a case like this one , I totally go with ` lying to the customer and doing the best for my company` , Besides , I would not be offended as a mere customer and not feel betrayed by the company I trust .
