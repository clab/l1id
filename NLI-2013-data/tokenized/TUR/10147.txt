Did you ever think how successful people become successful ?
The answer of this question is most probably : by trying new things and taking risks rather than doing something already known .

Trying new things is one of the ways of being successful .
One of the important characteristics that makes a person successful is being different .
People usually do not clap something they see everyday .
Why people like magicians ?
Because they are doing something that we can not understand how he is doing it and that can not be seen in everyday life .
The same thing can be applied to subject of success .
Of course this does not mean you are unsuccessfull with an university grade 3.5 over 4 because there are a lot of 3.5s , but any way a person with a university degree of 4 is more successful than you , since there are less 4s .

Another way of being successful is taking risks .
You can not know what you are doing is good or bad unless you see its result .
In order to see the result , you should do that thing and in order to do it ; you should take risks .
This is like a chain .
None without one .
Think of climbers .
When we see them at the top of the mountains with a great smile on their faces , we understand the happiness of success , but how does a climber do this ?
By taking several risks .
He may fall because the rock he hold cracked .
This does not mean that every risk can be or should be taken .
Risk is something external .
If climber falls because he hold the wrong rock , this is not a result of risk ; because this is his fault ; he is not trained enough to climb that rock .
This is something internal .

In conclusion , trying new things and taking risks bring success , but knowing what is risk is an important point to be considered .
