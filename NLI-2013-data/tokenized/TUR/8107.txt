I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts rather than to learn facts because firstly , the student has a chance to improve when he learns the idea .
For example ; if the student is taught about spherical mirrors in physics class , he should not be given the simple equations .
He should rather be told to prove how these equations are derived so in this way he can actually improve himself in spherical mirrors .
In this way , the student can learn better in further topics such as lenses .

Secondly .
understanding the ideas can help the student look at things in a broader way because by analysing the ideas , the individudal can examine the life around himself in many different ways .
For instance , in my extra lessons the teacher always wanted me to memorise the equations in the science class but in the school my other teacher wanted me to look at the topic in a broader way and think on it and she was actually right because I now know that memorising a fact in any science class is not effective for me to look at how the nature works scientifically .
If I know where all the equations and main points come from , then I can examine the environment around me in a broader way so understanding the main idea effectively helps .
On the other hand , memorising a fact does not definitely help me examine my environment because after a while I forget that ` fact ' and I may even never use it again .

Thirdly , understanding the ideas will give the student a confidence because when the student achieves a goal in that idea ; he feels pleasure about it .
When I first started writing my essay on sociolinguistics ; my supervisor did not teach me the main facts but he guided me about which books to use and which keywords have to be mentioned so in this way he did not want me to memorise but he wanted me to ` get the idea ' and eventually .
after using the books and the keywords , I realized that I definitely understood what the topic is mainly about .
When I handed my essay in , I was very confident of myself and I felt joy and pleasure because I actually improved myself and I learned the topic all by myself .
Even my supervisor was surprised because I was not taking sociolinguistics classes and the fact that I learned the topic all by myself made it much more better and interesting .

To conclude , understanding the main ideas are better for students to learn facts because firstly , by learning the ideas they can improve and become more confident .
Furthermore , they can analyse their environment in a broader way by learning the main ideas .
In addition , if the student achieves a goal about that topic by understanding it , he will be happy to be successful .
