To answers to the question `` do advertisements exaggracete the products ? '' may change from person to person .
So , people have different opinions about most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are or not .
I strongly support the this opinion .
From today 's point of view , I can list many reasons for that .

Firstly , advertisements aim lot of sales .
Producers produce the their products to earning money .
Last year I saw very big advertisement about computer on the television and I bought one .
But I do not like it .
Because advertisement said that this computer is incredible fast , you could not find faster one .
But I recognize that it was really slow after I use it .
I want to refuse this computer , but company said that we can pay just half price to you .

Secondly , to sell the any product is difficult .
Because generally people do not want to spend more money .
People have some difficulties about future and they tend to accumulation .
For this reason , producers need an exaggracete advertisement .
Indeed , there is the exaggarecete in the advertisement habitat .

In addition to what I have mentioned before , I should say that advertisements is needed for people .
If there is no advertisements , people do not find product which they need .
Advertisements help to people that decide to which product should buy .

On the other hand some times advertisements cause the really good product .
For example one company sell its product with big advertisement .
So , people think about these product is good .
If the product do not really good , people should hear this situation and sales are decrease and then accompany will lose .
So , company want to produce good product .

While I can say advertisements make products seem much better than they realy are , I cannot say whole products are worst than they really are .
Some products which produce from well-known mark are really good .

I tried to explain the reasons of my opinion .
All of these are the reasons why I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than really are .
