I strongly agree that successful people try new things and take risks .
There are so many things that make people successful , but taking risks and trying new things are the most important part of being successful in my own opinion .
The main reason is that there are plenty of people who are very successful by taking risks in their lifes .
In addition , the life has become pretty flexible .
Therefore this flexibilty makes people think differently .

Recently I have read an article regarding the life of Ronald Thrump who is very good at realestate business as everybody knows .
This article hs affected me a lot , in other words this article has left great impressure on my life .
According to Ronald Thrump , If someone wants be successful , he or she should take risks .
Also he believes that unless some risks are taken in this life , we cannot be really successful as we want to be .
There are so many succuessful people also who have become very successful by taking risks , trying new things , working on different fields which made them become very successful .
Therefore I strongly believe that taking some risks will bring succeed .

Day by day the world is becoming smaller .
In other words , the world has become such a small town as some expert people say .
This situation makes this life more flexible as well .
As a direct result of this flexibty , people work on very different and new areas .
Some people who take advantages of these new areas , who benefits properly from these areas become very successful .
This is why , people who want be successful should observe new areas and invest on these areas as well .
Twenty years ago 's opportunities were much more different than today .
We should consider new areas , new things , if we reallly want to be successful

In conclusion , as the time passes , we should think according to needs of time .
The life is really pretty short and in this short life some who take risks properly are successful .
At least , I find them very successful .
