It is difficult to say that whether to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or not .
If you ask to me , I prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects for several reasons .
According to me , having wide broad knowledge about several topics helps you to be more social , to compete in bussiness environment and to aware yourself in your field of study .

First of all , in my opinion , if you have more knowledge on many subjects then you could easily get friends .
You would not have difficulty to talk with a new person .
Consider that you meet someone who is computer science student in a party and you know something about satellites .
All right !
this is a great change to start a conversation if you like to talk him or her .

Secondly , bussiness life becoming more and more competitive today .
How much topic do you know is more important than how detail in one topic dou you know nowadays .
Bosses prefer to hire a person who have several experiences on many topics .
If you look at job offerings today , you will see a long list of expected knowledge .
IT departments are example to this situation .
Although a person is hired to development department of IT , it is expected from him to know about security , database sytems or something else .

In addition to the second reason , I think that if you have broader knowledge , you could easy change your field of study .
If you dont want to work on database systems , you could work on security systems .

Thirdly , I you have broad knowledge , you will know where you are and you can test yourself that you exactly want this field of study .
Do you exactly want to study in art or study in geology ?
If you know a little bit knowledge about other fileds then you feel comfortable with your choice .

In conclusion , my choice about this topic is to have broad knowledge on many academic topics .
