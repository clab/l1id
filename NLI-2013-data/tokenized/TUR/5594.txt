Fake pictures In the Advertisements Advertisement , it is the major force that makes the product of a company to be sold .
Those sometimes appear in television screens and sometimes in news papers .
They may even appear on radio channels .
They are in every aspect of our life .
Advertisements actually make products look much different and better than they really are .

On televisions , as it is widely known not only the product but also anything that comes to mind appear on the screen seem much better that they are .
After the invention of the television as a result of the technology developed , lots of fakes made on the appearance of the product .
Of course in the advertisements this fake on the products makes the products seem efficient and desirable .
Another situation that changes the people 's mind is that the companies use famous people in their advertisements .
As a consequence of that the person who will buy the product is going to think about some irrelevant stuff such as the fabulous life of the famous person .

Sometimes not only in advertisements appear on television but also in the advertisements appear on any other aspect of life one of the most important and disgusting situation occurs .
The company owner itself or the person acts on the advertisements may lie .
For example a building is said to be built with the latest technology .
On the other hand it is actually a very unstable building .
That lie may lead to very terrible consequence .

To sum up , advertisements are the very important part of our life .
In some manners they give directions to us .
While we choose the car we drive , the parfume we use , even the apartement we live in we are affected by the advertisements .
Unfortunately the most of the advertisements do not show the reality .
Instead they show people the fake pictures of the product .
