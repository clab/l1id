It is not better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
It may cause a huge problem because if a lot of person know a little about many subjects , how do they teach something in detail about a sepecific subject to another ?
Also how do people become a teacher with this little information ?
How do knowledge can improve with a little information about a subject ?
That is why it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Lets consider that there is a little population in a small land and they know a little information about every academic subject like geography , biology , history , physics ...
etc .
With this little knowledge it would be hard to determine geographical characteristics of the land , or species that live in the land and their differences or similrities .
Even it will be hard to now what is a specie or it would be hard to know about their history and it will be hard to put things on a road in the future .
So , that will helps to the population to destroy themselves more quickly .

On the other hand , imagine a land which is full of people who have a well knowledge about their one proffecional area .
With this proffecion they can teach their knowledge to their children or the ones who wants to learn about the subject .
The difference between this example from the previous one is they will know much more information on a subject and that will help to develop themselves more quickly .

In conclusion , as I said and support the idea with the examples before , I believe that it would be more effective when people have one proffecional area than to know a little about a lot of subjects because it will help them to improve themselves and also to have a well educated population in the land .
