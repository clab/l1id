In my sense it is better to specialize in one spesific subject in a globalised renovative and inventive world namely in today 's world as an exper in a specific subject .

Twentieth and this centuries have been the leading centuries in technological enhancement and progress .
so much information is being circulated so fast that sometimes it is very difficult to fallow up the developments .
In suzh an environment it is more useful and efficient for person to specialise in a specific topic and improve himself in this field .

To me we have to specialize since this is the only way to go in this century .
Just giving an example you can not go to a doctor specialised in the heart illnesses for a headache you are suffering .
The very broad range of fields in medicine requres doctors to specialize in one of those fields .
We can consider this requirement for all of other sciences namely social sciences maths and etc ...

While you have the oppurtunity to examine details from many aspects of views in one subject It is very hard to do this if you care about the all matters .
And having this oppurtunity will contribute the efficiency and productivity of the studies .

By specializing in one subject one gains the confidence to carry out new researches and he/she is encoureged with new findings .

On the other hand a close cooperation among the fields of studies is necessary to yiled fruitful results .
Since some subjects are interrelated and have very close ties with eachother we need to achive this cooperation in order to have more advanced results .

Finally I beleive it is better to have an expertise in one subject .
This is not a choice but an obligatory situation in today 's world .
Morover some sort of efficient mechanisms must be promoted to establish connections among the related subjects .
