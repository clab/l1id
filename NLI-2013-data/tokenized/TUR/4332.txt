The people should help their community .
But some people do not help their communities , especially young people .
Because they belive that they are happy in being this situation .
But they are not .
They can not see that because they lost theirself in this complicated world .
Because of growing very rapidly and basicly in that global world make them careless person .
But i firmly agree this statement .
This are my following reasons .

Firstly , nowadays young people do not give enough time their communities .
They suppose that they can live alone with not communicating in this developing world .
Actually we can not accuse them completely .
Because in this information era when we live they are used to play computer games and surfing in internet .
So they became people who do not go theaters and movies and do not participate in social activities .
And these conditions help them to alleviate .

Moreover , young people do not give enough time their communities because they think that when they could start to walk they are free .
And they can do everything what they want .
So they neglect their families and their friends .
When all young generation did this , the world has became worse place than before .
They believe that they are free and they behave how they want .
If they continue to do this , this stuation does not progress and it collapses .
We must be carefull when growing a child .
If only we do like this , we can protect our futures and our children's

In conclusion , I firmly believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
