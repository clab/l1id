We are living in a community and have some responsibilities because of this .
But many of us , specially the younger generation , do n't give enough importance to these duities .
In this essay I will try to explain this fact by stating the reasons .

It is a truth that younger generation of the society do not pay enough attention to help their communnities .
As humans live in communities , it is our main duty to help the community , so that one day when we need help we w 'll be able to receive from somebody else .
But the conditions of modern life lead to a change in this picture .
Younger people generally spend time on so many different activities that they can not find any spare time to share with the public .
For instance , they attend some schools , do different kinds of activities in the school , deal with the computer and also deal with the problems in their daily lives .
As a result , most of the youngs can not find enough time to help their communities .
Even if they do , it is very limited .

One other factor that prevents youngs from helping their communities is the misleading of the youngs by the community .
This can sound strange , but it is also the communitie that is causing the problem .
Young people in the community are not tought enough about the importance of supporting the community .
They have a lack of information on how serious this subject can be .
Thus , they do not clearly understand why they should help their communities .
I can give an example on this subject from my personal life .
The last time I went to a house for elderly , I had the chance of meeting many old people and learning about their experiences in life .
They complained about the young people in the society and that they are not spending any timewith them .
What is more , I was the only student who went there for the last two months .
What was surprising for me in that visit , was one of the things that I heard from one old man .
He said that it was the elderlies fault that they do not have any visitors now , because he even did n't teach the importance of helping the community , in some ways , to his own children .
As s result , even his children do n't come to see him .

It is true that young members of the society do not pay enough attention to help their communities .
There are some reasons like spending time for other things and the miseading of the society on this subject .
But it is also true that youngs should help their societies so that they can find help when they need .
