Trying new things and taking risks is a critical part of progress .
It is the essence of creation , without which we would have never progressed beyond the Stone Ages .
It is important for people to grow , learn from mistakes and bring about changes .
And it is a must for successful people in most professions in today 's business world .

People who only do what they already know how to do well do not grow personally .
They do n't get to realize their full potential .
They do a mediocre job at what they are doing , because they do not contribute anything new , only what they have been doing for years or what everyone else has been doing .

On the other hand , people who try something new or take risks stand out from the crowd .
People respect them for their courage and self-confidence .
If the risk brings success along with it , then it is most often phenomenal success .
Because risk-taking usually results in all-or-nothing type scenarios .
But even if the risk does n't bring about success , it is certainly a means for the person to learn something , and will pave the way for success in the future .

There are some professions where it is not only preferable that people try new things and take risks , but it is obligatory .
For instance , in advertising , it is extremely important to come up with something new for your advertising campaign .
If you do n't do something out of the ordinary , then your advertising campaign will blend in with the other millions of advertising campaigns out there and will not even be remembered by your target audience .

Trying new things and taking risks is part of what makes us human , of our creative spirit .
We should not restrict our creative spirit for fear of failure , for failure is also a part of the learning process .
And it is what bring success in the long-term .
