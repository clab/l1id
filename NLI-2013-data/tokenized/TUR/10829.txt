I agree with the following statementBecause all of these are risk while living .
for example I'am a food engineer .
I know food very well .
But I mus n't work in food factory or deperment of food in factory .
May be I am successful an other depertmant .
In my family my uncle is a doctor .
He is n't work in hospital .
Now heis working international factory and heis very successful person .
So I take risks to be successful person .
First of all you love your job or work .
when you love , nothing is problems .
Finally look at life of succesful persons , they take alot of risks everytime .
