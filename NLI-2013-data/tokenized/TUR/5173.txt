The role of media and advertisements on our lives has always been an interesting topic for me .
The pushing media plays a significant part in our decision giving process and consuming patterns .
I strongly agree that most of the advertisements imposed to us effects our buying decisions and make the products seem better than they really are .

First of all , the product advertised on several media channels mostly do not reflect its real physical appereance in terms of size , shape , or color .
By the help of advancing technologies such as computer programs and new viewing technologies in creative sciences , it became so easy to make adjustments on the physical appereance of a product .
As a result the product seems much more attracting to consumers on TV or newspaper .
But when you go to buy the product you realize that it does not look as good as it was advertised Additionally , in terms of quality what is promised by the firm is mostly not realized after the purchasing stage .
It is easy to promise on ads rather than realizing it .
For example in my country many home appliance firms which basically produce washing machines or refrigerators assure their customers that their goods will not be broken for three years .
And if these goods are broken they guarantee affording the cost of fixation .
In reality the item you buy generally breaks down in less than three years .
Worsely , when you email or phone them to transfer your complaint or dissatisfaction , it is a tiny possibility that you will get assistance .

Lastly firms are getting more wild on earning more profits because of the financial instability in the world .
Wars and economic crisis always fluctions in economy .
Therefore companies in order to strengthen their financial standing and improve their profit margin .
they focus on advertisements to increase their sales .
As a consequence new way of advertising enters into scene which is lying people about their products and pushing them to buy without hesitation .

consequently I strongly agree that in todays world most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are since the advancing technology , ease of promising more and more and the financial status of the countries and firms .
