The 21st Century is the century of more technological developement than any century before could achieve and the century of unsufficient sources .
Due to the population growth , on of the concerns of the scientists and researchers is the transportation problem .

One side of transportation problem is the number of cars in the traffic .
The traffic rush , the pollution and the gas are the problems of car use .
The technological developement may be used to protect the planet and find new sources of energy or use existing sources more efficiently .
Therefore , we can argue that in twenty years , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today : firstly , because there wo n't be enough gas for all the cars in use and secondly , there will be new ways of public transportations , like the millenium 's invention , the `` Ginger '' , or cost-efficient flying objects .

On the other hand , technological predictions on the future were always been a source of inspirations for the scientists , but never been accurate .
For exemple , according to 2001 : A Space Oddesey by Arthur C.Clark , we should have been living on other planets by now .
Or if predictions were true , Jules Verne 's novels would n't mostly be unrealized .
Therefore , we can state that , according to the growing numbers of cars in use , in twenty years there will be even a lot more number of car on the roads .

In conclusion , we can say that the future depends on us .
If in twenty years , we learn to be more proactive and begin to take initiatives , people 's awareness of the damage and pollution of cars could prevent the growing number of cars in use .
Nevertheless , if we keep on persisting on individual gain and forgeting about the planet 's sake , there will be much more cars riding on the roads every day .
