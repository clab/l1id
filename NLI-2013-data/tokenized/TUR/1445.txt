It is an important decision , how to plan your syllabus .
Some students prefer to take a lot of courses and expand their knowledge , whereas some other prefer to specialize in one specific subject .
In this essay I will dwell on the advantages of specializing in one subject and argue in its favor .

There are at least three reasons why choosing one subject is better than trying to keep balance between many subjects .
The first and most important reason for me is that this way people concentrate on one thing and do not feel anxiety about time-management and deadlines .
In contrast , student who take three or four subjects are very busy and stressed , because they have to prepare for many exams and see different lecturers , which is confusing and the results are not as good as those of the ones from the one subject plan .
In addition , when one specializes in one subject then this person has more chances to be well-informed about it and do his best , being sure he recieves the best knowledge and invests in something substantial and prosperious .
The second reason is that this kind of studying gives the opportunity to work and gain your own money .
Usually students depend on their parents and have to explain why they need money , which is not very pleasant .
For instance , I used to work when i did not have many lessons and I was happy that I was able to succeed in working and doing something important as an adult does , relying on my own experience .
The third reason is that the students can pay more attention to their relatives , friends and even their hobbies .
Moreover , life is not only studying and if we cannot enjoy it , we should rethink our point of view .
For example , students , who do not have fun and only study , get sick and miss the both chances .
The psychologies have proved that working hard is not the best for our health and we should take rest from time to time .

In my opinion , it is better to specialize in one subject , because this choice makes us have more healthy life , which has is successful too .
