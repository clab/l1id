The idea of teaching may be described in few steps .
The first step will ofcourse be the theory .
To understand a given subject one should know what is already there , what exists .
After that , as the second stage they will need to learn what is said about the existing case .
A person becomes a student to learn , learning includes learning how to think .

For instance if you are reviewing a company as it 's general director , you should first know the basic things like it 's field of production or expertise , capital , number of workers , its current standing in the market .
After knowing what is there , you may start to create your ways of carrying the company forward .
The things you have to learn in the first step are the facts .
When you are ready to walk on , you start taking ideas and concepts on how develop .

It is similar for a new learner student .
If he or she does n't know that two times two equals four , he or she will never understand the basics of mathematics .
After learning the main rules and factors they may look into ideas and concepts that have formed around the facts .
So saying that a kid refusing to learn the main rules of math will be a genius in the future , under the name of open mindedness may be nonsense .
If only the factors were tought to students they would probably become narrow minded people and never get to see different aspects of life .
So combining the two becomes a must .
While knowing the facts one should also understand the ideas about it .

From this frame I would like to state that understanding ideas and the concepts is need for a student to be able to see different point of views towards a single subject , but it does n't carry a meaning without knowing what the subject is which is formed by gathering of the factors .
