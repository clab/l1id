There are much more things that students must know than the students used to must know .
Especially after industrial revolution , in the area of engineering science there have been lots of development .
Some are not used anymore , some are still being used .
If it is used , students have to have knowlegde about that .
However there are so many thing which students have to know that it cannot be given into a single person .
So learning ideas and concepts is more important than to learn ideas for two reasons .

First , it is the idea that create facts .
All the facts come from a inventor or from a group of inventor .
They have got first the idea , then try it and see whether it works or not .
If students know the concepts , they can know where inventor made things wrong .
Actually , this is the way of development .
For example , for all people know that if apple falls from a tree , it hits the earth , but newton asked why .
From this point of view , he got another idea from a fact and created another fact .
As in this example it is beneficial students to learn ideas in order to increase their creativity .

Secondly , as mentioned above , there are lots of things to learn .
In a limited time period students learn either some facts and its applications very well or ideas and concepts of many thing .
Second one sounds better .
The reason why second one sounds better is because of globolization .
If a person has some ideas about a issue , he or she can many available information about that issue on the library or on the internet .
So the only thing is to know basic concepts of an argument .
