There is still not a common answer to the question about having knowledge of various academic topics .
Some people believe that they should learn about too many subjects whereas others believe specializing on a specific one brings more success .
It is possible to have a clear opinion on this issue by focusing on the technological innovations and increasing connections between the different study areas .
Although one person can not learn too many subjects very detailed , it is better to have broad knowledge of different academic subjects than to have a very detailed knowledge of just one specific topic due to the factors that are mentioned .

It can be claimed that since the technology is developing in a very rapid way it will not be possible to catch the innovations without focusing on only one issue .
In addition , it may be argued that specializing on a specific subject will be better than to have knowledge of various subjects in order to improve the skills and to get a better education .
However , the technological developments bring the working areas together and it is not easy to seperate the topics of each academic subject .
Every academic issue is related to another one .
Therefore , giving the attention to only one specific subject will prevent a person to understand the basic ideas and details of that subject .
On the other hand , by having ideas on all the related topics will be very advantageous because it will not be easy to understand a subject by ignoring the links between that subject and the others .

To sum up , in order to get a clear idea on the question about having knowledge of different academic subjects , the analysis should be done under the light of increasing links between different subjects .
As it will cause to ignore some points , specializing on a specific subject is worse than having broad knowledge of many subjects .
