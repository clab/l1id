When compared to the past in modern societies people are so selfish which means they are ignoring their reponsibilities for their communities such as helping .
That can exactly be true when young people are considered .
Since they are going to be the adults of the future .
Why do not they give enough time to their responsibilities to the community ?
It can be discussed in two different aspects .

Firstly , they do not have enough time to give .
Because they donot organize their time according to their duties for the community .
They spend all their time to their professional work or entertainment .
First they are giving much more their attentions to their other works especially to their professional works .
For example a teenager spends most of his time in school and a young adult in his office .
Furthermore they spend their times also on entertainment .
Since entertainment issues take their attetion much more then helping their community .
And entertainment makes happy them much more then helping community .

Secondly , they are ignoring their duties because they think that somebody can do that for them .
Firstly their parents does also their duties for community and they get accustomed to this situation .
Secondly , they think that they can not make it by their own and they are not capable of successing in their duties .
To illustrate , in some social problems that require their helps , as an individual they think it is impossible to handle .
On the other hand , these reasons suits their way of life .
In modern societies , people live as an individual not as an community so ignoring duties for community make much sense for them .

To conclude , young people are ignoring their responsibilities such as helping their community because of their not equally organized life style and their way of life .
It can be inferred that young people do not give enough time to help their community .
