I agree with the idea that there will be fewer cars in future than today becouse everything is changing about transportation and there are two reasons why the statement is true .

First thing i like to say is about the prices of the cars and the prices of the other ways of transportation .
car prices are getting more and more expensive day by day .
it is not only the prices of the cars but also prices of the car insurances .
i know very much people who intended to buy a car than chanced his mind becouse of the expensive prices for example .
now , these people are using the other way of transportation which are more cheaper like ; trams , busses , metros ...

Secondly , as the technology is improving , govenment make metros and trams which will close the rodes of cars and make so much traffic jams than it will make the people use the metros and trams .
if we look at the rates of the using of transportation we can see that even now it has some decreasing of using cars .

In conlusion , there will surely be decrease on the numbers of the cars in twenty years becouse of the tecnology and expensive prices of the cars and its needs .
and in my opinion it has already started to decrease maybe we wont see any car after twnty or thirty years .
