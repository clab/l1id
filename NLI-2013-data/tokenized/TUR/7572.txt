I do n't agree with the idea that the best way of traveling is to join a group led by a tour guide for several reasons .
First of all , no matter how many people are contributing to the group , hiring a tour guide is always a lot more pricy than traveling by yourself or with a friend or two .
Indeed , I find these tours as tourist traps because the tourists pay double or triple price when they visit museums with the ` knowlegable ' tour guides , compared to the amount they pay at the door .
For example , I went to Moscow last year and at the Kremlin Palace I noticed that the visitors are given two options , either you can hire a guide at the door for an outrageous price or you buy an audio guide for only three dolars .
Is n't it obvious which one makes more sense ?

Some people might argue that a tour guide has a lot of information about the city that is being visited , so it is essential to be led by one .
However a well-writen guide book would compensate the need for a tour guide and these guide books could easily be obtained from the bookstores or even tourist information offices .
Recently these guide books are being written by locals of the place and they contain all the valuable information that a visitor may need .
Furthermore they are being updated as new places open or anything changes in the place .

Also traveling with a group has the inevitable disadvantage of moving as a group .
Despite of the fact that each individual has there own interests and their own preferences , the group has a certain schedule for the entire trip and mostly it is required to follow this schedule .
This requirement leds people to see places that they have no interest in and in a way it turns the trip into an unpleasent event .
