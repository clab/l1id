Some may argue that successful people do n't try new things meaning that they do n't take any risks in the life .
However , I disagree with this opinion and for some reasons I beleive that one should take risks in order to be successful in the life .

First of all , trying new things develops one 's imagination and creativity .
In other words doing the things which we already know brings ordinarity and make people 's life monoton .
I think , imagination and creativity plays very important role in being successful .
Only if you have some extraordinary imagination and creativity you can succeed .
I wolud like to qoute from Albert Einstein saying `` Imagination is more important than knowledge , knowledge is limited but imagination encirles the world . ''

On the other hand , the life itself , I beleive , is a risk .
No one can know for sure what tomorrow will bring .
So , if we are living in a risky life , then , it is unnecessary to hesitiate to take some risks in the life .
By taking risks , people increases their chances of finding new opportunies to make their lifes more enjoyable , confortable and desirable .
I think , most of the successful people taking risks beacuse of the invevitability of risks .

Thirdly , no one can know what something new will bring without trying it .
I mean , of course , while something new will have both negative and positive effects , not to trying it restricts the probability of getting the positive side .
I beleive that making some preliminary studies , I mean thinking , one can easily take risks in the sake of getting the positive sides .

For these reasons I stated above , I am of the opinon that successful people try new things and take risks in the life .
