Shaping of the human thinking style is possible .
There is a fact that people from different countries have different reactions to the facts surrounding them .
This difference arises from the various education types in schools and the families .
There are two ways to teach someting to somebody .

The first one is teaching the reasons , therefore the ideas and concepts .
By this technique the student will be learning what is going on .
There he will have the power for making judgements and forecasts about the stuff learned .
For example , he/she will will be able to fix someting he has learned by means of repairing it , or will be improving that thing .
In two cases what happens is natural .
However , this method seems to be best fit for a fast evolution , has a negative side .
The other side of the madallion is that this process will be extremely time consuming , when we the number of things to be teached increases .

The other side of the madallion is learning by facts .
In this case the the learning curve is steep .
Since the student learns little about the ideas and concepts , he/she will not be able to comment about it in the future .
So this stuff will be prone to degregations .
In addition , the learned stuff will not have a change to improve until the learner is genius .

To sum up , the possible two techniques stated above are like two very different things .
But its maybe the most important thing to be realised that all human beings are different .
As we all have different abilities and unabilities .
The real thing is to decide which process is best for the student being teached .
A genius will learn faster , so load all the data with only facts to him k , he will just ask one thing to get the idea , and invent something .
Choose the right combination for the custom class that you teach .
That 's why the teachers are being trained for .
