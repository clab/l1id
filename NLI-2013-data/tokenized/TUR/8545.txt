Most of the time to understand ideas and concepts are considered as the most important factors thorughtout the education process .
On the other hand , it is ignored that not all the time ideas or concepts reflects the reality , so to learn the real facts is much more important for the students .

After the students graduates from the schools that they study , they will think that they are capable of dealing with everthing related with their departments as a result of feeling of trust caused by the knowledge which they gain during their education .
Nevertheless , life wil show its real part after they face the problems which they cannot find slolutions with the ideas or concepts they have learned so far .
At this moment , they start to discover what their deparments actually requires .

Another point is that as a nature of learning most of the people cannot put what they have learned into action until they start to deal with it .

As a result of this situation , students cannot distinguish reality and imagination from each other , so it is inevitable fot these students to be a failer in their career and social life .
