I agree with the only first part of the statement which says that `` Successful people try new things and take risks '' because this is the precondition for achievement in both business and personal life .
However , I disagree with the rest of the statement which emphasizes that the successful people do not simply do what they already know how to do well .
In my opinion , these people can become successful by the help of the things that are already familiar with them .
Now I would like to mention the basic ideas behind my contention .

First of all , trying new things and taking risks require a high level of self confidence and this is one of the most significant characteristics that many successful people possess .
Self-confidence enables them to apply new methods or take new decisions in their both professional and business lives .
Moreover , being open to new developments or ideas widens the people 's perceptions regarding the issues or concepts and so this brings the success .
Furthermore , to take risks may at the same time lead to increase in chance for invention .
In other words , it can be accepted as a way to be an inventor of something .

On the other hand , all of these can not be possible without using the old knowledge .
That is to say , a person can be more self-confident if he or she really trusts his or her own knowledge , experience and ability which had gained before .
Most of the time , by relying on their already acquired skills , they are able to become successful .
In addition to this , the experience gathered from previous tasks provides remarkable clues about the nature of the risks .
By already predicting the results of the risks , many successful peopl decide to take a certain risk .
In other words , while they take the risks and try new things , they also guarantee themselves .
This generally becomes apparent in the case of the businessmen working for many years and knowing the inside of the business issues .
