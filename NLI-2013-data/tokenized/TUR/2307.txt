Life is a very long journey with many different kinds of periods in it .
We are born , than become an infant , a teenager , an adult , an elder and finally come to the end .
Each period has good or bad parts and enjoyable to live .
The most important point in this journey is undoubted that you have just one chance to live each part and cannot change the order .

In my opinion , the most enjoyable period in this journey is youth .
Firstly , when you are young , you do not have to face any important diseases that the elder body brings .
Human body is in its healtiest period and also the most good-looking one .
Young bodies are attractive , thus , you can do any sports , eat anything you want and these do not damage your health .
It becomes a disaster when you cannot eat something you want like chocolate or sweets , or else salty refreshments .

Secondly , older people have problems due to their appearance .
They miss the bodies they own when they are young and each time they look in the mirror , they make another pace to depression .
Moreover , they lose their fertility according to their age and enter the menapose or andropose section ; these are reaaly hard times to face for people .

In addition to that , when you are young , your manners can be accepted by public even they are not ethical , but when you are older you carry the burden of responsibilities on your shoulders and you are not easily accepted as youngsters by public .

Consequently , even being young is thought to be more enjoyable than being old , it depends on person living it .
This is not an all black or all white situation and a person may have had an unhappy youth may have found happiness later when he is older .
Whatever the case is , life is beautiful everytime .
