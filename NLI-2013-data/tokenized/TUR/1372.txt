I think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
In fact ; you may come across few situations that some people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
But you ca n't see this kind of people generally .
Because they are very clever and hardworker than the normal people .
If we talk about in general except this kind of people , I agree with the statement about specializing in one specific subject .

The first reason of this choice is that the concentration on one subject is easier than more subjects .
you can focus on that subject , make good preparations and think much ways of that subject many times .

Second you may not have much time for being qualified in many subjects .
So you can spend your time only one subject and get more information and make yourself well educated about that subject .
Otherwise , you are supposed to dividing your time and power all the subjects that you interest in .

Third , if you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , you may pay a lot of money for that .
And you wo n't be well qualified in ne subject .
And all you know will be on the surface of those subjects .
You can never go deeper about the subjects .

Fourth , when people ask you your professionallity , are you going to say to them `` I have broad information many subjects but not one particular field . ''
?
It will be funny .
So if you want to be admitted from the universities or the academic environment , you have to meke yourself professional in one subject .
Otherwise they wo n't approve your abilities .

Finally , you have to choose one subject that you realy like and adapt yourself very well and try to be qualified in that subject .
You will see that you make the right chose .
