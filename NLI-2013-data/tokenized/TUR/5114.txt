Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
That is right .
Because it is their aim which is making much more atractive the product .
Advertisements are need to be very important to sell something .
Product 's selling race depends on it 's advertisement 's quality .

Advertisement producers and writers are under very big responsibilty .
Because if advetisement not very good , consumers are not aware about that product .
Good advertisement which means the most atractive one is everthing .
For example , a new model car advertisement has to demonstrate consumer what this car 's difference from others and why consumer will select that car .

Also , advertisements have to call attention of the consumer to their products .
It is not easy task .
Because there are lots of similar advertisemets on similar products .
That is why if the advertisement usual nobody notices it .
To call atention of everyone advetisement must reperesent the product with uncommon but enjoyable ways .

Thus , advertisements are made to sell products to many people .
For this task , advertisement producer must make products seem much better than they really are .
It is undertandable and reasonable way for the task like that .
