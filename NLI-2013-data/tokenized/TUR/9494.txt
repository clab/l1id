Although some people think that to learn facts is more importantfor students to understand ideas I agree with the statement it is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts because firstly if they understand the ideas then they produce new ideas and facts secondly they can learn the facts much easier and faster .

Firstly ; the students should understand the ideas and concepts .
Then they should do brain storming and work on these ideas and concepts .
After this step they can develop the ideas that they have learned and then they can produce facts on their own or they can produce new ideas , claims .
Maybe they can prove their claims and then so they produce theorems which will be helpful for new generations .
Then the new generation can develop the ideas that they learned and find new things .
This continues like this .
then there will be developments in the field where the new ideas generated .

Secondly ; I believe that if they read the facts from a book or learn the facts from somewhere else they will learn the fact much faster and easier because according to an experiment done by Baskent University it is proven that the students who have understood the ideas and concepts clearly can learn the facts faster and easier than the studets who do not understand the ideas and facts .

In conclusion ; it is very clear to see that understanding ideas and concepts is more important for students than learning facts by reading the two supports written on this passage .
