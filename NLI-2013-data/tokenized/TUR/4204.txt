Nowadays , old people blame young people of not helping their communities for enough time .
They accuse young people of being more personal than being a part of the community .
If you just look at time spent on community , they seem to be right .
On the contrary , If you examine the conditions , they are not .

Today , It is very hard for a young person , to have spare time .
Because working hours and conditions are worse than older times .
They have to work hard to have a job .
If you are not a devoted worker , it is possible to lose yoru job .
In addition , finding another job is much harder today .
A young person who may have the opportunity to help his community is probably a well-educated , economically secure .
Nowadays , people in same conditions as menioned above are numerous .
This gives the opportunity to the employer that if he/she fires someone because of not staying overtime , he/she will find a new employee in short time .
In the past , qualified workers were rare , because of war and epidemics .

Also , it does not make any difference , even if you spend much of your time in helping communities , your efforts are negligible compared to the need .
Communities are getting larger and more people need these time and money .
Older people look at the number of people who needs help and they claims that young people do not help them .
I tink this is not fair .

Government and local authorities should help communities , not individuals .
Today big money is required for fulfilling these needs .
Older people may make larger donations and professionals may do the job accurately and effectively .

So , it is not fair to say that young people do not use their spare time in helping their communities .
It is the conditions that prevents them from it .
Young people do not have enough time or money .
Older people should get involved in the subject and help their communities .
If they are unable , than government and local authorities should do the job .
Please , do not make young peoples life harder .
