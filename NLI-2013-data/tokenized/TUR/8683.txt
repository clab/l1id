I have been a student in an education system , which gives importance on learning facts rather than understanding ideas and concepts , for 16 years in my country .
Therefore , I have the ability as a student to discuss on the advantages and disadvantages of learning facts .
On the other hand , I will mention about the significancy of understanding the ideas and concepts basing on my knowladge rather than my experince .

In my education life , I have learned so many facts especially in my biology lessons .
Learning facts are necessary for a student in order to extend his or her knowladge , however , memorazing is not a good way of learning facts since you forget them in time partly or completely if you do not study again .
For example , I do not remember some of the facts that I have learned in my high school about biology .
In addition , learning facts without understanding them takes too much time since you try to learn a new thing that you have no idea .
In this case , as the time you study increases you get bored and usually stop studying .
Moreover , learning facts only also diminishes your creativity .
When you memorize the facts and then do well in the exam , you do not even think the rest of the fact such as ; what is the behind this fact or how this fact is related to other fact .

Understanding ideas and concepts rather than learning facts is a second way to study .
Firstly , understanding a topic completely is a time saving method since you can guess on the methods that have nearly same working principle .
Furthermore , understanding ideas makes you feel confident before the exam , yet you can use your mind and find the answer though you do not know the topic totally .
To illustrate , in my machine elements class , although i had not studied the helical springs , i could have find the answer by using my knowladge on the linear springs .

As i have mentioned before , i have learned too many facts up to now in my student life .
However , i have come to the conclusion that understanding ideas is better .
