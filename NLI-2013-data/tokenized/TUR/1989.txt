The issue at hand is young people enjoy life more than older people do or not .
I disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I believe that older people like life more than young people do because of many reasons .

First of all , old people enjoy life more than younger person do because they know they are much close to death .
They know very well the meaning of death and they will die in anytime .
Because of this reason , they try to spend their rest of life very effectively .
On the other hand , young people feel that they ever do n't die and because of this reason they do n't aware the value of life .

Additionally , old people like life more than younger because they have many reasons to enjoy life .
For example , they generally have children and a wife .
They need to care about them .
They enjoy life because of her family .
On the other hand , young people do not have a doughter or son .
They are single .
Because they do not have any concrete reason to glue life , they do not enjoy life more than older people .

Finally , I think old people enjoy life more than younger people because their expectations from life are not generally big .
They generally expect quiet place in peace with their family .
This is enough for them to enjoy the life .
On the other hand , as I am a young man , I have many expectations from life and if I do n't obtain any of them , I will easily hate from life and I will be depresed .
I expect a good job , much money , brand new car ...
It is very difficult to obtain all of them at the same time and due to these reason most of time I do n't enjoy from life .

Ultimately , I believe that old people enjoy life more than younger people do .
I believe this because , the life will end for them in a very short time later , they have many things to do and many people to care , and they do n't have a lot of expectations from the life .
