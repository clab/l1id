In todays world of information overload the specialist are much more neccesary than the generalist in order to further take steps in our technological development .
Fisrt off all although it neccesary to see the wide picture when faced with the problems the solution to the problem relies on specific knowledge of the problem .
For instance an academician with wide range of knowledge in engineering may easily realize the problem in assembeling a robot where knowledge from several fields engineering is needed much more quicker than a specifically trained engineer who can point out the problems associated with his special knowledge .
With his wide range of knowledge he can say that the electrical circuitrary is not working correctly .
But in order the fix the problem he has to need help from an electrical engineering .

Secondly a in todays world information is very extensive for one to collect and digest .
People have to specilaze on one subject .
The development of technology forces us to specialize in onet .
In the early days of humanity it is logical to expect an academician to know everything about the all science fields .
But nowadays things are getting much more complicated that one can handle .
We have diverse society to many fields and wait them to communicate each other .

Last but least you can see many people having diverse knowledge about all issues but not specified in one of those .
Those people are not valued by the humanity and no one can remember them in future .
For instance a primary school teacher have to have broad knowledge of all science fields .
He is just the first step of the development .
Although he is essential for the maintainance of the development he can not add new bricks to the scientific literature .
As you progress in your academic studies you can also realize that academiciens getting more and more specialized .
Those academicians are at the top of the development that struggle for the research .
Those will be remembered because of their support to the science .

All in all specialist are much more needed in our society where it is impossible for one to digest all information .
Specialist are the people who we are bound to in technological development .
I cannot deny the importance of the generalists but they just constitute the basic of the building .
If we want to build new floors we have to promote specialists .
