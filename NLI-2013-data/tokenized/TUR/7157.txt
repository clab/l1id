In my point of view there will be fewer cars than today .
the main reason for this is the technological development that makes the life easier day by day for todays people .
We can also take the oil reserves in to consideration for the decrease of the number of the cars .

The technological development is so great and unpredictible that one can do something which might be only a dream in the past like reaching the information he wants just by clicking some buttons .
Therefore the development may result in the development in the mass transportation and with the benefits of mass transportation ; like the cost and availablity ; people will be willing to use them instead of using their personal vehicles .
In twenty years there may be some kind of train which can go faster and cheaper than those of todays ' or the mankind will invent a machine which can transport the people to another place in seconds just like we watch in the scince fiction movies like ` battle star galactica ' or ' star wars ' .

There is another reason for why there will be fewer cars on the roads that it is the lack of oil reserves in the world .
when you think that the 99 percent of the vehicles use oil for the energy they need this might sound more predictible unless the man kind finds another source of energy like sun or a kind of an element which can be used instead of oil .
It does not make much sense to say this because the scientists spends more time to find any other means of transportation than finding usefull elements or sources of energy to do the work which the oil does today .
Hence the activities of the scientists have focused on new inventions and new ways of making the life easier and comfortable .

To sum it up ; in twenty years will there be fewer cars or any kind of vehicle in our world since the today 's activities of scientists show that the mankind is in search for an efficient way of transportation .
