Since the first car was used by people , people always want to have a fewer car so that the goals of the car factories are giving to people what they want .
Engineers studied to developed the models especially they specialized about the motor .
They innovated more powerful motor than the previous ones .

Today , the improvements about the motor are going on speedly .
Technology gives support to this studies .
The cars are more faster than the old cars but it is not only one criter about the cars .
The view is another criter , so cars are not only developed as their motor but also they are developed as their shapes .
Especially after increasing the number of women driving cars the scape and colour is more important because of their esthetic opinion .

Besides , security is a common subject when a car is evaluated .
When traffic was occured in big cities because of increasing of population , unfortunately big car accidents begun to happen commonly so another criteria is determined : A car must be safety .

So the suspancion systems was found and even they are developed today and also seat belts became a standard for the cars .
The reason why I mention the whole developments is making a comparety between todays cars and the old cars .
According to many people cars which are produced in twenty years are most esthetic than the others but if we compare their quality , Today 's cars are most powerful and security and accoding to me more beautiful .
This is the exact thing what people wants .
Everything is devloped in a huge speed , the cars can not be remained same .
They must be changed and they must be more efficent
