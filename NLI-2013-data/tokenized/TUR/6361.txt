Having less cars in twenty years time does not seem to be possible due to several reasons : comfort of the cars , availability of a technolgy and global reasons .
As the children of the twentied century we were born with cars , live and grow with them .
We have so much famaliar and used to them .
We can not find comfort of these cars in any of vehicles , bicycle or motorcycle or a ship or train non of those can provide the comfort and service we used to hava with our cars .

Secondly , the technology is not available to make an vehicle that can compute with car .
Space ships , planes or helicopters they may have seem to compute with cars but it should also be taken into account that they cost too much that ordinary people can afford .
Or even they can afford them some time where they will park their helicopter or where they will land with their plane .
It is a big question mark and does not seems to be realistic .

The last but the most important one is the global reasons .
The big car producing companies will not let a change in current status of the cars by making big cuts from prices .
Not only the car producers but also oil companies do not want fewer cars in use as their profits will decrease with less gasoline sales .
The same reason can be taken for oil - exporter countries and or for the countries who makes too much money from petroleum sector such as USA , Russia , and Middle East countries that determines and effects the political and economical decisions all over the world .

In conclusion , in twenty years , there will not be fewer cars in use than today as we get used to the comfort of our cars which we can buy by less money than other vehicles provided with the current technolgy .
And the global powers will not let a change in the situtation in unfavourably of them as a result of change in oil sector .
