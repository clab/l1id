`` If one knows all , he knows none . ''
All around the world there are people trying to do all the things they want to do , and causing other people of that expertise to be unemployed .
If a person is a professional in his or her expertise then this person should try to be useful for global researches about that expertise .
In other words , a person should not be trying other things than he is a professional on , but be the best in his own expertise .

In my country , Turkey , there are many people who are trying to be the best in everything .
For example , there are a lot of models who are trying to be singers or actors .
This causes the true singers to fade in the business in time .
Not only models , but many celebrities are doing the same too .
We have an author who also , tried to be the governer of Istanbul .
Not that he would not be a great governer , but he is an artist , he should do his art .
If a person is succesful in his or her business or area of expertise , he or she should try to help the worldwide researches about his or her topic .
The sharing of ideas would bring better solutions to the problems of the world .

I believe that China is in a great position to support my thesis .
In China , people are doing the things they have to do and they all think that their job is a `` great job '' for them .
This may be a hasty generalization , but China 's improvement throughout 21st century proves this statement .
If everyone does his or her own job , then every job gets to be the `` great job '' .

While concluding my words I would like to state my future plans about this statement .
I will try to be a professional in my area of expertise and try to share my knowledge with the world by all means .
This should be the plan for all to achieve great developments .
