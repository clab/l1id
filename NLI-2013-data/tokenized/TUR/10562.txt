While reading the succesful people 's lifes you should probably see that they are the ones who try new things , take risks and try to create and use something different than they usually do .
Successful people , try to create something different , use oppurtunities to do something new in their fields and take risks .

First of all being successful needs the ability of trying new things other than the usual .
Trying new things and creating some ideas make the person to move upwards in his or her career .
For example creators of the '' Youtube '' did something that has not done before .
They find an idea , improve it and create the one of the most successful internet sites which cause revolution in this field .
So being open to new things and able to show the ability to implement this idea makes a person successful .

An other ability needed for being successful is , using the oppurtunities and not to be afraid of doing something unusual .
People often stick with things that are good at , but trying new tehniques and using the oppurtunities to do something new and different , brings the success .

The last thing I like to mention about what brings success is , taking risks .
Other than doing the standart things and taking risks can be very beneficial to someone .
For example , showing the courage to invest in a field that no one has ever invested before may turn out very well .
The risk taker may earn a fortune simply just using the opportunity by taking risk .

In summary , people who are open to try new things , creating something different than the others by using opportunities and take risks are allways become successful at the end .
No matter how hard they try , people who have these qualities will garantee the success .
