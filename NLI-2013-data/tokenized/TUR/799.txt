Because the bank manager can only have knowledge about economic conditions , he did not talk about anymore about topics that were not related to financial situation .

Secondly , obtaining as much as possible informations about every subject can lead to broader perspective .
However it is also important to mention that hearing an unimportant sides of the subjects will not be adequate for claiming some critisism .
