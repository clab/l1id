Comparison of understanding and learning is probably one of the most important discussions I have seen about the Turkish educational system in the last ten years .
This paper will mainly discuss the positive and negative sides of understanding the ideas and concepts and learning the facts .

Understanding the ideas and concepts for students is very important for not only for their education life but also the real life .
As an illustration , a phylosophy teacher may explain Plato as only a man who said that there has to be three groups to form the ideal society : workers , soldiers and the leaders .
It would not mean anything to the student .
Because of this statement , the student may think that my father is working as a doctor , my uncle is a soldier and I am seeing the president of my country once a week so my country is just like Plato explained centries ago .
Contrarily , the same philosophy teacher may explain that the three groups forming the society are the mirror images of the three qualities which form the good person .
These qualities are desire symbolized by workers , emotions symbolized by soldiers and virtue symbolized by the leaders .
Understanding the concepts behind Plato 's ideas are more important than the Plato 's ideas themselves .

On the other hand , learning the facts are also very important for scince and engineering students .
With the help of the facts , people can understand the universe .
By knowing the law of gravity , we can understand why an object can fall from the sky or by knowing Kepler 's law , we can understand how Earth revolves around the sun .
A student does not have to know the the number zero is discover , solving the question is more important for him/her .

To sum up , I want to say that understanding ideas and concepts and learning the facts are very both very important for the students .
On the other hand , I believe that understanding the ideas and facts make you a better person in addition to being a good student while learning the facts can make you only a good student .
So , I agree with the statement that understanding is more important than learning .
