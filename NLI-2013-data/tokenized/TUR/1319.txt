The issue at hand is that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject .
The issue is important , because specialists are nerrow viewed people , who can hardly transfer knowladge from one subject to an other , and because of that who are limited within their academic subject .
Therefore , I beleave that it is better to be a generalist than a specialist .

At first , the generalist have a brider view of their academic subject , which allows them to transfer knowledge from other fields .
Since they have knowledge about different subject in one field , they can transfert knowledge from one field to the next in order to solve existimg problems faster .
Hance , specialist on the other hand can not do that , which supports my opinion that being a generalist is better then being a specialist .

An other point ist that , generalist are able to compare and contrust different subject in a field .
Therefore , have many more inspiration field than a specialist , which allow rhen to improve the .
This is an other reason why I think that specialist are better in a sence they are more successful .

As last , generalist are not restricted with the boundries of their field of study like the generalist .
They have the opportunity to improve their knowledge in different dicertions and aven afters jears of study , they still can improve their knowledge in their field of studu .
Generalist on the other hand , are strictyly capselt in their world , which holds them back of improvement .
Because specialist are restricted and close to improvement after some time of study , I thing that being a generalist is better .

As a conclution , I believe that being a generelist meand having a bride view , being able to transfere knowledge between different subject - in order to solve probles in faster way - and having the opprtunity to improve yourself , which makes it better than being a specialist .
