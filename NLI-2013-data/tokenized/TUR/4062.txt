Nowadays it is said that young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Is it true or not ?
To come up with that question we should make a comparison with the past and today .

At the past before the technological improvements there were lots of things which a humanbeing was not able to do alone .
For example think about not having any washingmachine .
When we think about the times that the female humanbeing must be doing all the houseworks .
At these times families are much more crowded and as a result people have to wash much more clothes .
Washing all the clothes by herself is not possible for a women , all the other young people has to help their mother to have clean clothes .
But now almost all of us have washingmachines in our house .
When somebody in the family have dirty clothes he \ she do n't have to call anybody .
He \ she puts clothes in the machine and in an hour they are clean and ready .

Year by year the population of the world is increasing .
There not too much places to work and earn money .
At the sum people prefer having small families such as parents and one child to have good life conditions according to their money .
At the old times people were usually making farm work .
When you are a farmer the more people you have in your family to help you , the more product you will have .

Because of that people used to prefer having crowded families .
And when a child has brothers and sisters it has to be social and help the others to have something to eat , to earn money or to have clothes to wear .

Finally by the improvement of technology , life is much more easier but technology makes youngsters selfish .
Young people choose playing computer games or surfing on the internet inspite of helping their mother in the kitchen and giving enough time to helping their commutinies .
