The best way o travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I agree this topic beacuse usullay when you go another country or city , you heard something or you prepared to travel .
If you have a tour guide you dont need to look something about this place .

Tour guides usually know this place because they are doing this job .
And they can know everything about this city : about history , shopping centers , natural parks , ...
ect .
So I want to talk about my expresions .

I went to Italy with tour guide .
It was fantastic .
I went Rome and it was a so beatiful place .
It was historical place and they can make best ice cream in the world .
When we went there we dont know what we gone a do and when we arrived Rome Internatoinal Airport our our guide was waited us .
He came to near us and he discribe his self .
and he told us lets go to our hotel and be ready to Rome .
so we slept and next morning we woke up 6 am. and we took a perfect breakfast .
First we went to Lovers Hole .
he discribe about history and why all peoples throw quarters to here .
and we traveled everywhere .
also we have lot of free times .
In those times you can travel your self .
you can see everywhere whit this tour guide .

But sometimes this can be whore thing in the world .
Some tour guides doesnt know anything about city or that place and they couldnt tell anything about city .
It can be so boring .

But usually tour guides selected persons .
and they know three or four langue .
And usually they were born in yhis city or they were lived in this city .
They can take special historical class for those tours .
I belive the best way to travel is in a group whit tour guide .
Because if you dont want to join group , you can stay and you can travel by your self or usually they give you free time to travel in this place .
This is the best way to travel .
