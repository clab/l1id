All of things which is realeted with the studends can changes person an person .
Their abilities , capabilities ; understanding skills time ...
For example , Let 's talk about the ideas which is important to understand it or it is for them to learn facts which one is suitable for the studends .
Is the first one or second ?
One of them suitable for the studens an we chose it ...

Firstifull , I think understanding ideas not only studends but also all of the people is really important .
If he/she dont understand for example one of the idea or passage how can the studends commend it .
How can describes focuces of the what he/she heard .
i mean it is really important point expecially on students .
In addition understanding ideas can occur after such as a good listening or consantrated on the topic .
The students will be more succesful after that .

Overall all of the things which I mentioned important for the student who wants to be succesfull .
however , learning facts can be really difficult to desciribe which he/or she focused on it .
The student can mix what thinking .
