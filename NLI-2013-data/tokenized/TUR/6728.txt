Recently , there has been an argument as to whether a person should buy a car if he or she can or should keep using the public tranportation among my classmates .
As a person using the public transportation for most of the time , I decided that , we should not consider this problem further because there will be less number of cars in use in twenty years than in today .
I provided some strong supports and evidences for this thought .

First of all , in twenty year , I think that most of the people will be much more aware of the value of public transportation !
If the number of cars increase with time , there will be a great need for more highways !
Since we are limited with the earth 's surface , we cannot simply dedicate all the spaces we have to roads !
Even now we withness traffic congestion everyday .
There is an ultimate solution for that : public transportation such as metro , busses and so on .
They have some outstanding advantages like low costs for both the country and personal users , and less polution of the environment .
Because the number of people who think of the public transportation as a solution will increase with time , the number of cars in use will even decrease !

In addition to that , most of the cars are used for transportation today .
In the future , with the increasing technology , we will not need to `` go '' to work .
Instead , we will be able to do whatever we do at home with computers !
For example , instead of driving to the university to attend a lesson , I will use the internet to attend the lecture online .
Now imagine the number of students driving to school .
Considering them staying at home to study makes me believe that there will not be a greater number of cars in the future .

Moreover , the available gasoline decreases everyday .
In twenty years , the gasoline resources of world will be much less than today .
Although there are alternative ways to make the engine of a car start without gasoline , there might be some serious problems abouit petrol reserves in the future .
To prevent the events which will probably couse a third world war , I strongly believe that the world will make regulations to own a car .
Therefore number of cars in use will decrease .

In conclusiuon , the number of cars in use will be fewer in twenty years that in today for so many reasons .
Among those reasons are people 's awareness of advantages of public transportation , advances in technology , and restrictive regulations to own a car because of limited amount of gasoline .
