For decades researchers are to find an answer for this argument .
Who enjoys the life more young people or old .
Enjoying life does not really depend on age it mostly depends on how much somebody likes to live , wealth , and life conditions .

The first step of enjoying the life is loving it .
At the age of twelve or fourty it does not matter if somebody loves to live he can enjoy his life more than anybody in this universe .
Also the way of enjoying life depends on what you like to do .
Because of the age advantage people think that young people enjoy the life more than the elders .
The main reason for that is appropriate and inappropriate behaviors .
Of course there are certaing things that differs the young from the old but still this does not mean young people enjoy life more than old people do .

A wealthy person can do what ever he wants .
He can travel all around the world , eat all kinds of food , and experience many different cultures .
This is what majortiy of the people think about enjoying life .
If this is the only way to enjoy the life how should a person who lives in an economy budget , can only afford living expenses , and barely shops for himself feel .
Again this is just a fact to enjoy life is not the only way to enjoy it .

Enjoying life does not depend on certain things , especially age , wealth , or life conditions .
To be able to enjoy the circumstances and the conditions for everybody might not be easy but otherwise all of us would be unhappy and the life would be miserable .
