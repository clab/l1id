Young people mostly experience things first .
While doing new things that youngs did n't do before can enjoy them .
Older peoples experienced most of the joy of the life , and to do that things again entartain less than youngs .

Young people have more energy to do enjoyable things .
Youngs are always in the way of doing new , more enjoyable things .
So while capability of doing things gave youngs joy .
Olders have less energy so they only use their energy to do the things that inevitable for thie life .
They rest in most of their time , eat meals , sleep and do other requirements of life .
They mostly cannot do what they want or what they do when they were young .
The disability of doing the things that desired make olders unhappy .

On the other hand olders think the death more than youngs .
To think die in short time do the olders being pessimist about life .
They think what they did in their lives most of time .
The wrongs and right things .
But the wrongs effect most .
If he thinks of his life with full of errors he ca n't enjoy from the remaining life .

But olders can enjoy when they bring their childrens , and see grandsons and granddaughters running around them respect them .
Most of the olders desire this scene .
If they can live this scene they can enjoy more than youngs .
