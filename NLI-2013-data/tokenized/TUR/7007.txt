There are many movies about the future life which does not contain a type of transportation with cars .
It is dispuatable how much they are reflecting correctly .
But there are several reasonable matters which mean modern cars wo n't live forever .
I meant that cars which run by petrolian by expression of ` modern car ' .

The biggest signature modern cars have to evolution is lacking amount of petrols all around world in near future .
Because , oil reserves are decreasing speedly .
The main factor in innovation of modern machines wo n't be enough for future by today 's consuming amounts .
But there are another options to put in place of petrolian energy sources like water or any other material which can be ransformed into electrical energy .
So cars ' fuel type will be last , even it is changing now .
So , in my opinion it wo n't be the main reason for there will be fewer cars in the world .

As a second reason for there will be fewer cars in the world is huge improvements in sciences knowledge and technologies .
Technology will make car unnecessary or non prefered transportatioan vehicles or devices .
According to this approach , there will be alternative transporation types for cars , like molecular transportation centers or flying objects ( flying cars ) .
Improvement in science and technology obviously show us there is no possibility to succeed the molecular transportation with today 's knowledge .
As a reason we do n't have a technology which transforms materials to photons and trasforming photons to materials .
In addition to this , there are many research in modern physics which have to be accomplished for knowledge about transforming photons .
In addition to this , we have never seen a flying car except jetsons ' .

As a result , i do n't agree with decreasing in number of cars in near future .
Because our historical experiments showed that human being is the most adaptable creature in the worls .
So if we wo n't have enough petrolian ' we will find another source .
