Advertisement is an assencial way to introduce products to the customers and to increase the usuage of the product so all producers advertice their products .
They try to show their product as it is the best one among the others in the same class .
So I believe that the advertisements make product seem much better than they really are because an advertisement do mention to good parts of the products only rather than being objective and advertisements do not show the exact results reached by the product .

First of all an advertisement mentions the good parts of the product only rather than being objective .
Producer wants to show his product as it was excelent , do not have any weaknes or do not have any harm .
For excample there exist cosmetics advertisements on TV 's every day .
Advertisement indicate how a woman beautified by the hair dye , how attractive she becomes .
But advertisement never mentions the harm of the hair dye which cause cancer in long term usuage .
So women use this product without being aware of its harm , They form a better image for the hair dye in their mind than it is in real .

Secondly advertisements do not show the exact results that the product advertised results .
They show the results which the pruduct must reach but not the results reached in real .
For example lets investigate an advertisement of a chemical , used for cleaning the dishes .
In advertisement , the dishes washed by that chemical seem realy clean and they shine and it is also announced that chemical is cheaper than the others .
When you by the pruduct and start to use , you faced with the result that your dishes are not such clean .
This means you are missleaded .
Again the image of the product in customers mind is better than it is in real .

As we see from the examples and experiment in our daily life most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
