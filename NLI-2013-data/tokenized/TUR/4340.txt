21 century generation has more oppurtinities in every aspect .
They are more free than before they are , they have more right : politically , the indivicual aspect more developed in this generation in that situation can we say young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities ?
I disagree with this statement because I think youngs are under influence of the globalisation .

I think we cant say young people dont give enough time to helping their communities since young peole are working for global problems like individual rights of all people in the world , human rights , enviromental problems or food supply like in African countries so the the concept of their country disappeared and young people are thinking in a global viwe point .

Another reason of my disagrement is that young is firstly educated in their countries .
Later they are working in their countries about their collegues .
this the beginning of their professinol life start in their home country and then later , most of them start to work for the international componies which are result of global economy .
I mean you are firstly spend your all time in your country and then try to develope and improve the life standard of the all people of the world in ecomicaly or socially .
people prefer to work for the worldwhere is their home country .

In conclusion , there is not concept of `` their country '' any more because people are aware of that they are citizen of the world and everything they should do must be for all people in the world rather than for just their home country .
