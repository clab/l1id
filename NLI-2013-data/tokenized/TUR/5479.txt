Advertisement is the art of convincing people and making them to beleive in the story told .
Generally these stories are about products `` great '' specifications , so I agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

Mostly in advertisements small tricks are utilized to attract the consumers attention to the desired field .
For example , the information about a campaign ( which can be considered as a product in an advirtisers aspect ) is written in very small puntos compared to the puntos of the slogan and many people do not even see them untill they buy the product .

Additionally , advertisers mostly exeggarate the products good points .
Esspecially , in electronic devices one can observe this fact .
After buying an electronic device it usually does not satisfies the consumers high expectations since it is not as good as it is written ( or announced ) .
Generally type of slogans saying '' Never such a resolution before '' or '' Great sound quality , better than any other product in the market '' make people to expect incredible efficiencies that would never be true .

On the other hand , precautions taken to prevent this kind of tricks which lead people wrong proves the existence of such a manipulation .
It can easily be observed that after this precautions , such as laws , taken advertisements became to the point and they started to give up such tricks , as mentioned above , like invisible informations and superior specifications .

To sum up , advertisers are doing their job which is convincing people ( or manipulating people ) altough the precautions taken and they will find other ways to deceive people .
As it is stated above it is their creativity and the markets request from them .
More precautions should be taken .
