A person is a student for all of his \ her life because learning process continues in all life .
A learned issue can be forgotten in a long time period .
The fact that if the person know the main idea of the topic he \ she would not forget it easily .
So I agree with the statement that express understanding ideas and concepts are more important for students than it is for them to learn facts .
I agree with the following statement because of several reasons .

Firstly , when a student learns the idea or concept it is more stable because the main points are learned by understanding the idea .
For example , in a math class a boy can forget about a formula .
By using the prove method he could reach again the formula .
So it shows that he get the idea-which means the prove method - and using the idea he reached the fact-the formula .

Secondly , without understanding the ideas and concepts its hard for a student to learn facts .
It is a weak way of learning .
Actually it is named as memorizing .
Memorized information can not last long .
But the information which a student learn is neccessary for his \ her education life .
For example , a memory of historic information can be forgetten in a several dayes .
But if a student get the idea with a small practice he \ she would not forget it easily .

On the other hand understanding ideas or concept is not enough sometimes .
As an example you can know how to prove a formula but if you dont know the formula then your idea learning means nothing .

As an conclusion understanding ideas or concepts is more important for student than learning facts .
The learned information can be forgetten but the understood information will last longer / .
