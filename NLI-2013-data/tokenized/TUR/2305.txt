There are always debates on the relationship between the age of the human being and enjoying life .
I believe in that young people enjoy life more than older people .
I assert this concept in this essay by giving the reasons in the following way .

In the first place , young people have more phycial capacity than older people .
As a matter of fact , the more you live , the more you are tired in the physical manner .
To enjoy even more , there is need to be healthy , ie .
powerful muscles , organs which are work properly , etc .
How can you enjoy if you are sick or tired ?
When the life progresses , your probability to get illness increases by the ages .
In this way , some familiar activities , such as sportive activities , going to the cinema , etc. which need physical effort to do cannot be possible to enjoy .

In the second place , the need for enjoying more is higher mental capacity .
The tiredness and efficiency losts are not only in the one person 's health , in the mental capacity also .
To solve a puzzle , what do you need really .
Yes , mental capacity is important .

To sum up , in one way or another , we need more physical and mental capacity to enjoy life more .
Because of the aforementioned reasons , we need healthier bodies and clear mental structures to taste more from life .
And it can be done in the young ages more .
So enjoy the life more !
As you can do in the early stages of your life .
