The number of cars appering on traffic is groving rapidly everyday .
Some people argue that in a near future there will be way too much cars than the roads and cities can support .
However this is not the only idea on the issue .
Some people has firm beliefs that in two decades , the number of cars will reduce .
I agree with this statement .

First , the way of living for the most people is changing substatially .
It is now possible for much more people to work at home with the improvements in technology and the Internet .
The need for going to offices everyday between certain hours is fading away .

Also , the energy supplies that are needed to run conventional automobiles are getting lesser everyday , Unless a new energy source will be found , which will also have to be very cheap , driving a car will become much more expensive than today .
The rises in the petrol prices is daily news nowadays .

Another point to mention is the negative effects of cars to the environment .
The public is getting more concerned everyday to the environment issue , and their sensitivity reflect to their lifestyles .
Most people start preferring alternative transportations such as subways , trains , or even bycycles .

Furthermore , it will not be fortune telling to predict that the governments will take actions in order to discourage people from using cars .
The negative effects of growing number of cars on traffic has serious impacts on economy .
Even today , the structures of the cities are not capable of supporting so many cars and some measures to reduce the number of cars , are in public opinion .

In conclusion , there are much more supporting reasons to predict that the demand for cars will reduce .
The ground for such an arguement can be based on economic , social and technological needs and requirements .
There is no reason for not to believe that the number of the cars will be fewer than they are today .
