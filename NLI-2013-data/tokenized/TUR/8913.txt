The human always need to be educated to reach good life standards therefore learning is a very important aspect of humanslife .
Everyone has different point of views about the idea of education .
Some assume that it is more important for students to understnad the ideas and concepts , in contrary to those some think learning facts are more important .
I personally agree with the second idea .
These are my following reasons ;

Firstly , learning by facts is permanent .
Experiments are good examples for facts .
For example , the one makes an experiment on the frogs in the lab in order to see the system inside of its body , he wo n't forget what he has seen for the years later .
Because it is realistic and live .

In addition to this , learning facts makes people feel confident .
For instance , the one is studying medicine if he studies just on the ideas of the professors and the concepts in Latin it will not work , he needs extra experience in order to be a good doctor .
As he has experienced the facts , he will gain self confidence because he will have the control on the patience .

The last but not least , learning facts are easier than ideas and concepts .
For example , the teacher will tell the students about a historical event , visiting a museum will be more attractive than reading from a book .
Because when they visit the museum they will see the photos taken and the paintings drawn in that years .
Photos and paintings are the most helpful equipments for the facts .
The students will not only enjoy the time in museum but also will learn easily .

All in all , as I said before learning facts is both permanent and makes people feel confident as well as it is easy .
The long and the short of it is that , action speaks louder than words .
