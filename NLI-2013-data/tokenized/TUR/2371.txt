READY FOR EVERYTHING

I do agree the statement that '' young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
Young people have more energy , they do not have much things to care only the time to play and also they are new to everything , while the older people do not have time and they care a lot for things and they already have known everything .

First of all , young people have a lot of energy to spend .
They can do whatever they want because there are very little things that can stop them .
Only mothers or the sun set will stop their having fun .
Even they get sick , they want to sleep in the street , not in the bed which is in the inside the house .

Secondly , in the begining of the life young people do not have much things to care .
They can do amazing jokes or harmfull actions to each other , but nobody will take those activities seriously because everyone know that those things is done to have fun not to harm or make sad the other people .

Besides having energy for everything or having not much things to care , young people are new for everything .
When they open their eyes to the world , they saw the world as a new place that have never discovered .
So they want to discover the world and while discovering the world they learn new things which makes them not only happy and but also make them to go on discovering the world .
Learning new things make life more better fot them and they enjoy in this better life .

In conclusion , the world is waiting to be discovered by those young people because the place is new for them , they have energy and they care only to be happy .
Being young , means starting a new adventure and every beginings of an advanture is more enjoyable than the endings .
