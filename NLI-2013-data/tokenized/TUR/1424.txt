There are several opinions about knowledge of academic subjects .
Some believe in that people should learn many of the academic topics and some thinks that it is useless to know many of them .
According to my opinion , people should have broad knowledge about many academic topics for solving problems , having more information and having options in front of us .

The first reason is people can not know what would they meet in the future .
Knowledge helps for solutions to the problems .
For example after graduation of a department , which teaches many academic topics , person could be recruited and in business life that person may meet with lots of problems .
As said lectures are preparation for business than they would be the answers to the problems in business life .
So these many lectures , that person got in the past , would be different solutions to the problems because every knowledge would have different points of view .

Secondly specialization on just one specific subject gives us less knowledge .
This means that we would have a great knowledge about one topic and it may be seem as not bad .
In my opinion this is not true because usually there are lots of information about any subject and I can not believe that a person may learn everything on that subject .
Although that person may learn most of the information , he/she can not learn all of them .
In contrast having knowledge about many topics is more believable because a person can many small things from lots of subject .
These examples are from daily life but they are all same with the academic subjects .

Lastly broad knowledge means options in the life .
After specialization , we would have only one chance which limits people and if we want to be free and independent of anything we should not be specialized .
For instance if we learn lots from academic subjects , we can easily decide what we will do in the future after seeing all the options lying in front of us .

If we take these things above into consideration , I can say that being specific on one topic is not as good enough as having wide information about academic topics .
To learn more , we should just study on more topics .
