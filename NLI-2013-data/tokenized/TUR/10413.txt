Some people think that we need to get new experiences and even to take risks to be successful while others support that we should only do our best at our expertation without new experiencesand without risks .
In my opinion , we have to obtain new experiences and take risks via contributing to technological developments by obtaining new perspectives and through increasing our performance by improving our cognitive ability or thinking .

Firstly , to endeavor new things can lead to new perspectives .
These perspectives can contribute to new innovations by providing improvements in the previous innovations .
For example , if an engineer tries a new machine when doing his habitual job , he can contribute to the technological development and so to the humanbeing .
It is inevitable to escape from taking risks to achieve such an aim .
In other words , the engineer has to work under the stresses such as the lost of time and money .
However , the possibility of the achievement or the possibility of the benefits of this new experince is worthful taking these risks .

Secondly , the performance of people can be higher and higher in time contributing cognitive capacity by unusual taks and under stress .
Thinking is an inevitable process for humanbeing and it can work better under new circumstances and especially under stress .
Coping with the difficulties created by new experinces can cause even higher stress and this stress can be resulted in even higher performence .
Otherwise , someone can think that there is no need for higher performance to complete his responsinilities/job .

Under the perspective mentioned above , I think we have to try the things which we have never tried before and take risks continuously to be more anad more successful .
