I think being youmg means to be able to do things more easily and freely .
When you are young , you are less responsible and you have more energy and the feeling of excitement for life .
Hence , I do agree with the statement saying that ` Young people enjoy life more than older people do . '

To illustrate my opinion we can compare some family members .
The parents are responsible for both their lives and their children 's lives .
So , they can not move free from their children .
For example they can not go to holidays without considering their children .
They should find a solution about their youngs .
Also , they should take permission from their work .
On the other hand , children can easily go to holidays by just taking their parents ' permission , although sometimes they even do not do this .
They are more free to do the things they want to .

If we think about the couples just married , the situation is not too different again .
Once you begin to work .
you become a member of real life dealing with real problems to survive and you forget about the beautiful parts of living .
You are so surrounded with the problems that you become having a monotone life full of problems .
However , when you are young , you do not have to earn money to survive .
Your family supports you financially .
Youngs also have responsibilities like finishing school , but they have more free time compared to older people .
You just care about school-based problems and friendship-based problems .
Life is mostly full of enjoyment for you .
You are not still aware of the real life problems even you hear about them .
Most of the time you just think of your own pleasure .

Another thing is that , the older you become , the less energetic you are .
To enjoy life , you should have the desire of living .
When you are younger you are more inexperienced and you aer not aware most of the bad parts of living .
Thus , you want to do every enjoyable thing .
However , as you become older you are bored of living since you have experienced lots of bad things and so you think that life is not very enjoyable .

In sum , I really believe that young people enjoy life more than the older people because young people are more energetic and less responsible and they see just the enjoyable part of the world .
