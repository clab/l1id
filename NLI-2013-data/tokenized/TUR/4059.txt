What is going on these days ?
What about the world , countries , cities and houses that we have been living in ?
I remember when I saw one of my friend , she was saying I do n't care about that kind of stuff , and also she was adding that even people who cares , they do n't have any time to discuss or help their communities to be more clean and then to live happier .
I strongly believe that it is not an excuse that saying no time for helping our communities .

Firstly , the young people are the people who has a lot of work to do on these days .
Students has classes that they ca n't postpone , they have alot of homeworks to do after school .
But they want to live in a better world .
Then is n't it so weird to want without any help ?
I think that means we all are selfish .

Secondly , some of young people think that anyway the world is going to be worse than today , so who cares in what ways it is going to be slower .
I do .
I care about my family , my husband and my children , that I am going to have .
I do n't want that my children has a dark future instead of clean , happy , full of people who are smiling .

Finally , it can be said that although young generation has an idea about the world which they are not going to change , I think with eveybody 's help , even young people who are so busy on these days , the world can be a place that is more clean and happier .
