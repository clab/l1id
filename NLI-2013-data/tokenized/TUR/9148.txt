I agree with the statement on understanding ideas and concepts for a student is more important than learning facts .
A distinction should be made between students in the phase of learning for developing skills for improving understanding of the life and those in the process of learning for a specific work .
The latter may necessitate knowing exact details for the proper practice of a work .
Nevertheless , improving understanding of ideas and concepts is more important to have a capacity to understand life .

First of all , a good reasoning develops with understanding ideas and concepts .
A student memorizing all the facts knows nothing indeed if he or she could not find the linkage between the facts .
For example , a student may memorize dates of historical events .
However , identifying causes and effects will be provided thorough analyzing ideas and concepts .

Secondly , as it is the era of information , a bulk of facts are encountered every day and they are prone to change with a rapid pace .
It is important to extract a useful bundle of information from there .
In that sense , ideas and concepts provide a frame for evaluating everchanging facts .

To conclude , considering the students undertake learning for developing skills for better understanding , ideas and concepts should be given utmost priority in the learning process .
