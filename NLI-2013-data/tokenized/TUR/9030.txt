Numbers versus Ideas

When students are considered to be mechanical masses that absorb and memorize words and numbers without processing them using their own intellect , one can easily believe that learning facts is the only virtue that students should need .
However , this is too far from being the logical and humane approach to the matter .

It is the ideas behind the facts that make the students evolve and turn into bright minded individuals that will undoubtedly lead their societies towards a better future .
To compherend , for example , the mechanism that makes an aeroplane take off is far more important for a student than to memorize the maximum speed of that particular type of aeroplane .
It is comprehension that triggers imagination .

Understanding ideas provides the learners with the opportunity to have an unchained mind which is absolutely the prime element of both individual and collective improvement .
Think of an individiual who has only been practicing in his studies the commonly adopted techniques based on the facts that are already available , without bravely experimenting new ideas .
How far could he go ?
Not too far , that is for sure .

If it had n't been for those who have bright ideas labed as ` crazy` , our world would n't have been as colorful as it is now .

As a conclusion , one should always keep in mind that we owe what we have today to those bright ideas of yesterday .
