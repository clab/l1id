I would like to begin my essay with Prof. Abert Einstein ' s telling .
He had said that understanding of a problem is the half of the solving .
We can not analyze concepts and ideas without not knowing what we have on our hand .
Therefore , I think to understand ideas and concepts is more important than to learn facts .

A greater number of people , on the world , are now judging each other without understanding each other 's ideas and ideologies .
And they learn facts without an infrastructural information .
This rival makes them merciless .
Because they do n't know how they should react .

For instance , we assume a man who helps poor people without judging them getting them dressed , clear and satiated and assume his neighbour has n't any idea what the man makes .
Our man accept his home all kinds of people olders , kids , women and men .
If firstly , his neighbour doesn ' t understand his ideas and then call police to learn the fact , an inappropriate event occurs .
But firstly , if he understands his idea .
No problems occur .

As our knowledge grows regarding various diseases , we become better equipped with sense .
