An advertisement is the most important subject for selling products .
If the advertisement of your product is very good and interesting than no matter how it seems because the people will keep on buying your product .
I think that the advertisement has to be perfect so that you can sell your product with a good price .

Nowadays , people like to buy things which everyone has .
No matter how they advertise it .
If the product is not the same as they advertise than there is only one possibility is that , you will not buy it never again .

Producers make good products .
The problem is costumers .
If they ca n't advertise it very interesting and amazing however the people will not buy your product .
They will buy the ones which sounds interesting and after if they do n't like it , you will have the change to sell your product .

As an example , you are producing bags .
The quality of the bag is very cheap and bad .
Paris Hilton wore it for advertisement one day .
There is another company which has the same price and with a good quality .
Would you buy the one which Paris Hilton wears or the one you have n't seen anybody wearing it ?
The answer will be the one which Paris Hilton wore and bad quality .
Why ?
Because the advertisement is better than the other one and people never heard about your company .

Last but not least , everybody likes to buy good products but especially the one which is good advertised and look expensive and usefull .
If they are not happy with your product , than you ca n't sell anything to them anymore .
