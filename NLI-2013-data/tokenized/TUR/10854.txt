experiance for risks

economy to management agreculture to education there has been lots of changes in the last century wiht in these changes sometimes we had to make a choice to be successful in our working life .
although some of us though that try new things and take risk to be successful is good idea some of us think it is not quite well have enough knowledge experiance advirtisement worring lost money are reasons to continuo what we already do

firstly to be succesfull in some job it requires lots of information and experiment for example my father has restaurant and he know lots of thing like cooking , servicing .
if he dont know how to cook he can not make any food so he can not sell anything .
if he waqnt to try have market he should learn lots of things to do

in addition to be good management or businesman we sould also know how to advertise product .
and if we dont know enough information about product we can not sell more so to be learn how to advertise the product require to know whole information about it and trying to new job requires to learn all new things

moreover if we dont sure to earn more money on new job you can lost all your investment .
for example my friend had shop before and changed job and started to make cook and he could not achieve this so he lost his all investment
