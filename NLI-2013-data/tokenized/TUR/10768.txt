I think I am a kind of person who likes doing what I already know how to do well and I think I am a successfull person .
But I well know some of my friends who become so successful by trying new things .
But I think these people are not too much .

There are good reasons to try new things and it must be excited to take risk in some situations .
But I think people should concantrate in just one aspect and should do just one work in a best way .
People can be successful only doing the work that already know how to do well .
Because you must spend some time and effort to learn new things .
For instance I decided to learn playing viola at the beganing of the university instead of playing piano .
I used to play piano when I was in primary school .
I have never played viola before .
Therefore I was unsuccessful .
If I had chosen to improve my ability in piano I am sure I would become more successful .

I think this statement is more about the trade .
Because my father have a company and he prefer to do diffrent works regarding his own work .
He always chooses to take risk .
But sometimes he becomes successful and sometimes he does n't .
I want him to go on doing he already do .
Because he is well aware of this work and also he has good experiences in this work .
But there is no insurance in the new work .
He does n't well know whether he will be successful .

Because of the reasons that I stated above , I do n't agree with this statement .
According to my experiences I can say that , only the people who try to do things that they well know are successful people .
