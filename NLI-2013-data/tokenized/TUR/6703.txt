In the next twenty years , the number of cars used will decrease in the more developed parts of the world , where it will increase in the less developed countries , I believe .
The reason why I a behold such a viewpoint is due to taking into consideration firstly , the nation state 's control of their country 's public transportation policy and secondly , the fact that the thirld world or developing countries are getting more and more domains of exploitation for the huge transnational corporations ( TNCs ) in our contemporary world .
In other words , on the one hand while the more developed countries are putting forward legislations that favour more their public and their security , the less developed countries , tend to be more vulnerable to the harsh effects of the liberal capitalist economy .
In other words , they tend to get more attracted to the advertisements that are shown on television , where due to these countries ' peoples lack of education , as well as the weak government policies ( as a result of weak nation state ) they get tempted to drive carswhere the public transportation is rather poor .

Let me try to clarify my point by comparing my observation of two countries , that is , Sweden and Turkey .
As Sweden is a more developed country in economical terms and has accordingly a social state that serves for the benefits of its people , the public transportaion is used hugely ; especially the underground and the busses .
However , it is not just the use of these public transportation but also the availability and quality of he service that is provided by the State , which is a factor that counts for the reason why Swedish people prefer to use the public transportation more than the privately owned cars .
On the other hand , although in Turkey the public transportation is getting developed especially in the two big cities , that is , Ankara and istanbul , it is still nothing compared to Sweden .
The busses do not have a timetable as in Sweden or the railway is not as long and the lines are not as many as in Sweden , which as a result makes people want to own and use cars instaed of public transportation .
However , apart from such a case , it also holds true that in Turkey people believe that nice looking cars affect their social status ( as the education level is rather law ) .

In conclusion , the suggestion that the use of cars will be used less is not a `` black '' and `` white '' answer .
It depends on the social , economic and political conditions of a country as well as its status within the global political economy .
