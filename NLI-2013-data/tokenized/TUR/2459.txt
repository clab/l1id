Everybody will admit that a birthday celebration with young people is generally more cheerful , colorful and full of fun than a birthday with older people .
Same goes for a sports event , a concert and into many social activities .
Therefore , it could be said that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they have more means for that .
These three means are eagerness , health conditions and new opportunities provided by technology .

First , young people are eager to live .
They are hungry for life .
They could travel all over the world , try new sports and meet new people .
They have not consumed the joys of life .
They are not prudent and ready to take risks which hopefully increases enjoyment .
However , older people are generally static both in mind and pysically .
They have rules set for their life .
There are nothing much left for them to discover .
Discovery itself is a big enjoy and young people could easily discover .

Second , young people 's health conditions provide them that joy .
When they got home from school or work , they do not feel any aches like the elderly do .
Even they drink a lot on the previous night , they find the stamina to get up and continue their life , whereas older people suffer from countless sickness even in their normal days .
Poor health conditions , which most of the older people have , is a great barrier to enjoy life .

Thirdly , for every new young generation , there are more opportunities to enjoy life than the older generations since there have been a lot improvements in communication technology and transport .
Fourty years ago it was almost impossible for an American girl to meet with an Indonesian boy .
With the improvements in computer technology , a lot people have a lot of friends in different continents whom they shared their feelings , expectations and so on .
Therefore , their taste for life increases .
They could also easily to travel in order to meet these people face to face .
There are much more planes travelling all around the world .
No one could argue that finding and getting together with the people you understand each other is

In conclusion , even though there are exceptional older people who could enjoy life , I agree with the idea that young people have more opportunities to enjoy and they certainly do .
