In today 's environmet , it is possible to see genaralists , generally in top positions , who have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
On the other hand , some sectors are in great need of specialists who have specialized in one specific subject .
The preference of being either a genaralist or specialist depends on the sector you have been in ( or will be in ) , and your capacity to learn .

First of all , in some positions having a broad knowledge can give you some extra advantage and makes your business easy .
For example , if you are a general manager of a company , certainly you should have a broad knowledge .
You will try to manage the company in all respects such as finance , human resources , and marketing .
However , in some occupations , having a concentrated specific knowledge can give you special advantages .
For instance , if you are a musician , having a specific knowledge about an instrument will be more beneficial than having a broader knowledge on all musical instruments .

The person 's capacity to learn is the second factor affecting having either a broad knowledge or a specific one .
Some students reveals high accomplishments at school .
Moreover , they have ability in many areas .
For example , they can read a poem and make some comment on it and solve a math problem at the same time .
They have really high capacity to learn and gather .
On the other hand , some students are not successful as students mentioned above .
Generally , they have a specific talent in one area such as art or music .
Trying to give them a general education on every subjects will make them bored and unsuccessful .
Their education should be focused .
Therefore , the students who has high capacity to learn ought to take classes on many subjects and finally have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
On the other hand , the students who has a relatively low capacity to learn ought to take classes on a specialized topic and spend all of his or her effort on that topic .

To sum up , the present or the future sector of the person and his or her capacity to learn affects a person 's choice of having a broad knowledge of many academic topics or specializing in one specific subject .
I think if a person have high capacity to learn and wants to work in a sector which needs broad perspective , that person should prefer to be a generalist rather than a specialist .
