Get a Acadamic Knoweladge

Academic knowledge is very important for human life .
People learn lot of things and get a lot of experiment during their life .
Some people try to learn lots of academic subjects , on the other hand some people try to learn only one academic subject for whole life , Nowadays people try to learn more than one academic subject .
Very firstly they get one accademic education .
When they finish this education , they want more education .
because tehey reliaze that people can learn whole things drung the whole life .
there are lots of people who have more than one academic subjects , these people aare very knowledgable and experiment , some people get only one specific subject during their life , they spose that only one accademic subject is enough for their life .
They except this stuation for their life .
they think that they always succesful at this way , and they never try to learn other specific thinhgs .

I strongly believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , because people can do it .
They get more than one specific skills .
I think this must be abligaton at nowadays .
becouse our world need to be more inteligent people .
I make a plane about my life .
If I enough life , I try to learn whole things at my enviorenment .

To sum up I strongly belive that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
day by day tecnology and the other things are developed .
We must chatch this developings .
There fore one specifick subject to learn is not enough .
If we learn many accademic subjects , we can do lots of yhinghs for our enviorment and our world .
