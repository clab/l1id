Time is the precious thing in people life but noone is aware of it end spend so generously .

Life energy begin in childhood and raised in youth ended in death .
Especially in youth ages everything is so simple for us ; .
we don t think about earning money or the job problems ...
We try to do our best to enjoy life as we can because we have energy to do this .
But when we get older we ll be scared to do something on our own and we ll delay our wills because there will be other persons in our life under our responsibility and their wills will be more important then ours .

I want to give example from my life .
I m 25 years old and i m living on my own in istanbul .
My family lives in other city and i want to study in america to be hired at reputable firm in istanbul .
I m about to change my life and i quit the job and take the risk because i know i m capable to do this because i don t have to lose at this age and i want to do everything i want in this ages after years and getting married this energy will not be only for me it will be for my husband children and work family ..
etc ..

Besides this emotional energy there will be lack of pyhisical ability in old ages to do things that we want .
Mostly old people use medicines for the deseases related to aging ; for example blood pressure ; could nt move faster and feel tired mostly .
It means when they feel healty and if there are some people araond them they enjoy their lives mostly

It is physical and emotional fact that young people enjoys their life more then older people because younger ones have great expectations from life and they have time to do .
I think we have to worth the time now we re in because it s go on so fast and we will not be young again .
