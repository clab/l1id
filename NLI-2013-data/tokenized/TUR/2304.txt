as a human being we are getting older day by day uncounciously and most of the time unwillingly .
Most of the time it creates serious problems for the adults .
But I believe that growing older does n't mean that you have to lose your joy of living .
I totally disagree with the belief that young people enjoy life more that the older people do .
there are more reasons and more possibilities for a older people to enjoy life .

First of all it is so obvious that young people spend their time and energy by dealing with the requirements of their social enviroment .
For instance after the graduation from the high school I immediately started to study my lessons in the university .
I could n't find time even to go on a vacation .
Moreover young people not only spend their time but also spend their energy in order to deal with the handicaps that they have been facing .
In contrast to them older people can save time because of their experiences .
they do not need to deal with those problems and they do noyt have to spend time on it .
in contrast to this they can go on a vacation everytime they want .

Further more they seek for enjoyable time more than the youngsters do .
Young people think that they will have time and chance to enjoy life in the future but since older people are well aware of how fast the time pasts .
They do n't wait to do something that they really want they use their senses rather than their logics .
My father has started to deal with the garden after he retired from the court .
He had worked for several years continuously .
Right now he know everything about planting .
he knows that he wo n't be able to make his dreams come through if he waits longer .
on the other hand i could n't find time to improve my clarinette .
I believe that this is best example which suits to the dicussion about timing because I still imagine that someday i will find time to improve it .

As a conclusion , I do not agree with the statement about the amount of joy that older people get from life .
As I faced during my entire life older people know better how to enjoy and how to spend good time by using their experinces and senses .
