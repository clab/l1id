I always belive that every age has its own beauty .
When I look around and observe people from different ages all around me , I can see that they love to do different things and they enjoy different things but they can still enjoy .
I do not think that the people who are in their old ages enjoy the life less that the young ones .

A young person may do lots of things in a single day than an older one .
He can go to cinema in the afternoon , go to shoopping in the evening and go to a concert with their friends at night .
However , it does not mean that not doing these kind of activities makes the older one enjoy the life less the younger one .
The older one may have done all these before in his younger ages and may want to do diffrent things such as having a beatiful dinner with his children and grandchildren or may want to have a walk with one of his friend to have a cup of tea on the seaside .

People at some certain ages are already have the taste of something and they want to do diffrent things .
I do not belive that , this makes them enjoy life less than the young people .
My mother loves to cook delicious meals when I go to my hometown at the holidays , and my father says that the happiest times of my mother are those when I say that ` Mum , these are all delicious` .
My mother enjoys the life at those time .
I can see it in her eyes .
Going to cinema or shopping or to a concert do not make happy her as much as having a dinner with all familiy .

Overall , people can be happy with diffrent things in their different ages .
Therefore , they can enjoy life very much at their older ages .
