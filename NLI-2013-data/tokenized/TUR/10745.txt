Many of the greatest discoveries like America and Everest were made by men who werent afraid to explore uncharted territories .
Who werent afraid to lose what they already got even their lives in order to achive their goal .

To create something new and something with a greater value you have to stop doing what others are doing and search for a better way of doing it .
You have to invent your solutions take the risks which scares away all the others .
I imagine people thought Edison was not bright at all untill he find the light bulbs .
Many successful people tend to pursue their goals no matter how risky they are and how irrational they seem to others .

Sticking on what is known to be right way of things will not achive you to the better .
You will do your job but you wont have the chance to know of a better way .

Walking on the path of others will only get you where others were .
While this may be sufficient for some I think there is a reason for all of us and its up to us to find it .
We have the chance to make our lives better and we have to pursue it no matter what .
