After industrial revolution , there was a boost in the production of new staffs all over the wold .
The revolution not only increased the speed of the production but also it opened a way for the variation .
However there should be another innoation to exhibit these new products .
At this point the advertisement concept came onto the stage .
The advertisements have been using for introducing new products to consumers starting from that time .
They are doing a good job for introducing new products to us .
However I agree that most of them intoduce products much better that they realy are .

First reason why I agree with the statement is that these advertisement companies should act in this way to be able to make profit which is the rule of capitalism world .
The statemet is true in that these companies should show the products desirable to get new jobs from the other companies .
However the introducton of new products in other way may result in disasters .
For example , if one new food product is introduced as a healthy product , altough it is not a healthy product in real .
This advertisement attempt would be resulted in death of a lot of people .

The second reason is that the companies may not have enough time and procedures to differentiate between the good one and bad one .
As a result they try to show them in the best way .
The technological innovations helped them a lot in this concept .
However there should be divisions in these companies to check the quality of productto be introduced .
Otherwise as I mentioned above the disasters for the human health would be unavoidable .

In conlusion the advertisements usually shows products better with the ignorance of human health .
