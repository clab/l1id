Success is the biggest motivation in human life .
The human kind is always trying to be successful in order to show his or her potential .
Some people think that trying new things and taking risks are the biggest failures of life .
However , the others contradicts that and if people want to be successful , they should try new things to show how successful they are .
I agree with this second idea .
These are my following reasons .

Firstly , without trying new things , it is impossible to know what the success is .
Also , you ca n't evaluate yourself whether you are successful .
Success is closely related with the different aspects of you have .
For example , my manager in my office is not as successful as he should be and he ca n't see this fact because he has been doing the same job for thirty years .
The main of idea of it is that he ca n't compare himself from the other similar people in the industry .

Secondly , according to me , success means proving yourself in various tasks or jobs and having courage to change your current job .
For example , if you stuck into one job that you assume that you are doing well , you ca n't know what your performance will be in other jobs .
You can have predictions only for your current job .
In another example , a friend of mine

Thirdly , living in this life means that you are taking many risks .
Which idea can lead someone not to try new things or take risks ?
For example , as we all know , when we step into the streets , there are many possibilities to face with difficulties like accidents or crimes .
There is no need to worry to take risks .
However , if you do n't have a courage to try new things , it means that you are not living in this life .
For example , one of my friend did n't have a courage to change his job at first although he is offered three times of his current wages .
After my intensive force , he changed his job and now he become the manager of the company because of his success .

To sum up , if people want to be successful , they should try new things because they have to learn what success is and try new jobs and they have to know how to live .
The motto said that success is only motivation in life .
