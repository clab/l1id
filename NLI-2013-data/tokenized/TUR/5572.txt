There are many different forms of marketing and maybe the most efficient and widely-used form of it is advertising .
However sometimes companies make their products seem a lot better than they really are in their advertisements and there are certain reasons for this .

First of all , companies advertise their products in order to increase their sales or market shares .
While doing so , some companies do not hesitate to do whatever it takes although this may include misinforming the consumers .
For instance , many companies generally prefer to hide some certain aspects of their products or the facts about it when they are advertising this particular products .
Everyday we see millions of these advertisements telling how cheap a product is .
But , how many of them state the actual price ?
Besides , yes the product may be cheap , but compared with what ?

Secondly , other than hiding some facts about it , companies follow another way to create a more favorable image of their products in the minds of the consumers .
They simply utilize impact of media .
For instance , the TVs are a very good way to make your product seem ` better` .
The visual impressiveness of this media channel is amazing .
Therefore by making TV advertisements that are enriched with visual impressions might boost your sales .
Also you can use the effectiveness of celebrities for example .
The advice of a well-known pop star might create an incredibly favorable image of your product .

Finally , by merely advertising your product you can easily create a more favorable image of it .
You do not need to hide any facts or utilize visual effects , bright colors in the advertisements to make people believe that your product is better .
This is because when people see the advertisement of your product - say , on TV - they ca n't help thinking that it really is a product of high quality .
This is maybe because advertising is a heavily expensive thing to do .
Therefore there is this common fallacy that what is advertised must really be good .

To conclude , today 's market conditions require the companies to be competent .
Some companies concieve this as a legitimization of unfair competition and behave in ways that they create misconceptions in consumers ' minds .
Especially when they are advertizing their products .
However if they want to create brand-loyal customers they should firstly earn their trust .
