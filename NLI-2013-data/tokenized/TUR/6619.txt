I definitely hope that in 20 years there will be fewer cars being used than today .
Eveyday more and more people take air pollution in to consideration .
People started to use local tansportation vehicles more than before .
As the fuel oil prices increase the personal car use is declining .
On the other hand local and or national transportation is getting more modern with the developing technology .
Access to many different regions is easier than before .
The starting point should be environmental pollution .
If we want to leave a less polluted world to our children to live , may be we can start with our cars .
Here is an idea ; when we are going to work why not driving one car .
Collegues living in the same region can get together and drive to work with one car instead of each of them driving his or her own car .
This is a very common argument nowadays .
Hiring a minibus is an other alternative way to decrease the car amount on the roads .
In today 's world people are more aware and conscious about the nature .
