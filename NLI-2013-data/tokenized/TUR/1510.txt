I strongly believe that experiences and the knowlege come from the chances .
We get more knowlege and experiences by chancing our main subjects than specializing in one specific subject .
Also we would have a chance to find the subject which we really like by chancing our subject .

Whether you believe it or not , different kind of subject give us more information than the same subject .
This is because we have a chance to improve us in many areas .
For example , if we study as a computer engineer , we would develope us in the area of art history by this method .
And I believe that the fact that we take art history couses in the school make us more important engineer than the ordinary engineer since he would desing the internet sites more interesting and more exciting .

Working in different subject give us a chance to find the subject which we really like .
Let ' imagine a person choose a subject which he does not like very much .
If he does not take the courses which is different from his major subject , he will never find the subject which he really like .
On the other hand , Working in differnt subject make the people more aware about the the other things .
For that reason people would see the differnt things as a hobby , not a stranger things .

All in all , chances contain many advantages in terms of information and our hobbies .
By studying the other subject we have a chance to undrestand what the subject we really like , and we get more informations and experiences for both our social and the professional life .
