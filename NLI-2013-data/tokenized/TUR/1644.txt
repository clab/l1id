KNOWLEDGE
The humankind always need knowledge to reach good life standarts .
Therefore knowledge is very important aspect of humanslife .
Some think that its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in on specific subject .
In contrary to those people some think that its not a good idea .
I personally agree with the first idea .
These are my following reasons .

Firstly , knowledge is a part of our life we make evrthing with our knowledge because we use our brain before doing something .
If we specialize in one specific subject we cant do anything about the another subjects , so its better to have broad knowledge .
For example , I know english very well but I dont know anything about spanish so I can speak only english , i can read only english but if i know another language with english it can be better for my life .

Secondly , if you have broad knowledge you can do whatever you want , you can discuss something with other people so it improves you life standarts .
For instance you have a job and you are good at your job maybe you think you are the best about it but if they kick you , you try to find a new job but everywhere will ask you something for example what do you about this topic discuss me or something like that so you know lots of things about everything in our world .

Finally , all in all as I said before if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject you will be better than other people who are specialize in one specific subject and Im sure you will win lots of things if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you will see .
