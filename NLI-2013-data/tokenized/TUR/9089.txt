In our country we have an old tradition in our education system .
Even if you are a primary class student or a university student you will experience the same : `` We like repeating words , lectures or whatever we told , without understanding the ideas ''

First of all , history classes in the primary school , I remember our teacher told a lot about the war that took place between our country and a neigbour , however right now it is really difficult for me to remember the reason or the result of that war .
Because all we did was to repeat several times the reasons without understanding and get rid of this knowledge after the exam .

Another memory that also affected my life was passed in the high school .
We had an exam on math .
In the result of the examination I failed because I could n't remember the necassary formula .
However my best friend who also forgot the formula passed because she also learned how to get the formula .

Nevertheless I am still failing in my works because I do n't know how to find the solution .

In Turkey we have a saying `` Do n't catch a fish for someone but tell how to fishing '' .
As a result in my opinion it is really important to understand the idea than to learn the fact .
