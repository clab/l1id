As a student majoring in bussiness management , i definitely know how important advertisement is in selling a product .
However , this does not mean that advertisement increases the purchase in a right way .
For example , it is not allways possible to find a product in the way that you saw in the advertisements , many times we find it worse than we thought .
Thus is because the manufacturers tend to show products ' properties better than they actually are .

First of all , it is common that most firms deceive people about the function of the product .
They try to show that their products serve extreme performance .
A very good example of this is slimming products , such as diet products .
I want to express something that happened to me recently .
In the television i saw the advertisement of a new product called `` diet patch '' .
It was stated in the advertising that after a person uses diet patch she would not feel hungry .
Consequently , she would lose 5 kilos in two weeks .
As soon as i saw this advertisement , i bought this product and started using it immediately .
After two weeks , while dreaming of loosing five kilos , i could lose only one an half kilos although i did all the things that were said in the instructions including the diet .

Secondly , in order to make customers buy their products , most of the firms demonstrate the appearence of the product extremely better than they actually are .
The most common example of this is the advertisements that are related to summer holidays such as tour organizations or hotels .
Last year we wanted to go to a hotel for our summer holiday .
Thus , we searched the newspapers and among various hotels we decided to go to a hotel which has 2 swimming pools .
The picture in the newspaper was so lovely that we could not think of any other hotel .
But , after we went to the hotel it was a muddy pool .

Finally , in order to pursue the customers the firms make advertisements that show their products better in ways such as changing its fuctions and its appearance .
