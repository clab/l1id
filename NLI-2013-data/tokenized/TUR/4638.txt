ADVERTISEMENTS AS A PART OF SYSTEM

I surely agree that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
However this is not simply caused by advertisements .
It is also related to the capitalist system and Marx 's idea of commodity fetishism .
By those processes , peole easily see those things more beautiful then they actually are .

First of all I want to describe the basic consequences of commodity fetishism .
People by caring more about the exchange values of commodities instead of their use value , get integrated to the system .
Marx argues that by this way people are controlled by commodities that they actually had created .
I think this is the basic feature which underlies why and how advertisements make products seem much better .

If people were not a part of the system and were not controlled by the commodities , they would n't be buying things that actually do not need .
However by living in the system they do n't care for the real features and use values of things .
A person who really and only cares about the use value of a product would n't be atrracted by the commodities which are now seem much better than they actually are .
Advertisement can give them more value because the system allows simple products to act as they have a real value independent from people .

If those conditions were not available , no matter how good or succesfull an advertisement is , it could n't show a product much better .
Because without those conditions there would n't be a human consciousness which would perceive them better than they are .
If only the use value could be cared by people advertisements would even not be on stage .

So when I say that I surely agree with the assumption it is because of those underlying features .
For commodities to control people , the system needs the advertisements in order to manipulate people more effectively .
So as the system is still exercised and work properly all of its parts should also be working properly .
And as the advertisement is a part of the system , it has also make its jobs and show products better than they really are .
