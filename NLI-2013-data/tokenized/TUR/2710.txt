Some people think that young people enjoy life more than old people do .
I am totally agree with this openion on condition that you are in good health .
When we examine the the reasons behind why old people usually cannot enjoy life as the youth does , we can find the answers for why the youth enjoys more .
The young people are usually in good health and still have many hopes for the future .
They usually have less to care about life as they are not still engaged in real life troubles .
They can easily spend money for fun and do anything for amusement .
Personally , I am in good health and I do whatever I want provided that I have enough money .
I can go out anytime at nights or stay at friends as I am away from my parents .
But as for my father , he comes home every evening for dinners and spends the whole evening at home watching tv .
He wakes up early in the morning and works all day .
He has to care for anything associated with our family in addition to his occupational responsibilities .
At the weekends , he prefers staying at home while we want to go out and do shopping or see a movie .
He has no pleasures of life and lives in a very pragmatic way .
Young people have their own dreams , own hopes and they have expectations from life .
They think , things are more entertaining when you are young than when you are old .

In addition to these , young people are not experienced about life and its pleasures .
They cannot think of possible results of temporary enjoyments .
The old are more careful about life and always thinks twice before doing something .
Therefore , old people usually miss their past irresponsible happy days when compared being ill and troubled at home .
Besides , young people like seizeing the day , my personal concern is that anyday repeats itself , so whatever I do today is a gain not a pain for me .
Noone knows what the future brings .
Life is meaningful when you are young .
The older you get , the less happier you are .
