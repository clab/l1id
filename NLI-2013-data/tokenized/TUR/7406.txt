Yes i do agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because of many reasons .
My first reason is , a tour guide is more familiar with the places that we are going to travel that guide can show us many place that we can not find easly by ourselfs .
for example hidden historical places or same taraditional places or relogionus places , churchs .

The second reason finans , when we travel aboard or for holiday to same where , if we have a tour guide we us , the guide can provide us usefull information about the our travel and some of this usefull informations are , the hotel which we will go , the tour guide can provide us the chip and best hotels .
For shoping also we can take hepl from the guide who can take us to the chip or a good shoping place .

And my last reason , going a country which has a different language can be hard to enjoy .
but if we have a tour guide who know the language of country that we are going to visit , the guide provides us to many nice things .
for example we saw a castle in the city and want to learn about it .
the guide can help us by translating information for thr castle .
If we want to speak and learn about the things and cultureof the country that we are visinting we need and translater Because all these reasons i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , but who is profeccional tour guide .
