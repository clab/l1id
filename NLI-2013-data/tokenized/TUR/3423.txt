I believe the correctness of this statement varies greatly from one community to another .
If am to answer this question considering Turkey , the country I live in , I would still say the answer depends on different socio-economical classes in Turkey .
However , I agree that the majority of young people in Turkey nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .

One thing that can be said is that the more educated a young person is , the more time s/he devotes to help the community .
When we look at the uneducated youth of Turkey , we see that they spend their time doing simply nothing .
A large percent of them is unemployed and they do n't have the sense of helping others in the community since they are the ones who need help in the first place .

However , when we look at the youth in the universities , we see that they are more concerned about the problems in the community and possible ways to solve those problems .
So , from this point on , I will concentrate on the educated young people .

When I look at my university , there are some people trying to help the community , and some people who simply do n't care .
Devoting time to help the community is not really common , though .
The heavy courseload forces people to plan their time effectively , and what is included in the plan is , most of the time , the things which have practical benefits .
People simply do n't have time to enjoy the moral benefits obtained from helping others .

Actually , a person can devote time to help other people only when his/her own needs are fulfilled , so that s/he can enjoy the moral satisfaction and respect from others in the community .
However , in a community where it is hard to fulfill the needs of oneself , it should not be expected of young people to devote their time to help others in the community .
