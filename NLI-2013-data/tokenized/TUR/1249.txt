Over the last fifty decades education has been a significant role for peoples life .
Because of that they have researchs about lots of subjects ore just one .
Some people beieve that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and the other people think that the better one is to specialize in one specific subject .

First of all having a knowledge of many subject is not mean having lots of essential thing .
People can know economics and biology in the same way but they cant use it together .
Because those are different things .
But when people taking some reasearcs about similar subject it can be help them for lots of things .
Knowledge of lots of thing does not mean anything if the people do not know how they use it and when .
Whwn a person have lots of knowledge he or she can help people in lots of areas .
Because of that people can prefer this way .

Secontly specializing in one specific subject can be mor acceptable to everyone .
When people interested in one subject they can continuing about this material and they can be a professor .
And also if a person know everyhting about a subject they also have learned some different things .
The people who have a knowlegde of specific subject have more succesful life than the others ' have .
So that they earn much money than others do .

To sum up i agree the idea which mentioned because of the facilities of board konowledge .
Knowing lots of thing can get a number of oporcinities which can help us in our social or daily life .
But both many academic subjects and one specific subject are essential for people .
People 's indecive adversely affected their life so they would choose the way which is the most suitable for them .
