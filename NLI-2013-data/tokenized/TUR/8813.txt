The education system should provide the students with the ability to assimilate new ideas and concepts and comprehend their implications , rather than only stating the facts about a particular subject .
The major reason for this is the very nature of the memory and the learning process .
Furthermore , in order to use the school knowledge in real life , students must have the capability to analyze the concepts .

Firstly , human beings tend to forget the facts ; however , if they analyze them and derive their own conclusions and ideas , they remember them for a long time .
For example , in the history classes during my high school education , we were overexposed to a vast amount of historical facts and data , like the dates and places of wars , among which I remember only a few .
In contrast , in my university education , I had the opportunity to take history classes in which the students had to read a lot of articles about a certain topic .
The reading material consisted of diverse opinions about a historical fact or argument .
In the exam , the students were asked to present their own opinion by referring to the information in the texts , analyzing them , and explaining in detail why they agree or disagree with certain parts of them .
I still remember the arguments and the reasoning behind them , which have been very useful not only in my academic studies , but also daily life .

Secondly , merely memorizing the facts is insufficient to implement the school knowledge in real life , since it does not entail originality and creativity .
After the students graduate and start working in the industry or in their daily lives , they are required to come up with new ideas and present solutions to the problems .
In order to accomplish this , they have to have originality and creativity .
The history classes in my university education have also provided me with this ability .
For instance , while reading the articles in the newspapers , I can not only understand , but also criticize the writer 's argument in its historical and political perspective .

To conclude , I think that understanding ideas and concepts is much more beneficial for students than merely leaning the facts .
This is both because they can remember the information much more easily and because they can implement their knowledge in real life situations through their originality and creativity .
