I firmly believe that , in the twenty-first century , specializing in a specific subject is much more important than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
This is for the reason that with developing technology and the accumulated knowledge of humankind through centuries , having broad knowledge on any subject is not sufficient to make researches , experiments or , consequently , any developments .

It is known that Aristo worked on various branches of science from psychology to biology and physics .
However , when the circumstances of the Ancient Greek civilization is compared to those of 20th century it will be quite clear why Einstein did not follow the footsteps of Aristo and merely , specialized in Physics .

In Aristo 's era , humanity had not developed at all and was living its early stages .
In this context , Aristo had the opportunity to bringforth the most basic concepts which were valuable then , but are a part of our daily life , now .
Considering the technological conditions and the level of the knowledge of humanity , Einstein conceived that in order to step up he should focus on a single subject .
Because being a member of the 20-century-old humanity he should learn a subject by heart , not only the main topics related to it but also the very details .
That is , learning physics is a stepping stone to learn modern or quantum physics .

The general behaviour of the disciplines of science is supporting this idea .
As the researchers continue and the developments are achieved new disciplines are born from an existing branch of science .
Physics was just physics at all , but as it is understood that there is something more to it , Electronics , Mechanics , Metallurgy etc. began to be considered as different branches .

To sum up , I should say that I agree with the idea of knowing single subject but being the expert of that field , is far more better than having broad knowledge of many subjects which is identical to being able to talk of many subjects at first but is not able to keep pace with the real experts of that particular subject .
It should not be disregarded that every effective person in today 's world , whether a politician , an academic person , soldier or a sportsman is specialized in single subject and that is why the people around the world know them .
