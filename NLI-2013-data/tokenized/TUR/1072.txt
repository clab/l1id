Academicians are often faced with the dilemma of either specializing in their core area of research or to study , learn , and eventually be productive in a variety of subjects .
Needless to say there are advantages and disadvantages of both approaches .

Usually , a doctoral student completes his/her dissertation focusing on one topic and investigating the issue in detail .
The chapters of the dissertation may look at the problem from different perspectives , but the main theme is the same .
After graduation , the student hopefully finds an academic position and turns the chapters into independent articles and has them published at academic journals .
After that , whether to continue in the same area or branch into different areas does become the choice of the academician .

Focusing on the same specific area of research will make the academician an expert in that field .
If the reseach area is fertile , the publication record will be impressive .
S/he will get tenure quite easily and will be a respected member of academic circles .
However , at some point , the academician will be isolated .
S/he will no longer have the possibility of venturing into joint projects with others .
Moreover , if interest in that particular area of research eventually fades away , s/he will lose popularity , the career will be faced with the possibility of obscurity , and it will be extremely difficult for her/him to move into other research areas at that point .

On the other hand , keeping a balance of conducting research in the main area of interest and branching into other subject areas will make the career of a researcher more durable .
The natural way to do research in other areas is to have co-authors , whose talents can be combined with those of the researcher .
As knowledge increases in a geometric fashion in today 's world , it becomes more and more difficult to master a topic by oneself .
Researchers are forced to develop joint projects with others .
Moreover , the quality and the efficiency of research production will increase with joint projects .
Establishing connections with other researchers will open the door for new projects with other researchers .
As a matter of fact , this is the trend in many areas of academia .
In Finance , for example , the majority of the articles that are published in good quality journals have multiple authors .

Learning is the lifelong ambition of an academician .
This is best achieved by branching into and learning about other subjects , establishing connections with researchers in those areas and developing projects by sharing knowledge in a reciprocal manner .
