There exists an opinion that young people nowadays do not tend to spend enough time to helping their communities .
Indeed , I agree with this statement .
First of all , the notion of individualization has taken over in modern times and consequently among the young generation .
Young people place more value on individual interests than they do on the interests of the community they are in .
As a result they tend to devote an appreciable amount of time to their own works and private lives .
This in turn , as may easily be guessed , does not leave much time for them to do something for their communities .

Moreover , the lives of young people became much more difficult than they were in the past .
By the word ` difficult ' I mean that the conditions that face the young generation are more cruel and competitive .
The world population and hence the amount of young people increases year by year .
Therefore , in order to achieve something in life , the representatives of the young generation have to work much harder and concentrate more on their own interests .
In other words , they just do not have time to be engaged in helping their communities .
I would like to bring my life as an example .
I want to become a successful scientist in the future .
However , nowadays there is an appreciable amount of students who would like to pursue a scientific career - especially in my field ( genetics ) .
Therefore , in order to ` outweigh my rivals ' I have to work quite hard and have very little time to help my parents , relatives or friends .

Furthermore , helping someone else in general and the community in particular should involve a great sense of responsibility .
However , as far as I could observe the members of the current young generation usually lack that .
In other words , they do not want to take responsibility for someone else and hence do not tend to help that ` someone else ' .

In conclusion , I would like to mention that in view of the reasons and the example stated above , I certainly think that at our times young people do not spend a reasonable amount of time devoted to helping their communities .
