These statement made me think a bit more time because I disagree and agree with it at the same time .
I try to explain my opinion about these topic .

On the one hand , I agree with these statement for commercial products .
Because advertisements are mostly very common way to recognize some of the commercial products to community .
When you see any product in any advertisement , you always meet good characteristics of the product .
Any advertisement do not mention about any negative characteristic of the product .
if you try to sell some product you must say the good characteristics of the product .
If you explain the some of the wrong or disorder characteristic of the product you can not sell it easly .

For example when you watch TV you never met any advertisement mention about some side effect of some medicine , some foods , etc .
Any hamburger restaurant do not any adverticement about how dangerous is feeding with fast foods but we know when we eat much more hamburger we take weigth .
If we apply morgage to buy a home we can met some bad situation when we do not pay montly bill .
But any of them do not explain these un nice results of the commercial products .

However on the other hand I disagree with the statement .
Because some of the advertisements are for the human services .
For example : Child care center , nursing home or any hospital , etc .
These kind of advertisements try to explain the programs ' facilities , how peole get the services , etc .
Most of the these kind of advertisements give rigth informations to take the attention of consumers who need the services .

At the end I can say that advertisements is very effective way to recognize the some commercial products and services .
But important one take account human well being .
