In our daily life facts has a domination on our automated behaviours .
Because most people do n't spend much time on intellectual activities .
They are getting up early , having breakfast , going to work , after their work they coming to home back and this loop goes on .
But if a person must want to be a real human , he/she must spent some time in the world of ideas , because what makes it different from animals .

Before a fact became a fact it first be shaped in our mind .
After creating an idea we can give it life and make it real .
We put some goals in our brain , for example going to Mars after 20 years .
Is this a fact ?
Of course not .
But going to the Moon was not a fact too until someone deciding to achive this challenging idea .
So if we want to do something we must start from conceptualization of what we want to do .

Another fact about facts is they are passive for us .
It is a result of a proccess and what shapes the proccess is ideas .
So we can say that thinking is cause and fact is result .
In this point of view , if we want to educate creative and active students we must not fill their brains with passive facts , instead we must teach them how to think and conceptualize new , brave and challenging ideas .

In sum , being as a human we are living both with ideas and facts .
But teaching only facts without their background information can not achieve a permanent learning on student .
And a student who does not know how to create new concepts has no meaing in education .
