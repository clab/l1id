As much as I wish for it to be true for the sake of the environment and the future of of our ecological system , I have a hard time agreeing with the statement : `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use that there are today . ''
Ever since the introduction of the `` T-Model '' by Henry Ford using mass production technologies in the 1920's , the number of cars has started to increase in exponential factors .
This is due to a number of factors which I believe are irrevocable in our modern day world .

Firstly , our technology is changing at such a fast pace that we do not know if and how to tame it .
Thus , it is becoming ever easier to design and manufacture cars .
The number and variety of car models abundant in our everyday life is natural proof for this point .
There is wide range of cars available for sorts of tastes and budgets .

Secondly , as the world economy progresses , the purchasing power of nations and individuals increase although not at the same rate .
For example , even though let us say that some 3rd world countries are not as rich as their European or North American counterparts , the streets are jammed with cars in capitals of India , Egypt , etc .
Cars are becoming more and more accessible in the remotest and the most impoverished locations .
Whereas it was not easy for a young woman from Kazakhistan to own her own car , it is not as unthinkable today as it once was .

Lastly , I believe that we , as individuals , are becoming more and more addicted to our cars .
Whereas a household used to have one car in the 1970's or so , now the number of cars per household is increasing rapidly .
This is in part necessitated by the rapid and hectic lifestyles brought about by the modern world and in part by what we call `` conspicious consumption '' in economics .
If your neighbour changes to a better version , you like to do the same due to psychological factors even though your current car may be perfectly functional and comfortable .
This naturally `` drives up '' the market for cars .
We cannot think of ourselves without our cars .
Our daily routines are completely disturbed if we have to go to the office without our car .

As a result of these and similar factors which I believe to be irrevocable , the number of cars will continue to increase despite environmental concerns .
I also believe that this trend will continue for even more than twenty years .
However , it is a comforting thought that the negative effects may be somewhat decreased if car manufacturers start focusing on enviromentally friendly hybrid and diesel models .
