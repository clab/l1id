CITIES TWENTY YEARS LATER
How will our cities be in the future ?
How will people live twenty years from now ?
These are questions asked for so many years and we can see many different answers , theories and approaches through out history .
When trying to answer these questions , the key aspects of cities such as traffic and car use come into the picture .
I believe that , in terms on car use in the city , there will not be significant decrease in the number of cars used and even more cars will be used in twenty years .

There are several aspects effecting the car use today .
The main element is the car-dependent life style of modern people living in the cities .
I believe that the city life of the near future will as car dependant as today or even more .
Cities evolve and continue to get bigger counting on the mobility of the people .
As new suburbs are created and cities with multiple city centers away from each other , are developed ; as the current situation in Istanbul nowadays more and more people will need to use cars .

The only reason for fewer cars to be used in the near future would be the concept of working from home using the internet .
People can argue that when people will have the chance to live and work in one place - the home office concept , they will not need to use cars .
However the concept of a home ofiice is not that new and in the past 10 or 15 years many people tried to work from home but ended up going back to their offices .
Big companies are not supporting people working from home , on the contrary they are trying to create better and more confortable working environments in and around the city .

Based on what I see in my own country ( Turkey ) and many other developing countries I can say that more and a lot of money is invested in the car industry , highways , tunnels and bridges making it easier and necessary for people to use cars .
Therefore I believe that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today .
