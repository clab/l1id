I believe that most of the products we see on tv or magazines are much better than they really are .
Two years ago I bought a face cream I had seen on the television and it turned out to be a disaster .
This kind of misrepresentations are really common in todays advertisement world because of the companies aim to sell more product and advertisement agencies way of being more attractive .

The companies represent their products better since there is a a lot of potential customers and they all want to take their shares in this large cake .
These companies have great competition between themselves and they are ready to do everything even these things are unethical .
Their way to sell more product is to show their products better and they can do this easily since there is no control over the kinds of misrepresentations .

Besides the companies , the advertisement agencies show some products different than they really are .
Since they are in the business to make people believe , they create some ideas or images which seem more attractive to the customers on the television while misrepresenting the product .
While they are doing this untrue presentation , the companies do not prevent them since it is for their advantage .
from this arrengement In a conclusion , today most advertiments we see represent the better version of the product and there are still people who buys these product before searching the products really quality .
I took my lesson two years ago and I hope everyone see the true faces of these companies and advertisers as soon as possible .
This misrepresentation will continue as long as it goes until someone come and show the real faces of these companies and advertisement agencies to all world , but until that time I wonder ` What is next'
