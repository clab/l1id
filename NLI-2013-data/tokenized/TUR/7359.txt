I like to think that I am the kind of person who is willing to like to travel very much .
Addition to that , the best and most important thing for a travel is to be in a group led by a tour guide for some reasons .

Firs of all , to travel in a group by a tour guide is more economic .
When I was in my country , I was going to travel to Istanbul with my friends .
As you know , Istanbul has always become a very critual city throughtout history .
To learn Istanbul and see every place of its is always megical to me .
Hence , we planned to speak with an advisor who was working in a tour company in Istanbul .
The tour cost approximately 1.000.00 dolar .
And also , all our requriments was going to be given by the company .
However , the reason was that we could not offer that money .
Therefore , we got some credits from the company .
The most beautifil things were we could save our money .
Being in a group led by a tour guide gives you some opportunaties to you .
You can save your money because you will be able to know how to spend your money before the travel .
During your travel , you do not have to determine your payments because they will have done by the company before the tarvel .

The second reason why I think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is that you can develop your friendship and you can learn more things about the city that you will visit by the guides .
During your travel , you can have a conversation with people who are from diffirent country .
For , some travel companies make their tours with tourist .
Therefore , you can meet people from other countries .
For example , our tour was with German students and we discussed with them Turkey and its importance for European Union .
Furthermore , I learnt many interesting things about Istanbul that I didnt know from the guide .
Since they are educated about the cities that they are responsible for , they know the some hints of the cities .
During your travel , you can ask them some questions about your things that you will see .

Finally , the reasons I have just mentioned above , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
It offers you some opportunaties before and during your travel .
