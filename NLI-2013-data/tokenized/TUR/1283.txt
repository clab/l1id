Some people believe that having a broad knowledge in various academical subjects may lead them to greater depths in their carreer .
On the other hand , there are also many examples of people concentrating on a single subject and specialize and make a carreer with it .

In my opinion , studying for a specified subject would be a more efficient and wiser decision to make .
For example , when you think yourself as a student who is having double major on two unrelated fields , you 'll soon mix together what you have studied .
The two essentials of the two fields would be congested .
By the end of your study , you 'll not be able to specialize in either of the subjects .
You 'll just be able know the basics of them which is not the best thing the succeed in life .

A further example of why choosing a single subject can be the attempting of a working carreer of your own in a certain field .
For this to happen , you need to concentrate on a single subject at your academic career since you have to understand your subject with detail and from every point of view .
This only occurs with specialization .
Therefore ' being ambitious in life , brings the need to specialize in a specified subject .

If we look at the problem from a student point of view , some students believe that broad knowledge on many subjects requires lots of time and a lot of sacrifice from social life .
By this drawback , they easily select specializing in one subject .
This could also be seen as a different reason of choosing a single subject to study .

As we have seen from the examples , it does n't matter whether you are ambitious on specializing on a specified subject .
The important thing is that , it is the wiser decision to take to reach what you are aiming in life .
These aims can be listed as succeeding in working life , achieving on new discoveries of your subject , specializing on what you studied or even being able to spare time at your university years .
For sake of your aims , it is better to have a knowledge on specifis subject .
