There are many options for the university student in their studies .
Someone can get deep in one topic and pay all his attention to this topic or ahve broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
My opinion is the researches should focus on his study to get all the information about his topic , however he should also follow what is going on other subjects .

The definition of the world master is someone who knows all the esential information about one topic .
Since it is difficult to reach all the knowledge about many topics , the reasercher should choose one specific topic and concentrate on it .
In todays world , knowledge is like ocean .
If a fish wants to see all part of the ocean , it will exactly lost his way .

There are some examples of people who chosed many subjects to study and becomed succesful .
For instance ; Decards who is called as the father of geometry is know as one of the biggest philoshofers .
Newton who set the basis rules of the phisic , has a lot of theories that are used in the modern mathematics .
However , the number of these scinetics are limited .
Many good scientis are concenrate on one topic .
In the universites it is difficult to find a professor who gives lecture in two different departmant .

However , the researcher should have the major knowledge from related subjects to his topic .
For example , the electronical enginieer working on television research and development department should know what is going on in computer technology to carry out his research .

To sum up , it is better to specialize in one specific subject while knowing what is going on aroud .
