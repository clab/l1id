Cars that are flying

The amount of cars gets enhanced in the last few decades , but as all humanity passed behind so many other things like horses , the last days of cars are coming soon ?
There are several aspects to talk about this clearly , such as the oil reserves , high technology devices , and public transportation .
Those are going to be the deciders of the final days of cars or let s say the significant decrease of the amount of the cars .

As we all know , the oil reserves of the earth is getting lowever and lower each day .
Scientist , politicians , socialist and so on , think of an alternative resource to oil .
The only possible solution to this problem is the solar source nowadays .
It includes the technology that the car engine structure can be based on this enegry , but I do not hink so , because the technology is so expensive to apply and also not progressing fast .
It won t cause any decrease in car number but in old fashioned cars maybe .

Second , the high technology devices that enables any thing possible , are not quite working on this process , and generating any development to fit in this area would take at least 50 years to give reproducible results .
The new and high technology always cost very much and it can not be spread so quickly to remove cars from earth .

At last , the public transportation can be good example of an expectation to decrease in car amount in a few decades however , as the world gets bigger in terms of economical subjects concerned , the wealthiness of the people is going to increase , in a manner that everybody want to own his or her car .
In twety year era , no new things seem to be coming .

Consequently , as the development is in the nature of the mankind , the new technologic progresses are on the way , just sticking onto our fancy four wheeled cars must be somehow another fancy thing , too .
However , when the behaviour of people are analyzed , it can be obviously seen that since there are nothing coming newer than cars in twenty years , I am pretty sure that cars are going to dominate the world somehow
