The humankind always need knowledge to reach good life standarts .
Everyone has different aspects of this idea .
Some assume that it is more iportant for students to understand ideas and concepts , in contrary to this some assume that it is important for them to learn facts .
I totally agree with second idea .
These are my following reasons .

Firstly , the reason the knowledge from learning facts is important is permanent .
When people learn facts with experience , they do not forget easily .
So they use these facts through all their life .
For example , I had an car accident last year .
Before this event , my parent advised to not drive fast .
I understood the ideas , however it did not help me avoid to make accident .
Now , after accident I learn my lesson and drive my car slowly .

In addition to this , the reason that the learning facts is more important rather than understanding the concepts is to show an example of it in real life .
The understanding the concepts can be so abstract .
For example , the concept of communism seems like so perfect , however in the real life this concept can not be worked well .
So students can be confused by this abstract concept .

As I mentioned above the learning facts is more important for students than understanding ideas and concepts according to these reasons : it is both permanent and real .
I think the teaching system should modify with these reasons .
