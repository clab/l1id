I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
First of all that is why companies create advertisements ; to increase the reputation of their products .
Also advertisement is need to be like that to be effective on customers .

Companies create adversitement to make their products well-known , to increase the sales and to make profits as much as possible .
This three reasons are every companies most important goals .
To make your product well-know , the advertisement needed to be good prepared .
Also it can be exaggrated if it is needed .
There years ago there were a car commercial in Turkey .
The commercial was about reliability of the car .
A car was moving fast through valleys and up to mountain .
At the end the driver get off the car and started to walk on moon slowly and with jumping .
Many people in Turkey still remembers this commercial , so does the car brand .
If the companies or their brands are well-known they can increase the sales .
As a result the profit which they make would increase too .
That is the reason companies make deal with other companies to enter a new market .
For example Sony made deal with Ericcson and create a new brand , Sony Ericcson , to enter the Turkish cell phone market .

Advertisements are need to be effective on customer .
Some scientific researchs in USA during 1990's show that people forget very big part of what they see easily .
To make it hard to forget or unforgetable their emotions are needed to be effected .
If advertisement can effect people 's emotion it will effect people 's ideas too .
To effect people 's emotion advertisement need to show more than what products really are .

I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because companies creates advertisement to make their product well know , to increase the sales and to increase the profits .
Also people can easily forget what they if they are not effected emotionally .
We need exaggrate to effect people 's emotionas .
