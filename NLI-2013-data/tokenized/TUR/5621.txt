The seller always need to advertisements to buy their products to human therefore the advertisement is a very important aspects of the sellers .
Somebody things that advertisements show the reality of the product to consumers , the others think most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I agree the second idea .
These are my following reasons .

Firstly , advertisements may have visual games .
For example , the cosmetic companies use much beatiful models to attract womans to buy their products .
They think the products will increase their beauty as the models .
Moreover , advertisements may show unrealistic details of the products us .
For instance , the shampoo advertisements says they have lots of positif benefits to hairs and they show a women whose hair is so atractive but they are not full of these benefits ,

In addition to this , advertisements are everywhere so we are influenced about thinking they are good .
In my street there are lots of bilboard and when an advertisement about a product is on these bilboard , I see them everday and the result of this I think it is better to use .
I mean that our opinions about a product are influenced by the advertisements .

Finally , although some products does n't worth , the advertisements increase the price of the product .
So we buy something which is less quality than we expect .

All in all , as i said before , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because of having untrue visuality and being everywhere and they are cause of high costs .
The advertisement company should be honest to improve their quality and profits because people easily understand the reality of them .
