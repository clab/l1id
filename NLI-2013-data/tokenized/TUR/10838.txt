I agree with successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
If you want to be successful , you should try new things , take risk and be brave .

First of all , success come up with trying new things which have never done before .
You should investigate , think about new things and make your decision step by step .
After all of them you should start what you want to do .
For example , Bill Gates left out from university and created Microsoft which would be number one in the world .
He found a useful program which named Windows .
People all over the world uses it because it is new and it has no alternative .
He is number one because they always do things never done before Secondly , without risk you can not be success . '
Life equals to risk ' says Rahmi Koc who is the head of the Turkish biggest company Koc Holding .
Moreover , if you do not want to take risk , you can not make any progress in your life .
Also , you can not make any step .
You should take risk and try to do your best .

At last , you should be brave what ever you do to be successful .
Because , when you are afraid of doing something new , you can not never be successful in your whole life .
You should think the step you are going to make , but you should n't think it twice .
When you think it twice , it will be too late to do it .

In conclusion , to be successful , you should do things which have never done before , take risk and never afraid of anything .
When you do all them , there will be any reason to succeed .
Life is short and there is nothing you can not do .
