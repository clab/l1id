I can see both advantages and disadvantages to try new things and take risk for being successful .
You can whether choose stability and use traditional ways and avoid risk or try new ways and take risk for being successful .
I definetely believe that people should try new things and take risk for being succesful .

If you do everything with a routine that means you know the results .
For example if a farmer use traditional ways for agriculture , he can guess how much crops he will get .
He can avoid risks by doing that .
But it is not a creative way and it is obvious that he wo n't be successful .
He will get as same amount crop as next year .
The point I am trying to make is , that is not a vakid way for being a suscussful person .
On the other hand he could try different ways in order to get much crop which means taking risk for success .

In my opinion , successful people try new things and take risks .
For instance , if the farmer try a new agriculturel way which is not experienced before he can get a different amount of crops .
he could get whether '' less or much '' but the point is he can be successful by taking that risk .
I already know that lots of successful people in business area tried new things and figure out new ways .
That is the main reason of their success .
For instance a very well known newspaper owner was just a writer in a newspaper .
He decided take risk , he resinsged and established a local newspaper and then he made it success .
And we all know that newspaper owner today .

To sum up , I always experienced that successful people take risks .
They try new ways instead of only doing what they already know .
They take risk for being successful .
