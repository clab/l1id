Knowledge is something so much important for the humankind .
Some people agree that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subjects is the right thing to do and some of them think the opposite .
I agree with the opposite , I would rather specialize in one specific subject .
These are my following reasons .

First of all , your knowledge will be strong .
After specializing on one specific subject , you are going to have so much information only about this .
Nonetheless , other people who have information about so many things will never be an expert on the subject .
They could have opinions , however unlike you , they wont have strong ideas and enough supporting information .
Being an expert on one thing gives the person so much power about that subject which can be used to convince someone easily .
People will count on your strong ideas .

Secondly , the knowledge will last long time .
People who have knowledge about so many things will forget their information in time .
Nevertheless , specializing on one idea will make our information last long time .
They will never be forgotten .
For example , someone who spent whole his life on one thing will never ever forget that subject because after some time it is becoming one of his part , on the contrast , someone trying to learn about everything will forget what he learns soon , because he cant keep that all in my mind .

The last but not least , being an expert on one specific subject will lead us to success .
For instance , i was quite good at maths in the high school , i was also good at chemistry .
However , when i was going to university i had to choose one of them because in no place on earth , they are letting you to specialize in more then one specific subject in universities .
You have to choose one of them in order to lead to success .
Noone can be professor of so many things .
You can be a professor of one major subject .
Therefore , it is so much important to have great ideas on one major subject .
Also the basketball players can not play ball and study at the same time .
For leading to success they have to choose one thing and specialize on that .

To sum up , i want to say that specializing in one specific subject is so much important rather than having knowledge on so many things .
Because , knowledge on one thing will be strong , last long time and lead us to success which is required by everyone .
