Knowladge is eveything

I agree with this view .
This view is it is better to have broad knowladge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are very unknow events in the world .
It is believed that whatever scientist can find them .
Govermants are always support them .
Because if they find a solution for unknow events , humans will be well day by day .

For instance , one of the most unknow events is space .
We still do n't know aliens to be or not to be in our solar system .
Altough a lot of people such as scientist or resarchers try to find a solution for it , they can not a solution for it yet .
Also , the people who are scientist try to find a new energy source without petrol or electiric .
They found h2 for cars or bus .
Cars or bus work well without petrol owing to h2 .
in my opinion , one of the most important invention is that .
In this way , envoriment is protected by people because h2 is n't harmful for nature .

All in all , thera are a lot of unknow events in the world .
Scientist have to find a solution for them .
If scientists or resarchers find something like a treatment for cancer or fliying car , people will be more healthy and people live easily .
