Who enjoys life more young poeple or old ones .
It is very important for us to enjoy our time in our life span owing to the fact that we fell positive and happy if we only enjoy our time .

People often claim that young people enjoy life more than old people however I am inclined to belive that , old people can enjoy just as the same levvel or more/I have many reasons to belive so .
To start with according to me young people spend good time which is true they do not have many responsibelties , they can make many sports , ride their bike and the like but they are also in the term of their like they have being educated .
I thing that this is a very hard time of ones life they have to obbey to rule , to be dissipline which can be gloomy and sad .
In this term of their life they do not have the apportunety to chose what they want .
They are in control of their parents or their theachers .

According to me , adults have the ability to chose what they want to do whicw is the most significant issue according to me .
Fredom is something which we enjoy in life naturely and instinctly .
Aspecialy if we choose a job that we tend to or have talend on I can not see any reasons which can take an adult to be unhappy / Taking everything in to accoud , i strongly belive that adults can also enjoy their life just as young ones do or much more by chooseng the right job and controlling their selves .
Working , earing money and spending it on something they enjoy .
