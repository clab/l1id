It is good to have knowledge on many academic subjects , however , upto what extent we need that amount of knowledge is questionable .
In my opinion , specilizing in one specific subject will bring lots of good academic works .

Suppose that you are a person who have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
This means that you studied a lot and learned a lot of things .
But first question appearing is that does that person really need that amount of knowledge ?
And , more importantly , by using that knowledge , can he focus on the topics properly ?
I claim that speclization will bring efficiency , time management , and gains in focus .

For instance , in societies , almost everybody is specialized on a specific job .
In other words , as a rational people , everybody wants to do the job in which he has a comperative advantage .
By doing so , not only the person will be happier but also the society will be more close to a Pareto efficient allocation .
On the other hand ; if people know a broader knowledge of many things , then they might have some useless information and lose their focus on subjects .

Another example would be related to an academician 's situation .
when writing a paper , almost always specifing on a certain topic is as much as desirable .
For instance .
If that person specifies in the field of industrial organization and game theory , the papers that he will be writing will certainly be affected by the knowledge that he created in that field before .
However ; if he focuses on different fields and tries to specialize in a lot of fields at the same time , there might emerge some problems regarging to the accumulation of knowledge in the future .
Everytime he writes on a specific area , he needs to focus on that field again , and this will take considerable amounts of time and bring inefficiencies .

In conclusion , I think that it is better not only for people but also for societies to specilize on certain subjects .
It might sound good to know everything at the first place , however , a deeper thinking on this topic shows that there might be losses on the time and efficiency concerns .
