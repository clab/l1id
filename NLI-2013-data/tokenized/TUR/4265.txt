I agree with the fact that young people do n't give enough time to helping their communities .
Before I give the reasons and examples , I want to clarity the word young people .
According to my essay , young people means the people at the of 15 to 25 .
Below and after those ages are out of the scope of my essay .

If we look at the global trends in the world today , we see that it is mainly a world based on consuming more and more .
Consuming in the sense that , our happiness is getting more and more directly related to having more personal material under us .
If it is not the same for every young person , it is the same among my friends .

The main reason why I agree with the statement is because I believe that he world that we live in today is very individualised .
The reason for this is the one that I explained before .
In today 's life , we have huge resources of data , huge amounts of toys to spend time and etc .
People keep on spending time with those toys or vast amount of data that are available .
For those people , having a time for other things are almost inevitable .

As an example , I can give people who dedicate their lives to Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games .
I know my friends play these games for days continously just to have a better character in the game that results in a better reputation among their friends .
In the scope of this example , for many people , helping out the community is just a waste of time .
Something that does not possess any value in it .
Because they do n't gain anything materially by helping out people .

In conclusion , I think the way young people see the world is the problem here .
We live in a world which is dominated by consuming trends .
The happiness in today 's world comes from material happiness , and for many young people around me , helping out the community is most of the time nothing but a wastage of time just because it gives nothing to their material possessions .
