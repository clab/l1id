I think that 's not a very accurate statement , indeed , becuz enjoying the life has nothing to do with age or agedness .
Enjoying life is a matter of knowing to get real taste from life or not and regardless of their age , anyone who likes to taste the extreme limits of life can achieve that in the best way .
For example , who gets more taste from life , a disabled young boy or an old grandmother of yours who still feels vivid , fresh and joyful as ever , young girl or the old grandmother ?
Of course , the old grandmother does , because the young boy is n't willing to do anything as he ca n't use his body properly .
He ca n't walk or run .
He ca n't ride a bike unlike the able ones who can enjoy life riding on a bike or going for a walk in the streets holding the hand of his or her darling .
As it is illustrated in the above example , we ca n't generalize that the old people are usually boring and dull people who like to stay in their homes waiting the end of their life to come sooner .
In the same way , we can claim the opposite , namely , we can come across with lots of young people who want to bury their sorrows by living their life jubitantly and old people who do n't want to do anything regarding living the life in the happiest way , however we see on TV programs , though not every day , old people who dabble in sports like canoeing , jogging etc. despite their advanced years in life and lack of strenght , but on all accounts they know no limits and enjoy their life of their own accord without having to think that they are not young people and young people , at the same time , do n't want to go out owing to their lack of pushiness or extrovertness .
According to their own lights , they enjoy the life merely by staying at home and watching telly .
When on earth asked them whether they enjoy life , most of them reply the question saying no without any logical reason at all , but they solely say no under such circumstances .
No one at all really knows why they say no .
Do they have handicaps in life which impede them to live the life as their heart wish or did they have a bad traffic accident which resulted in the loss of the family members .
Of course no .
So why ?
Becuz they do n't know to get the ultimate taste of life regardless of their age .
