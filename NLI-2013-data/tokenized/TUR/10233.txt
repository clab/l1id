What I am going to explain is I tottaly agree succesful people try new thing and take risks rather than ony doing what they already know how to do well

First if you ask anybody who is walking on the street randomly , `` did you ever take a risk in your life '' He or she defintely say for this or that reason .
Because the life means take risk .
if you are succeed or not eveyone takes a risk in their life time even one time .
So it is familiar for eveyone .

Second , as see and heard if try something new something different , it makes you more succesfull , open mind and attractive .
For instance I have a sister who name is Elvan .
She has very different personalty .
For a long time like our childhood term she tried so many different activitys and jobs .
She did n't even think .
she change her jobs several times it was n't about money it was about satisfied .
She was very intellegent , clever .
She is still as she was .
One imported thing I realized she didi n't scared anything .
She did what ever she wants .
she played on the stage like an actress ang singer to huge audince .
it made her brave and she learnd how to control herself .

she went to Europe and stayed there for 2 years and studied history and pediatry .
and she learnd how survive in the life and stand by herself .
Now she is art professor in Europe and happy with 2 children and a husband .

FInally What I am telling is risks and triyind
