In todays world becoming an expert in a one topic is very important .
Acoording to my point of view , becoming expert in a specific field is always more advantegous than having broad knowledge about many academic subjects .
Specializing in one specific subject makes people more productive and to be able to solve any problem about that subject , allow people to struggle with the subject that they love most and while specializing people also gain broad knowledge about many academics .

If a people specializes in a specific area , he can focus on a simple job and can be more prodcutive on this area .
He can solve any problem about that specific job .
For example think about a person who is only working on the safety of humans in the car .
He can easily see the simple safety problems of a car and make suggestions about revising them which means he become an expert of car safety .
By working on car safety only , he will definetly find some new techniques for increasing the safety of a car .
So he became more productive .

On the other specialization allows people to do the job that they love .
If we continue with the same example , car safety expert may not like struggling with the desing of the car .
Because the point hat he like is safety of the car and the rest is not important .
Also this arguement coincides with the first arguement : the people who love their jobs become more productive .

Specialization does not mean that person cannot know anything about different subjects that he did not specialize .
While specializing in a subject , a person also learns needed background about the subject .
For instance any engineer must know calculus .
If we apply thi theis to car safety expert example , to become a car safety expert he must also know the stucture of the car .
If he does not know , his workings about car safety may conlict with the main structures of the car .

In conclusion , specialization is the main solution is all the problems .
An expert can easily solve a problem about his or her area .
Specializing makes people more productive , to be able to solve the problems about his area , allow people to struggle with the subjects that they love and gives people broad knowledge about some other subjects .
