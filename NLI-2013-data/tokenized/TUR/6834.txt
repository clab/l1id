The invention of the vehicle is one of the most significant achivement of the twentieth century .
They made the long distances shorter and provided time efficiency .
Today , cars are the most common kinds of vehicles .
Every individual might buy a car depending on their needs. t must be stated that selling rate of cars are getting increased due to the curiousity of people , the advancements on cars and the population growth of the earth .
Therefore , while there are technology improvements on cars and rapid population spead over , I disagree with the statement that In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

To begin with , the technology is reaching further in any area and the area related to cars , so I do not think that in near future there will be fewer cars in use .
The technology improves cars far beyond .
Every year we are being advertised about new things on cars such as brake systems and some protections for children .
For Example twenty five years ago there have not been an ABS ( Automatic Brake System ) system but now we have that technology .
I personally had chance to experience this sytem in our own car .
One day I was driving car and suddenly a child appeared , I quickly pushed to the brake and thans to the ABS system I did not hit to child .
Consequently I do believe that while the advancements on cars continue , it is low possibility that in near future there will be less cars in use .

In addition , the population of the world is increasing every single one of day , so I see this factor as one of the reasons not to decrease the amount of cars in use in near future .
Accordingly population growth is a problem that must be solved .
There are starving people in Afica .
So I do believe that it is not good because the resources are limited .
on the other hand , it is good for selling new cars .
Because every individual means potential customer .
So looking in this perspective while human beings are increasing and spreading all over the world , it is not possible that the amount of the cars reduce .
For example researches show that , comparing the car selling rates with the past thirty years it is consistently increasing every year .

In conclusion , in the light of the facts I stated above , I disagree that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I consider there might be people who agree with that statement .
However in my opnion my reasons are crucial and essential for me .
Therefore in my opinion in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there today .
