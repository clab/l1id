As science and technology develops , societies burden people with a huge amount of knowledge .
An important question arises for each individual , when he tries to build an amount of knowledge for himself : Is it better for him to concentrate on a subject and has a unified knowledge on that subject , or is it better for him to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I think , it is better to choose a subject and concentrate on its details .

First , during my undergraduate years , I tried take classes from as broad subjects as I can .
I took economy , physics , classical ballet , history of science and german litretare courses as my elective courses .
In this way , I have gained knowledge on each of these subjects .
But I could study each of them for at most two successive semesters .
That 's why I could gain only a little information on each of them .
Now I still have curiosity to further improve my knowledge on many of these topics , but I could not have time and energy to accomplish such a great task .

Second , the number of academic subjects increases in an incredible speed .
What is called broad today , will not even be enough tomorrow .
And the amount of knowledge that has to be gained on a topic in order to have an idea of it will also increase as time passes .
So , it is also very diffucult to develop a good and broad knowledge of various academic topics .

Last , but not the least is that , a person is required to find a job to survive .
So , he has to have adequate knowledge in one specific subject in order to be able to work on this subject .
And it will be better for him to concentrate on the topic he works on .

All in all , to have a broad knowledge of many subjects seems attractive .
However , it may be an impossible goal to achieve .
