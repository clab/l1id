Today , there is a competition in every area and the one who is succesful is gaining it .
Succes comes from different ways .
Someone gets it by trying new things and taking risks and someones do the things that are experinced before .

I thing the curiosity is sometimes good .
When you try the new thigs that noone did , you may invent someting .
For example , I am a biology student and I want to do some projects about genetics .
In this area there is a PCR machine which incereas the numbers of the gens .
If I work on the prensibe of how machine is working , I will never find new things .
Because it is allready known .
However I want to study about the Real-Time PCR which is not obviously known .
By this way , I am choosing the risky way rather than doing common things .
I might study too much but noone can say that I will not invent a new thing .
If I manage it , I woul make a big succes .

So it is sometimes required to take a risk for being succesful .
Because it is not real succes to get the others experinced .
