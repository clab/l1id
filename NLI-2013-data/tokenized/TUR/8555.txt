People always need to learn something to reach good life standarts therefore learning is the most important aspect of humanlife .
Everyone has a different point of view , about the idea of learning .
It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
These are my following theses .

Firtly , students go to school to learn something .
Teachers are teaching them to us but we do not awere what they are .
For example , when I was a student in a high school .
My teacher learned me but he did not want me to understand them .
Because of this reason , sometimes I do not understand clearly my lessons at my university .

In addition to this , to understand concepts can help us in future .
If we understand a subject , we never forget it , because we cover it all .
We know every thing about it .
For instance , we are in a math class and a teacher learns us a formula and he provides it for us .
If we understand it how we can obtain it , we always remember the formula .

On the other hand , to learn facts is neccesary fo people .
Something can not be undertand .
They have to be learned facts for students .
despite the tis idea i prefer to understand ideas and concepts

To sum up , as I said before it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is fo them to learn facts .
