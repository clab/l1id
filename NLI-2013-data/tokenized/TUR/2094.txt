Enjoy Life at Every Age

All people in a society can not be happy with the conditions or lifestyles that they are living in .
This may be based on the socio-economic conditions or spiritual reasons .
There is common belief in public that , young people are enjoying their life rather that the older peole .
This is totally incorrect , since these kind of generations can not be applied to every society .
The level of enjoying life is determined by the level fulfillment of wishes , not with the level of age .

To start with , we should look at the age groups and their lifestyles in the society .
For instance countries like Germany has a high rate of old people .
In contrast , countries like Turkey has a high level of young peole .
But , it can not be said that that wish fulfllment of young people in Turkey is greater than Germany .
The social and economic conditions may bring joy for the older people in an industrialized country .
It is not surprising that older people from those countries are travelling around the world and having fun .
It is obvious that , they are having the greatest time in their life , since they do not have any reason to worry about .
They living peacefully and with lack of stress .
In other words , they are enjoying life more than younger people .

To go one stage further , working young people should be considered .
In deveolping countries and even in industrial countries people are forced to work at early ages .
This is because of the financial requirements .
They have to prove themselve in the society and start earning money .
Otherwise , they can not stand in the against the hard rules ofthe capitalist economies .
Ailtougt there are cases that young people are enjoying their life by going to clubs , bars , or spend most of their time on entertainment but somehow they have to start working and face with the truths of the wild world .
In addition to this , most ofthe young people , who has been seen like having fun infact performing aroleplay .
The latent tru inside is toatally different .

To sum up , when all the things above are taken into consideration , the generalization in a society that expresses the level of satisfaction .
It is obvious that people are enjoying life at any age that is most suitable for them .
