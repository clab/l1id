In my opinion , young people nowadays really do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I can certainly defend this opinion relying on many experiences that I have been having since I started to feel myself like an adult .
These experiences even have led me to the thought that the young people , including the teenagers as well as the university post-graduates are becoming more and more selfish in todays life .

On the other hand , no other experienced could show to me selfishness better than the work life now does .
In my daily work life , I see how people sometimes present my studies as
