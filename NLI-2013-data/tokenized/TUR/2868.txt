People generally want to live long .
In recent times , there have been several news about people who had succeeded to live over the age of one hundred and how they did it .
Altough , the young people try to enjoy the life , the older ones are more succesful in doing so .
While the young people are dealing with the problems of the life , the older ones spend their time on more enjoyable experiences .

To begin with , the young people are generally busy with earning their lives .
In other words , they deal with their problems in business and daily lives , In additon , the young people do not have the necessary time to have the taste of life , They waste their time in many experiences which they never wanted to live .

On the other hand , the older people have a significant life experience in order to decide how they can enjoy the life .
They determine their habits which they most enjoy through participating variuos events .
For instance , last week in a party I met with an old lady who was dancing for almost forty years , Altough she was 70 years old , she was really energetic and enjoyed her time very much .

Futhermore , the older people have also a significant time to enjoy the life .
Because they are generally retired , the old people spend time more on things such as travelling , reading .

In conclusion , the older people have more chance to enjoy the taste of life rather than the young people .
The young people are hectic and busy with their vital concerns and problems .
The older people , on the contrary , have the essential time and experience to enjoy life .
