Although there are some peoples claiming importance of understanding ideas and concepts instead of learning facts , I disagree with this idea because of three reasons .
First , ideas and concepts are two intangible feature that you cannot observe or prove with a scientific method .
However , facts are real and has been in the world before us .
Moreover , you can prove them with a scientific method .
Understanding facts make you understand your environment , which may lead you to understand your and other features live .
Second , learning facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts since you can create your own ideas or concepts after leraning facts .
When you learned realities of life and things that has surrounded you , you would simply started to think about them and inferr various meanings as much as you can .
Without basing your ideas on a fact most probably your ideas would not be proven and may not become valuable .
Third , people can see importance of learning facts instead of understanding ideas and concepts because by learning only ideas and concepts one may tend to copy those ideas like he or she has owns , which is called plagerism .
Without knowing the realities and facts that are behind of an idea one can argue or defend an idea which is not her/his .
To sum up , it is more important to learning facts than understanding ideas and facts .
God may be think and than create the world , but people has seen the world and than started to think about it .
