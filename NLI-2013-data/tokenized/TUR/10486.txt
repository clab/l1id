It is important to do your job well .
However , most people can do this by working hard and doing their jobs on time so they become successful .
To create a differance from these people who are only working hard and wasting time by only obeying the comments of upper statues , what can you do ?
The thing that you can do , can be trying new things and taking risks .

First of all , trying new things shows the creavity .
That means you do not only taking the information , you also analyse it and try to give a new proposal or product .
It gives a different value to the job .
For instance , if there are two managers that one is only trys to keep the work contunious and the other one also doing his job well but he also wants to increase next year 's bugget by changing his work princible that may be increasing the money that spent for the researchs or entering an area that has not been exist yet .
Doing things that are different than what you do every day can increase your point .

Secondly , in order to be creative , you should take some risks .
The things that you do may cause a diseaster but they also give good results .
If you do not try , you can never answer this question .
Taking risks after analysing the situation do not seem horrible .
At the end , more success and money can be riched .
Therefore , when we compare the events , the results are like this : If you do not take any risk , you seem stationary that will be all right for someone .
However , if you take risk and get a good result , you show improvement
