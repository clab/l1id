Deciding whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to specialize in one specific subject is a complex issue .
On one hand , a broad general knowledge is apprexiated within society .
On the other hand , today 's global and competitive business environment requires specialization on a certain area of interest .
In my view , the advantages of specialization on a specific subject offsets the possible advantgaes of having a general knowledge of many academic subjects .

Firstly , business environment is getting more integrated and complicated day by day .
Technical developments in technology and science makes it impossible to know everything .
Since narrowing the focus of interest on one specific topic ease the intellectual improvement process .

Secondly , high competition in business and academic world motivates people to have in-depth knowledge about a certain field of interest .
Having confidence a specific topic can be considered as a prerequisite of professionalism .
Colleques value thoughts or opinions only if they trust a person 's expertise and competency about the subject .

Thirdly , specialization is a growing trend in busines life .
Especially , expert are looked for in crises situations .
Thus , the ambiguity or recessions in business cycle may be an opportunity for a specialized employee to verify his/her competency on a specific subject .
Also , specialization enhance the probability of promotion or shortens the time needed to reach a career goal .
For instance , Nissan , the Japanese car manufacturer , needed a new CEO for the inefficiency of operations causing losses in recent years .
Nissan offered the position to a Renaults employee who specialized in increasing efficiency in operations and dealing with crisis situation .
Specialization enabled the manager to take steps quickly .

Under the light of above reasons , specializing on a specific topic rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is a motivating factor behind success
