Some people believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects whereas others support to specialize in one subject .
In my opinion , notwithstanding a person should have knowledge of all related academic subjects , to specialize in one specific subject is most appropriate in compliance with this century .

We are living in a century in which it is easy for everyone to reach information about nearly anything at anytime they wish .
However this knowledge is generally too surface based .
Therefore the level of knowledge determines the difference between an academic person and non-academic person .
To specialize in one academic subject prevents a person from spreading his energy , effort and time to too many things at the same time and helps to contrate on that one subject whereas broad knowledge of many academic subjects shall only result with a lot of unnecessary , unclear and ambiguos knowledge which ends up with no contribution to academics at all .

The areas that agrees to specializaton has been increased by the development of technology .
Science has been seperated to much more branches than it was fifty years ago .
For example principles such as law and medicine encourages people to specialize in one specific subject since it is impossible to learn to a subject deeply with a surface based knowledge .

Thus , i believe that considering the easiness and quickness at reaching information , it is better to specialize in one specific subject in order to draw a difference between academic and non academic .
