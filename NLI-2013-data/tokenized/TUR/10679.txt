I do not believe that succesful people always have to try new things rather than doing what they do best .
A successful person is n't someone who is good in everything he or she tries , it is someone who is among the best in what he or she knows the best .
If the former definition was true it would mean that there are n't any successful people in life because noone can be good at everything .

Many people consider Bill Gates as a successful person .
After all , he took the risk , established Microsoft , and earned billions of dollars from it .
However , even he does n't try other things that are outside of his strenghts , such as swimming .
I am one of the best swimmers Turkey has ever seen , and I hold multiple national records .
Many people consider me as a successful person as well .
Suppose that Bill Gates was to try a swimming career , and we competed side to side in a meet .
Doubtlessly , I would have won , but would that make Bill Gates a loser , instead of a successful person ?
Would it mean that I am more successful than him ?
I think not .

Success is about what you can achieve with what you are given , not about how many risks you take .
A one year old talking baby is a successful baby .
A student with the IQ 150 getting 90 per cent on a logic test is not so successful .
Taking risks and trying new things in life broadens your vision , it does n't have anything to do with being successful .
People who do what they do best are already successful .
They do n't need to wander around for new excitements just so that other people consider him or her to be successful as well .
