The immense growth of advertising in the last decade or so , is indisputable .
The phenomenon of ` implicit learning ' , as coined by psychologists is not only exploited here , but also used jointly with techniques that influence human decision-making , making the advertised products seem more attractive than they already are .
There are several ways in which advertising could influence decision-making by presenting products in a more desirable way .

While watching TV or travelling on a train , the advertisement itself is the first thing that attracts one 's attention even before the product is on display .
We find certain scenarios more interesting and laughable or enjoyable and catchy than others .
The use of memorable and easy slogans , although how annoying they may be sometimes , are retained in memory like no other information .
The repetitions of those slogans , along with greater and repeated exposure times , is a key factor in the retention of a certain product in memory .
No matter how bad the product or the slogan might be within aesthetic guidelines , people remember !

On the other hand , the advertising community will know their audience better than anyone else , especially if the commercial becomes successful in selling the desired amount of their product .
There are certain types of ` appeal tactics ' that they use such as presenting a certain character trait belonging to the audience , followed by how the current product will help enhance or complete that character trait .
By playing on insecurities or the ` coolness factor ' , advertisements could push their way into the decision-making process .
A product could be presented as someone 's long-waited-for solution to all problems , whereas it 's someone else 's ego-booster .

The advertising world has also technologically advanced itself in order to get better access into one 's mind .
The use of multiple media sources such as TV 's , radios and newspapers give more than one dimension to advertisements themselves , hence making their products more desirable .
The TV in particular is a great stage for that purpose .
Commercials can now use greater graphic design and animations to be more interesting and attention-grabbing .
Products look more colorful and the effects are more intense .
For instance , a washing powder could be demonstrated in so many different ways such that even the molecular construction of it is conveyed .
The video presentations that follow are interesting and convincing , making the products look much better than they are .

Consequently advertising enhances product desirability in multiple ways and usurps many techniques that visual technology , in particular , offers .
This leads to better advertising skills and more convincing results in order to make products more attractive .
