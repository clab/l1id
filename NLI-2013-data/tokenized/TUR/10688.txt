How do we recognize and differentiate successful people from other people ?
What is the secret that brings someone from bottom to top ?
Is it a lightly touch given by one 's guardian angel , or a genius one is born with or merely just luck ?

I think that successful people are defined by their creating or discovering of something that others have not .
It is their ability to forsee things and have the courage and ambition to realize them .

It is not only that they do take risks what leads them to success , but it also the commitment and the sacrifices they make along the way to success .
For example this year 's Oscar winner for best director Martin SCORSESE , has comitted his life to a career of directing movies .
For many years he made films that others did not dare to make .
For many years he was nominated for the Oscar but remained empty handed .
But he did not yield and he continued to make movies with the same enthusiasm and resolution , always trying something different and new , wich finally brought him the award .
He is an example of lifelong success .
Some people might be coragous , some very lucky .
But i believe that what makes a person different and gifted than the other people is his or her resolution and the undying belief in what one 's doing .
