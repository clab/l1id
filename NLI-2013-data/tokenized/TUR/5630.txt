Humankind always need to purchase some products to reach good life standarts therefore products are very important and essential aspects of humanslife .
Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of advertisements .
Some people assume that advertisements do n't make products seem much better than they are .
In contrast , some believe that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I absolutely agree with the latter idea .
I will clarify the reasons behind my argument .

First of all , making products seem much better is directly related with the decoration of the most advertisements .
In the twenty-first century , people can adorn all the background of adverisements which can be definitely attractive for human beings .
For instance , while people watch the television , they can observe an advertisement about a food .
The producer of this advertisement can use too many people who eat that food in the advertisement , so spectators will be effected provided by people who mess up that meal .
Furthermore , people who observe this advertisement would like to taste that meal .

Secondly , the technology is totally related with the advertisements which make products seem much better .
Besides , the producer of the advertisement can even use some lights which indicates that people who watch this advertisement would like to buy the item shown by the producer as soon as possible .
For instance , advertisement creaters can only use twelve squares in an advertisement , however , if they attempt to use one more square in his advertisement , people who watch his advertisement would like to purchase the item shown by the producer .

The last but not least , some taste changes are totally related with the advertisements which make products seem much better .
In addition to this , while human beings watch the television , they can be effected by some meals shown in a channel .
For example , if people watch a soap opera in which an artist tastes a new drink , they are going to taste this product as much as possible .
Additionally , drinks can be made provided by some dangereous but tasteful aromas .
Moreoer , people tell the excellent taste of a product his friends , so it will be attractive for these people to taste this product .

In conclusion , as I said before , both the decoration of the most advertisements and the technology as well as some taste changes of products are absolutely related with the advertisements which make products seem much better than they really are .
The long and the short of it is that , the more advertisements producers will have the oppotunity to attract the people 's attention , the more people would like to buy the items shown in the advertisements .
