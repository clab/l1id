Let 's imagine and create a person who is successful in his firm who is in mid thirties .
Who is already become a CEO .
He can keep doing what he is at best or he can try to find another area to seek success .
Definetely seeking the success in another field would be a dissappointment .
But it is better for him to find out what is there ?
The unknown is always attractive and if he achieve it great for him and the humanity .

Taking the risks rather than only doing what you do is basically not fun at all .
And if you are already good at it .
What is it to lose ?
If you could not .
Come back .
The door will always be open to a man or women who is successful in a job .
This process will effect the person 's creativity .
It gives the chance that if he or could make that miracle in another situation .
It is a challenge and a contest .

For instance our CEO in a company realizes that he always wanted to be a politician since he was a kid .
He could give it a try and try to get in the elections of next year .
It is a contest , not a beuty contest .
A contest which he will find his inner strength and get to know himself finally , who knows ?
But not trying at all is the real sin of all time .
Because living with `` If 's '' is a great overwhelming thing for a human being .
In addition to that , if a person can achieve the second dream it will not be just for him or her .
It is gonna effect the others eventually and it will be a benefit for eveyone .

Consequenty , successful people definitely try to achieve more and more in new fields and jobs .
Doing what they already know how to well will not be plus for human kind .
It is a big mistake of all time .
