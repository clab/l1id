there are a lot of responsibilities on the young peoples shoulders .
they are trying to discover themselves , discover their abilities , their place in the communuty eventually draw their own path .
I believe eventhough i spend most of my time for studying , i give time to helping my community .
is it enough ?
I think this statement is both true and not true for different reasons .

it is true in a way that we do n't do our best .
we can spend a lot more time to make our city a better place .
we can take part actively in regualtions .
also we can spend more time with the elderly .
we can do this by carefully planiong our spare times .
but usually we choose to relax and be with our friends whan we have time .
one of the reasons for tghis is that nowadays people do not need each other like they did before .
almost everything in out lives can be done with professionals .
because of this people less intefere to eachpothers lifes .

on the other hand its true that we are doing what ever we can .
even studying not to be a useless person is helping to the communuty .
I do not have time but when I see my neighbours I ask them If they need something .
I am living in a flat and my neighbours are two old sisters .
I ask to them if they need anything when I am going to the market or example .
If something is going on in front of my eyes i do not close my eyes , i interfere and help .
If I am not aware what can i do about it ?

I think this sentence is both tur and not true from different views .
It is true that young people might be little bit isolated from community and because of this they are nto helping much .
but youngs , especially students are busy with studying and developing themselves and should not be balmed for not giving enough time .
it is communuties responsiblity to create the occasions for sharing and helping .
