There is a big difference between the concept of having an extra information about one academic topic in terms of having a enough information and knowledge about more than one academic subject .
According to me I prefer to have exra information about one topic instead of having knowledge about more than one topic .
Because of some reasons as such ; being happy or earning more money .

First of all ; Having an extra and extra information about a subject could make you a specialist about this area .
it is so important feature about making your job good .
If you improve yourself really extraordinarily about a specific subject , it also brings you success and powerty .
For instances ; you are a doctor and you are really successfull in your job .
Everyone could know you because of your ability to reach the goals , as a result you will be a person who is unique in your area .
Also this success could bring you happiniess and money at the same time .
You will be happy because you are doing your job good and people are admiring you about your high ability about this subject .
For example you are the doctor who will find a solution for the cancer .
Because you are just focused on the this topic and there is nothing to prevent your success .

At the same time speciality will bring you a money .
They all related things .
For instance again ; if you are a doctor and you are doing your job and everyone knows you , it means that you will have lots of patients and you will gain much more money .

on the other hand ; you are a doctor but at the same time you want to be a engineer or historian .
But unfortunatley it s not possible to become really succesfull for every department .
Because all these subject are different from each other and the human could not have enough capacity to achieve these goals at the same time .
As a consequence : you could not reach the same power and respect unlike being a specialist

consequnetly : according to me being a successful only one are instead of more than one , is a really goood and important thing .
Because it could give you extra adventages like earning more money or being happy .
