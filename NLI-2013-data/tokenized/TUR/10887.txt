People should take risks and try new things , to be successful .
Life does not gives us a list full of opportunities .
we must create our own chances .
As we look through history , we can understand that every succesful person did something new .
Scientists who discovers incredible things or artists who thinks more creative are called `` successful '' in our time .

The thing which make Kandinsky or Picasso is that , these people tried new things .
They were not afraid to create `` cubism '' or the other art technics .
The leaders such as Martin Luther King or Ataturk , battled even if it seems impossible .
Victory can not be won without taking risks .
There are so many examples to give , our own lives are also examples .
For example , at school I asked a question about a murder which had happened in my country .
It was such a question that should not be asked but everybody knows about .
It was a new thing , to ask about politics and talk about them in class .
That question created me a new job opportunity , when a modern professeur heard about it .
I learned that , we should not be afraid to ask , to search and to judge because it is the only way to win .

In every novel or in every movie , there is a hero who makes everything better for himself or others by taking risks .
Last night I watched a movie called `` Pursuit of happiness '' which depends on a real story .
In the movie there was a man who has no money and a 5 year old kid .
He turned from an unknown person to a world wide hero .

After all , I can say that , people should try new things and take risks .
It is the only way to be successful .
Otherwise , they may not have the life that they want to live .
