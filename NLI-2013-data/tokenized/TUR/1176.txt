Life is all about the preferences .
some people choose go on the was x while the other walks on the y so the perefences are depends on the way people want to walk away .
this rule is also valuable for the academic life of people .
some people prefer to study and to have knowledge about many subjects , in contrast others want to specialize in only one subject .
I do not agree with the idea that it is better to have a wide knowledge of many academic subjects than to specilize in one specific subject .

Firstly , for example , in my university eligible students are given an opportunity to study double majors and many eligible students from business administration department are stuying double in economics as well although most of them is goin to work as a manager in diffrent departments of a company .
However , in the business field employers require their employees to know pretty much about what they do in the business , for instance a marketing manager is not required to know about economics .

Second , it is waste of time because instead spending time to get knowledge about many different academic fields people should devote all their time and get depth into the most crucial subject for their future and careers .
having a little bit knowledge about many academic subjects does not add so much value on the people s career , on the other hand specializing in a single subject can help a person to be famous all around the world just because of the contrubutions s/he makes to this subject .

In conlusion , i believe that focusing on one specific subject is better than to have broad knowledgeof many academic subjects .
although i have been studying double majors , i have been trying to focus only on and paying more attention to economy classes that i have been attending in the univesity because i want to have an academic career on economics and want to be a famous economics professor all around the world .
