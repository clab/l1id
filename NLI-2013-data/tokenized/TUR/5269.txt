Today , advertisement of a certain product , almost as important as the quality attributes that the product actually has .
Although , advertisements have important effect on the perception of the quality level of a product , I do not agree that advertisements are capable of making products seem much better than they really are .

First of all , it is illegal in my country to provide misleading information or intentionaly flawed data related with a product or service on its advertisements .
Such an administration , makes it legally impossible to try to introduce a product as if it is much better than it actually is .

Another important reason why I do not agree with the statement is that the influence of advertisements last only for a certain amount of time , depending of the advertisement policy of the product .
After that amount of time passes , real quality level of a product become known to everybody , by means of various communication media .
Especially , nowadays , forums on the web sites and blogs make that period even shorter than ever .
For example , if a TV producer , advertises its product as providing the best colours , which is a very subjective claim , and it is not the case , many user of the product may reveal the truth in very short time in various web sites .

Although advertisements are important in the way that a certain product is percieved , they cannot change the real value that the community attributes to the product for a long period of time .
Their primary purpose of advertisement is to highlight the strong attributes of a certain product and cannot go beyond that .
If a producer try to advertise a product as if it is better than it actually is , it will not only be contradicting with the legal regulations , but also be sacrificing its creditability .
