I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Companies want make money form those products so they try to show better than they really are .
Companies use techonology to create a good advertisements for their products .
They use colors , images , ext .
which attract people to buy those products .

Advertisement is a important isue to sell products .
Good advertisements have advantages for products which is advertise .
In the advertisements , they try to show products much better than they really are .
They use visiual things or they use sounds to make the advertisement more colorful .
Most of the time , those things attract people to buy those products which has a increadible advertisement .
For example , my father bought a sprey for his car .
In this sprey 's advertisement , they show a red BMW car which has some spots on it is cleaned with this sprey perfectly and also in the advertisement they show some references for that sprey .
My father 's car has some same spot too and my father belive that advertisement and these references and he decided to buy that products shown in that advertisement .
This sprey did not work on my father 's car .
It caused to change colors where he used it on the car .
when he searchen why it did not work he figured out that sprey not used for all spot occured on the car , but in the advertisement , they do not warn you that what kind of spot is ok for this sprey .

Advertisements use to introduce the product to the public .
They try to show the product much better than they are .
Because of that kind of advertisements people get wrong idea about products most of the time .
By advertisements , companies want make more money so they can use all techonogical ways to attract people to buy their products , but this kind of advertisement do not make their product better but they make money for sure .
