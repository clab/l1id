The idea that , it is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts is not correct actually .
The student should be objectively tought of the realistic events ond facts .
Then try to develop some opinions of their own .
This method should be applied to their whole life in order to eliminate some problems .

First , the ideas and concepts inevitably change from one person to other .
They of course need to understand what other people think about a given topic or specific event .
However , in order not to admit one person 's opinion without any septicist point of view , student must be given some factual explanation earlier .
Unless this is provided , they cannot have their own opinion .
The words they use would be somebody other 's .
Once this becomes a habit , they start to do this for their rest of life .
Htis is something very bad because they will never gain the characteristics of an individual of the society .

Second , not providing the students the facts , sometimes may couse some more serious problems .
In many countries some student are becoming parts of the social tragedies .
This is because they are not well educated in giving more importance to the reality .
The reality is sometimes more diffirent than what it seems like .
Student should always try to investigate for the facts in order not to be pushed into such kind of problems .

For short , students should always try to get the facts in their educational and social life .
This never means that ideas and concepts are not important .
They have to arise their own ideas with the help of the facts and then try to criticise other 's opinion .
They should later decide to accept them or not .
