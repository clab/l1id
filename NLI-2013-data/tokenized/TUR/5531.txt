Consumer goods is a big sector in today 's markets .
There has been a lot of competition among numerous firms in the stage of persuading customers to consume products of firms .
As an effective strategy , most corporations make use of advertising to attract customers ' attention .
Though attention span of cutomers is limited since many advertising techniques are used ranging from realistic ones to unrealistic ones .
It is obvious and necessary that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are because this is a highly competitive business , and attracting attention of people on regular products is difficult goal to manage .

It not our issue to argue that population growth in the world or , maybe , globalization caused the markets to be overcrowded .
There is this fact lying on the floor and causing firms to compete harshly in an environment where the fittest survive .
Small firms or the firms that are unable to cope with the competitive environment are omitted or forced to leave the arena .
The firms survived were not necessarily the big ones but the clever ones to adopt strategies to sell their products such as pampering the qualities of a product in the ads .
This method has proven its efficiency since we observe the products in advertisements lacking realistic representations .

In addition to competitiveness of the industry , it is also hard to come up with modifications that would differentiate the product from the competitor products .
Not only existing technology of the corporation may not permit such a modification , but also the outstanding budget may restrain the company .
In those situations , the most cost effective strategy is to use advertising that would put a magnifying glass on customers ' eyes .
Playing with the colors , size , shape would help the customer to realize the product that is on the market .
Throughout their monotonous lives people neglect many items that is shown to them .
By doing so , advertisers are taking advantage of cognitive psychology and even widen the attention span of customers .
Given the conditions such as lacking technology and inefficient budget , in addition to highly competitive market , it would be fair to use such a hint which would compensate for the conditions .

In conclusion , most advertisements most of whom managed to survive , make products less realistic which is an efficient and common method followed in advertising sector .
By doing so ' they keep on with the market and increase the porfolio of their customers which I would advise to every other entity in the market .
