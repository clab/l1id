Unfortunately i am not totally agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .

It is for sure that success encourage people to discover or invent new things but if there is risk i am not sure that every people would be courage enough .
After knowing how to succeed feels some people would like to live with it instead of trying new things and have risk to fail on it .

It is obvious that if you can not take risk you can not success .
But risk is something you can take mostly when there is nothing you can use .
For instance think about a director who had won Oscar Prize .
Now he did the best at his work and now people all over the world know him and expects a lot from him .
The hardest movie he can make is his next movie .
Since he already is known as best and he has to be the best for rest of his live .
But what if he wants to direct another kind of movie than he always do ?
And what if he fails ?
You think he can be that courage to risk his famous for just to do his ambition .
I think not many people would do that ...

But on the other hand if people keeps doing same thing then who going to discover or invent or try new things ?
Only the young people or the people who never had got awarded yet ?
But what about experience then ?
Experience is important to success something .

To put it in a nutshell i would like all successful people try other things than they had already done .
That is how creativeness can improve i think .
But also i dont believe most people can take risk .
