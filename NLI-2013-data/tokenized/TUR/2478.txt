The first point I would like to say is that I totally agree with this statement .
Because young people have young views towards to life .
They are positive , joyfull , active persons than the older one .
They can listen and learn things better , their mental have a big capacity to gain the information coming from the outside .
On the other hand , older people has specisific views towards to life .
They get tired of work and external factors .
They wait to retraite and stay at home .
And their mental is full of lots of things .
They do n't want to think necessary things anymore .
So young people enjoy life more than older people .

Enjoying life has different aspects that can differentiate from person to person .
When a person has born , he or she does n't know exactly what is waiting for them .
There are lot of steps waiting for them to take to be succesfull for the rest of their life .
For instance ; when you finish elementary school , college is waiting for you then university moreover starting to work .
First aspect is that when you are young , you can enjoy life better .
You go to cinema , movies with your friends .
You can go outside to eat at a restaurant or go to disco to have a great birthday party with your friends .
T he second aspect is at early ages , you can learn lots of things from business and social life .
Your intelligence brings you lots of success to maintain your life happiness .
Companies search for young people to apply to the positions .
You can find suitable jobs for your skills .
You can earn lots of money .

Third aspect which is the most important one is that young people has a excellent freedom of expression and happy looking towars to life which is very important in our society .
People should protect their rights and defense themselves against situations .
They must have self confidence to be more successfull and to enjoy the life .
On the other hand , older people experience everything through out their life .
They just want to stay at home , look out of the window to see the snow .
They do n't want to enjoy the life because they have experienced it before .
Maybe they have travel all over the world , they have gone to cinema millions of time .
So they choose to enjoy a silent life .

As a result , young people enjoy life more than other people by making activities with their friends , by working hard and earning money and by looking happy to the life .
I agree with this statement because I am young and I am joyfull .
This view reflects my life in a postive way .
