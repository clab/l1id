In my opinion , most advertiments make products seem much better than they really are .
Most advertiments establish for endustrial competion between thousands different companies .
Their competions are fair for their realm but they dont have to be honest for their work .

On the one hand , today we are living in techonological world , using satallate and web , watching tv , movies and reading news .
Always we see advertisements every where for instance , on bus , on wall , on building .
I belive they dont tell truth every time because they dont need it .
Most advertiments company just consider an amount of their sales .
They dont care people who buy their products .

On the other hand , when I watch tv and see some products which I know so well because I am used to it before .
I am just annoying these companies .
Indeed , they are liar therefore I cant trust on them .

My point of view is the most important thing related to especially food advertisements .
Let me give you a picture about fast food companies in United States .
For example , Mc Donalds is one of them , this company is common fast food place worldwide .
Today , we have to endovour and to reveal the most significant problem about obesite in this country and developement countries .
Every day and every where we are facing and watching all this fast food advertiments and feeding ourself and our children in this place .
We dont know really what we are eating as well .
Besides , they could be dangerous for our health , they could be deadly for us .
I watched a video about Mc .
Donalds and I saw that they are killing us .
In this video ther is a man who ate hamburger and fried potatose every day and he got very serious health conditions after thirty days .
He had to give up eating Mc Donalds foods .

There is no doubth about most advertisements dont give reality for their produc
