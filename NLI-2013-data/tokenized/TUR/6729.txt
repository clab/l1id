Transportation is a very importnat factor in today 's global life .
As the number of people increases on the earth , the requirement for different transportation ways increases as well .
One of the very important means of transportation are cars .
I will argue opposed to the statement that , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

Firstly , the car industry is a very old industry , which is mainly developed through the last century .
The improvements in the area are still very exciting , therefore the idea of earing higher and higher amount of money triggers more and more people to spend their money for constructing a bussiness on cars .
As a result , car industry after twenty years will be greater and more important than today .

Moreover , cars are not attractive only for their being of a means of transportation .
There exists a great number of funs , who can pay millions of dollars for old cars and special cars such as the last models of Ferrarri .
An other example is , the famous Formula race , which helps to trigger a worldwide increase number of funs for using and buying cars .

On the other hand , people choose to use their own cars rather than using means of public transport such as buses and metro , because they do not offer them a comfortable travel , which they can have in their private cars .
In turn , the number of private cars increases in correlation with the increasing capacity for car industry , since everyday peolpe are introduced to this industry as customers .

In conclusion , I believe that , in twenty years there will be more cars in use than there are today , due to the continuously improving car industry , which is in correlation with increasing number of funs of car races , collectors and customers .
