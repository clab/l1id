Today , governments try to reduce the use of personal cars .
It is easy to support this observation by following the investments made for both new public transportation methods and recent developments in technology .
There are various reasons for trying to reduce the use of personal cars .
The reduction in power resources in the future , air pollution and traffic are the main reasons to try to reduce the use of cars .

Recent studies show that , in thirty years , the resources of fuel oil will finish .
Since fuel oil is an important source that is used in many other important industries , the price of fuel oil will dramatically increase over time .
This will automatically make people think about the alternatives such as public transportation , bikes or any other cheap device .

The use of cars increased very much in the last twenty years .
One of the biggest disadvantage of this increase was the air pollution .
Scientists believe that , the Ozone layer is seriously damaged with the increase of car usage .
Since this gives serious harm to nature , governments will need to take decisions to reduce the use of cars in the future .

Today most of the big cities have a traffic problem .
It is easy to observe the effect of increase of car usage on the traffic .
Governments try to solve traffic problem with several alternatives .
The most willing alternative is to increase the use of public transportation .
Nowadays , extra taxes are required from personal car owners in order to reduce the use of personal cars .

In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Lack of power resources in the future , air pollution and traffic are main reasons why there will be fewer cars in use in the future .
