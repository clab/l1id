I agree with this statement .
For my opinion there are many reasons why this so .
First for a human it is easier to understand ways how things works .
After the human understand an specific function it is easy for him to make referation to the facts and he can visualize the facts with the specific concept .
He can put the specific fact to there where it is needed .
The facts can allways recalled from any book which is in the near .
The book is then a tool for the student to create specific works for the class .
It can be used to establish an essay or any other works that is typically for an academic enviroment .
The tool can help the student to understand the concept in a specific area .
For example my personal experience show me that if you understand the concept to writing a computer programm , then you can switch to other programming language .
To the programming language that they can solve the specific problem .
You only need time to keep in mind which function is typically in this programming language .
But you dont spend too much time to learn all the function that is used in this Programming language .
When you started
