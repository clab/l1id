Advertisements are the most important and most effective tolls in order to present a new product and to make that product to be desired by customers .
I absolutely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better that they are .

It is not certain that when first advertisement emerged and and how it was .
But , it is a fact that , advertising affected the life of people not only the producers but also the customers .
Today beyond the developing technology , teh producers can present their products to whole world .
This is done by satellite televisions , news papers , or internet .
As the producers konw that their products can be followed by all of the peole in teh world , they try to pull attention of those peoples with different and strange types of advertisements .
For instance , one of the worldwide known trade marks use football players who are very famous all over the world .
By this way , the owner like to give a message to the people such that : `` Do you see , most famous sport men use my product , so why you do not ? ''
.
Even though that product is not very good really , the people - due to that advertisement - believe that product is the best .

An assumption may make the idea more clear .
Assuming that there is a new kind of drink and no one knowns anything about it , the producer absolutely knows that the drink is not as good as other existing drinks in the market .
But s/he designs a very effective and impressive advertisement .
What will be the possible affect of this advertisement ?
When the people ( potential customers ) see that advertisement , they will think that the drink must be very good and delicious .
So they will be forced unconciously to buy that drink and - at least - try it .
This tendency to buy that product is totally due to the effect of the advertisement .

All in all , advertising is a very wide area in the world due to all of the people can know about the product very easily .
Not all but some advertisements are designed in order to make people pay attention to the product , because the people who present the advertisement know that pulling attention of the customers is the first step of forcing them to buy the products .
Therefore , most of the advertisements , today , are just tools to show products much more better than they really are .
