I agree with the statement which is given , before .
This means young people enjoy life more than older people .
Because the psychology of youth is based on senses , feelings .
It doesn ' t look over incidents , falls with completely rational and logical eye .
If young people would weight with rational eye what they experiences have , they couldn not enjoy life so good more than older people .
Because they would see and understand realities of life , which are not so enjoyable .

Older people can look over realities of life with rational eye .
Because they have more experiences than younger people , and choose the rational way .
Their senses and feelings are not stronger their youths .

We can see these situations at the oldest people in the most extreme fall .
Because they are closer to the door of the grab than others .
And nothing can make them enjoy as before .

Opposing that sometimes we can meet young people which behave older than theirselves .
This means , as exceptional , they move more rational , more logical and serious than their environments .
Therefore , they think future and behave according to future .
They are little crazier but this does n't affect their lives to the negative route .
Hence , they can catch the succes .
