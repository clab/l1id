Throughout our education life , we have been subjects of different kinds of teaching styles .
Some teachers teach through making the students learn the facts , while others try to make students understand the rationale behind the fact .
Also \ , no matter what the teaching style of the instructor is , some students focus on understanding the idea while others prefer to learn the facts .
In my opinion , a student should first try to understand the ideas and concepts rather than learning the facts , because ideas help students build a vision , they are more implementable and they are easier to keep in mind .

First of all , when a student understands a new concept , it adds to that individuals ' vision .
Every concept or idea you understand makes you a person with a larger view of life .
It will help you see daily events see in a different way .
However , if you only learn the facts , they will be minor memories in your brain ; they wo n't help you built your personal experience quota .
For example , when i learned about some concepts of behavior in my ` organizational behavior ' class , my perspective of looking to my everyday relations have changed enormously .

Second , once an individual understands a concept or an idea , that will be implementable to every situation she/he will face in the future .
While that individual is trying to make a decision on something , that concept will automatically come to his/her mind thus helping with the solution .
For example , at enginnering college , I learned the concept of ` muda ' which is a Japon word for loss .
If our professor only taught it by a specific fact saying that you should eliminate any extra loss in a specific machine , then that would be too narrow .
However , she taught us the concep so I could implement it to my light at home .
Forgetting your light turned on while you are not in the room casus muda wh'ch is a loss that can be eliminated .

Lastly , concepts and ideas that are understood well are easier to keep in mind whereas specific facts memorized are harder to remember after a certain period of time .
I remember reading in amn article that you forget 75 % of the things you memorize in the first 24 hours and 90 % percent in the second day .
Therefore , the facts learned wo n't be with you for a long time ; however , the ideas that you managed to understand will stay with you for a lifetime .

As a conclusion , I definitely agree with the statement suggesting that students ' understanding of ideas is more crucial than their learning of facts .
Students should focus on understanding the concepts because the ideas will be more permanent , they will be more applicable and they will help them create better views of life .
