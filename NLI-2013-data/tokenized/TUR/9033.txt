KNOWING OR UNDERSTANDING

What makes a human being different and superior than other creatures of the universe is its ability to think , understand and make the right decision under every circumstances .
A human does not come to the world with simple instincts only but also with its magic ability of understanding .
This simple fact is the key point and probably the self-sufficent answer of the question .

Although everybody has the ability to understand , some people lose it gradually in their life .
The main problem of those people is their bad habit of learning the facts without understanding the reasons behind them .
In this way , they are limiting theirselves to the information they get , nothing more .

On the other hand , when we look at the intelligent and successful people , we see that they do try to understand the ideas , concepts mechanism hidden under the facts which makes them successful .
Doing so ; they are getting able to understand more with every new idea they perceive .
Besides acquiring the required information , they learn much more .

To sum up , it 's more important for students and every person to understand the reasons than learning the fact in order to be successful in life .
