While some people may think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , I think specializing in one specific subject is better , because when you specialize in one specific subject , you could have more opportunities to be a real expert on that subject .

First of all , i 'm one of the believers of the famous quote : `` Time is money . ''
It could be advisable to use time efficiently during our life because time is valuable .
As far as i 'm concerned , we should use time specializing in one specific subject .
In that way , we can have great knowledge about that subject , and that means we could have the chance to be an expert about that subject .
I do n't blame the people who has many variable interests , but it is important to see the differences between having many interests and specializing in one specific subject .
For example , one of my friends has a great interest in music and i see him every year trying to learn how to play a different instrument .
In my opinion , it is clear that there is a bare chance for him to become a good , professional musician .

Secondly , having broad knowledge of many academic subjects keeps me away from the feeling of satisfaction .
In other words , this kind of knowledge is not substantial for me .
When we consider successful people in the world , we can obviously see that a big percentage of them chose the way to specialize in one specific subject .
As a result , they become people who they are today .

Finally , taking all the factors into consideration , we may safely reach the conclusion that the advantages of specializing in one specific subject outweigh those of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects because when we specialize in one specific subject , we have the opportunity to be an expert on that subject and we can be satisfied and successful .
