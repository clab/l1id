i think it depends on people but i disagree that understanding ideas and concepts more importand for student than learing facts .

i belived that there are some important points why to learn facts .
People encourage to learn facts because of interested in really and to learn easily factinal information .
For instance i would like to learn which tempertures does water boil or how electrity comes our home and how dishwasher does work ?
Moreover , i would like to learn basic maths to help my daily work .
Nowadays , young jenerations are very knowledge for evrything even children .
They watch tv , read newspaper and resarch what happening in the world in spite of ideas or cancepts .

In sort of information is teached people different way .
some student maybe can learn easly idaes and concepts rather than learning facts .
In my opinion which kind of necessary information we need , we can learn guickly .
So learning facts are important for me and i prefer to learn it .
