If you had asked me this question five years ago , I would have said , that there would be a sharp increase in number of cars during the twenty years time .
Since , I was not aware of the fact that cars have plenty of negative influences to the environment that we have been living .
In addition to that , petroleum prices are increasing extremely sharply .
Nevertheless , I , now , absolutely claim that the amount of cars will drop significantly in twenty years time , may be shorter .
Therefore , I strictly say that there will be less automobiles in the coming future .

The reason that I was thinking that the number of cars would increase was my desire to the car technology and the possibility of a reduction in prices .
I was believing that car designs were wonderful and everybody was aware of this fact .
Thus , each and every person would buy cars as much as they can .
Another reason for this belief is that , since the brands are getting larger and rivalry is increasing , the prices of the cars would fall .
I did not come to a conclusion about the prices opf the cars .
They are decreasing as the days pass by .
However , I had seen that the automobile desire was only my characteristic .
Most of the people istead of buying cars are now investing on other properties , such as flats or cooperatives .

Why I am now thinking in this way , that the number of cars will decay , is now I am aware of the effects of cars to the envoropnment .
Furthermore a considerable number of people are also agreeing with me and they are all aware of this damaging effects .
Therefore , most of the people will quit using cars , at least they will use public transportation , which is a good alternative for private car usage .
Since most of the people will be carried just by one bus or other sort of transportation , it will be more clean .
Another reason for thinking in this way is actually a lesser crucial point that compared to the one mentioned above , which is the high prices of the oil used for cars .
After the sharp rise in 2004 , the car usage decreased enormously .
Especially in less developed countries , drivers quit using the privae cars .
It seems that the current prices will not vary during the coming future .
Hence , this will influence the number of cars used on roads .

If we take all of the factors mentioned above into consideration after a detailed observation of each point , we can come to a conclusion that , because of negative effects of the cars to environment and high gas prices , the usage of the cars will drop .
For the following twenty years time , I am not expecting a sharp fall but degree bu degree .
If the usage of the public transportation is enhanced and if the people are warned and educated due to the side effects of cars to the environment , this fall may be faster to a certain degree .
