Humans tend to blame things , they often look for things that they can not see , but that does not help that much sometimes .
`` Advertisements make products seem much better than really are. '' is a product of this action .
It is also a popular but wrong opinion .

First of all , if it is true why do not we act against it .
If it is so then it is a lie or maybe a trap .
Well if they sell you a broken item what if the difference .
There is no difference they sell you a different item than the one in the advertisement , therefore they can get sued .

Secondly , there is no point in fake advertising .
If they sell a product that way they lose their credibility and that is way to bad .
For example , a company sold 100000 units of a product with some fake advertisement , but by the time their next product the public get clever and even if it is a great product they will not buy it and that is way more important than 100000 sales of the previous item .

Finally , if they can sell stuff that way why do they collect and replace their faulty product .
It is like selling two items with half-price .
For example , two years ago Sony sold their new slim Playstations with faulty adaptors but after they realized their mistake they changed every adaptor with the new ones .
They did that because credibility matters and fake advertisements kill credibility .

As a result all of that we can say advertisements do not show the products better than they really are because companies are afraid of losing credibility and getting sued .
