In universities , the students study lots of thing related with their subject .
However , they can not make relation between their subjects and the other subjects .
In my opinion , we have to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , because we can make a relation between our subject and the other subjects and we can think more widely .

First of all , students should know have knowledge about the many subjects because they can find something from the the other subject related with their subject .
The other subject can give us an idea about our subject because they may have a relation .
For instance , today , the researchers work on projects which contain lost of subjects because they think that they can only find the result of the problems from the relationship of the subjects , so they want to learn lots of things about the other subjects .
As a result , the students should know nroad knowledge ofm any acedemic subjects to solve the problems on their projects .

Secondly , many academic subjects gain us to think more widely .
if we have knowledge about the other subjects we can analyze the problems more easily because we can search more subjects to solve the problem .
For instance , although my teacher is a professor , he is still study lots of thing because he think that he can think more widely if he know lots of thing about the other subjects , so he can easily find the solution if they are related with his problem , as a result , broad knowledge of many academic subjects make us to see the solution more easily .
In conclusion , we can think frem the other sides and make a relation with the problem .
as a result , p
