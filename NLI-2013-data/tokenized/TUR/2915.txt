Are you young ?
you have to know the importace of it .
when you are old , you do not some activities and you have a lot of diseases .
you have to think about their children .
you have many responsibilities .
I agree that young people enjoy life more than older people , because you do not have any worry and you have much energy .

first of all , when you are young , you should enjoy , due to the fact that you have more energy .
young people have more energic than the oldest .
for this reason , they can many activities .
for example ; they can go skiing , they can climbing the moontain .
these activities may make the lives of people enjoyable .

secondly , young people enjoy life more than older people do , because they have no worries .
old people worry about their futures .
this may not give a permission them to live happly .
what is more ; the oldest have fears of dying , because their ages are very high .
for these reasons ; they enjony life less than yhe youngest .

to sum up , I agree this issue , because young people do not worry about future and dying and they are energitic .
If you are either young or old , you should make an effort to live happly .
