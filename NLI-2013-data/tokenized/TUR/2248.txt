Every people wants to get as much enjoyment as he can get from his life .
One of the main factors that affects the level of this enjoyment is the age of the person .
I think young people enjoy life more than older ones since there are more facilities for them and they are less directly concerned with many problems that come with age level .

To begin with , there are many entertainment facilities in today 's world for young people such as night clubs , sports clubs , dance clubs and so on .
The primary reason behind this fact is the marketers ' concern about the young people that they are more energetic and more attracted for entertainment products and services .

Secondly , young people tend to be more individualistic .
They have a tendency to think of themselves rather than their families .
They go to parties , enjoy their college educations etc .
They have little concern for money , since their parents pay for their expenses or they are granted scholarships .
On the other hand when people becomes older , several different concerns arise .
Older people should think of the financial situation of the family members , education of their siblings , housing expenses and surviving after retirement .

Some people may argue that age does not matter in terms of enjoying life by claiming there are many opportunities suitable for every age group .
Although I agree to this claim to a certain extent , I think there are some physiological and psychological constraints that prevent them from doing what they want to do .
Illnesses and being tired of life can be given as an example .

To sum up , I can easily say that young people 's having much more facilities for entertainment and being confronted with less problems make them enjoy their lives more .
