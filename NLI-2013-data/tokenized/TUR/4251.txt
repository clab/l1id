Especially during the last few decades , there has been a considerable decrease in community work done by young people .
This results from many factors including the way community is seen , the moral values that changed over the years , and problems of young people of today , which prevent them from trying to become beneficial and effective members of the society .

In these modern times , individualism has become the essential motive that challanged all of humanity 's life style .
A modern person , man or woman , is completely independent from any binding social or communial groups , and although he/she might be involved with different levels of society , in the end , every man is for himself and we are not members of a group or society , but merely individuals who participate in certain events from time to time .
This way of life and thinking has caused young people to focus their energy to things that will be more beneficial for themselves , rather than their community .
They do not feel being a part of a community which can be enriched by their support , because they never see the existance of such a community which values all of its members .

Related to the change in the concept of community , moral values have also changed over time .
Chivalry is considered a thing of the middle ages , and selflessness is associated with being gullable .
Competition has been valued so much , being honorable , generous and giving has left its place to using any means leading to success as long as it is legitimate , and sometimes even challenging the law , by working around it , is seen as normal and wise .
In such an environment , expecting community work from young people which will gain them nothing , would be too optimistic .

Last of all , young people have lost their belief in rightiousness .
Current democracy does not empower its citizens , and bureucrocy discourages them .
With all the wars and ill-doings gong on in this world , young people feel lost and insufficient .
For someone to take any kind of action , he has to feel that he can make a difference , but our young people today lack the belief and confidence that their efforts can do any good to this world .
