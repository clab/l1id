The dominating idea of the 20th century was to have a wide range of knowledge about a lot f subject areas .
However , within the new century or with the rising of the automation age we confront with complex machinery which needs its own specialists to operate .
When we think of in this sense we see that for the new century it is better to have specialists rather than people who knows a lot about a wide range of subjects .
It is the same also in the case of an individual studies .

The reason why I claim this is that the the science of physics have subjected us to many striking discveries such as the particle quark which is smaller than an electron and we have seen the implications of this discovery in the field of technology .
We had machinery which operates with nano technology which is the discovery of the century .
This discovery have fund its reflection in a wide range of the areas from health to consrtruction .
The crucial thing about this technology is that it needs highly qualified professionels who are parts of a team working on the various different sections of the same project .

These professionals in question spend their time merely on the area of their interest and this enables them to focus on the whole aspects of the phenomenon that they are concerned .
In this case the effort is flew into one direction and consequently more quick and effective results are taken from the experiments or the researches .
The notion of specialize in one specific subject enables resarch groups to get better results in the sense that every member of the team has his or her own space to do the necessary search on his or her topic and can arrange time without having any distraction or worry of completing various tasks in order to reach a result .

To sum up , in my opinion for quick development and effective results team work and to specialize in one topic is necessary .
By dividing the subject among a group or basically by canalizeing oneself into one spacific topic success is more guaranteed .
