`` Exploring by yourself or leading by someone ? ''
It is a personal choice depends on a person 's character and goals because of this people make different decisions to explore or learn somewhere .
Despite leading by a tour guide , I prefer to explore places and prepare my own travel guide by myself because it costs less money and I might explore more things .

Getting a service is always expensive than doing these things by yourselves so making your own travel guide is cheaper .
First of all , you can save money if you travel by yourselves because you decide what you are going to do on travel and you do n't have to pay for this decision .
Tour guides provide information about travel and places where you want to go but you can find those information spending a littile bit time on internet .
Also , tour guides generally guide you to some places where they can get more money for accomodation or shopping so they might cost more than they really are .
Finally , tour guides always deceive you to spend more money but if you travel by yourselves you could control yourselves to spend your money .
For example , tour guides give some options which are really look like fascinating but not important such as staying at a five star hotel it is really essantial for travel ?

Tour guides just show places where are on their list and this list generally limited .
First of all , they lead tour groups to only basic places so if you are in a tour group you might miss wonderful other places .
For example , when i first came to chicago , i have paid money to a tour guide to show me real Chicago but i just saw Millenium park and Sears .
After a while i discover other wonderful places in Chicago where are Rush St. Hancock Tower .
As they said `` everthing is in details '' so people could find a lots of detail places if they search for their travels .

A lots of people prefer a tour guide to travel in a group , however , I prefer to explore places by myself and be my own tour guide because i can save money and i can see more places .
