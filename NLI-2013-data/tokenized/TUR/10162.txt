Everyone wants to be successfull .
However cooking a pitza is not a success .
The question is ` which accomplishment is a success ?
` .
An accomplishment is called success when it is something rare .
Success comes from trying and working for new , risky and higher level accomplishments .

First of all , a successfull person can not be the model of an old successfull person .
For example an architect builds an extra-ordinary building and create a new approach which is second to none in his area .
An other architect reads many articles about the above mentioned approach and builds a new building with the same style , or approach .
Which one would you like to call successfull ?
Of course the first one .

Secondly , accomplishing something which is already accomplished by someone else is not success .
Take the risk and try something harder !
As an example , one racer finishes the race in 5 minutes .
If the other one want to be successfull then he should risk his life and drive faster .
Moreover , in pc games the player is only successfull when he or she reaches the top score , which means he or she is better than the last player .

In contrast , some lazy people argues that doing the thing they know the best is the success .
I call them robots .
Do you see any difference ?
Robots are doing what they can do the best .
They are of course successfull in being a robot , however not a successfull human .

All in all , in my opinion there is a big difference between success and accomplishment .
Success is the new , risky and top level accomplishment .
Only doing what you already know how to do is next to nothing .
