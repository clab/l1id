I agree with the statement that it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
First of all students give importance to get high grades from the exams .
On the exams students are generally questioned from the ideas and concepts which are thought at the classroom .
In order to get high grades they are forced to understand ideas and concepts very well .

The facts of the life are different than the classroom .
In the classroom students do n't have the chance of practice .
In other words they are faced with only theory .
Also they have an expectation that they will see the facts after graduating from the school .
According to them there are two time periods : at the school and after the school .

I think we must not escape from the facts during school period .
