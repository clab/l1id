Everyone can enjoy life whatever the situation is , how old they are and how much money they got .
The important thing is that if a person is aware of enjoying time is an essential of his/her life .
In my opinion , I strongly believe that the young people enjoy their life more than older people do .
I am going to explain my reasons of this belief in the next sections .

Firstly , young people are more open to new ideas and mostly they are willing to try new things that they did not experience before .
Trying new things like paragliding , a game , swimming in cold water make someone 's life more excieted .
Having fresh bodies may also help to exhibit these new offers and wishes .
Since the action is more easy event in the youngness .

Secondly , young people have not so much responsibilities like paying house credit , buying newer car or going to more expensive places for dinner .
Thus , they can take more risks than normally older people do .
Then they can move more easly then older people do since they have not settled down totally .
Adventuring new places also gives pleasure to everyone .
A cheap trip to North America is an opportunity for young people while an older person would asks which hotel to stay , how long vacation is need .

Lastly , young people do not have proper job , and they have plenty much time for doing something else .
Assume that , I have plenty time to spend on my own .
I would like to do my staff that I have already delayed but after finishing them I probablt will be get bored and think about what to do else .
This brain storming gives new ideas to try .
But this needs time to do and all other staff should be completed before it .

Despite of having enough money and being mature enough , I believe that young people enjoy their life more than older one do in the way of I tried to explain above .
