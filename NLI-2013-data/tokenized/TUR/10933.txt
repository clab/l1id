Rich people or successsful people always try new things not because they are not happy or so just beacuse they want more and they think they can make more oir they need more for there future .

People in these days take a lot of risk to make more money or have a much more succesful life .
Still when they are making good money and have a succesful job they try new things .
Things that they have n't done before but thing that they think will give them more success in life .

I think people do this for three reason .
If they are not happy with there standarts of life or if they are so greedy that they just want more and more and they will never stop wanting or if they will not continue successfully in this buisnees for the rest of their lifes .
In our case if you are successful that means you do have a life that is the way you want it to be .
Then there is two possible situations you may not be succesful in the future with your current business .
Like having a clothes brand .
In these days there are companies like gucci , prada or more casual companies like polo ralph lauren or abercombie are the top brands but in these buisnesses it is so hard to continue as a good company for such long time .
So people try new thing they jump into new buisness or make new agreement like pair with a cell phone company and produce phone that has the name of a clothes brand , because one day his clothes may not start to sell and a company like prada or gucci may be out of buisnees so thy have to try stuuf that are risky but still give them the oppurtunity to continue successfully in there buisnesses .

In other hand you may be the richest men and you may never worry what will a be tomorrow .
Like Bill Gates he is the richest men alive and he wakes up twelve million dollars richer every day but still he goes in to new buisnnesses like having a console `` xbox '' this is all greed .
Or in other hand I 'm not gonna give name but think of man that makes his money from food buisnees .
He is so greedy that he tries something way out of his league .
getting into arcitecture buisnesses and because he has the money he takes the risk but at the end he still makes money and the risk he takes wo n't hurt him or his company if he does not succesed in this buisness .

In life succesful people mostly try new stuff not because they need money or more power they do it for the greed .
Success does bring greed in to poeple and they allways want to be in top the most succesful one .
