THE OLDER THE PEOPLE , THE MORE ENJOYABLE THE LIFE
Some people believe that young people have a lot more to do with life than older people whereas some others think that it is the opposite .
I guess as a young person I am in that second group thinking that older people enjoy life better than we young people do for a number of reasons like having more free time , more consciousness about the value of the time concept and having better financial conditions .

People are born , grow a little and start school in a usual life cycle .
After that beginning , they usually start working immediately after school and can not find the enough time for an enjoyable life .
Unfortunately , they find this time to live more enjoyably only after years and years , at the time they became old people .
Old people are usually retired people who have more spare time to live as they want .

In addition to that , old people usually are wiser than the young people and as a consequence of their experinces and advanced opinions about the life , they know the importance of time concept and how valuable an effective time usage is .
I believe that this would help them in thinking twice and having a more enjoyable life in a better-managed time period than young people can do .

Finally , since old people are usually retired people and have money from their pension funds or their own savings from their investments done in the previous years they would have a bigger chance the enjoy the life in that old age .
At that point , I know that people not necessarily have a lot of money to live more enjoyably but money has a considerable effect on well being and more money means more opportunities to evaluate to have fun or to enjoyment in life .

To sum up , all these reasons make me believe that old people have more opportunities to live their lives more enjoyably than younger people can achieve .
More free time , more consciousness about time management and an amount of money that can easily spend on better opportunities of an enjoyable life rather than only survival would be good assets for a better taste in life .
