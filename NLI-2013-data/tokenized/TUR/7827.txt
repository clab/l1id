I do not agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
There are many disadvantages to follow the tour guide .
Even getting a tour guide can be harmful and dangerous for tourists .

First of all , when you follow the tour guide to see around the city which you want to see and travel , you only can see places in which the tour guide shows you and your group .
You can not find out around of city .
Everytime there are some limitations which are made by the tour guide .
For example , you want to see other side of city , but there is a certain travel program which includes to see certain place in the city .
You have to follow the travel program .

Second of all , People who are from that city can understand that you are tourist .
This sutation has some dangeours point .
They can cheat on you or sell kind of present things to you much more expensive .
For example , when you go to a store for shopping , if they understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist they can try to sell many things much more expensive , but if you travel alone and you can speak the language of that country which you want to see they can not understand that you are a foreigner or a tourist .
So people who are from that country or that city can sell things to you in original price .

Third of all , is traveling with groups not expensive activity but also it is a so dangerous .
There are many terrorits people or groups who want to kidnapp to tourists and foreigner people to come true their bad purposes .
Those kind of people can realize that you are a tourist , because you are travelling with the group and following the tour guide .
They can kidnapp you and kill you .
Furthermore they can use you for their purposes .
That situtaion happenned the tourists many times .
Those people killed the tourist or got money from the tourist of family .

In above , there are many advantages about traveling alone and following the tour guide .
The quite proverb says that `` It does not matter whatever travelling alone and following tour guide cost , people can listen their heart and make their ways for travelling . ''
That 's why we have to travel alone .
