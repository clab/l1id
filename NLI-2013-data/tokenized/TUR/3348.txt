Today young people give enough time to helping their communities .
Young people , thus , the new generation between twelve and thirty years old do their best to help their communities ; for instance , they organize several activities together : they visit old people on holidays , and bring them gifts and food .
They give free private lessons to small children in their communities .
They get involved in some youth clubs , and call writers , scientists , artists , musicians , or other people who have an impact on the society , to give a lecture in order to exchange some ideas with them .

Besides , at home they help their parents or other family members : they prepare the table , clean the house , wash the dishes ...
If a family member is ill , they visit this person .
By working part-time , they also gather money for the poor in their community .
They do all of these activities , as they study and work .
Sometimes they work part-time , because they want to contribute to the family budget .
They buy their needs with the money they earned .
With the rest of this money , they help the poor in their communities .

However , many young students have to study hard to pass their extremely difficult exams , and get high marks .
When they have exams , they may sit just concentrared on these exams , on reviewing the material that was presented them in class , or they may spend their time reading several scientific articles , or books .
They study also for their communities , as they have to be distinguished members of the society in which they live .
They study to learn and to help their communities .
In their free time , of course , they assist the work of the older members of their communities ; for example , think about a twenty year old girl , studying biology : she studies when she has exams , papers to write , or has to make a class presentation ; if this girl is Jewish , when the Jewish New Year , Rosh Ashanah , arrives , she will visit the poor of her community , and distribute food to the old poor people of the community ; these are the same things as what a Christian girl does on Christmas .
Young people are as helpful as the old ones .
