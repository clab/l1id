Twenty Years Later ?

It is considered as in twenty years there would be fewer cars in use than there were today .
This statement may become true or false , because it is a guess but why people believed in that guess or not .

First of all I strongly believed in that statement .
As the time pass , transportation and different ways of transporting is being improved and while improving it is being cheaper .
What improvements the transportation can see ; subways , busses , railways with comfortable trains , planes , jet planes etc .
Why costs of transportation with these vehicles will be cheaper ; because with supply and demand balances in the economy , w'th the increased numbers in cars increases demand in fuel oil and supply is constant and decreasing because it is a fossil energy .
As a result the prices of fuel oil will be increased .
so people will choose to transport by bus by subway or unbelievable but expected by plane .
Because by improvements in the transportation paths people can reach everywhere from their home by these vehicles .
I think it is an obvious choice : if you have chanceto go to your work by subway ; you will go to your work by subway .
It is why ; because you will not choose to wait in your car alone in the traffic and you will not give a lot of money to fuel oil and you will choose to read your book or newspaper while travelling .
On the other hand people choices will change while travelling along the cities ; people prefer to use planes to go to Antalya from Istanbul or from Antalya to Istanbul - from a metropol city to a touristic city of Turkey - rather than travelling by bus or by car .
Because for making another guess ; in twenty years time will be the most valuable thing in the world of all .
Time is a valuable thing now ; but in twenty years it will be the most valuable thing that people will pay the plane ticket for not being late for the life .

In all these respects above ; transportation will see great changes in the aspect of the people lives .
These changes will be rooted from the improvements in the transportation vehicles and economic conditions for instance in the fuel oil people faced .
As a result for making a guess `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ''
