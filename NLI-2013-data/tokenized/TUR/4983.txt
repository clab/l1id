With the advancement of the technology in the communication sector , the companies are now able to market their products to an anormous number of people in a really beautiful way .
For example , the advirtesements on TV are so attractive that people watch them as if they were watching movies .
Unfortunately , they are misleading most of the time , as they make the products seem much better than they really are .

I think , an example from real life would make it clearer what I mean ...
A few years ago , we were considering to change our family car .
Therefore , we were researching different models of cars , what their properties are , how much they cost , and so on .
First , we tried to follow the TV advertisements to get an idea .
According to these advertisements , these cars were so good that it was hard to believe that they were actually not from future .
Nevertheless , they did not give us much information about the futures of the cars .
So , we decided to go to the agencies , where cars would be sold , to talk to the salespeople there and to get catalogs with detailed information on every single aspect .
Of course , the salesmen were really sure in their statements that the cars they sell were the best and capable of doing everything .
Therefore , they were not very informative .
And neither were the catologs ...
The problem with the catalogs was that they were written in such a way that an average person would not understand what they mean and how their cars were different from other models .
After all these attempts , we were even more confused than we had been at the beginning .
So our choice was nothing but a random one .
At the end , we had a car that would break quite often and create problems all the time , although it seemed to be the best car ever produced .

Now we know that , the advertisements are not the most reliable tools to refer when deciding on what to buy .
I guess , it is much better and informative to talk to people who have already bought these products to figure out if they are good or not .
