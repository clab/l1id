To travel is one way to learn and extend our horizons about the world and life .
I have some important reasons to travel without a tour guide .
Yes , I do n't prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide although I cannot deny its pros .
I believe to experience new things in your own world for yourself should be private .
You do n't have to give up from your freedom as well .
Secondly , when we do n't have any schedule to follow travel may be more relaxing and be more stretching to expose things which are not familiar to us .

One of my aim to travelling is to experience new things and be faced with beautiful or ugly things during this travel .
To read about one place 's history brings a mental challenge and gives deeper and extensive knowledge about that place .
To find out the most beautiful but hidden places are unique experiences for me .

Also , not to follow a tour guide that means not be tied by a incoherent group can give much space for your discovery .
You wo n't have rush to follow any schedule or you wo n't wait someone whom is taking your time at all .
It may seem harsh thought but I count on my experiences .

In sum , I suppose that I am more individiulastic one that led my decision favor of travelling without a tour guide .
I like expose and experience freely and myself .
