One specific subject could be more difficult to developing your ideas .
I agree that its better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
You can learn more things for giving opinions about them .
Also its important for having well grade in the university .
On the other hand you can give different lectures with many academic subjects to your students .

Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can learn more things for giving opinions about them .
it gives you an extra point in group of academic for talking about different subjects .
Also you cant show yourself more success to your head of department .
That will gives a point for getting a position at a department easly from the others .
Forexample ; i am an interior architect but also i study for industrial desing that gives me more department in my university .
Means that having more value from the others for university position .

Other view ; its important for having well grade in the university .
It means that you can take more class about your interest moreover ; give a chance meeting more than ten prosfessor to taking their ideas from your topic .
It to difficult in my coutry to talking any prosfessor if you dont take his or her class .
They dont have much time .
Having more grades is also important for going in another step like ; doctoral degree .
You can manege your part with your grades in my country .

You can give different lectures with many academic subjects your students .
I have an example for it ; my history lecturer Burcu Ozguven , she is giving history lecture and studies many subjects like decoratives in interior architecture , gardening , textures for early period of the greeks .
She can give lectures each of the subjects .

Its grade for a person i think .

Having more opinions are important for our life .
If we have time We must develope our subjects for being well educated .
People could use this education for serving to people .
Im a lecturer and have to be learn more for my students .
