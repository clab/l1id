It is known that educational system is always discussed by the politiciens and of course a lot of families who are interested in future of their children .
Learning concepts or learning the real facts is one of the discussions .
Because these ideas are both very essential for students because of many reasons .

Firstly I vant to point out that students charge with learning a lot of important information because they can be get everything when they are children .
Moreover , for their cultural improvements , they have to learn many about our phylosophy , history and the concepts .
Of course ' it is very important that they have to understand the ideas .
I have to say that this type of information give the students perfectly .
In my opinion , there is not problem in this idea .

However students have to learn about another issues - I can say ` real issues ' .
Because there a lot of students who are very clever and know concepts but can not have any idea about the current events all over the world .
In this situation we must focus on this type of education .
In my opinion when we talk about the lack of good education , also we must think about us , families .
As I said in the first paragraph , all families want to educate their children in a good way .
According to the some people families can improve their children in their houses too .
It is not incredible because of a lot of advantages .
For instance , a student can learn a lot of things with his or her theacher at school but at the same time when student get up he can read a newspapers to learn about what is going on .
Furthermore , his family help him of course and this way maybe he learn thinking .

As a conclusion , understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are both are very important information for students in this way which I talk about .
