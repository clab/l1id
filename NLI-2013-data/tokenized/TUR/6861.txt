I disagree with that statement .
Because i do n't believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Because the population of world continuosly growing up , its meanthere will be living more people on the earth than today .
So its mean peoples will need more car for their requests or anything else whatever you want to call .

If we look to back , our past will show us , we are always usig more by time .
For example , if we use 10,000 cars in the 1920's , we are using over than 500 million cars today .
This is only one example shows , there is always a good table showing us we always use more car than last year .
And its will be going up like this way .

Lets look with a different point .
There are car facilities and others like tear productors etc .
So always , they will need to be developing new models of car and other parts .
And we are drivers or whatever we call , shortly peoples will be changing their cars to another new car .
In this while other poor peoples , i mean who does n't lives in good life standarts or conditions .
Then as you seen there will be two car in use , if you will think other peoples does same too , so can you tell me , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?

No there wo n't be fewer cars in use in the future .
If you look around and think that , when you were child there was less car , but when you were growng up , if you think carefuly then you will see that cars are raising with time .
Now look around , how many car there are ?
Is it was less than the time you were child ?
No It 's not .
Because there are more cars in use now than past times .
Finally i will say we will see many car in use in the sooner future .
If we do n't find solutions for traffic problems , so we will be in big trouble .
We will waste time in traffic and we will waste gas for nothing while waiting at traffic .
Also i think patrol companies wo n't let it be less car .
Because how many car is there , they will sell that much gas and earn money .
We can give many example like these .

Hopefully there wo n't be much cars than today for more healthfull live .
But my brain does n't tells same things .
I think we need to work hard for this big problem .
We need to teach peoples for social transport vehicles like bus and others .
For a healty life we also need to use byscle .
I will say again , i do n't want a world with aot of car .
I just want a world in peace and clear and healty and without stress .
