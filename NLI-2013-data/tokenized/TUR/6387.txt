I dont think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because every day the number of people who use cars is increasing as i see .

When i go out i with my friend , i can not hear her because of the car voices .
Wherever i look i see cars covered all around me .
And we see that it is getting worse and worse day by day.10 years ago i couldnt see so many cars on the roads but today people have to wait for hours to arrive home because of the heavy traffic .
The situation is just for my country .
If we think about all the countries in the world , the number of cars is horrible .
In China most people use bcycles outside .
But they are alone .
Even if thet do that cars in use are increasing .
If only all people in the world did that .
If they did , the roads would be very quiet and also the atmosfhere would be cleaner .

But if we look today it is impossible that there will be fewer cars in use .
Unlike today the number of cars in use will have been so increased that we will not walk on the streets .
If it will continue like this it will damage the environment , too .
We are damaging whole world and in twenty years we will not find anywhere to live .

Using cars is also cause the decreasing in petrol .
We are consuming so much petrol that it will not be enough .
So we can not drive our cars without it .
maybe it will be better because if there is no petrol there will be no cars .

I think people have to be educated about this .
While they are doing this they do not know that they are damaging both the environment and the atmosfher .
