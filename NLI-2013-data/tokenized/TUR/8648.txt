In my opinion , i disagree with the statement .
I think both of the situations is very important for the students .
( understand ideas and concepts , learn facts . )
the two situations combine with each other .

firstly , understanding ideas and concepts is useful for the students .
By the way the students can learn the ideas .
so the students have an opinion about the situation .
for example ; while learning about a war , the student should learn the ideas and concepts of the war .
( what is the importance of the war for other companies , the other persons opinions about the war , where it begans ...
etc ) before the student dont understand the ideas and the concepts of the war , they cant have a focus on the war .
not only understanding ideas and concepts of the war but also learning the facts of the war has an important role for the students .
if the students want to learn about the war , the students have to being successful in two situation .

secondly , when learning facts is not enough for the students .
for example ; the student learn the facts of the happening , ( for example by learning the facts of the war , the student can understand the war anda then the student can built their opinion strongly ) but if the student dont understand the ideas and concepts of the happening , the situation doesnt have a place in the students mind .
then , the student wont remember the situation .
so it means the situation is temporary for the student .
By understanding the ideas and concepts , the student can develop their ideas .
So the student can improve yorself about the situation .

in conclusion , the students not only understand ideas , but also learning facts .
they gave enough importance for both of situations .
so they learn the situations well by understanding ideas , concepts and learning facts .
