I think it is better to specialize in one specific subject and be an expert on that subject than to have broad knowledge of many subjects and not have a specific area of expertise .

Having broad knowledge of many subjects does not necessarily show that one is qualified .
That sort of knowledge can easily be acquired through personal effort and experience , which makes it almost the same thing as what we call ` general knowledge` .
General knowledge is the accumulation of one 's experience and learnings gained through education and/or quite simply , living .
Everybody has a general knowledge to some extent , and this knowledge does not bring any bonus points to you in the course of your professional life , no matter how vast it is , especially in an age as competitive as ours .

On the other hand , specializing in one particular subject gives you the opportunity of being unique .
There is no limit to how much you can learn and discover on any subject .
Therefore , it is possible for someone who has chosen to specialize , to go as far as he or she wants with his or her studies , research , experiments , etc .

Let us take the profession of conference interpreting as an example .
It is a must for each and every conference interpreter to have broad knowledge on many academic subjects , since they could be hired to work in many conferences regarding many subjects .
It is not possible for them to interpret what they hear if they do not understand anything , or if they are not familiar with the particular terminology .
Nevertheless , this certainly does not mean that they are experts , or in other words , that they have specialized in those subjects .
This does not mean that they are not experts in any subject either .
What this means is that they are specializing in conference interpreting , and that without their expertise in that particular area , their abilities to simultaneously listen and talk , their knowledge of interpreting techniques , their broad knowledge on many subjects would not do them any good .

In conclusion , in an environment as competitive as the current one , where you have to stand out in order to be able to achieve certain standards in your life , you can not just settle for a broad knowledge of many subjects .
You certainly have to have your area of expertise , an area where you are unique , and where you are willing to pursue that `` uniqueness '' to the furthest extent possible .
