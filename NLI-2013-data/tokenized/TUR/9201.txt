There are certain areas that differs from each other according to how a student studying in those areas should respond to the needs of the area he or she studying in ..
Although some of them such as Mathematics require a student to learn facts , understanding ideas and concepts about an area or an issue is more important .

One of the reasons that can be given to the statement that understanding is more important than learning facts is ability to apply what a student learn practically .
For example , I am studying pyscoholgy and it is not enough for me just to learn the facts about certain things .
As I want to be a pyscologist in the future I need to apply what I learn and I need to solve my patient 's problems .
This certtainly requires to understand ideas and concepts of what I study .

The other reason is that a person can be more creative and do well on their exams when she understand the ideas and concepts .
Rather than accepting the fact after learning it , students can discuss the concepts and even improve the ideas that they understant .
In my department I have a frind whose conception of studying is totaly different from me .
While I always try to learn the main facts and concentrate on them , she focuses on concepts and just tries to understantds ideas .
What I observed recently is she is doing better than me in exams and this lead me to become a conclusion that since I only focus on learning facts , it makes me limited to them and I can not answer or respond to anything practically .
What is more is she is more creative than me in producing solutions to practical problems of some patients that we study as an exercise in a hospital .

To conclude , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts instead of learning facts .
That is the way I want to change myself towards also .
