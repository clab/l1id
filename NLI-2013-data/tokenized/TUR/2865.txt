People born , live , and die .
This is the typical cycle of human life .
In this cycle the people choose the way of their lives individually .
Some people prefers an enjoyful life , such as entertaining , travelling doing thing they enjoyed , while the others prefer working for their future .
But it should't be understood that people who are working do n't enjoy the life .

From this phenomenia the topic comes to the question of how can people enjoy life and who can enjoy life more .
In the answers of this question generally it is encountered the statement of young people enjoy life more than older people do .

This statement makes a categorization of people by their ages .
But I do n't agree with this statement .
It is right that young people have more physical abilities to the older people .
But it should n't be understood that only the physical abilities are enough to enjoy life .
Young people has more physical abilities , but their decision abilities are n't grown up enough to make always the right decisions on the situations they encountered .
For this reason they can fail while they are trying to enjoy .

It is also generally thought that older people are working and do n't have enough time to make different things which would be enjoyful .
But it should also be considered that working on the job which is your ideal would be the most enjoyful activity for you .
Working , improving or inventing new devices , generating new ideas , dealing with your own interests also can make your life enjoyful .

Finally , my last opinions on this statement is that the life would be enjoyful if you are on the way of your preferences .
If you are doing the things in your dreams , and on the place where you wanted to be the lifge would be enjoyful for you .
So , from that time the ages does n't affect your considerations about the life .
