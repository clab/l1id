Globalization one of the most famous word in our daily life .
It means that the world is becaming smaller , inspite of increasing its population .
The world is small now becaose of the developing communation technology .
Any firm can sell its pruduct by using the fruits of the technology , for example internet .
It also means that globalization .

However , it is not easy to say that globalization it good or not for us .
In the old times people do not have to advertise their product .
For example in a williage , there was only one market .
People do not have another choise and they know the market .
But after providing of travelling means , travelling to another williage 's market became easy .
First market had to do something , such as offering lower prices or saying that my products are better than others , and advertisements season started .
Despite , the purpose of the advertisements is giving information about the product , most of the companies are doing more than that , in order to beat their opponents .
One of the most common trick is making products seem much better than they really are .

There was a advertisement in the Turkish televisions , a promotion of a newspaper .
They gave an audio player , if you collect thirty coupons .
It was seeming amazing and so big on the advertisements on the TV .
Most of the people collected the coupons buying the newspaper .
After thirty days they want to places that distrubiituon of the `` amazing audio players '' .
Everybody surprised .
Size of the player was smaller than a hand .
People got angry but there was nothing to do , because the newspaper did not mention about the size of it .

Of course advertisements are the best way to show the product , however sometimes the companies ignore the moral rules for more money .
