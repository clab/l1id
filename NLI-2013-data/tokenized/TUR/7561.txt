The best way to travel can never be achieved by being in group with a tour guide .
Being in a group and being led by a tourguide means you are completely restricted to the wishes of the group which is the decision of the majority of the group about where to go and restricted to the directions and the information provided by the tour guide .
The best way to travel can be achieved by a very well self-planned tour beforehand the travel .
This way , you are completely free to choose where to go , where to stop and from where to get information about the place you go .

If you choose a self-planned travel , you are completely free to chose where to go .
Otherwise , with a group of people , the decision is restricted to the choise of the majority of the group .
Therefore , you have to select their choice .
For example , for the Thanksgiving Holiday , you may want to visit New York .
However , your friends suggest that you should go altogether and pick up a tour bus in New York which is guided by a tour guide .
If you choose to travel with them , you can only see the places that is covered by the route of the tour bus instead of choosing the places freely , and you can learn only from the tour guide instead of talking the people in streets of New York .
You may want to see the SoHo , but , the route of the tour bus may not include SoHo area in New York .
Therefore you will not be satisfied with this travel .

Second , you cannot choose where to stop during the travel .
If you choose to travel in a group in the guidance of a tour guide , there will be some certain places to stop , that are predetermined before the travel .
Other than those places you will be unable to stop whenever you wish .
For instance , if you are travelling in a school bus in the guidance of the teacher , you can only see the places that are chosen by your teacher .
You will be unable to stop some other places you might wish to see and talk to residents of the area .
It can be a travel to Florida from Philadelphia , and if the teacher does not want to stop in Washington , you will miss the opportunity of seeing Washington and talking the people in Washington .

Another constraint of travelling in a group led by a tour guide is that you are not free to choose the source of information about the place that you are travelling .
For instance , suppose that you are in Turkey , and you are to take a tour bus that goes to Kapadokia , which is one of the wonders of Turkey , led by a tourguide .
You will be unable to talk to residence of Kapadokia who live in very small and old villages .
You will not have the opotunity to gain knowledge about the history and the civil life from its residents point of view .
How detailed could the tour guide 's instructions be ?

Summing up , travelling in a group led by a tourguide is very restrictive .
You almost do not have any preference on choosing where to go , where to stop and where to get information from about the place you visit .
Given those constraints , the best way of travelling is a self-planned travel with your own .
