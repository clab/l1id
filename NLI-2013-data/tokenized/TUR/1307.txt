Some people prefer to divide theirselves to several areas and know a little thing about many subjects while others prefer to get deeply information on one subject .
Based on my experiences I strongly believe that a person should specialize in one subject .
There will never be enough time to get deep knowledge of all the subjects and there are several advantages of specialzing in one subject , easiness to reach success and live iin a more organized way and it Unfortunately there is a big time problem in recent years .
I mean there is a lot of things to do but not enough time for them .
People should use their time very economically .
Trying to get knowledge in many different areas is a big time lost ; moreover it is a challenging idea .
Due to the high responsibilities there will never be enough time to really understand all of the topics , no one is so intelligent .

In addition , I do n't believe that a person can reach success by giving his or hers interest in different areas .
I had such a friend that encountered such a situation .
We werw at the same class , he get everytime high grades .
Then he decided to study architecture beside chemical engineering and at the same time he played guitar in a bar .
After this decision his grades declined significiantly : moreover he loosed his job because he was so tired and could n't give good performances .
To be an accomplished worker a person should have detailed information of his subject .
Without knowing all the aspects of a subject no one can do a good job .
Because he or she would n't have appropriate knowledge to use when heor she confronts a problem .

A person is going to live in a more organized way by studying one subject , because all the things that he has to do during a day will be fixed .
There will not be any disorders to disrupt his day .

In conclusion I prefer to specialize in one susject rather than having broad knowledge of many subjects because I believe that there are sqarce time to deal with many subjects , it is easier to reach succsses
