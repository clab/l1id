Whether young or old , many people have expectations from life .
They all want to enjoy life , be in a good manner for themselves .
In my opinion , youbger people enjoy life more than the older ones .
There lots of reasons or facts for young people to enjoy life more .

Better physical conditions are good referrents to make young people enjoy life .
Most of young young people know that they have a better physical condition than the olders .
A young person generally knows that he or she has an undeformed body related with most of the olders and find himself or herself strong to perform a different job .
For example they can play football whenever they want but the olders can not .
Youngers can also try new and dangerous sports which make them feel exited .

Younger people know that their age is an advantage to be in a good manner .
Being a young person I know I have a bigger chance to live more than the elders and that sometimes motivate .
Before starting a hard job I know I can deal with that job as long as I want .
If I face with difficulties , I can spare bigger time for my job .

Nowadays , it is true that knowing less information about life , people are beterly motivated to their lives .
It is important for people what they have learned during their life times but when a person realizes the things he or she had faced , he or she does n't want to remember them .
Thus young people have have less things to remember and as aresult , they do n't think about life 's difficulties .

Young people have chances to see life easier and entertain .
As I have mentioned above they can find ways to entertain .
