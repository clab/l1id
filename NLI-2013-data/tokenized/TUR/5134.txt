Trends of Consumption Society
We live in a material world .
This world has been like that after the invention of equipments which help traders to reach their consumers much easier .
Advertising became the most important equipment as it is recognized to be aiding in sales ; making no difference if it is a good product or not .
Therefore advertisements are making us to think the product is just perfect .

Advertising is the best selling technique for a product in the market .
For the producers to earn more , consumers should be convinced that there is no problem with the product .
Even if a product is good enough for the specific purpose , when it is introduced as having few bad points besides lots of good points producers will loose money .
This is not desirable , so the producers find an easy way out : Misleading their consumers through advertisements !
It is harder to convince a consumer than to make him have a negative attitude towards the product .

The reason for the preparation of misleading advertisements is not one-sided .
It is a relation of effect and fact .
The consumers are mostly willing to see better and better products .
They regularly want to see new and perfect material .
They can not stand seeing bad points of the things they consume .
This is the famous trend of consumption communities .
Everything that the members of the society face with should be good looking .
Most of the time they do not even bother about the idea of being cheated .
They ask for it so that they accept it with the eyes shut .

Advertisements making the products seem much better than they really are , are just the consequence of developping consumption idea .
As long as there is a demand for it , producers will not hesitate to cheat on their consumers .
This is the basic deal .
