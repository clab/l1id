I do not agree that in twenty years there will be be fewer cars in use than there are today .
We could n't stop to use car that give freedom in our life .
Even they have polluted the enviroment since first gas engine built , it can be fixed by new generation powertrain component .
For instance , emmision group have set up regulation for the ciritcal value of exhauts gas and substances .

In fact , human population increase rapidly than we hope and all people need vehicle such as car to use efficiently their time .
Car help us to go whatever we want without awating anything .
It is also critical that you can safe anybody'life with car .
Cars are our hand and improve our social acivity .
You can get your firends or family even they are far away from your home .
you may use your phone to reach them but your sound is not enough sometimes .
If you want to see anybody or being anywhere with your own decision than you need car to do all .

In the mean time , shape of the car and engine trend will be different from nowadays that all useful items in terms of humanity could be added on it .
But all of them wo n't decrease the usage of cars .

New trends allow the people get cars more cheaper and use alernative energy source to prevent giving any damage the habitat .
Moreover people feel more freedom to do what they want .

.
Everbody try to get more than one car for their parents and boy so that they can dirve their way .
All in all , car production will be increased annualy and help people any point of their life .
It is neccesary that govermant should give some financial advantage to company produced car .
it helps people dreams become real so that they will be happy .
