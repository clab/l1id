The major aim of young people of this century is following the popular trends .
They do not know anything about politics and recent developments in science .
They follow the concerts of Madonna instead of following technological developments .
The youth is careless about their community .
Besides , they see their friends who have concerns about the community as antisocial .

I do not know many young people caring about their community .
In fact , most of them do not have any idea about their community .
They only care about computer games , partners that they meet by internet and the latest trends around the world .
In other words , they are not interested in anything important like how they can help their community .
They think that they do not have any responsibility for their community .
For instance , Paris Hilton who is known by almost all young people does not have any idea about who is the president of England .
She is also young and she is a role model for youth with such a little knowledge .

I have to state that there are some people who concern about their community in the set of young people .
However they are not seen as role models .
Instead , they are the most antisocial group according to young people who do not have any concern about future of their community .
They think that you are a creature coming from space when you want to talk about important issues such as politics or problems of the community .

I believe that the youngs should also follow important issues in addition to famous trends .
Nowadays young people do not give not only enough time but also no time in order to help their community .
They do not have any concerns about future .
Also , they see youngs who want to help comminity as asocial .
All nations should take some measures about these problems .
Otherwise I can not imagine the world with countries that have presidents chosen from these careless youngs .
