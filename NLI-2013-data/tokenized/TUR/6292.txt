We all have been in traffic jams and mostly it is due to the fact that the number of cars increased a lot recently , rather than that it is because of roads .
Due to the imporevements in manufacturing technologies , it has become possible to produce cheap cars in shorter times .
In return , the number of cars increased .
Toyota now can produce a car in 2 minutes with a cost of 2000 dollars , less or more , of course depending on the type of the car .
This indicates that as technology developes more and more , people will buy more and more cars .
So in the following 20 years , in my opinion , there will be more cars instead of the possibility that there will be fewer cars been driven than we drive today .

One reason for the possible increase in number of cars within close future is , as aforementioned , the technological improvements enable manufacturers to produce cheaper cars in shorter times .
Cheaper cars mean that almost everybody can have it .
Attracted by extra promotions and suitable purchasing conditionos , even a family can have more than one car .
And this attraction that the manufacturers present for their customers will be even more attractive as technology contunies to improve , as a result ; more automobiles will be on the roads .

Other than that cars are getting cheaper , the people are getting richer as well .
The economies of countries grow with the impact of globalization , especially in develop and developing countries , which in turn brings money to people , and I can say that the globalization is just starting .
So what can be done with the money ?
Of course if you have a house , you will buy a car ; if you have a car why should not your wife or son have a car next .
It can be seen that having automobile is not accepted as luxury property in some countries , especially in develloped ones .
And considering the population of develoding countries and they are going to be developed , there will be a significant incline in the numbers of cars .

Also there can be disadvantages of driving a car in the next coming 20 years .
the time consumed in traffic jams , and environmental problems related to pollution can disatract people , or even laws can be decided by goverments that are limitating automobile usage or number of cars in a family .
But all these will not stop the increase in the number of cars , at least 20 years .

To conclude , it can be said that cars are getting cheaper and people are gettin richer in the follawing 20 years due to technologicalso the world is going to be wealthier and cars , of course , are the best canditates to show the wealth a person have .
therefore , I believe that number of cars will increase .
