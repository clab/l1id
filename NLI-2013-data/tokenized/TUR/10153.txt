Inventing the Wheel Again

The method for being sucessful in life is not written on an ancient egyptian scroll .
In today 's world no one can really determine what will be a hit or not .
Inventing a new things is sure necessity to be sucessful , but one should not blindly take risks in the sake of it .
One 's experience is his best treasure and his best guide for reaching sucess .
Successful people improve on what they already do well .

Imagine someone who wants to be a good swimmer .
He first learns freestyle and as soon as he learns it enough to look good , he starts learning butterfly , backstroke , breastroke and so on .
While a competitor chooses his best stroke to be freestyle and puts just the same energy and time to freestyle only .
The first swimmer can race and be good in all styles but when he races freestyle , the second swimmer will win .
Success in sports is similar to success in life for many things .
If one does n't focus on one thing and learn it quite well he wo n't improve on it .
Successful people plant their strategies well and work on the things they already know to improve themselves .

In order to be sucessful in a subject one should bring something new into that subject .
In order to bring in something new to the table , one should first know what 's been put on the table .
Successful people who has experience on their subjects already know not only what has been done upto that point , but also they understand what is needed next .
Someone looking at a picture from outside cannot see the next step , cannot see what that businness field is lacking and what would be a big gap filing invention .
Taking a risk on new things without and experience on it is like driving in dark with no headlights .

Being successful does not mean doing only what has been done up to that point without chaning it .
Successful people always re-invent and improve things in their fields .
The first rule of being successful is not stopping and always improving on what one have .

Success stories are based on doing dramatic things .
However it is only a fair luck to be successful in a field by just taking risks and trying new things .
New things are necessary for improvement and success .
But for new things , experience is a must .
Successful people are the ones that try new things in the light of their experiences .
