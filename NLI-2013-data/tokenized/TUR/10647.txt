I completely agree with this statement .
I think it is very important for a human to make , to tery new things in their life .
sometimes it may be very risky , but we do n't have another life , so will not lose anything with trying .
Making changes is always good for us .
This change can be a very big one or a small one .
it is same in all fields of our lifes .
let 's say that i am attending a research program .
And i have an idea that may effect this research but i am not sure about it .
if there is no another chance , i will to that thing , regarding the risks that a became face to .
i may be successful or not .
But if i at least try i will not loose anything .

we have to encourage ourselfs to try new things .
it is our lifes .
no matter what other people say , for example some people look us like a crazy person , but i thing it is worth to try .

if we do n't try new things we will stay where we are all of our life time .
does it really enjoyable ?
No , i do n't think so .
i actually think taht doing the same things everyday take people 's all happiness .

i think that the person who does n't afraid of taking risks is the successfull person wheter he/she succeeded or not .
taking risks makes the most important changes in a person 's life .
it 's like stay or go , do or not .
even if we make a bad decision with taking a risk , if you are still alive after that , than nothing is over .
you can start again where you left , but not taking the same risks .
we can not just take a risk to prove our encourage .
we take risks when we beleive that it might effect our life positively .

so , taking risk and making new changes in our life is good , but in my opinion we have to think twice before making a decision
