The days when one could be genericly called and a scientist or an inventor who knew it all are long gone .
Like Leonardo Da Vinci was a painter a mechanic a biologist among many other things .
In our modern times there is so much knowledge that one lifetime of constant memorizing will not suffice to acquire it all .

Technology and science advances as people contribute to it , and to be able to contribute to it one must have mastered what has been previously done .
Todays academic subjects are very deep and extensive .
In addition , considering that there are a lot of subjects , a superficial broad approach will not lead to significant contributions .

Although it is mandatory to have a borad understanding of things to be able to relate ones work with other areas and find uses for it .
Failing to have awareness of other subjects can be considered as ignorance , but this kind of attitude and lack of interest has no place in academics .

Broader knowledge will get you in to many plesant converstions and you may be able to orchestrate a bunch of specialists from different fields to collaborate , however it is not enough for individual contribution .

I personally passed a phase where I was hungry for information and tried to learn everything but then I discovered that eveybody in the world knows at least one thing better than me .
For example I was repairing my own automobile and makin my own surfboards when I discovered that someone else can do a better job than me and it will cost them less time .
It will also cost me less money if I spend it working on what I know .
The same applies for academcis .

Now I believe that you should do one thing that you know and do it it right .
