Success is a very well balanced cocktail .
A person whose quest is for success should keep in mind that without taking risk , gaining is virtually impossible .
But taking risks is an art in which one should be extremely careful and wise .

Let 's take the battle of Thermopylai as an example .
The Spartans and their allies took the risk of facing an Persian army that multiplied them in numbers .
The Spartans ` knew ' that they had superior training in infantry tactics and that the battlefield was not fit for cavalry .
The Spartans also knew the geography that helped them hold the persian army for that long .
In the end , the Greek allies in Thermopylai held the enemy long enough for the assembly of the Athenian navy .
Hitler as another example , thought that he could capture Moscow in December 1941 then return home .
This was a miscalculated risk and the german army which was n't prepared for winter suffered dramatic losses in the winter of 1941-1942 , when it could n't reach its 1941 objectives .

Taking risks is a key to sucess indeed .
But one should keep in mind that miscalculation and ill preparedness in taking risks is the most likely cause of downfall .
