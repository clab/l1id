Consdering how rapidly the technology is advancing , I believe that the use of cars will be greatly reduced twenty years from now .

At every passing moment , scientists are coming up with new ideas to make people 's lives easier .
Currently , one of the challenges that await them is the ease of transportation .
For longer distances , the planes are highly efficient means of transportation , but for shorter distances , we are bound to use cars or similar vehicles like buses .

There are already steps taken towards this issue .
The `` Ginger '' , also known as Segway , was invented for people to travel short distances quicker and without hassle .
I am confident that better variations of it will be created in twenty years ' time .
These may include flying vehicles , which can be easily navigated even through streets .

At first , they may not be appealing either due to their prices or due to non-familiarity , but after a period of adaptation , they would be more commonly used and eventually they would replace cars .
This is exactly what happened to horse-ridden vehicles when the first car was introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century .

Moreover , there is an increasing concern for air pollution generated by the excessive use of cars .
People are getting more inclined to use alternative methods of transportation like bicycles .

It is true that some people are not aware the impacts of the pollution generated by cars .
However , they are , too , getting reluctant to drive a car since the oil prices are increasing rapidly , whereas the oil sources are depleting rapidly .
The traditional car will be of no use when there will be no fuel left to run it from twenty to thirty years from now .
There will be vehicles running with alternative energy sources , but I believe that they will not be considered as cars in the traditional sense .

When all of these different factors are brought together , I can say that people will willingly give up using cars one way or the other , reducing the number of cars that are in use in twenty years ' time .
