I agree with the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
My reasons for this are three folds .

Firstly , in my opinion , ideas and facts are broder termsthan facts .
Therefore , when a student learns about ideas and concepts she \ he may also have the chance to see the facts behind them .
However , if a student only learns about a fact , he \ she would not be able use this fact when necessary .
This would be mainly because of the inability of the student to make this fact concrete in her \ his mind because of lack of ideas and concepts related with this fact .

Secondly , learning a fact alone would not probably take the attention of the student very much .
However , in oder to motivate students to learn more about their fields of studies , the topics of their studies should be interesting .
Most probably an interesting lesson would help students to be more willing and more motivated to make further research and investigation about that topic .
In that way , understanding ideas and concepts rather than merely learning facts would help students to develop themselves as well .

Thirdly , to my point of view , understanding ideas and concepts make students more creative .
If they undertand ideas and concepts about a topic \ then they can apply them into their lives .
For example , they can develope new theories .
which can also make contributions to their fields of studies .
Being creative is a very important aspect and of an education system .
Due to that reason , understanding ideas and concepts would be critiical in the personal development of a student .

Ultimately , for all of the reasons I have mentioned above , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
