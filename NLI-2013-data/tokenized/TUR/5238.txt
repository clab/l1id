Nowadays advertisement became very popular for the companies .
Especially the bigger companies are using this argument very frequently .
In my opinion advirtesements make products seem better than they really are .
The goal of the companies which is maximizing the profits and the competition between the companies provides this stiuation .

Companies are using advirtesement arguments for increasing their profits .
To achieve their aim they are showing their products differently .
For example , once I saw an advertisement about a digital dictionary on the television .
When I saw the dictionary I decided to buy one .
Because It has a o lot of functions which are very beneficial for me .
It is also said that the use of the dictionary is very simple .
Next day I went to the shop to buy one .
When I saqw the real one I was shocked .
First it was not practical as it was said on the television .
On the other hand the size of the dictionary was very big which is a problem for carrying it .

Sometimes the competition between the companies may cause this situation .
Today a lot of company are competing bacuse they are producing the same products .
Each of them wants to raise their own profits .
There are two big companies in Turkey which are producing the same product , knifes .
They are emphasizing the sharpness of their knifes in the advirtesements .
Both of them want to prove that their knifes quality is better than other company 's knife .
For that reason sometimes they are giving untrue knowledge about the qualifications of their knifes .

It may claimed that an untrue advirtesement may be harmful for the company 's future improvement .
But It became a habbit for the com
