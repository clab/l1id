NEW THINGS AND TAKING RISKS

Nowadays when you turn on TV you will probably see a discussion program about the importance of trying new things and taking risks .
Although some people think that to be successfull , people should not do new things which means risks , I think the best way to become successeful in our era is doing new things and taking risks for mainly two reasons .

To begin with , new things means new opportunities and as a result of this while people do something for the first time , they also have the change of getting its benefits for the first time .
For instance , let 's think that you are the first person who opens a hamburger restaurant .
In other words you are doing a new thing with high risk level .
However you will be more successful than any other person who does the same thing after you ; becaus you will be able to make a lot of profit before others understants that this is a profitable way .
As you can see this will be the opportunity that you get as a result of taking risks .

Secondly , new things makes people able to do whatever they want and as a result of this , they can easily become successful .
For example , Mickey Mouse is so famous today ; however the inventor of this character tried something new in order to do the things he had imagined .
Infact when he planed to draw this character he was not sure about the popularity of Mickey Mouse but he took the risk and become successful .

Opponents argue that , doing new things means lots of stress and this prevents people from being successful .
However this is unlikely tp be true ; because altough there may be some problems at the begining , after a while the risk takers will probably become sucessfull and then everything will be easier and less stressful for him or her .

To sum up , I thinf doing new things and taking risks are the key facters to become a successful person .
I thing everybody should be aware of this .
If they are then our world would become a better place to live in .
Do not you agree ?
