Some people tend to think that young people get more pleasure from life than older people do .
In fact I dont agree with this view because I believe older people enjoy life more .

If you are young you are probably a long way to settle your life .
You will have many tasks and duties to complete before being able to enjoy life such as completing your education successfully , finding a good job , setting a family etc .
These kind of burdens will prevent you taking pleasure form life because you will be worried about sorting out all those things .

But if you are older it is likely that you already got rid of those kind of problems .
All personal and financial matters would have probably been sorted out so that you could have the time and opportunity to enjoy life to the full .

On the other enjoying life actually needs learning how to enjoy life .
Young people are likely to imitate their friends .
Instead of finding out what makes them enjoy life themselves they genereally do what their friends do , may be just to receive acceptance .
To enjoy life they drink , smoke and do lot of other things without any serious justification of their results .
But as you get older you become more experienced about what is good and bad for you .
You can deliberately decide what to do to enjoy life because you probably learned from your past experiences .

Finally it can be concluded that older people are able to enjoy life more than young people do but it must be pointed that tyhis assumptions is valid only under a normal way of life without be pointed that
