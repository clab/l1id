I think that , the young people dont give enough time for helping their communities .
As the most people accept , the life has changed considerably and this causes some changes on people characteristics .
The effects of this change can be seen on the issue of the helping the communities .
The following consideratoins can be accepted to as a causes of this change

Nowadays , young people dont have sufficient amount of time to deal with the social occurances .
Young people have to participate an educational institution and they have study for their courses and this take a huge amount of time .
For the sake of the success on the life , young people have to dealt with their education , After the school life , these people encounter a job life and again this period spends a too much time of people .
As we see from this life conditions , young people can not find enough time to take part in social activities and they try to participate more preferable activites in their free time ,

The second consideration is that the young people encounter a huge amount of competition at the recent time .
As you guess , the high level of competition affects the thinking of the people and this makes people to less aware to issues that about their communities .
In the school life and the job life , young people spend a big amount of effort to reach better position and this increases the selfish level of young people .
These people only think abount better position , better education and finally more money and this is the opposite of the expected results .

Eventually , we can say that young people will be less involved in the issuses about the social life at the future becuse of the recent life style .
The people who lived in 1700 , less involved in education and the ecenomy .
Therefore , they were more involved in social activities , The level of the competition was less at these years and so people respected more to other people and the issues that are anbout the community .
We have to decrease the level of the competition and the working time in order to increase the involving level of the young people to issues about the their communities .
