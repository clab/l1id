The first thing that comes into the mind is that people are simply unconscious about the topic of pollution and environmental problems .
What they really care is their comfort .
Everybody wants to live in comfort , isnt it ?
But they dont think about how much time their comfort will last .
The answer should not say a long period of time because it is this comfort that will end the life on earth .

Everyday , the population of earth increases with acceleration , So , proportional to the number of peaople we can say that the number of cars will certainly increase .
If we are to think of ay decrease in this number , we should considers about peoples consciousness as individulas and governments regulations .

First of all , the cars release outside , to the air , very hazardous gases which cause to ozon depletion .
The people outside dont really know what the ozon deplation is .
Moreover , the old cars that are not used anymore are themselves are the cause of the pollution becouse , the huge metal waste is also thrown into the earth .
So , at this point , scintists have the real job .
They should make both the individuals and the governments beware of this dangerous issue .

Secondly , there is also a conflict here that increase in the number of cars makes themselves useless !
There is a lot of traffic in big cities already and this will increase day by day .
At the end all the cars will be totally useless .
It will be that time that people will begin to think about using buses and railways .
But , I dont think this will happen in a couple of decades .

Finally , with the advances in technology , there may be flying objects that can supply the transport in the cities so that people will no longer need the cars .
But for this technology to be reached , maybe it will take a whole century .

To sum up , I think in the next two decades there will bw even more increase in the number of cars simply because of the incresase in human population .
It will take much more time for people become conscious about environmental problems .
But in the end nature will adjust itself
