When I was lazy student , I always tried to make out why did my teacher be insist to teach this ideas and concepts .
Now I grow up and get the main idea step by step .
Concepts and ideas must be learned clearly to predict the facts .

First of all I totaly agree with this situtation .
Not being understand ideas and concepts and then predict or learn facts mean want to run not being learned how to walk .
For example there are two students in same class .
They are good friends in there .
Student A try to understand basic things and after all the notion .
He wants to be the top in class .
But Student B just try to understand cause and effect .
His intend is get enough marks in class .
Do you ever think why do teachers try to teach notions .
I did , the answer is research or develop something much faster or bigger .
I mean their intends are not just students get the highest marks .
When student learn ideas , concepts etc. he/she can do develop that subject .
He/she really be the competent of this subject .

In addition , student who wants to be an engineer , he/she has to learn all about the subject if s/he really create a unique thing or innovations .
To sum up , you have to make our way between these Student A and B. Which one do you want to be ?
Just get enough marks on exam , make your GDP 2.01 and go to and ordinary college or be the top student in class , make your GDP 3.0 and go to Harvard University .
I would prefer the second one cause I want to be top .
