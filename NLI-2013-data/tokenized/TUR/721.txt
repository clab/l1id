I think specialization in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
In the academic life in universities , every student wishing to graduate from the university must represent a specific subject as finishing project .
After than for instance , a specific issue is selected in the master 's degree .
Every scholar is expected to focus on a specific issue .
Moreover , no one can claim to be best at all fields .
In this sense , there are many sub-titles below the issues .
As a graduate from the international relations department , I can give many sub-titles such as Europe , Middle East , Far East , Territorial Waters , Weapons of Mass Destruction , etc ...
Examining one specific topic gives the person more detailed information on that subject , subsequently she/he will be called as a expert on that subject .
By getting more and more information on the subject she/he will be more self-confident person .
If a sensitive issues are raised on the subject , she will be applied firstly in order to get her thoughts .
Writing books or essays on a specific topic could enable her to gain more prestige as well as more money .
Paralel to raising in her/his profession , living standarts will also improve .

On the other hand everyone has some information about the daily life .
The people must attach importance to the politics , economy and international relations .
We must take an active roles in all social platforms in order to audit the political process .
We must keep a close eye on the happenings in daily lifes .
