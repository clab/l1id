human kinds always need ideas , concepts and facts to reach good life satandards , therefore understanding them is a very important respect for humans life .
everyone has different point of views about the idea of concepts , ideas and facts .
some assume that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepsts in , contrary to those , some think that learning facts is more important than understanding them .
i personally agree with the second idea because of some reasons .
i think facts are basic things to understand things and they are both real and nondebated things .

first of all , facts are informations which people should leran to reach a thought .
if a person does not have any information about a topic he or she can not say any thing about the topic .
for example a student is required to say his or her thoughts by his or her teacher about a school lesson first he or she must read and search about the topic and must get information about lesson to have any idea about it .
facts are real things .
they are basics of thought .
we can not create and idea or concept without learning them .
so facts must be teached the students in schools .

in addition to this , facts are real things which make us more intelligent and add us extra knowledge .
so we should teach them to our children before they gain ability to understand ideas and concepts .
by that way ever thing may be more clear for them .
they will not face any problem while establishing an idea or concept .
owner of ideas must know about facts too .

at last but not least , as i talked about a little before facts are real information which have no doubt .
so we can not discuss about facts but ideas and concepts are special for people they can be debated because of this reason .
so to not confuse childrens mind , teachers should talk about facts and they should teach facts to them .
for example 2 adn 2 is 4 it is a well known fact and very clear for every one but an idea of a someone else may not be clear for every one .
all people may not be agree about the idea of a person .
it is a very natural situation i think .
so that shows what important is the teaching of facts .

all in all , as i said before , learning about facts is more important because of both being basic things and also real things as well as no one has a chance to debate a fact .
the long and the short of it is that it is more important for students to learn facts than understanding ideas and concepts .
