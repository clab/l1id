It has been such a long time since I completed my academic education and has been working as a professional that it is impossible for me not to agree with this statement .
Sooner or later school comes to an end and professional world starts .

In the Turkish educational system you have to decide on what you want to do at a very early age and that decision does not always turn out to be the ` right ' one for you .
What are you suppose to do when you realise that you have made the wrong decision at the very beginning .
It is very hard to start from all over again .

As an experienced professional I belive having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is always better than specializing in one specific subject , for it gives you the space , in other words the freedom you need until you decide what you really want to do .

It will be easier for a person with many aspects to get a job in the professional world rather than wait for the ` specific ' opportunity .
When one applies for a job it will be to his benefit to be aware of many subjects , for the bosses are usually looking for young people with a broad vision , eager to learn and capable of applying what they have learned .

I also believe that after deciding that one is on the right path , specializing in that field is inevitable if one wants to promote .
I would like to finish with giving an example from myself ; I graduated from business administration , I worked in a travel agency , in a factoring company and at the moment working for a non-profit organization as an expert on the European Union and I owe all this to the broad knowledge of many academic subjects I learned in school .
