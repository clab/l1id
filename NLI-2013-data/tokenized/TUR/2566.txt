I absolutely agree with this statement .
In my point of view nowadays young people enjoy life more than older people do .
This is due to the fact that life standards have changed a lot .
Young people have more possiblities to spend their time in several ways , whereas old people do not have this possibility .
Moreover old people do not enjoy doing a lot of things .
Whereas young people like to do sports , go to cafes and just sit there , go to clubs and dance and do a lot of funny things , old people mostly get bored of those things .
I see the old peope in my environment , like my grandparents .
They are sitting all the day at home and do nothing than watching TV or reading newspaper .
They do n't like to talk a lot and they just want their calm , one ca n't be loud around them .
They have reached all their goals in their lifes and have nothing special or important to do .
They got a lot of time , but they do n't spend it doing nice stuff .
In my experience young people just have to do something , they do n't like it to sit at home all the time and do nothing , it 's the most boring thing for young people .
Their lifes are just uncompleted , they have to make experiences in every case of life .
Because of this they see life different than old peole do .
Young people want to live life , they have to reach several goals , like graduating school/university , getting a good job and having a good career .
Because of this they live life different .
Moreover the environment has changed , young people have more possibilities to do anything , like going to clubs and dance or different sport activities .
Because they 're young they want to have something like an adventure in their life , so they spend their time different , trying several things and spending their time useful .
In this case I can talk about myself .
I like it to try new things , evereyday is a new possibility for me to receive something new , to make a new experience , to learn more for my life .
Because old people have done most of these things during their youngness , they do n't have a lot of fields of interest .
Even if they have special interests , they ca n't do much stuff , being old is hard , so their body is n't strong enough for a lot of activities .
Old people get tired quickly and because of this they do n't like to do anything hard .
They mostly even do n't know how to spend their time .
In this case young people have luck , they mostly can do everything they want to and they purely enjoy it .
I 'm sure when I am old I wo n't enjoy life .
In my opinion being young is the best thing which can happen , because everything is than possible .
