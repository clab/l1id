Nowadays , companies in the growing competitive environment have started to focus on more effective advertisement techniques .
To present their products better they have begun to show a lot of aspects of their products .
While some people claim that by doing that companies are overpresenting the quality or the purpose of their products , some people think that companies try to show product 's features as close as possible to the reality .
In the improved industrial societies , i do n't think advertisements would make products seem much better that they really are for the following reasons .

First , the main purpose of the advertisement is to sell the product .
However , today there is something called customer satisfaction in the corporate world .
If the customer percevies the product of much better quality .
Then , as he uses the product , if he ca n't get the quality that he was expecting , the first to suffer from that would be the company .
Therefore , in todays competitive corporate world , i do n't think any company would take the risk of losing the customers .
Moreover , the improved and new consumer protection laws prevent the companies from frauding the customer by penalizing those actions .
According to the law , company that provides the product or service should inform the consumer fully before entering into sales contract or transaction .

To conclude , main idea of the advertising is to make the product attractive but not seem better than they are .
Not only the increased protection of consumers by laws , but also the increased competition among companies over the market share by raising the customer satisfaction and having loyal customers will prevent the companies to make their products look better than they really are .
