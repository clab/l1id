In twenty years , I believe that there will be more cars in use than there are in today .
However , there will be not such a huge difference .
The difference will be about the car types .
With the reason of limited petrol sources , the car manufacturers are already focused on different type of cars that run with different power like a electricity .

Furthermore , the usage of car , needs to be analsyzed under the type of customers expactatitons .
The answer of the following question may give us clearer idea , `` Why do the people need a car ? ''
Transportation , more comfortable , time saving are the sample reasons that the people always would have one .

With the link question that I sated above , there are hundreds of different brands available in the market .
It is not just about the brand also about different type of cars like luxury class , racing , diesel-economical , small or vagoon , etc .

The another reason that there will be more cars in twenty years is high competitive market .
If we look at any magazine or newspaper , we can easily see many different advertisements everyday .
The car manufacturer always come up with better deal and better quality of product .

As a summary , I do not agree that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The reason of finding different type power sources and also car manufactures ' reasonable offers will always create a wish for consumer to have a car .
