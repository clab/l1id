A person can enhance his academic knowledge in two ways .
These are having a broad knowledge of many subjects and specializing in one specific subject .
Both of these ways have their own advantages and disadvantages .
However , I think that having general information about different topics has more advantages compared to specializing in one specific subject .

In one hand , knowing general things about many subjects may increase a student 's overall perception of topics around .
Having a general perception of different subjects is also a way taken by ancient Greek scientists .
If we examine their life and researches , we find out that there is no scientist which just specialized and worked for a particular subject .
With having broad knowledge about different topics , they have founded the main elements of our civilization .
But in our world , people sometimes need specialized partners in order to accomplish a part of the project that was designed to be built simultaneously by different people who know their subject very well .

On the other hand , specializing in one particular area may also increase a person 's academic knowledge .
Specialized people are less prone to errors in their particular area than people who have general information about that particular area .
However specializing have a negative effect on inventing new things .
When somebody is specialized in one particular area , it is sometimes hard to find innovative things due to a lack of general knowledge about different subjects .
The process of invention most of the time requires knowledge about different disciplines .
The areas of science like biochemistry and electromechanics are great examples of these .

In conclusion , I think having broad knowledge about different subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject .
It increases the ability to invent and helps to see the big picture more neatly where specializing produces identical people .
