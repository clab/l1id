In the world every person tries to do something and wants to be successful with the work they do .
Some of them tries it very hard and become successful and some of them tries to do their best but it would not be enough .
In time , successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well but the others continue with the unsuccessful works .

First of all , if a succesful person goes on with the same work for all the time , that person would get bored in a short period of time and become useless and unsuccessful at that work too , but if he explores new ideas he would be more successful than his previous work .

Second , success always brings the curiosity within and that is why people became successful , they always want to know more and they reach the solution .
For example , scientists always work and try to find what is best for the human being or what kind of things make ourlives easier ?
If they do not have that curiosity then they will not reach any results .
So they will not be successful .

Third , in life everything is about taking risks .
If someone is afraid of taking risks how could this world go further ?
How can we know what is good or bad for us ?
So , taking risks is important and it will help people to be successful and it gives the courage to people to try new things instead of doing what they already know how to do well .

As a result , without successful people world can not develop and people can not learn new things .
That is why risks create successful people and successful people always creates new things and these new informations help world to develop and go further .
