I believe and I have observed that successful people always try new things and more importantly do not hesitate to take risk .
This is the way how people see and meet new opputunities waiting somewhere to pick it up .

Eventhough trying new things and being open to changes are fearfull to most people , I think this is the one seperating those who govern and others who are governed .
I also strongly believe that taking risk is the key to success espicially in busuness .
For example , my big brother resigned from his job in Turkey and went to United States for his graduate study .
Some people who never want to try new things and always doing the same stuff forever blame dmy brother as foolish because he was trying something new and taking risk .
However , in the long term , my brother completed his study in the US and now has become a director in an oil company currently running in Russia and making a lot of money .
Those who blamed my brother still do the same job with fixed salary and closed vision .

Now the world in which we are living has become a small village and is changing in every hour in terms of rules and ways which we live \ which we do business , and so on .
Even if we do not want to try new things , I believe , the current conditions are forcing us to change , try new things and taking risk .
I have several friends doing business in different part of the country .
I clearly certain that those who did new things addressing taste and preferences of custoners , for instance , have been winners at the end of the day .
Nevertheless , some of my friends who do not like taking risk lost their business .
I have an specific but trategic example with one of my friends doing s'lver business in Ankara .
I strongly urged him that he had to try new markets especially foreign markets for his products he was producing .
In addition , he gad to take some risk for losing money .
He chose his old way and avodid new things .
Unfortunuately .
his business is noe dead .

In summury , I am in favor of trying new things and taking risk .
So that we will be able to improve our personel attidutes and busnisses .
This is the way how we can prepare ourselves for future .
