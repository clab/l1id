The twenty first century is the era that lots of discoveries done for the sake of the human-being .
This is done by scientific improvements in lots of areas .
But how are these improvements done ?
By the scientists knowing things about many subjects or by the scientists specialized to only a single area .
Since lots of special subjects about a single topic could be seen nowadays , it must be noted that improvements done by the specialized scientists .

First of all , if we think of the history of science , the scientists of that era had ideas abut lots of issues such as mathematics , physics , chemistry and so forth .
However , one sould keep in mind that there were fewer things discovered until that time for that era .
As a result ; even though the previous scientists were not be specialized to one area , that does not mean that today 's discoveries have not been done by specialized scientists .

As mentioned before , lots of subjects could be observed about a special topic or area .
For instance , if we think of Electrics and Electronics , one could be drowned in lots of areas which are Telecommunications , Electromagnetic Waves , Power Electronics and so forth .
In addition to this , if we think of the history , we cannot talk about electronics before 1960's when the semiconducting devices were first used .
As a result , by the improvements in Electrics and Electronics with the specialization to these areas , the humanity has a easier life .
For instance , would not be so hard to live without mostly used devices which are cell phones which are products of telecommunications .

If we think of eyes which are the cameras to the enviroment for the human-being .
If we deeply analyze what is in the eye , we must note the importance of retina , cornea , eye lens and so forth .
For instance , the people suffering from diabetics may lose their visions due to problems in the retina .
Or simply , if we think of contact lenses which could be used as artificial lens , these are improving visions of millions of people .
To summarize , all these about the eye could be done only by specialization .

To conclude , since a single human being cannot know or remmeber the whole idea about one issue , it is important to specialize to one area .
As a result , more improvements could be done about that area and as a result about that issue .
