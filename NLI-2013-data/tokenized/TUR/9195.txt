In a student life period and educational process students learn many ideas and facts .
Sometimes ideas and facts combine and can be learned together , sometimes we can learn them seperately .
Both of them are very important parts of education but , I disagree with the statement and in my opinion learning facts is more important than to understand ideas and concepts .

First of all , facts are more memorable things than ideas and concepts .
Facts can contain historical victories , new improvements and also something important that worht to remember .
Students can easily remember the facts that they are interested in and do n't forget easily in their lifetime .
For example , World War II is an important fact in world history and it is easy to learn this fact rather than the ideologies that caused the war .

Secondly , facts are more realistic things rather than ideologies .
You have proofs and historical documents about the connected fact , but ideas contain utopic and individual beliefs and values .
It is a little bit harder to understand these utopic values if we make a comparison with the learning facts as a learning process .

Furthermore , learning facts is more impressive about taking interest in the issue .
Ideas and concepts make them curious only who are interested in the issue such as Aristotle ' s philosophy .
But facts are more general things and can take more interest rather than ideas and concepts .

To sum up , I believe learnin facts are more important than understanding ideas and concepts
