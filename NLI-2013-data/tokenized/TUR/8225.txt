We ca n't undertand each others and also new ideas .
In my opinion , this is the biggest problem for global world .
I strongly agree with the statement that `` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts . ''

First of all , students have to learn ideas before the effects .
Because if they did n't learn the idea ofcourse they ca n't guess the effects .
The biggest scientist Einstein said : `` understanding problem is fifty percent equal to solving problem '' .
The biggest example comes to mind is my college years .
I 'm Industrial engineer and I wrote 2 books about lean production and value stream mapping .
I went to Ford 's factory but I could n't make a good job because I had n't understand the Ford 's manufacture system .
When I solve the system I catched lots of mistake in the productions .

Second of all , if students understand the idea after they try to learn this ideas effects and they check the effects for daily life .
When I learned the game theory for economy firstly I started to use for my own company and I learned all effects .
