In today 's highly mobilized society , cars have become an indispensible part of daily life .
It is now common in most families to have multiple cars , one for each member of the family .
However , while enjoying the innumerable advantages that cars bring to their lives people are becoming more and more aware of the down sides of having so many cars .
Considering this point , I agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in the future than there are today .

The biggest price that today 's societies are paying for the convenience of having so many cars is definitely the deteriorating environmental conditions .
Cars probably have the largest contribution to air pollution among all the technological advancements that we can think of .
In the recent years , on the other hand , environmental awareness has been awakened by means of international treaties , scientific research and public advertising .
In my opinion , therefore , these efforts will have far reaching consequences and make future generations more sensitive on the issue .

What effects an individual directly , however , is not the global environment that he must do his part to protest but more than that the expenses that comes along with having a car .
As the organic energy sources on the planet diminish , oil prices will keep increasing , possibly at higher rates .
In the end , it will probably reach such to limits where people will be willing to give up their comfort in favor of their pocket .

The final point that I 'd like to make to support my argument is the gigantic technological advencement that we are witnessing in the fields of computers and the Internet .
Nowadays , one can work , buy , sell , communicate , read the daily paper and do much more on his computer without leaving the house .
This , however inadvantageous it might be for the health of the society , will surely have an effect in cutting down the number of cars that people have .
After all , what 's the point of having a car if you are only going to use it once a year to take it to the mechanic for its annual check ?
