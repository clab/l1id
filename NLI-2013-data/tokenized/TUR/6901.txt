We all know that technology is the most rapidly developing thing in the world and who can predict how we will live after twenty years from now !
It is really hard to tell what will future bring us .
Twenty years from now , is a very long time and I think everything that seems imposibble today might be normal in daily life in future .
This includes the use of cars , of course .
I think I am not agree with the idea that fewer car wil be in use in a twenty years time period .
Because the 21 th century is the century of the speed .
People even today are always worried for not to be late to go from some place to another .
This is usually cause a big stress to people .
I close my eyes and can imagine the time 20 years from now .
What I see are people that are more faster and hurrying around than today 's people .
In my opinion people of future will need much faster cars than today 's cars .
Furtermore they will need much more cars than they need today .
Because the number of the people is increasing day by day , rapidly .
In order to support the increasing people 's need the number of the cars will increase , either .

Another thing that supports my idea above is the globallism .
The trade and the communication between counties are speading every day .
This globallism will cause an increase in transportation between countries around the world .
In order to transport easily and quickly from one place to another there will be more heavy transportation cars such as tracks exc .

I think these are all to say in order to support my idea that 20 years from now there will be more cars than today .
May be cars will change and may be they look diffrent but this wiil not change the fact that their number will increase .
