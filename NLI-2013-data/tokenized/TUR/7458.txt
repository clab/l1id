When it comes to travel it is very significant to choose how to travel .
in a group led by a tour guide or other ways .
i agree that the best way to travel is to use help of a guide .

The most benefit of traveling in a group led by tour guide is that you are twice likely to learn more abot where you visit. a guide can help you to discover more details .
rather than observing superficially .
you can have opportunity to benefit from a tour guide .
due to their experience tour guides can have more knowledge than you have .
For examlple i recently visited to spain .
although i studied international relationship .
after visiting to spain i acknowledged the fact that without using a tour guide help i could not comform my knowledge about spain whether or not correct .
tour guide helped me tremendously to explore spain .

in addition , you can remove risk of getting lost .
i have experienced this reality .
although it seems to have less possibilities .
If you do not use help of tour guide .
because of lack of knowledge about place where you go .
i visited to turkey years ago .
i did not have idea about istanbul where crime rate high .
i was mugged .
while i was following criminal .
predictably i got lost .
it took two days to reach my hotel As a result i prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide .
Because it has alot of benefit such as getting more information about where yiu go also remove risk of lost
