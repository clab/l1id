Real enjoymen People have been traveling along with our history because of numerous reason .
Learning or experiencing new cultures , business , religion can be some of these many reason .
While we 're traveling , we need help about destination , adddress , food , history and social life because we 're not at home and we 're not familiar with that en - roment .
At that point , he 'll be in your service like in the Indiana Jones movies .
You can be disagree for going some in your country but when you choose somewhere totally differrent you have to admit , you will need assistance like guide , you will need guidance .
it is like a flash light in the dark for that reason .
Above all , we have to figure out group needs leader and your guide can be the only leader because he/she knows the history of Greek temple or palace of queen .
Not only the knowledge of history , where the best club or best restaurant which one is cheaper and serve better .
If you pay some amount for your guide more , you can get pretty good deal in whole travel .
In group , I think the biggest challenge is the harmony and cordi - nation of time and destination which is related with whole enjoy - ment.His/her experience and connection with local restaurants , clubs , resort hotel , carpet stores can be the deal of your trip .
You can go to Bolivia and you can look for handmade alpaco hats and local colrful clothes , you can pay a lot for over priced fake products and you can miss whole unique and genuine hand craf - ted local products just because of your ignorance .
Go to Turkey , try to find some nice carpets and kilims , without guide , you will be cheated easily .
In brief , try to get some help .
