I do n't agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do , i believe the opposite statement which expresses that older people enjoy life more than younger people do .

Because i believe there are several reasons that prevent youngers to be more effective in their own lives which can be based on the fact that the young people should spend much time by studying for exams or by having stress because of the uncertainity of what they will confront in their future .
Time that passes too fast , has a strong pressure on youngers which prevents to enjoy from their lives .

But when we think of a 60 year old adult who had earned enough money till that age of her life and prepared a good opportunity to be able to supply a good education to their children , has her peace and she has no more challenges with life any longer .
Therefore , she has a huge time to have fun , and nothing to loose except money .

Besides , because of the fact that time passes so fast , a 60 year old adult does n't think of anything else except having a great time till her death .
As the person feels that death is sooner coming , there wo n't be any other struggles or any fights with life whatever the reason is .

As i give my mother as an example , she is a typical retired teacher who has enough money to live , and has no responsibility for looking after a child .
For that reason she feels free to live without thinking of any doubths or fears .
She is going to trips with her friends and having great time with self satisfaction .
She lives her own by the power of not having huge responsibilities such as earning money or looking after a child .

Consequnetly i can express that when i look forward future , i would rather to be more older just in case to be able to be more effective in life , by not just trying to do what life requires and also to do things for myself either .
