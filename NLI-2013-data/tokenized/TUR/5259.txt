Lately there has been an ongoing debate over whether or not most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .
Some people are of the opinion that ads represent a great opportunity for manipulation with regard to certain products while others contend that ads cannot change the nature of the products they are presenting and are therefore not manipulative .
A close examination of the issue reveals that the statement which asserts that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are is unsubstantiated .

A main reason why such a claim has its limits is the fact that the advertisement industry is regulated .
The state decides about what can and ca n't be said in ads by legislating about ads and competition .
That makes an advertisement susceptible to lawsuits : An angry consumer who thinks that a certain ad has mislead her can sue the advertising company .
Since advertising companies are aware of that , they will try not to make false claims about the products they advertise for .

Another reason why the claim about advertisements and their misleading status does n't hold is that most ads do not actually inform about the products , but that they rather encompass certain images and emotions which are associated with the product they are trying to sell .
How many ads about ice-creams include the nutrition facts ?
The answer is none .
And since most ads do not inform anyway , it is impossible for them to make products appear better than they actually are .

Perhaps the most convincing reason why the great majority of ads is not misleading is that an appraisal of a product 's quality is in most cases subjective .
For instance , some people like onion soup while others hate it .
Some people would immediately switch the channel when they encounter an onion-soup-ad while others probably would enjoy watching it .
So , one 's perception of an advertisement undoubtedly depends on her subjective attitude toward the product .
This subjective attitude would almost certainly affect the degree to which one would find the ad deceptive .

In conclusion , the claim that most ads make products seem better than they actually are is unsubstantiated for three reasons : State regulation , the advertisement 's non-informative nature and the subjectivity of advertisement-appraisal .
