There is great debate on the academic arena about whether to have broad kowledge on many academic disciplines or to specialize in one specific subject .
Nowadays , people are highly puzzled with this question and are having difficulties to choose their path .
Depending on my personal experience and the conjuncture of today 's world I would definetely claim that specializing in one specific subject is more beneficial to one .

To begin with , globalisation is at its peak on the 21st century .
This fact brings a lot of communication tools like television , cable TV , internet , ...
etc .
All these sources of communication feed people with information .
Although , load of information sometimes creates confusion still it makes an awareness .
Thus , in the globalised world more people know more things on more issues .
In other words , most of the people became able to have a say on any issue with the information coming from communication sources .
This , made the `` general information '' less valuable .

In the past , there was no internet or TV .
Access to information was valuable .
Thus , being able to talk on any issue was a virtue .
Nowadays , having general information is accepted as something normal .
So , it is expected from people to say more professional and more specific things about their issue which makes the specialization in one specific subject necessary .

Secondly , I am an International Relations student at a university .
I am planning to graduate this year .
However , I realized that I would face difficulties in finding a job .
The reason is that when I graduate from this department I would be able to say something on every issue without being a specialst on any of them .
To illustrate , I know something about microeconomics and macroeconomics - because I took that lectures during my 4 year education - but I am not an economist .
Just in the same way , I know about psychology and sociology a little but I am not a psychologist or sociologist .
All these facts made me aware that I have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects but I need to specialize .
Thus , I decided to apply for a master 's degree .
This illustration well explains why specializing is a better choice .

In conclusion , the new conjucture of the world which came through the process of globalisation and my personal experience prooves that specialization is a better choice that having a broad knowledge on many academic subjects .
The increasing demands of people on having a master 's degree in todays world would be another proof of this necessity .
