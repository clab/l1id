In my opinion , in education , in order to fully understand and deeply explore an issue , it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .

To begin with , learning facts , although important , is not sufficent for a student to develop a complete understanding of the subject .
It is not possible to evaluate the facts without grasping the underlying idea .
The knowledge of the facts without knowing what caused them and why is hard to be considered whole .

Secondly , without understanding the ideas and the concepts , the student will fail to apply the knowledge he or she has gained to changing facts .
As long as the main idea is understood , the student will not struggle even if he or she faces a problem with different facts .

Lastly , the facts learned as a student can be easily forgotten following the end of the education .
However , if one understands the key ideas and concepts , these will guide him or her to recall the information he/she gained during education .
Exploring ideas and concepts will enable one to develop a strong notion of the subject studied , which is what makes one a successful professional .

In conclusion , as a lawyer who always has to be guided by main ideas and concepts in the face of unique facts of each event , I believe that , for a student , understading ideas and concepts is the most important part of the education .
