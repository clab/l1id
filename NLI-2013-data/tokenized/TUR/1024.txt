In my university , most of the students tend to complete their studies in the field that they started , and they direct their minds into one specific subject without going out of it .
For students this easy path always give many advantages on their own fields .
However , without any interaction with other subjects academic life might be too mediocre .

Students who satisfy all the offered courses in one subject have a good chance to enhance in that subject , and they can easily follow what is required for them because the curriculum is already determined for them .
For example , during the whole of his/her undergraduate study , a student who studies in Department of Mathematic must register for a certain number of credits or courses which are all related to mathematics .
Such a person whose mind is full of mathematical problems might be a very reputed academician or scientist in the future , but he/she loses the chance of learning different subjects and relating and developing them .

On the other hand , one who tries to get a broad knowledge of various academic fields can use those subjects with each other .
In other words , one specific subject can help to develop another .
For instance , although I studied philosophy at the university , in the second year of my study I chose to register for a minor program on Architectrue .
This gave me o good chance to interprete architectural productions in a philosophical way .
I gained a chance to investigate architectural effects on human .

In conclusion , even though specializtion on a single subject might be useful within that subject , for me it is more enjoyable and interesting to specialize in avariety of subjects .
This provides me to create my own style in the academy .
