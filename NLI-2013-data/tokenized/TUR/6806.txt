In this contemporary world it is inevitable to be away from the tecnologigal developments and the facilities the life presents us .
One of these is of course the cars whigh make our life easier and time-saving .
Some say that in twenty years time there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I actually disagree with this opinion because I believe that in this rapid change of the world noone can prevent the surprising innovations to be appeared on this very big stage of earth .
Thus , some people , such as scientists , manufacturers , governments and the consumers also , wil urgently have to take some precautions as soon as possible ; otherwise the people living on earth can be face to face several harms and disadvantages of having that much of cars where they live .

First , there is a very overwhelming problem that must be taken into consideration on global base , that is pollution .
Too many cars mean too much environmental problem .
As a solution to this problem governments should put great importance onto the public trasportation systems .
It wo n't merely solve the problem , but it will also be much more econemical at the same time .

Secondly , perhaps in twent years ' time , throughout which noone can be sure about what hi-tec movements se are going to see , people may be using some other ways of transportation instead of having cars .
Moreover , if this can not happen , there wo n't be even a bit of empty space
