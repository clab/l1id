The development of humanity causes new problems to be solved by the society .
The way people act change as new generations come to life .
A new generation means new trends , values , and behaviors .
As a matter of fact , these changes are not always positive ones .
The youth today faces a variety of problems .
An important concern about young people is that they do not give enough time to helping their communities .

All children evolve into young adults during the process of their growth .
It is a self challenging process for many , a time peroid when an individual discovers his tastes , ideas , beliefs and most importantly his place in the society .
The usual respond to this findings is a denial .
Many teenagers would rebel against the system , thinking that they should have more freedom to express themselves .
This is quite understandable in most cases ; however , individualism could turn into a dangerous ideology if precautions are not taken .
For example , a young person might reason that he does not have to keep the streets clean because he did not make them dirty , or he might find himself believing in the idea that old people do not deserve help because they have no practical use .
In addition , there many distractions made to young people 's lives .
All new technology , DVDs , video games and stereos make it impossible for the youth to be aware of community 's problems .
Sadly , more young people come materialistic each day ; less and less teenagers have interest in world issues and politics .
Young people , in essence , are unfortunately slaves of conformity .
Their goal is to be `` cool '' .
Helping the community and becoming responsible people are not considered as `` cool '' by young people .
Inevitably , young people start to do things that are imposed on them by their friends , which eventually leads to a decrease in their involvement in their communities .

The values and ideologies of young people sometimes lead them into wrong paths .
Nowadays , the youth is careless about their community and its needs .
Surely change is an inevitable characteristic of life that is going to affect everyone in the world .
The youth 's attitude has changed over time and became more aggressive .
It is vital to educate and rise up the youth in a way that guarantees the future of our world
