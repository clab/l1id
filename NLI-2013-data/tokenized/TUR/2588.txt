Young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Being a young person and comparing my self to my grandparents , I have some reasons to support that idea .
First of all , younger people do n't face that many difficulties from the beginning of their life .
As the time passes by , we learn the life and we face difficulties , sadness , heartbreaks and so on .
And this can steal a lot from someone 's energy for living .

Secondly just because young people have more time to live ( in normal conditions ) , they have more time to make their dreams come true .
So they do n't stop expecting and this makes them better enjoy the life .
But for example my grand father who 's already 83 years old , do n't have any expactation .
He thinks that he will die soon , he lost his power and will for life .

Also , if not married , young people do n't have as many responsabilities as they would have when they get married .
They do n't need to think of their children .
When they want to do someting , for example travelling , they do n't need to think if they need to take care of someone who 's staying home .
But for example for my parents it is never easy to do immediately what they want to do .
They think of me and my brother , they think if we need them they can not be on our side and this makes feel them bad .
Also my father has big responsabilities of his work , he ca n't quit whenever he wants to .

Finally , it is also very common that older people have more health problems .
As they get older , they are coming closer to the end of life and this gives them bad feeelings and keeps them away from enjoying the life .

In conclusion , I would say that even if I will get older , I never want to stop enjoying life .
If I 'm retired and in good financial situation , I can travel to see the world , I can keep expacting for my children or even grand children and if I have the power , I would spend my energy for the charity foundations .
I believe making other people happy and providing them a better life would always make me enjoying the time I 'm living .
