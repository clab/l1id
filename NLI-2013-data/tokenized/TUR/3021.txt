Both young and older people can enjoy life but i think younger ones will enjoy it more .
Young people have fresh energy to use and they can do whatever they want .
They can do some activities for adrenaline .
For example bungee jumping , to jump to sea from high rocks , dance untill morning etc .
Older people can do these easyly .
Their energy will not be enough for these .
Also they will have a family to look after .
And they need to pay the bills .
So they can not use the money how they like to .

But younger people need money just to have fun .
They do not need to pay bills or they do not need to look after a family .
They need money to go travel , drink beer , have fun with girls , going to disco etc .

Lets think an old man aged 70 and a young boy aged 20 .
There will be an important thing that the old man can not do in that age .
This is sex .
I think sex is the most enjoyable part of our life .
Only this opinion can make me to support that young people will enjoy life than older people do .

Older people always think about to work , to eat , to sleep and maybe to travel in their minds .
They use most percentage of their mind to do these .
And only a little part to have fun .
Young people always think about where to go this night , which girl i must date with , which film i can watch today or to do a party at the weekend or not .

All in all younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
Because they have high level of energy , or no family to look after .
They can do what they want .
They can do when they want .
