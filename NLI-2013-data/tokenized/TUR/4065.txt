Helping the comunity you live in , does not necessarily mean to allot more time helping the older people or reading to blind .
There are also indirect ways that young people will contribute their comunity to foster .
These indirect ways may seem inmeasurable in the first place , but actualy are more contributing than any other means of direct help .

Young people spend most of their time for doing popular things such as dancing , singing even playing video games .
But popular things arouse intrest of the comunity which makes them profitable for the mass media .
And therefore singing .
dancing and even video game contest are shown on TVs .
This contest enables young people to become a celebrity only by exceling in the popular things that they like .
Celerities bring many contributions to where they live .
People visit the places where a famous celebrity is born .
In turn of this touristic attraction the local economy will boost and bring new job opportunities to the community .

Moreover spending more time for individual development rather than for social contributuions to the community will enable young people to become more capable and respected individuals in the future .
If young people direct their energy for intellectual excellence they will cultivate a better future for both them selves and the comunity they live in .
The contributiuon a young may do is very limited when compared to a rich , respected and powerful person can do who is willing to help his society .

To sum up , young people should their best to become someone in the first place so that they will also help their community .
