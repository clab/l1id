I agree w ?
th the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The facts are forgetten easily but concepts and ideas are more permanent than facts .

When I was at high school I took lots of lectures that are h ?
story , geography , maths , biology and etc .
I was actually a successful student and all my exam grades were really high .
however there was a problem .
When I did not attend to the class I was stud ?
ng before the exam , Actually I d ?
d not learn subjects in detail just knew what they were .
Thus I passed all the classes with high grades .
When I came to university I recognized that I d ?
d not understand many concepts well .
I have just known the names or dates but why they are important is a question in my mind .
Somet ?
mes ?
n class teacher asks someth ?
ng that must be learned before but I cannot remember even the main points .
The only lesson that I am favor ?
n ?
s maths which I really worked hard and examined many hypothesis and concepts deeply during high school .
In many lectures I benefit from my knowlodge related to maths , so I am pleased to learn the maths well in the past .
Furthermore it proves the importance of understanding ideas and concepts when working on something .

Students cannot understand the importance of this matter themselves , so instructions should be responsible for teaching something in an understanting way .
