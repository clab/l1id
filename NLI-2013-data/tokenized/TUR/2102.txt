the age is not the basic thing when the topic ic enjoying life .
if a person is optimistic in his nature whatever his age is he can not enjoy life .

young people have more energy to live and willingness to do things about life .
but it does not show that they enjoy life more .
most of the old poeple are smiling more than young people .
especially in the last 10 or 20 years most of the young people have lost their energy to live .
they are more depressive and optimistic than earlier generations .
they do not satisfy from anything they get .
they always want more and more .
earlier generations know to satify with the things they have .
and they could be happy even by a small surprise .
it is because the new era we live in which directs us to consume everything we see and have .
so our children does not know how to be happy and how to enjoy life .
they spend their energy to consume only .

by this situation we can say that our older people enjoy life more .
when you look around yourself you will see that in the places where nature fresh air the proof of life stands there are older people more then younger ones .
younger people are the shopping malls cinemasor at the take aways .
so how can we say that they know how to enjoy life .
they even do not know the source of life the mother earth .
they only see things on tv .
they do not speak and smile much .
they thought they are cool and carismatic by not smiling .
but enjoying life is smiling laughing .
younger people do not curious about thing around them .
they got used to consume the things given to them .
but you have to be curious about life to be able to enjoy it .

in conclusion may be we can say that 20 years ago younger people enjoy life more but not nowadays and it does not seem they will in the future .
