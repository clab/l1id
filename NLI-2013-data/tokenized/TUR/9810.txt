If you ask people , who have success in their work , to change the work and do something else or go to another country , they will not be afraid of doing this .
Because they have success and want to be more successful .
So I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks .

People who have success want to be more successful by doing more things and especially different things in order to show that they are successful in every branche .
They may have a complex or so but they think they have to show everybody that they are successful in their work .

Some people would change the country to be more successful in their life .
For example the person is very successful in Europe and now wants to be also successful in America .
Step by step this person will work and do everything to be more successful and to show the word that he / she is a grand person .
So that the person can be proid of herself / himself .

In some cases families will be destroyed because the parents want to be successful .
Having nothing in the mind only to be successful in life , parents could forget their children .
They do not forget their children but they do not see the importance of their children and that they need love and other things like that .
With leaving the family a person risks a very big importance in the life because to have a family is one of the biggest and best things you ever would get .

And why should a successful person do something that he or she already know how to do it ?
In my opinion this would not be interesting for a successful person because these people want to be more and more successful in there work and every part in there life .
So they have to discover ther things that are for they unknown to show uo other pe
