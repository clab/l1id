Does having knowledge in all types of academic subjects is better than being an expert on only one single subject ?
Actually I both agree and disagree about it .
Because both of them has advantages in some sort of areas .

A person must always try to learn more and more in my opinion .
Because it is a key to success .
A person who is able to speak about every subject gets respect from people .
Because by this he/she can prove himself to everyone in every field .
For example in social life or in bussines .
If a person has an idea and thoughts about every argument or debate he is in , he will just keep getting respect from people .
I am not saying that a person must be a genius in every fields .
He only has to gain some information to prove that he has thoughts to be considered by people .
If you want to be taken serious by them you must gain respect and this is a way for it .

But a person who is an expert on what he does as a job , gets respect in only his field .
But this is not a disadvantage for the person because it is an aim which he should have .
For example , a plactic surgeon who has mastered in his field , gets more patients .
The patients who are satisfied by his work tells his name to their friends and this chain will go on and on .
By this , the surgeon will have a good reputation .
And this reputation he has will return him by more patients .
And the surgeon will be successful in his main aim by working as a surgeon : making money for a living .

In my opinion a person must have knowledge in every areas of work , arts , academic subjects etc. to gain respect in social life .
But he/she must has to be a master in his area which he does as a job if he wants to gain respect from community .
