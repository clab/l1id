I did not agree with this statement .
Actually , I give more value to facts .
I think without knowing facts , one can not analyze ideas or concepts .
Then you will only memory , not understand .

If you really want to learn the ideas and concepts about sth , first you should learn all the facts about it .
Then you can be ready to understand and discuss both the given ideas and concepts .

However , I understand the reasons behind this .
As everybody , the students want get good marks without studying hard .
That why we choose to learn only the things that will be asked to us .
If they ask to write the ideas and concepts instead of let 's say argue this concept or state whether you approve or disapprove this and that ideas , naturally a student pays no attention to learn the fact .
Obviously , he or she will prefer to memory the ideas and concepts about a subject and then he or she will get a good mark .
That 's what I have faced many times when I was at high school .
This was the first reason actually .

The second reason is that many resources do not cover enough facts , mostly they embraces the results or the consequences .
There is not a chance to cover all of the facts .

The students choose learn ideas and concept due to the education system .
They teach us how to memory not to discuss .
