ILLUSION

Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
This a kind of illusion .
As everybody knows , advertisement is very important .
This method is used every part of job .
Also , it is useful for selling better .
When you show a product 's advert , it may be affect you because you can see only good sides of product and you decide to buy it .
When you start to use it , you begin to recognize bad sides of it .
You feel yourself bad but seller do her/his job good .

Some people do their job only for money .
They do n't think anything without money .
They make a beautiful and effective advertisement and then they start to sell it .
In contrast some people do their job well without thinking money too much .
They try very much how they can do their product best .

According to some people , if there are lots of advertisement about one product , it might be bad and useless .
Because if product need to advert , something must be wrong .
People do n't want to buy it so there are lots of advert in order to courage people to buy .
If people think like that , they do n't buy and do n't feel theirshelves bad .

On the other hand , everyone does n't think like that .
Some people like to follow new product from advert .
So adverts are so important for them .
I do n't mean every product which has so advert is useless , of course there are lots of good and useful products among them .
The main thing is make a perfect choice .

Trying is good .
If you do n't like the product which you see from the advert , you do n't have to use it again .
You change your idea and buy the other .
This is simple but only for unexpensive things .
Therefore you should be careful what you buy and which features does it has .
