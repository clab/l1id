Whether or not successful people try new things and take risks is a complex issue .
While someone might argue that only doing the the things what they already know how to do well provides them a lot of advantages , it can also be said that trying new things and taking risks can lead them to way of success .
Both sides of the issue have advantages and disadvantages but i think that trying new things and taking risks is the better choice .

First of all , at present we live in a world where every thing is getting harder day by day .
It is getting harder to go to university , if you can go to universtiy this time it is hard to find a new job for yourself .
Furthermore there are thousands of people who does almost the same things as you do .
That is , if you are a bank worker there are thousands more bank workers who do the same things as you do everyday .
At this point what differ you from the rest is your courage .
If you are strong enough to take risks and try new things u can open up the way of success .
Forexample maybe you borned in a farmer family and grew up in a rural area however it is not your destiny to be a farmer if you are strong enough to choose the way of studying and working hard you can open up a small company and be the boss of your own company and maybe you will have chance to be a boss of a huge company which trades with thousands of firms from allover the world

Last but not least , life is a risk on its own .
Nobody can know that what will happen a minute later .
Therefore , we can not predict what can happen as a result of a decision we make .
We are the only one who can be ended it .
While we spend enough energy and time over the steps we decided to take we can be successful at the end .
Forexample , you can start with a bussiness of trade if you really work to achieve something there is no reason left for being unsuccessful .
Only u have to work on it hard and do not give up against the problems

Overall , i think that successful people try new things because they know that clear u can not reach the top with the things everybody does .
trying new things is the key of the way of success .
