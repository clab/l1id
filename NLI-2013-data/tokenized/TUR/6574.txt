No i do not agree with this statement .
I belive that there are many reasons why there will not be fewer cars in twenty years , some of which are that : Firstly , twenty years is not exactly a long period of time so i do not believe that in this period , scientists will be able to invent new ways or methods of transport for the millions of people using cars .
Even if they did have ideas and samples of inventions , it would either take to long to put into practice for the public or simply too expensive for many people ot use .
In addition to all of this , many people are simply content with using cars nowadays so therefore there is not so much of a concern in finding news means of transport but more of an effective one .
Cars are still in use .
The only difference nowadays is that scientists are trying ot find more effective and environmentally friendly sources to use in cars .
So there probably would not be a decline in the number of cars used but a decline in the number of inneffective cars in use .
For this reason there will probably not be much of a difference in twenty years .

Also , if anything , there will probably be more cars on the road in twenty years .
Due to the poplutation increases globally , there will probably be an increase in demand for cars , with respect to transport for people .
This increase in people will probably reuslt in the urgence to find new means of transport but twenty years is not a long enough period of time for such drastic changes .

So in conclusion , there will probably be many more cars running on the roads in twenty years which is the near future , then there are now .
