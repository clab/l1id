Learning facts and understanding ideas and concepts are the different ways of learning and they also need different kind of attentions .
I am a university student and I prefer learning facts rather than understanding the ideas and concepts .

I said they have different kind of attention and first I want to explain this .
When you try to understand ideas and concepts you generally spend more time .
You should cover whole issue to understand it .
Most professors try to use this method and while coming the important points of issue they are talking a lot .
In my opinion , they are giving unnecesery knowledge .
However , if professors just give the important parts of the subject than students may understand better and it would't take much time than talking about unnecessary things .

The second important thing that we should talk about is that the human brain can also concentrate 25-30 minutes at all .
That 's why on the 35th minute of lecture the student start to daydream while the professor just coming the most important part of subject .
If teachers want to teach better , they should stop talking and trying to cover the whole idea .
I insist on just giving the important parts of issue and then start to cover the subject while solving problems or debating for example .
This is more succesfull way to teach and more convenient for students , too .

To sum up , I totally disagree the way of undertanding ideas and concepts .
That is a less of time and time is more important that students .
Teachers should use time conveniently and just give the student the important parts not the whole of the subject .
