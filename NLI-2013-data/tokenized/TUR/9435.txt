In my opinion there are two types of students ; one is learning by searching the issues deeply and the others give up searching when they understood the ideas and concepts but it does not mean that to learn facts 's not important for students than understanding ideas and concepts .

Trying to understand the fact behind the particular issue help students to get a wider view about that issue .
This kind of behaviour also help students to learn questioning the reasons of events which are effecting whole lives of them .
But on the other hand to give up following the facts can not help us respond the problems .
By this way accepting the results becomes easier than solving the problems .

I can easily assert that understanding of facts is as important as important understanding the ideas because by questioning the events understanding also becomes more easier .
I mean that only understanding the concepts can not improve knowledge by itself also the importance of learning fact is great .
So I can easily say that many times a student should want to learn the intuitions lies behind the concepts .
It is like a sense of wonder and it is like a mean for development or improvement in life .

Education system also has a great affect to make students notice the importance of learning facts or reasons during their education period .
Because the strategy that they are taught in the school age will also effect the way of thinking during their lives .
So an education system should teach students to search a concept or an idea before accepting the it directly .
On the other hand it does not mean that understanding is not as important as learning fact .
It 's like a chain and should follow each other .
I mean that after understanding the concepts or ideas the other important process should be applied which is learning the intuition behind particular issue .

Consequently I am not agree with the following statement that understand ideas and concepts are more important than learning facts for students .
Process of learning facts is also very important for students .
Such a kind of learning strategy can lead to success in many areas in their lives of students .
