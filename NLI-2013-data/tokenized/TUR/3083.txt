The cycle of life has not changed since the begining of the time .
Every humanbeing borns , grows and dies ; but the most important thing in this preiod of time is to fill out your life in the most proper way which fits to you .

Every period of this life cycle has it 's own rules and conditions .
When you are a child you are not able to do whatever you want ; furthermore when you are a baby you are even not able to tell what you want .
This cycle of life may seem a little bit unfair to us but actually it is not .
At that period none of us has to take responsbility or none of us has to work for earning money , so may be those times were the easiest and most favorable parts of our lives .

If you are in the middle period of your life cycle ; I mean if you are a young person , you are able to do lots of things without permissions , warnings or even concerns .
As I mentioned before while you are young you are able to do whatever you want and even stupid or risky thinks ; but in this case one important limitation comes into play , which is your metabolism .
As a perspective explanation ; people are allowed to do things as long as their health and metobolism let them .
If you are a young person without disabilities ; there exists about nothing to stop you or prevent you from enoying the life .
You can go to swimming , you can go to scuba diving and you can even try bungee jumping ; but we all have to remember that we have only one limitation which is our health .

On the other hand if you are getting older and , if it has been a while since you passed the boundary line of middle cycle of your life ; it means that you are not that strong as you were at your previous years .
In this cycle people start to loose their strength and energy , moreover their metabolism gets slower and slower day by day .
This of course does not mean that these kind of people are not able to enjoy , but at the same time it means that noe these people have some health limitations and not able to do whatever that they want now .

In conclusion everybody in the World can enjoy the life ; but of course not in the same ratio or amount .
And who can deny that young people have a big advantage under these circumstances ?
