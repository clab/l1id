There are two ideas about knowledge .
One encourages the person to have extensive knowledge of his/her academic subject and the other thinks that one should have knowledge of many academic subjects .
The subject should be discussed in terms of the efficency that knowledge would enhance the person to .
Altough knowledge adds much to a persons general culture , specialization would let scientific truths to be turned on .

Broad academic knowledge , would give much to a person because of the ability that knowledge provides to think in different ways .
When a person gets to inforamation in different subjects , his ability of thinking improves .
The reason of this matter is that when a person learns about an academic subject , it is required to learn its logic behind too and the different logic lets the one of thinking in different ways .
In this way having a broad knowledge seems more effiecnt for a person .

Another subject that should be concerned is the general culture that a broad academic knowledge would come with .
This would both let the person to have a better social life and also provide him/her to get a knowledge about a veriety of subjects that he/she is interested in .

Despite the adventages of having a broad knowledhge , specializing on a specific academic subject has an adventage of leting one to know the nearly every information possible .
When a person specializes only on one matter , one could lead to new discoveries and improvements on the subject he or she is studying .
In this way , specializing in one specific subject would let one to go further to the limits of his/her subject .
Itlooks better than to have a broad knowledge because one could give something useful to the society by specializing .

To sum up , it would be better for individuals to make their own choises to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects or to speciazlize in one specific subject .
If to have a broad knowledge is choosen , that would provide on to have a nicer life full of different knowledge that may lead to different points of view but specializing on one subject would let the person to invent or to discover some improvements .
