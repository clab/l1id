While some people believe most advertisements do not make products seem much better than they really are , l agree this statement.l think there are three important reason to support this idea .
these are that to reach people is more esier and advertiser can show product diffirent with imitations and people do not have real information about products .

As far as l know almost everybody has one television or radio .
they can get all news from television or radio .
For instance l watch t.v almost every day at least two hours .
If people watch the same thing constantly after long time they believe imitated material on screen .

As a matter of fact television especially most effective tool. l beleive also that all people are not educated to evaluate all prosess on television .
they can accept all thing without thinking .

Another important reason is that l beleive advertiser get educational support to effect people .
They take advantage of opportunity .
They already have information how to influence people .
For example people have some weaknesses such as emotion or dramatic .
When we watch children who is carrying and listen to song so emotional backround we would like to do everythings .
we feell that is our responsibility .

Last reason is that as a society do not like read books about .
Proof is amount of buying news papers , so advertiser can exaggate news for selling their product .
we face to lack of the knowledge .
if we have some informations we can seperate which one is correct which one is wrong .

Because of these reasons l support that vision can be changed by advertiser .
However as a consumer we have to be more qualified .
They depend on our life style .
We have to spend time get rigth informations .
