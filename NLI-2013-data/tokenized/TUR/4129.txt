Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
This can be because of their selfish behaviors or not having enough time to help but it is obvious that this is not a positive signal for the furutre of a community .

When I was a student in a college , there were some students coming from villages .
They were going back to their families as soon as the holdays begin , to help their work on farms or etc .
Even this situation sometimes had bad effects on their lessons , they had never thought not to help .
Now , when I compare with the new generation , unfortunately the scene is not seems to me so helpful and willing .
They all say that , they do n't have enough time to help their parents even just for a few week during their summer holidays .

The situation is similar for the public buses also .
When I was a child , it was a pitty to sitting down when a pregnant lady or and old men is standing .
But today , young people are rarely give their seats to the others .

I think one of the reasons of this situation is depends on the changes of the games of children .
It was more training having team games than today 's personal computer games .
Team games are joyful as much as the personal games and also teaching children solving problems and living together .
Today 's old people are the children of past 's , and that 's why , we know helping and sharing more than the new generation .

Whatever the reason is , none of the excuses are acceptable for me .
Becasue I believe that as the time changes , people are becoming to have more theirself-centered life style .
