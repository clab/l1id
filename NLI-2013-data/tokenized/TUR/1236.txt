Having a broad knowledge of numerous academic subjects has several advantages compared to having specialized knowledge on one unique subject ; as it helps individuals in problem solving , grants them with flexibility and is a useful social helper .

Acquiring knowledge on a broad range of subjects first of all broadens one 's perspective extensively .
This in turn will enhance one 's problem solving ability as he/she will be able to approach problems from not a single viewpoint , but attack it from several points .
Therefore , a generalist is likely to come up with more ways to solve a certain problem than a specialist .

A second advantage brought about by gathering knowledge from many academic areas is flexibility .
As one has a certain level of knowledge about many different areas , it is much easier for him or her to make changes in his/her career or life than it is for a person with a knowledge focused on one particular subject .
Flexibility might come handy especially when one is under an obligation to make a change in his/her career .
When the company one works for gets out of business for instance , while the generalist has broader new employment opportunities in different fields , the specialist has to find a job in very specific area he/she has specialized in .

Having a broad knowledge on various academic fields may also be utilized as a social tool .
In order to get socialized with other people , especially with ones that have not been met before , it is essential to find a common ground , or a common area of interest to keep the conversation - or in the long run , relationship - going .
By interesting himself/herself in different fields , one increases not only the chance of finding a common point with the newly met person but also that the relationship will persist .

In a nutshell , people should add as much variety as they can to their scheme of knowledge in order to be better problem solvers , to have the ability to make changes in their lives with ease , and to have better , persistent relationships .
