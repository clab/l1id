IN NOWADAYS , PEOPLE BUY THE PRODUCTS BY ONLY LOOKING THE ADVERTISEMENTS .
FIRSTLY , IN THOSE DAYS PEOPLE MOSTLY BUY TEH PRODUCTS BY THE INTERNET .
INTERNET IS USEFUL FOR EVERYHTING , BUT YOU CAN ONLY SEE THE PICTURE OF PRODUCT ON THE INTERNET .
YOU CAN NOT TOUCH OR YOU CAN NOT LOOK ALL THE PURPOSE OF THE PRODUCT .

THUS , YOU JUST SEE THE ADVERTISEMENT SO YOU CAN BUY IT IF YOU LIKE THE ADVERTISEMENT .
ON THE OTHER HAND , I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE .
IKEA IS VERY FAMOUS .
BECAUSE YOU CAN FIND EVERYTHING IN IT AND ALSO IT IS VERY CHEAP .
AND I LIKE THE ADVERTISEMENT OF IKEA .
BUT WHEN I BUY A TABLE FROM IKEA , I WAS SHOCKED .
BECAUSE IT IS SO BAD .
I COULD ONLY USE THAT TABLE ONE MONTH .

I THINK WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO BUY SOMETHING , THEY SHOULD N'T ONLY LOOK THE ADVERTISEMENT , THEY SHOUK INVESTIGATE THE PRODUCT TOO IF IT IS GOOD OR NOT .
