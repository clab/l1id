i believe espeacially collage students should have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
For example in my university called Sabanci university , we have two years to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
No matter which faculty the student will continue with , all students should learn a bit from everything such as chemistry , biology , mathematics , politics , history \ design ect .
For example i made a good useage of this system , by learning what i really want to study .
As for me , I would never choose visual communication and design department if there was no such a system .
I have choosen this department by knowing what it includes , what the requirements are and for sure what pleases me more .
By looking from this perspective , i think that to have broad knowledge helps to open peoples minds and create more well cultural backgrounded people .
The more well cultural backgrounded people means the more civilized people .
Perhaps this would lead to a better , pieceful enviroment for living .
By the help of this system , people take more confidential steps to their future jobs .
As we see today , most people do not work at the same field that they were graduaded from , moreover they do not enjoy their jobs .
As a conclusion , this system can be the solution of this problem .
However i believe that after having broad knowledge of many academic subjects , people should specialize in one subject , because it is also important to have specialized people on specific subjects .
If knowledge of everyone is on the same level , the scientific approaches or artistic innovations would not be possible .
As a result of all , my oppinion is , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
