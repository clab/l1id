Since the serial manifacturing of cars , they had become a really important part of human lives , as they decreased the time required for transportation .
As people 's needs for transportation will not decrease , it is really hard to say that there will be fewer cars in the near future .
People use cars in their everyday lives and , for people today , it is hard to imagine any period of time without cars .

There had been other forms of transportation in the past , but ; none has been used as frequently as modern cars .
One could claim that a newer form of transport may evolve .
Some people even say that , we may be able to teleport in the near future , however ; this suggestion has yet only lived in science fiction books .
Therefore , in the near future , as near as twenty years , people are unlikely to see a newer form of invention that will close the era of modern cars .
Cars ' looks , types of fuel they use or their engine systems may change , but ; after all , they will still be cars .
Even if cars began not to move on four wheels , but ; instead , started to fly ; as we see in science fiction movies like `` Back To The Future '' , they would still be called `` cars '' .
That is because , they will still be belonging to an individual and be used just like the way we use them today .
As stated before , their way of working , that is ; their engine system , ignition type , fuels etc. may change ; however , they will still be `` the personal transportation device '' .

As a result , when we look at the 20th and the beginning of 21st century , it is almost impossible to see cars vanish from the market all of a sudden .
Lots of people are happy with this as well , as long as oil prices are kept at a reasonable price .
Maybe , the 22nd century will become free of cars and car addicts would surely be glad that they are not to see those times .
