The department I am currently studying has the policy to encourge all the students to specialize on finance or marketing .
The logic behind is that you can not make smart choices if you have less and broad knowledge in a specific topic .
I totally agree with the idea that focusing is better .
Because I believe that you can not talk or make comment about every topic in the world and to specialize encourges you to learn more and makes you love the topic .

Firstly having broad knowledge of many academic subjects only gives small opinions about them and one can not know the details .
Therefore the ability to make comment on the subject and talking about the issue becomes impossible .
For instance someone who watched only the teaser of a film only can tell one or two sentences .
However a person who watched the film and read many things from the magazines about the film can make comments or discuss about the film .
Thus the people having less about a topic have not the right to discuss about this issue and can not be able to make smart comments .

Secondly knowing a lot of things about an issue encourge to learn the topic more and makes love the topic .
Because the beauty hides in the details .
When I start to learn about a topic it always seems to me very boring and hard to understand .
However after passing this point and coming to the details I find this subject more interesting because I start to understand .
Thus knowing the details make the subject important for me / To sum up because the policy of my university I am used to focus rather than having broad knowledge .
I would like to specialize in one specific subject because of two reasons .
The first reason is the ability to make comments and discuss bout the issue .
The second reason is that details make me love and encouge me to learn about it .
Focusing is always better than know less but about many subjects for me .
