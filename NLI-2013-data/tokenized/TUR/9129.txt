Some people overestimate the importance of facts and not pay enough attention to ideas and concepts , while some others approach the issue from a reverse angle and not care about facts and focuse on ideas and concepts .
I do not share any of these marginal positions and think that a middle-way including all these factors in different variatons should be applied in eductaion .

Focusing only on ideas and concepts is problematic for students .
For instance , if a course on 20th century politics forces students to pay their attention only to the major political ideas and concepts in 20th century without presenting any historical development or fact about the era , it can not be fruitful .
Moreover , it can confuse the students ' minds by leaving ideas and concepts in space .
It can become a boring philosophical discussion in the eyes of students , which says nothing about the era 's actual political life .

Overestimating the importance of learning facts in education process is similarly problematic for students .
If that course mentioned in the previous paragraph gives only factual information and focuses only on concrete historical developments , it can easily fail explaining the political life of the era .
Because the ideas and concepts that had major impacts on these concrete developments are inseperable parts of such a course .
They have a vital role in explaining those events .
Without them , the course may become simple story sessions in the students ' eyes .

On the other hand , combining these factors in education is usefull in education .
If the professor of the course mentioned above pays balanced attandance on factual information , ideas and concepts , the course can become an efficient course that covers the topic in a comprehensive way .
The students can be able to link all the information they obtain from the course and have a complete picture of the political scene of the era in their minds .

In conclusion , I believe that ideas , concepts and facts are inseperable parts of a whole .
Any education method that omits any of these parts is very likely to fail .
In other words , students need to understand all these factors in their education process regardless of the topic they learn .
