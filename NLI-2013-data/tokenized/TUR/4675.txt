I am definetly agree ....
We all love watching tv , Every time we saw the new advertisement we get excited at least i know my self I do ...
Even I do not need that stuff stilll I want to have it .
I think it is in our natura , We all same ...
Television make them more desirable of course ,,,, Also I think those people they know their business , You know what I think that way because they are succesful , because They make the people buy more and more ,,,, For example couple months ago I have seen some commercial on the tv .
I went to shopping to the MALL .
And than I have got Whatever I saw at tv .
I took them home of course I start to use them after couple of week later they had so big scratch on it .
( it was a cookware set )
They were not like this .
When I bougth them It started after I ued them , Please listen to this on the that commercial about that stuff : It is stainles , very good ,,,,,,,,, Of course It was baloney ,, I trusted that commercial and than I went to buy that stuff .
Otherwise I would not but it .
They can be tricky some time that is why We should not trust them but not that much ,,, We still check them every once for a while ,,,, Like I said before We buy something We all have be very carefully .
Otherwise sometimes our money can go for nothing .

After I had my cookware I took them back , And than I told them , `` That is not nice , You can not take adventage of people like this '' They knew I got mad .
But no problem I could return it , I got my moey back .
Of course They asked receit , first thing , I showed it to them .
The I got back home it was relief , This was lesson before I buy something I will be carefull again
