in the future there will be fewer cars in use , i think .
Today , buying a car is more possible than in the past .
because it is cheaper and more essential for people .
however , while the time is going on , the roads have been crowded and traffic problems have increased .
therefore people 's complicates have raised .
now , there are no adequate roads .
the government may build more roads so that provide the translation .
on the other hand , there are so many roads that building new ones may not be possible one day .
to illustrate the government may be increased the saling prices of cars and buying a new car may be difficult .
i think this idea should support and the people should encourage to go somewhere with the governments busses .
moreover , going anywhere with the busses is cheaper than the fact that we go with .
the population in turkey is also a factor of increasing the number of cars .
while a number of person is increasing , these crowded roads and traffic problems will increase .
to sum up , the government should provide the using of cars to be decreased .
