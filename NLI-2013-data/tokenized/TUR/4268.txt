In the contemporary world , a new meaning to the word ` time ' is added : ` money` .
Today 's young people , with the conscience of this reality , thinks about the most effective ways to use their time .
Money as the root of all evil pushes today 's young people to research for the ways of self-masturbation but not the communities` .

The most important fact that can not be denied is that humanity is in the middle of a technological transition .
Among this transition , every new gadget attracts their attention .
A new mp3 player , a new CPU with four chipsets or a new software that allows using the same desktop ; they are stuck in the dream of what is going to come next .
Because of this kind of innovations , they begin to think in micro instead of macro and they become isolated from their community .
This isolation causes to associalism and ends by becoming self - centered .
When they need help for their own problems , they just have to browse on some online forums and get the answer they need .

However , this generalization would not be all accurate .
There also exist some situations when young people help their communities such as teaching English language and computer utilization to homeless children , organizing visits to old people , cleaning the streets of the hood they live in , preparing theatral sketches and concerts with the goal of a more compaq gathering .

All in all , I do completely agree with the statement because young people nowadays are totally busy because of the obligation of self-improvement .
This selfish point of view is the weakness of their relationships with the communities and I think that the cause of their organization problems is that they become more individualists .
Creation of some ` e` - campaigns in the name of cultivism , is a must that has to be done for the future of the communities .
