In Turkey , almost 45 % of total population is composed of young people .
If there is a problem about young people , that causes big problems to be solved .
Nowadays , it is believed by most of the population that , young people do not give enough attention on their communities .

First of all , it must be accepted that there is a problem about young people and tried to be solved .
Especially in Turkey , we can not see any young people when some problems about social life or country are discussed .
Youngs think that `` These are unnecessary subjects and can not be solved by us '' which is completely wrong .
People are effected by various source of communication device such as tv , radio , mobile phones , etc .
In the programs , it is always mentioned that being a rich person in an unfair and quick way is the best way .
Youngs do not want to study any more because of these programs .

Second , student population is very high in Turkey .
They are highly concentrate on their primary job which is finishing the school in an acceptable time .
Problems about social life and country do not bother them any more .
Education system makes students only `` living memorizer '' instead of a researcher or a confident person .
How can we expect a young boy/girl to be confident if he/she is grown up under pressure of his/her parents or teachers ?

Finally , reading habit is very low in young generation .
It can be seen not to be related to this subject in the first sight but the more you read the more you know and if you do not know , you can not discuss or help .

As a result , young generation is effected by some external factors and forced to believe and live in such a lazy and slave life style .
The situation is valid for today but should be worked on it .
Turkish culture and traditions must be told young generation instead of the west world 's .
