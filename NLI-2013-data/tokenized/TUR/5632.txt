Humankind always need to earn more many to reach good lifestandarts .
Therefore the amonth of money is a very important aspect of humans life .
Evrybody has different poin of views how the must earn the money .
Some assume that advertisements is the best way to show how is your product to the costumers .
I personally think that advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The reasons are ; to sell more , to be the biggest company in the market .

Fist of all the main resaon why the products seems better is to sell more .
With a cheap advertisement one can easily sell a lot of his product .
For example Burger King is one of the largest fast food resturant in the world .
Therefore they need advertisements to show their burgers .
On the other hand their new burger , woopeer menu , misleads the costumeers .
In their advertisements they use a huge photo to show what a big menu it is .
Plus they also shows big meatball .
But the throuth is one burger can never be enough , you must eat two or more to postpone your hunger .
Burger King advertisements is the most spesific examples for the cousious consumers to find out their consumer rigths .

The last but not least , to be the main producer in the market is the best way of deciding the prise of your product .
For insthange Apple is the biggest company in the Mp3 player market .
So they are able to change the prise of their poduct , Ipod , freely .
How they became the main producer ?
With advertisemnts actualy .
They garenty their product will survive for 2 years , but after ten monhts it is almost broken down .

All in all , as a conculusion , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The consumers must find a way to bent misleading advertisements .
