I disagree with this statement .
Because not everybody likes what i like and i dont have to like what everybody likes .
Thats why i would rather go alone .
But there might be somebody like me , which i mean by this is any person who likes to do stuff that i do or likes the things that i like .
I am really sorry to continue like this but right now i am taking the test in a room with 5 more person other than me and we all are taking the test with the computer .
But right know i am in the writing section and some of us are still in the speakin section and i really can not concentrate on what i write .
Also its been on all the sections because we use the head phones it makes alot of noise and it seriously very hard to stay on task .
I really study for this test and i was hoping that i would do good in this test but under this conditions i dont think i did good .
I guess i will have to retake the test .
I just wanted to tell you what i felt about the stuation .

THANKS
