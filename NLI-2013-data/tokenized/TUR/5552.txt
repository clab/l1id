ADVERTISEMENTS

Today in our country and also in lots of countries advertisements are very important for buying new products but some some advertisements do not show the real qualities of the products so i completely agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

To my mind , advertisement is very important because if the companies create new product , the people have to recognise this product .
Therefore the companies have to make advirtesements to sell their product .
Because of this reason advertisement industry is very common all around the world .
However , most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are so buyers complain about this situation because buyers of course want to buy the right things but the unreal advertisements cause the wrong things .

According to me the advertisement companies have to be careful about the products which they will make their advertisement and they have to try the products and then they must make the their advertisement .
If they do not do this , the buyers can make a mistake while they are buying this product .
They can rely on the advertisement and they can buy the product which is not better .
Therefore all of the advertisements must be real they must not show the unreality .

To sum up , all the advertisements must be real .
Not only the advertisement must be for earning money but also they must be for showing people the truth .
For example if some kind of medicine advertisement are not be real , the buyers can have big problems because of this advertisement so the advertisement companies must always be careful .
if they are not do this , some big problems can occur .
Finally most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are but they must not this .
