I believe that successful people try new things and take more risks than other people .
Being successful means to built new ways .
When we search about successful people lives we could see what made them successful is that they find new subject , creat something new , they found new ways , new styles etc .

To continue what you know well does n't make you successfull but it can make you experinced .
Being experinced is a good and essential for doing a job but it cannot built your ability to create something and change your life style or thinking style .

When we look at some artists or scientists life we could see that they tried to live in a different way and change sometihng which they never lived before .
So what makes people remember and artist because he different things and make a cange in people lives .

Why Gandhi is well known figure in the World that he does n't want to live like all people live in his country and he made a decision and take a risk .
The risk also can take his life from him but without taking any risk no matter can change .
It is so politicial issue to discuss in this section but I want to mansion about only one thing if he never want to change his life and protest soldiers with a quiet way he can never show the people how successful politition he was .

Successful people have take risk to be successful , and being successful also needs new things to try and never give up .
