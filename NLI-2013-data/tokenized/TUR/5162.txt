Most of us , at least once in our lives , were dissapointed by a brand-new product we had just bought after being seduced by a flashy advertisement .
After learning the bitter truth that the product is not the least of what is presented in its advertisement , we understand that we were swindled by an advertisement .
I agree with the fact that most of the time advertisements make the products seem much better than they actually are .

The very simple and powerful trait of an advertisement is that the very reason of its existence is to make the product seem more appealing and attractive to the customer .
The advertisers primarily aim to show the best properties of their product while hiding its weaknesses behind the curtains .
For instance , while watching an advertisement about a video game to be released in the market , it is highly unlikely that you will hear anything about the possible dangers of the game such as provoking violence , especially on the target audience .
In the advertisement , you will only see the beauties and improvements of this video game compared to prior ones , such as its graphical superiority , or development in its scenario etc ...

Secondly , an advertisement will always try to impress the customer at first sight .
The idea here is to create an illusion in the mind of the customer to convince him to purchase the product .
I remember a very notable example for this .
When I was 10 years old , I desperately wanted to have a bicycle since most of my friends possessed one .
I remember very clearly that when I saw an ostentatious advertisement about a mountain bike , I fell for it .
I repeated a million times to my father that I craved for that bicycle .
After seeing the bicycle I remember my father being doubtful about purchasing it because it simply was n't the bicycle that we saw in the advertisement !
Without giving a second thought I went furious .
And eventually my father bought that bicycle .
Using it for several months , when my passion faded away , I realized my mistake , but it was too late .

Last but not the least , the advertisements try to catch the customer by aiming to the subconscious .
The advertisers study the minds of the customers , namely their target audience , to make them surrender to the idea that the product is absolutely necessary in their lives .
They achieve this by using certain gestures , words or displays in advertisements to catch the customer without awakening his conscience .
For example , an advertisement about a car might include a beautiful lady to imply that purchasing the car will also provide the charisma or respect required to impress the lady .
The target audience here which consists of mainly males , will be impressed by the car without really acknowledging this trick .

All in all , there are several ways for the vendors to make their products seem much better than they actually are .
Eventhough , this statement should not mean that all the products with impressive advertisements are exaggerated in their display , it is definitely true for most of the products because advertising simply means to make it seem attractive .
