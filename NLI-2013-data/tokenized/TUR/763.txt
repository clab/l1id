Coming to the end of my undergraduate education in the area of Molecular Biology and Genetics , know is the time for me to select a specific subject from my area to begin graduate studies .
In four years , we have covered a broad range of topics from cancer to pathogenic bacteria .
Definetely , knowing a bit from all topics in this scope will be a hard and unproductive task .
This idea applies to interdisciplinal studies in academic subjects .

Firstly , a short glance to the academic programs of any university would reveal the broadness of programs .
Trying to obtain knowledge in all or at least in several of these areas will push the limits of a normal human being .

Secondly , it is a fact that the more subjects you learn about , the less specific information you will have on each of them .
I always thought that having a shallow knowledge on many things is not a very desirable thing .
I am a person who would like to be focused on one thing and dive into deepnesses of that thing .

Another thing is that , a person excelling on one particular subject is given supplementary information from other areas .
In other words , you do not see the life of cell for four full years in Molecular Biology , it is blended with mathematics , physics and chemistry .

A last reason for why I am opposing the idea of having a broad knowledge of many subjects is because I believe that everyone should be contained in their own subject and should not jump to the others ' .
If I knew statistics as good as I knew microbiology ; why would there be a need for a statistician ?

To conclude my discussion , I would again like to emphasize the importance of co-working of experts from different areas in harmony to achieve the big thing , rather than one person trying to know and achieve everything just by himself .
