Learning is an important and difficult issue for student .
First They have to understant what they should learn .
Some people claims that learning ideas and concepts are very significant and some other people agree that learning facts is exactly much more essential .
I agree that learning ideas and concepts are much more important than learning facts in terms of forming more creative and responsive indiviuals .

As I mentioned above learning ideas and comcepts should become prior for students because major aim of the learning is educating himself and increasing the information to make some sort of comparisons or to come up with results or new ideas .
Therefore , learning facts is impossible for student and anyone , they have to create and form their own fact by combining the ideas and concepts that they learn .
For instance , student can learn the ideas that lies under a war in the history such as world war II .
They should learn the ideas and concepts that lead that war to occur , however , they should anlyze and realize the consequences of world war II to understand and learn the facts .
Another important point is that , by teaching them the facts themselves , teachers prevent students improvement duration .
Students can improve themselves by thinking on a subject that they learn the major ideas , they will become more creative and more observer and that characteristics obviosly help them during their life time .
if a nation want to raise an individually working , observing and creating indiviuals they let them to learn the major ideas and concepts .

To sum up some people claims that students should understand ideas and concept and some people claims that they have to learn the facts .
both conditions have some advantages and drawbacks , however , I agree that student should understand the ideas and concepts .
This is their priority , by the help of that type of learning they will become more observer and more creative because they merge their own facts .
