I do not agree that younger people enjoy life more than older people do .
Altough young people are physically more active and healthier then the older , thus , may have more energy to engage in enjoyable activities , older people have also some advantges of the old ages provide them .

Young poeple are energetic and active , hence , often dominate most of the daily life activities we see around .
However , when compared to older people , younger ones have more responsibilty , which hinders their opportunity to enjoy life .
For example , I and my sister are working in full time jobs , which make us to spend all day in work .
Besides that , we are studying for graduate degrees and this takes most of our free time .
However , my granparents who are now enjoying their retirement years , spend their days with shopping , wandering around , travelling and hosting family members in the weekends .

Another advantage older people have is that they have been cared by other family members more than the younger ones have been .
In my culture , senior people are highly respected .
They have been consulted for experiences they have and for the knowledge they acquired throughout their life span .
That is , they are often visited by familty members , by relatives , which is giving them opportunity to interact socially even sometimes more then young people do .

One other point is that having developed a mature taste of preferences , older poeple do not spend time trying new things spend their times in a more quality way .
Yet , young people generally like trying new things as if they have not developed permanent life preferences .
In other words , young people can be thought as they are still in their life cycle , which can be characterized by flcutuations in tastes and preferences .

Therefore , I cannot agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Both age groups have their own advantages and disadvantages .
While young people may be healthier and more active than old people , older people can enjoy many different aspects of life .
The more important thing is that regardless of the age you are in , one should know how to enjoy life .
