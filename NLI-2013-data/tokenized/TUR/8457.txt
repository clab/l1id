Many different approaches are used in the education system of an educational community .
Mainly ; two types of approaches emerges in a school curricula ; one is practical application of issues which profoundly depends on the understanding of the ideas and concepts ; the other one is undoubtedly the theoretical approach which focuses on the merely comprehending of the facts and details .
As far as I am concerned and as being a student for a considerable amount of my life-time ; I am a proponent of the practical approach and think that schools must pay attention to teach ideas and concepts and should provide each student a broad vision to comprehend them throughly .

There are a number of important reasons I can settle down about the beneficial points of the practical approach ; meaning ; procuring students with the ideas and concepts .
The main advantage that may come along with such an attitude in an education system is the fact that students can learn how various people applied-otherwise saying practiced - the facts .
They are not only feeded with raw material ; but ; also application of the facts ; their processed form is also given to them .
During a school life ; a student may not value the importance of the facts learned .
And ; this was what exactly happenned to me and my classmates in the philosophy class in the lycee .
I have always considered that class as a base one to understand the very basics of science as it teaches to think in both quantitative manner and also abstract way .
But ; I have graduated from lycee being devoid of having the abilities in pholosophic thinking .
Because ; our teacher would talk about the facts all the time .
For example ; when she talked about the evolution of the world and the facts related to it ; she never touched to the various ideas proposed by celebrated philosophers such as Sokrates and Platon .
As a virtue of our teacher `` s educational approach ; we learned to memorize the facts ; furthermore denied acceptance on thinking on further ideas or concepts .

To sum up and to cut the story short ; it is much more important and further beneficial to make students learn the ideas and concepts which are the application of various facts solely or in combination with other facts .
It is true that we cannot deny the importance of facts as they highly depend on the facts .
Evaluation and validation of an idea related to a fact may further make it possible for a student to develop his or her own ideas .
