Being a teenager , I have to spend a considerable amound of time with teenagers .
Therefore I am quite aware of the behaviours of young people considering community .
I want to handle the approach of young people to helping community in two basic parts which are education they are having and the era they are growing .

The educational system is one of the important source of the young people 's attitude towards the community .
In the past education system was not only meant giving the scientific information .
However teachers were able to educate the students in every aspect .
For example if a student behaves to a friend or a teacher in a cruel way , that student was being punished .
In contrast today students are telling really discusting world to their teachers without getting no punishment .
Furthermore in the past since the mothers were frequently hausewifes , they were able to follow their chidren 's education .
However today since most of the parents both have to work to make their living , the education of the chidren are most of the time done by comunication devices like television , internet .
These causes the today 's young people to grow without respectful education and they become people who do n't help to the community .

Although education makes up the very important part of the reason of young people 's behaviour towards the society , the era which we are living in , supplies the important condition to make tenageers behave in that way .
Today , there are a lot of things to do in order to spend time which are more enjoyable for young people .
For example once upon a time my friends and I decided to organize a visit to the elderly people 's hause and we were not successful because we could find only three people to come with us .
A lot of peole said they had another plans like going to cinema , doing sports , ..
etc .

In conclusion , it is obvious that I strongly agree with the starement that young people do n't pay enough attention in helpin to community .
Due to the people around me I am able to summarize theit bahaviour 's main reasons which are their lack of education and the conditions of the era they are growing .
