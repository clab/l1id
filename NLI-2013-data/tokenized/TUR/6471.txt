Rapid developement of car industry continues to supply cars to every organisation and company and even to every house in a country .
I believe that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years of time .
The reasons for the decreasing usage of cars could be that the cars are causing air and noise pollution , besides harming the worlds and countries natural sources .
And as the technology develops other types of transportation could be more commonly used .

As most of the big cities around the world encounter traffic problem , the cities have great air and noise pollution .
The population in a big city keeps growing with migrations .
The governments should develop solutions to the usage of so many cars .
As a best solution public transportation could be spread .
If public transportation is encouraged there will be less polution and less cars .

When the natural resources are taken in to account , if each individual has a seperate car then more and more fuel will be wasted .
The natural resoruces like fuel is becoming to an extinction problem .
In the future other new sources could be introduced to be used in cars enginees but extereme usage of cars will endanger these sources as well .
So the solution again will be usage of fewer cars .

Other than cars , there is airplanes , ships and trains that can be used for transportation .
As for far distances airplanes are announced to be easiest and safest way of travelling .
So in the future other types of transportations will probably become more commonly used .

In conclusion , there will be fewer cars used in twenty years time as need for cleaner air , keeping of resources and other transportaions will be
