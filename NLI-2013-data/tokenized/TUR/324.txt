I belive trying new things and taking risks are the key of the success .
In our world if a person wants to be famous with his or her success story he or she must create a new thing and take risks .

Firstly invention is a major requirement of success .
A person who wants to invite something must be radical and try new things othwerwise he or she find new powerful ideas that will lead to success .
Henry Ford who is the inventor of cars that we use today has emphasized the importance of invention and radical thinking abilty by these words : `` If we asked the people what they want only thing they would say would be the faster cars '' .

Secondly taking risk for the success is an inevitable point .
People who wants to be successful must know that there is no easy way to the top and they should know they will

To sum up ,
