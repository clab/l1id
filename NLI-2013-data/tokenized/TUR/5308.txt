I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I believe so because I have been exposed to many advertisements which after some time has been banned because of their unreliability and I have experienced many disappointments after buying a perfectly advertised product .

Almost every product comes with beautiful and effective advertisements and for the first few weeks , many people pay for these products .
However , after some time , organizations which are supposed to control the unfair use of advertisements ban the sales of that product in the markets due to wrong information given in the advertisements .
To give a specific example , PO , which is one of the largest oil companies in Turkey , recently announced their new oil product which contains some agricultural wastes and products .
The advertisements were great and every people owning a car , started preferring that company to buy the oil .
This is mainly because they were told in the advertisements that the performance of their car would increase significantly with the use of that new product .
However , after 3 weeks , the advertisements were banned from being shown in TV 's , because PO could n't prove the performance increase of the new oil .
This was only one specific example and there are many other like this one which are caught by the controlling mechanisms as well as which cannot be caught .

Another reason why I think that advertisements make products seem better than they really are is that I have experienced some disappointments with the products for which I was affected by their advertisements , To be more specific , I watch a movie by just looking at its advertisements .
However this some of the times made me disappointed because the comments about the movie is generally exaggurated and one can never understand whether they are or not before watching the movie .
I have read a lot of good comments on Keloglan movie 's advertisements .
The film was however disgusting .

These two summarizes
