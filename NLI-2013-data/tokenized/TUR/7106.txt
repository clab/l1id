In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Transport politics of the world are survival .
We give more importance to trains metros and other big transporters .
We also follow rules to reducing emission gas .
So we aim to decrease the quantity of cars .
If governments supply more finance and services to transportation problem then they can solve this problem with mass-transportation .
They can build more ways to trains and metros for example from street to street .
Transportation will be more speedy and cheapier so people will select to travel with mass-transportation instead of cars .

On the other way car industry is improving day by day .
They supply various technology selections and prices .
In that important point , governments have the big responsibility of this subject .
Governments should balance car industry and mass-transportation industry .
By this way big volume of society can select speedy and cheaper solution , mass-transportation .
The rich and little volume of society can select private and expensive solution , .
This implementation also support reducing emission gas .

By the way if this politics can be followed by governments , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
