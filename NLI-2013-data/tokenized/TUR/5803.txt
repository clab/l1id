The usage of cars has been increasing since the beginning of 20th century , with the Fordist era - the easy and mass production of cars in 1900s .
However I believe that it has reached to its peek and in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , because people are becoming more concerned with environmental issues , petroleum prices are constatly increasing while its supply is decreasing , which causes financial problems and car users started to find new solutions nowadays and public transportation is rapidly developing .

Fisrt of all , the global world is now aware of the environmental problems .
For the sustainablity of mankind , the carbondioxide emmision must be dropped .
Billions of cars in traffic , all around the world are producing carbondioxide and destroying the ozon layer .
Fortunately , there are many organisations , public groups and volunteers that try to educate people on this issue and people are now feeling more responsible for the environment they are living in .
I believe these efforts will result in positive outcomes in twenty years , and people will start to find new ways of transportation in order to save the world .

Caring about the environment is not the only reason why people are trying to find new ways of transportation .
The constant increase in the petroleum prices due to the decrease in its supply , also leads car users to search for new solutions .
Employees of the same companies or students of the same schools started to share cars nowadays .
By this way , they can share the costs of the car .
In additon , there are some restrictions by some governments that supports this solution .
For example in United States , people who pass across a bridge alone in his/her car pays more fee than the ones sharing their cars .
In additon usage of bicycles , motorcycles and scooters also increased , and keeps increasing .

The last reason why I think that car usage will decrease in the future is because of the developments in other transportation systems .
Public transportation is getting more efficient with the technological developments and it seems like it is going to improve even more in the future .
For example in Turkey , as economy improves , more subway lines are being constructed .
Now , most of my friends come to school by subway instead of busses or their provate cars .
In addition to getting widespread in all around the city , the subway system is now much more comfortable and fast than before .

Societies ' increasing awareness in environmental issues , increasing price of and decreasing supply of petroleum and the improvements in the public transportation sysems will result in fewer cars in usage in twenty years .
