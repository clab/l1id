Methods of teaching are essential for the students to learn and understand things and apply those in real life .
So it is important to choose which method shall be used .
Indeed , students can be educated by helping them learning about the facts , but would it be enough ?
Since learning starts with comprehension the definition and essence of things , which are theoratical ideas and concepts .
Addition to that , learning about ideas and concepts can improve the students ' argumentative abilities , and lead them not rely on an only one truth .
Regarding those , making the students learn things by facts does not seem to be an effective method .

Indeed the theoratical concepts can be boring for the students and may cause them to loose their focus .
But in order to understand and comprehend something , they would need the know the definition and the essence of things .
Learning facts can be practical but can never provide the sufficient information for the students .

Despite the fact that , learning about and studying on facts can help the students to overcome certain problems that they may encounter , these circumstances are limited .
If a student 's argumentative ability is not developed enough , then he or she may not able to use the potential creativity he or she has .
Thus when students encounter events or issues that cannot be explained by a specific fact , they cannot come up with different soultions since they would not know about the essence and the logic of the problem they encounter .

To conclude , although teaching the actual facts may contribute to students understanding and learning of things in life , it may help them to a limited extent .
As long as they are not concerned the ideas and concepts , in other words , the essence and the logic of the things , they can neither develop a more creative and argumentative point of view nor can be successful enough in their future lives .
