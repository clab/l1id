Industrial engineering is a profession having a broad area becomes more popular in our country recently .
It is thought that studying everything a little is better than specializing in one area .
However in my opinion it is not a good idea .

Firstly , people with a broad range of interests can not learn and use everything well .
It is obvious that human beings have a capacity and this can be only enough for some extend .
Specializing on a specific subject makes it possible to use all your efford for it .
Hence you will be more powerfull on that area .

Secondly , studying everything may be usefull for someone to see the big picture and sawing some problems easier .
however fixing the problems usually needs to be an expert .
For example knowing accounting and computer programming may help you to define a problem in the accounting software , but only an software expert can fix it .

Lastly , think about the inventions that are really essantial for our life .
For example electricity , engines , computers , and so on .
All of these are a product of a long training on a certain subject .
This process is an increasingly learning process and it does not have an end .
Hence , people should use all their efford to achieve the point that they can achieve .

In conclusion , it may be said that having broad knowledge is better to find the problems or something else .
However this is not an effective idea for being an expert and fixing the problems or improving the quality of life .
Thus , specializing on a certain aspect is better .
