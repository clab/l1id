Today , the new generation is not as sensitive as their parents .
They hid after their childhood and escape from the responsibilities .
I agree for the statement .
Young people do not give time to help to other people .
I guess this situation comes because of only one thing .
`` Technology Improvement '' .

Technology refers so many areas .
Television , advertisements , music , i-pods , games and of course computers and chatting .
Young people prefer watching TV or playing a computer game to giving time to help their communities .
They all friends do this as well .
They spend so much time at their rooms and do not talk to theis parents as well .
In school theis conversations with their friends are not about the community .
In spite of the problems they share only the games and their online communications skills .
Internet is now widespread .
It makes the distance closer .
The young people find friends from other countries .
They improve their foreign languages and they learnt the culture of the countries .
They like chatting to unknown friends .
On my opinion , the young people are not guilty but their parents .

Parents should be a leader for their children .
They can coordinate and organize the times to play , to study or to meet the helpless people .
Sensitivity begins in childhood .
Sensitivity is teached only by parents ; not by teachers or friends .
They can learn their children that the life consists of not only the music , friends , TV or chatting but also people , trees , ecology , and the world they ca n't imagine .

Technology is a great strength and opportinity but its necessary to learn how to use it .
Be sensitive and be awere of the community .
Spend time for them .
