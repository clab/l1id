CARS IN TWENTY YEARS
Today 's world is changing rapidly and during this change people invent lots of new things that makes life easier .
Once cars were a dream and now it is almost impossible for a man to travel without them , but what about twenty years from now ?
Will they become ancient history or will it still be very important ?

Cars will continue to be important for daily life however it is possible that the number of cars that will be used diminish .
There are many reasons for that , such as , people became more aware about environmental issues and since one of the major causes of air pollution is the usage of cars so in the future people may use less cars and more of buses or trains , it will also be helpful for traffic jam because roads are not sufficient anymore to handle all the cars .

Second reason why the cars may be less used is the technology is growing very fast , as mentioned above the cars were also a dream which came true , so in the future it is possible that scientist may invent something new that costs cheaper and move faster so people start buying these things and cars will be less used and their number may diminish .

One other thing about cars is : today cars are seen as a person 's wealth .
The more money one has the number of cars or the luxury of the cars increases too , so it is some kind of a fashion show .
If this idea changes people will stop buying new cars and the number of cars that will be used become fewer .

As a result , it is very possible for the number of cars to diminish in the future , due to several reasons , however it is not possible for them to get entirely out of human daily life .
At least not in a twenty year period .
