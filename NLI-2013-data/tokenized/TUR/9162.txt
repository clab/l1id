I do not agree with the statement that ` it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts` .

I dont think that you can understand ideas or concepts of something when you do not learn the facts .
Facts are more important than ideas .
They should both know the facts and concepts about something so they can analyse the situation themselves .
They can not know something by not learning the facts .
They can not be completely concious about a subject if they do not know the fact .
The only thing they know is the ideas about it .

I also think that just understanding concept and not learning fact , do not encourage students to observe or investigate .
We all just learn to understand others ' ideas .
Maybe i would not agree with those ideas if i had known more about it .
You can not ask questions about things that you dont know what the facts is .
Hence just understanding ideas will not let us asking questions .

Mostly in history lesson we only understand ideas or concepts about lots of things that we can never be sure if it is the truth or not .
Also i know it is hard to know all facts about history but i just wish i could .

Beside all those above by thinking as the meanings .
Fact means something totally objective and can not be changed .
However idea is opinions of other people and mostly are subjective .
The facts are always objective .
So it is more reliable .

To put it in a nutshell for being more objective , asking more questions about and making the situation more understanable for ourselves we should learn the facts .
