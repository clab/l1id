I totally agree with the statement .

Because first of all , as a very practical example , understanding ideas and concepts requires active participation of students .
In order to understand an idea or concept student would have to think on that idea or concept .
Without his thinking and using his previous knowledge related with a subject he can never comprehend meaning of an idea or a concept .
Naturally when student becomes active and can link ideas and concepts and can see the bigger picture in his or her mind he or she would understand the ideas and concepts and will be able to use them in future .

However in the case of learning facts student may memorize the facts and may think that he or she learned the fact .
Nevertheless , since without having understanding of general concept he or she can only remember this fact or piece of information in short period without being able to use it in real life and in future .
I mean a student can not use facts without knowing ideas and concepts that this fact is related to .

I would like to give the example of learning law .
In the field of law we can think rules as facts .
People thinks that lawyers know all rules implemented in a country .
Of course they know the basic rules in the country , however what they know in fact is general understanding of the law system of a country and relation of concepts in legal system together with knowledge of ideas behind that formed an improved the system .

By knowing these a lawyer can find the rules he or she is looking for easily and can understand the correlation among them .
Without knowing concepts he or she can not even find the rules he is needs among thousands of rules .
Thus the key is knowing the concepts and the ideas .
By knowing these a lawyer can produce solutions .
However by only knowing the fact meaning rules he can not solve any problem
