Everybody wants to be successful , but success is not so easy that people can reach swiftly to it .
Thus , humans must have some features in order to achieve .
Therefore , these should be their knowledge , experiences and skills .
As a result , I think people who do what they already know exactly can be successful with their knowledge , experiences and skills .

First of all , to take risks is dangerous in business life .
We even lose easily our job .
Moreover , doing what we do not know or understand would damage our carriere , so it is not a good idea .
For example , if ones have an exam and they do not study very well .
As they answer the questions by wrong , these students would take a big risk about their future or notes .
Briefly , people must think twice while they meet a problem because of not to take wrong decision .

On the other hand , a person who has experiences and who is skillful and of course knowledgeable can not take risks because he knows the results of it .
Furthermore , he has already met this situation before , that is why this person has not ever taken risks and will not in his all life .
In conclusion , experience , knowledge and skill advance the human 's statue .

All in all , as I said before taking risk is not a good thin
