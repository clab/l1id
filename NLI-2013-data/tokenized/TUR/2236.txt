Young people live better than old people because they know the value of life .
While people getting older they lose their dreams during years .
Old people have got much more chance to do what ever they want but they have also lost their excitement about life .

First of all , imagine a child , it always smile and play games or laugh .
There is also a sentence which is used for describing the happiness of a child ; '' being happy as a child . ''
During the time is passing , years takes so many things from our lives .
Old people are mostly angry and unhappy people .
Actually years make them like that .

Older people experience more thing than young people .
They also have lived more sadness .
For example , when a person faces with a death of a member of his family , everthing takes different shapes in his world .
Because of that old people sometimes lose their willing to live more .
On the other hand , old people can feel that they are aproaching to death day by day .
They feel like they are waiting for death .
It dusturbs people in a very effective way .

On the other hand , young people have got bigger dreams because they have long time to do everything .
Dreams link them to the life more strongly .
Young people also do not have more responsibility .
It makes their life easier to live because when you are free to do whatever you want to do , it protects you from stress and the things which makes you unhappy .

As can be seen , getting older cut the links between you and the life .
If a person has got no aim about future , it only makes you sad .
Aimless is the biggest enemy in front of a man .
Finding energy to enjoy the life does not change according to age .
If you want to be always young , you just should dream because dreaming is the realist thing in the life .
