Living in a crowded city with an undeniable traffic problem is getting worse each day .
Being a part of this tarffic jam the cars generally save our lives to get from one place to another .
It is really an easy way to get out from our houses and use our cars to transport .
But remembering this ; just one person in a car going to his/her work makes us crazy especially in the mornings .

In our daily life some of us use public transportation .
There are many busses or other vehicles but besides most of the people use their own cars to get to work or somewhere else .
The cars are getting more and more each day and this causes great problems .
More car accidents , more air pollution , more noises etc .
The government works for this problem to make a solution and it is very useful .
Now a days people are learning to use public transportation .
After all people should agree using undergrounds it woud be helpfull to us .
Using an underground or a bus or getting to work with your own car but with some friends of yours , also would be a possible solution for the traffic jam .
People will do these things when they realise that this is usefull but this will take time unfortunately .

I think that as the time passes the traffic is not going to be a problem because in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
In the beginning some people will not agree but after some time I think they will see the truth .
Living in a world without a traffic and a clear weather will be more enjoyable .
People will slowly understand that using public transportation will make their life easier .

So as the time passes maybe this will help us to communicate with each other in crowded places we will be living in a world all the people understanding each other .
