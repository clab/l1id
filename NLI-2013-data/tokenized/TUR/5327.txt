Welcome to New Advertisement World

Do you remember the advertisement of Pepsi includes Beckham Roberto Carlos Zidane ?
Anyone who is interested in international football memorize it even she or he generally drinks CocaCola have more instinctive force to feel the same in the advertisement in buy of Pepsi .
So I can clearly say advertisement have effect as make seem better of products Today we live in a world that people use brands as characteristic signal of themselves .
And we make some celebrities as the one who we want to be same .
Think about Pepsi advertisement with the key role of popular football players .
People who admire Zidane Bechkam want to be a Beckham Or Zidane with buying and drinking Pepsi .
And this occurence make Pepsi seem better and desirable Firms play unseperable roles in modern economies .
We cant imagine an economy without firms .
Firms employ people and they need to be operated properly .
Properly means firm needs more sale to afford salaries and equipment to produce product .
And this force manangers in a way of convincing people about their product is better than they think / At this points advertisement comes up and help firms about making product more desirable in other words making product seem better than it look .

Advertisement that gives wrong ` nformations about product creates unfair competition on some specific good market .
Other firms which see wrong informative advertisement of competetive firm create new advertisement not to capture its market share to competetive firms .
On this process wrong informative advertisement gives help his firm .
In other words because of market share and competition there are cycling behaviour of firms about advertisement / As a conclusion I can clearly agree with the statement about advertisement effect on goods seem better then they are .
This is cruel life for profits in the market and cycling behaviour of firms will make last this effect so long
