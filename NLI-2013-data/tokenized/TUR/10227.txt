Having risk may mean to open l ?
fe to new ares .
It may be dangerous but it is necessry for developments , I believe .
Otherwise , most probably mankind would not come to the point he is at the moment .
I will try to discuss how man ?
mproved his exitence on earth taking risks and signing so many succesful project in the course of history .
I will also support the idea from my own life .

The first example to be given for such courageus initives would be the invention of fire .
Fire has been the most determining find in the history of man .
The f ?
rst person who found the fire obviously took an incredible risk in his or her life .
Apparently , it was not easy for that person to trancend the supersticions of his culture .
But the person gifted a marvelous present to mankind .
Let me give you another example : Colombus took a tremendous risk to reach to the new world .
That great journey was the exploration of a new part of the world , of course , for the ones who lived in the east part of the word .
As a matter of fact , it was so great a succes that the map of the world has changed after this succesfull but very risky journey .

I would like to give you an example instane from myself .
After graduation from high school I should have a university examination to enter university .
My transcript did not show a great success in my high school education .
I could accept this situation and I could go a university according to my level of success .
With also the help and supprt oa my family , however , I embarked upon studying the examination .
This was a turning poin in my life .
Rather tan sitting at home and waiting for my fate I tried to change my life course .
It was a success and I could be able to enter a prestigious college .

To change something in the world also means tking risk .
Our world improves with courageus initiatives of brave man , I believe .
This has always been my principle in my life .
