I absolutely disagree with the statement .
Understanding ideas and concepts is maybe necessary but learning facts is obviously the most important matter in education life .
My personal experiences have proved me that being aware of universal realities is worth to sacrify everything .

First of all , facts are indispensable for everybody .
After one learns the facts , one can understand ideas and concepts more easily .
Namely , learning facts is the first step for being a cultivated person .
For instance , in our education system depends on understanding and memorizing concepts and events .
Thus , the students in Turkey are lack of discovering and realizing the facts .
It is a huge problem for us and our posterity .

Second , Learning facts will affect the students whole cultural and social life .
If one does n't know the truths , how one can define his own way to live .
Therefore , if we want individuals who ere enough concious to determine what is really good for them and their country , we must give extra importance to the facts .

In conclusion , it is evidently more essential for pupils to have the facts than to memorize or learn ideas and concepts .
Learning facts is the most impatta
