I do n't agree it is better to have board knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize one spesific subject because being specialize in many academic subjects means your attention divides to many academic subjects .
If everyone does just his or her work well then every work would have a specialized person .

Being specialize in many subjects means your brain and your attention divides many adacemis subjects .
Its harder to focus a lot of points than focus just one point .
For example the students studying double major in universty and they have two exams for next day .
They have to study both .
Then they can not study as much as their other friends .
If they have enough potential to get good grades from both think about to they study just one exam .

Specializeing one spesific subject is means you have enough time and enrgy to study about the think whick you are working on .
But if you are triynig to study more than one spesific subject then you do n't have enough time to specialize as much as the ones who specializes one spesific subject .

I think if every one does just their work well the world would be a better place to live .
Think about a person who is a engineer can he or she make a better construction than an architect .
No .
But also an architect can not do the thinks as good as the engineer does .
World has a rule and everyone has to do his or her own work and have to try to be specialize his or her own work .

Being specialized in a subject is allways better than being specialize in many subject because the one who specialized in many subject can not know as much as the think that the one who is specialized just one subject .
