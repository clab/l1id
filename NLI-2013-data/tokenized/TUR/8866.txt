Teaching is a major activity in ones life .
People improve theirselves by learning from the schools , experiences and the like .
The more they learn , the better they lead their lives .
However , there are many disagreements about how to teach students .
Besides how is taught is so important , what is taught is also vital .
Learning can change the life and improves the communication of ones to the others and the environment .

The importance of understanding the ideas and concepts is much more required according to learning the facts for students .
Firstly , it can be considered that there is not only a true for any circumstances .
There are facts and people decide which fact is their fact .
It will be unlogical to expect people doing all the same things .
Hence , the best way is to teach the ideas and concepts of the other peoples .
This will help them to find out their own paths .
Demonstrating people the cases which others are passed by and showing the behaviours makes much more sense .

Furthermore , if ideas and concepts are taught instead of facts , the improvement in cultures begin .
Learning the way of reactions to the different circumstances by different people make ones go one step further .
According to a survey lead in an European university , people are selected from different cultures are put into two different classes A and B. The people in the A class are given a piece of paper writing that the boiling point of water is 100 celcius .
Besides the other group is making an experiment showing that water boils at 100 celcius and the idea beneath it .
After a while , they are asked to examined and the results show that B class members are much more successfull according to the other group .
This shows the importance of ideas than the facts .

In the light of these , it can be cited that ideas and concepts are worth to be learned to improve the community .
Also they help to find people their ways .
