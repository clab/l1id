It is always up to the personality whether one like to keep the track of others or do something new , something which 's not tried before .
So according to this idea of mine , I believe that success is a reflection of personality .

In my opinion success comes from production and innovation .
If you do n't try something new and do the same things those have been done for years , you dont produce much .
We can clearly see that from the current situations of the economies of the countries in the world .
The biggest economies which produce the largest amount of national income are the ones which always produce and sell new technologic innovations .
They are the one who are successfull in the world economy .
Because , taking risk is the most valuable input of the economic activities .
Trying new things always includes much more risk than the doing what they already know how to do well .

As taking risk has a price , risk averse people or societies can not be successfull .
If we go on from our example , far east countries which only produce already-invented-goods , can only have a little profit since they dont take the risk of trying new things .

The same thing is valid in the extend of persons .
In my view , doing the things what someone already know how to do well , is a thing which can be achieved by an ordinary man but not by a successfull man .
Because trying new things needs courage and effort to succeed .
And this effort and courage must be at a level which can not be obtained by everyone since everyone can not be successfull .
It is to be sucessfull to create this difference .
