Some people agree that young people enjoy life more then older people do because of vast energy that young people have , while some people claim that age is not important for enjoyable life because every part of life has its own enjoyement .
After consedering this question , according to my age and personal view , I agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

First of all young people 's physical condition provide them to make different kinds of sports such as snow-boarding , squba diving .
Therefore I believe that young people can have more exciting hobies .
They can travel or explore different places so I advocate that it is the very important part of good life .
Additionally young people 's energy help them to reach their goals easier they can work harder and can obtain greater career .

Secondly mental tireness makes older people to lost motivation or expectation from the future .
Young people has energy to try to solve problems or put up with them .
Thus I advocate that this energy is the foundation of having enjoyable life .

Last but not least while individuals are young they have a temptation to taste different food or to meet different people .
for this reasons happiness and enjoyement are directly linking age and this temptation .

All in all I agree with the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do , because young peple including myself have more energy in terms of mental or physical .
