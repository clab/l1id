There are some steps for selling a product .
The frist step is to produce and in tha last decedes this is the esieast step .
The second step is the advertise and delivery of the product .
Advertisement i very important .
Doing something without advetisement is as like as blinking ti girls in the dark .
Only you can see what you do .
But At this point the amount of the advertisement is important also .
There must be a limit for these .
Because more advertisement means more money and more market to delver the product .
The other reason is if you make more advetisement you must deal with much more people .

Firstly , the reason about money .
Advertisement is a money = needed process .
For instance , TV shows advertisement is very effective but money for these is too big .
Newspaper banners , web page links , radio talks are the same of course .
All these need money .
BEcause of these when you think about more advertiesement you must concider about your budget .

Secondly the more advertisement you make , the more people you deal with .
Dealing with more people means that you need mere customer relations and more thought to support customer demands .
For example , ColaTurka , a new Turkish cola brand , made lots of advertisement via all the media channels , newspapers etc .
But whne the advertisements died down the custumors want to buy this brand .
But ColaTurka could n't reserve the demand so the firm loose money .
We can understand from this instance , we must get prepared before making advertisement of a product .

Consequently , advertiment is expensive and risky process .
So when we think about making advertisement , we must think about our budget , the field of our product and our sources for reserving customer demand .
