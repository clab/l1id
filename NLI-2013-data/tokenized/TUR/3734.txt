I agree and disagree with the following statement '' Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' .
Nowadays , everything is different .
If we compare today to two hundred years ago , we will see a lot of differences such as different cultures , people and places .
However , children never change .
They always have the feeling that they should never work and always play .

According to my experiences , I agree more with the following statement than I disagree .
Young people ( teenagers or children ) do not have the spirit for working or helping on anything .
They are mostly attracted to the computer games , movies , soccer , basketball and other things .
Therefore , it is not their fault that they do not do some things .
However , it is their responsiblity to do at least some of the things they have to do .

There are also other teenagers or children who are by far different from the people who always play computer games or watch TV Programmes .
These kind of people ( teenagers or children ) might be as young as other children but might be much more mature than the other .
These kind of young people usually give enough time to helping their communities .

However , young people not giving enough time to helping their communities might result from the parents .
The parents have a big role and effect on the life of the children .
If the parents always do what the child wants , then you would not expect that child to give enough time to helping his/her community .
If you get the child whatever he/she wants , then he/she will want more and more and you will buy more which will be a very bad influence on the child .
For example , I have few extremely rich friends .
These people always get what they want .
However , they are the ones who usually fail during school .
So I think the parents might also effect the children .
