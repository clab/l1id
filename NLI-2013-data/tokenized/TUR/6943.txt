I can say that aproximately twenty years afrer today there will not be more cars in use than they are in use today .
In the technologic world everything started to be more easy .
The engineers work in order to make more suitable world for people .
And everybody knows that the cars are one of the major reasons for the pollutions .
Beside pollution they are serious threat for the traffic crowd .
In my opinion after a few decades They will be fewer cars in use .

Subways will be established everywhere .
It has already been using in most of the places in the world and it will be the easiest transition in the cities .
It started to be used more than cars in some of the cities which are very big and very crowded .
The people who live in big cities got used to use the subways but in smaller cities there are still many people who have never seen subways before because they are not aware of this easy transporting machine they maintain to love their cars and use them .
I believe that when their cities are started to enlarge and when they will get red of the crowds they will want to use someting else which is much easier .

Moreover not only the subways but also some other vehicles will be using after a few decades such as bycyles .
There will be special roads for the many people will be more happy than they are today because they will be more healtier .
They will go to closer places by using them .

Ofcouse there will be still cars on the roads and somebody will continue to use them but in my opinion it will be fewer cars than today because the new generation is more conscious than we are today .
They will find better solutions because they will be aware of the world 's beauties .
