By the improvement in the technology and the fun , the people began to seperate from each other and this caused the lost of the love .
It can be easily seen in the young people .
They are the common example in our life .
And unfortunately , nowadays young people give less time to their communities .

As i told in the above that i believe that the main reason for this s'tuation is the improvement of the technology .
With the technology you can insulate yourself from the real world or society .
For instance when you take your place in front of the computer you can spend lots of hour in front of it without any bored , you can play games talk with people that you do not know or listen music , whatever you want .
After the mobile phones invented the travelling decreased because many people can know eachother with talking on the phone .

Another reason for this is that the young people began to think only yourself not the others .
For example , they go to parties they are having lots of fun and they want to this all time they only want to have fun in their life every responsible thing becomes diffucult to them so that they do not want to do these things .
And it comes from the technology .
And there is a culture mixing in the world everyone wants to be like the other one and so young people can loose their own ideas or their own behaviours and the most important one is that they can lost themseves .

In summary , the young people give less time to their community from some reasons like the technology and the wiiling of having fun in their ages .
However , the ypoung pepole 's behaviours can change in the following years if the techonology decreases .
