Knowledge is one of the necesseties of life .
As far as I observed , most of the people wants to learn knew things and the people who have knowledge about many things are to be respected by others .
Therefore , I agree with the idea that to have broader knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specialize in one subject .

First of all , the world is changing every time especially thanks to the development of the technology .
The needs and wants of the people change as time goes by and the field which is approved by everyone one day , can not be copnsidered as a good field the next day .
Therefore , people should always improve their knowledge and skills to continue their living .

Secondly , concentrate on in one specific subject makes nonsense , in such a world where everything is related to eachother .
For example , as a student studying economics , I do not understand why a macroeconomic professor has no idea on game theory .
At first sight , there seems to be no relation between them , however , if we think deeply we can see how the findings of game theory , has important effects on decision making process which affects the decisions of fiscal and monetary policies , and thus will reflect on macroeconomic stability of a country .

Thirdly , if we consider the social interactions between the people , generally , people do not like to talk with persons who always concentrate on the same subject .
For example , a man can be a very good doctor , howver if he does not have other interests , he will not have any social life since people do not always want to hear the same subjects again and again .

As a conclusion , to capture the needs of human beings and technology and response in accordance with them people should concentrate on different subjects rather than only one .
This will also be helpful on maintaining an effective social life .
