The education system has always been a very critical discussion issue for all societies .
Some societies have favoured students to specialise in only a few subjects from the early ages whereas other societies have favoured students to have a broad knowledge of almost many academic subjects until the very last years in their education period .

There are pros and cons to both approaches .
As in Turkey ; we tend to cramp students ' brains with so much detailed and technical information from the very early ages that they start memorising and when the exams are over they can remember very little of what they learned .
Although it is quite acceptable that they learn a lot about almost any subject matter how much of the information they can use later on in life is definitely debatable .

On the other hand in countries like UK children start specialising around the 5th year in secondary schooling .
This system allows a student to allocate time only to his selected subjects and prevents the student from allocating time for subjects that he is not interested in .
The students in UK select 5 or 6 subjects they are interested in pursuing in further years and after they take exams based on those previously selected subjects they get qualified to select 2 or 3 subjects out of them which will if they are successfull eventually enable them to gain an entry to a faculty that they want .
As they already have a solid background before they start university the universities also benefit from this .
Universities in UK donot have to reeducate students for the classes they have to take in the university as Turkish Universities have to accomplish these days .

As a conclusion I would definitely support a UK like system where a student can specialise in fewer subjects .
On the other hand it is also true that an education system should be able to make up for the culture gap students are experiencing with their own history literature culture etc in order to generate godd enough societies .
