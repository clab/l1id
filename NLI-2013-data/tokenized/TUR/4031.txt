The situation and responsabilites of young people has been always a major topic in social issues .
The limits of the latter has been changed according socio-political conditions of each country or society .
Nowadays , debate abount young people help attitudes towards their community is growing .

Advocates of this argument claim that although a deep understanding about social collaboration and establishment of non-profit social organizations dedicated to help others is growing , young people do not choose to be a part of this life style .
They argue that they waste their time by some other kind of activities .
However , this approach can be critised by claiming that our lives is not strictly determined by our free choices .

As I mentioned before , the environmental conditions in which a young person is located is extemely determining in his \ her attitudes .
To exemplify this , we can consider a country where you have no social rights such as free education or health insurance and where you have to work hard to afford life expanses .
A young member of a poor or even a middle-class family will not have sufficient time to study , to work and to be part of organizations which are devoted to help people .
Considering education and earning money as two main obligations of survival in capitalist system , there is no time for involving in social organizations .
One further exemple of the importance of social conditions in young people choices is the situation observed in extrene conditions like war .
In times of war , there is an immense need for helping other people and whole life get a new direction according to demands of other .

After taking account all this arguments , I can tell without hesitation that I strictly disagree witk the statement claiming the lack of charity behaviour of young population towards their communities .
