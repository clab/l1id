The people doing the things they already know are always more successful in the society rather than the ones trying new things .
there are many reasons of this success .
experiance is the most important one .

The most important feature of the experience is knowing about the probabilities .
By the experience people can see the difficulties and problems of the situations and they can create some ways to get rid of them .
and in the second time they probably get their precautions ; or if somebody comes across a problem at one time , she \ he doesnt do the same thing in the next time .

Moreover , experienced people are always preffered in jobs .
For example whe \ n I want to have my hair cut , i go to an experienced hairdresser .
Because I know the probability of qualifications he has is higher than the inexprienced one 's .
This shows his succes in this job .

trying to do things without experience brings trouble most of the time .
Because it carries risk .
being inexperienced may cause destructions in every aspect of life .
But experience brings maturity .
