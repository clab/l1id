I agree about it .
I believe more than % 60 percent of any products which are in ad not like same quality as they appear .
The most one is for the food section expecially fast food , they are not same quality and same servise as they said in ad .
For the reasan that is they have to be service so quick and keep their merchandise at the same quality .
if you are think about a busy restaurant in somewhere , they must be give their customer so quick service , not wait on the line and high quality , it seems not be possible and when you get yours one you can see the diffrences between in ad .
There should be not big diffrencess but they are not exactly the same quality .

The other examples like a something which can be change person wiev or opinion .
To sell some product of yours .
Sometime people can be say it has high quality , do not have any problem , there should be very small misunderstanding but the product should not be same quality , some people can say it is excellent some of them can say it is good .
Here is the diffrenceses .

There should be nice oppurtunity for this ad but they can not mention about all of those .
They should be mention about good things to get your attention after decide to buy or to get it you get and recognise for the other part of hand which they not mention about it in ad .

If you want to put something to ad you must be try your best to sell it .
