The Best Way to Travel

There are many different opinions on the ways for traveling .
Some people like to travel by themselves or with their friends while others enjoy their time with a company like a tour guide .
Those people who believe that the best way to travel in a group with a tour guide feel more comfortable and learned for they can travel and learn a lot of new information at the same time .
However , I am one of those people who would rather travel alone or with my friends .
The reason for this is because I do n't feel very comfortable when there is a tour guide around .

Firstly , I really like to have my friends or relatives around me while traveling because that 's how I have fun .
Also , even when I do not know a lot about a place that I am planning to visit , I go online and get more information about that place .
I read and get directions to find my way out easily rather than being with a tour guide .
This is not necessarily because I do not like tour guides but it is just because I believe that I would have more fun while I spend time with people that I am very close .

Furthermore , I traveled many countries with and without tour guides .
Some of the places I went to are Germany , Russia , and Holland .
Even though I had difficulty while traveling around because of not knowing the language , I still enjoyed my time during the vacation .
On the other hand , when I was with a tour guide I felt like I was under a lot of pressure to listen to every detail that he provided .
For instance , when I went on a tour in a museum in Germany , I got very bored and tired because of the explicit and unessential amount of information provided by the tour guide .
My tour guide kept trowing dates about the important buildings and no one really paid attention because everyone expected to learn some interesting facts rather than simple dates on the tour .
I think I would have enjoyed my trip better if I was by myself .

Lastly , I like to have conversation with my friends while traveling .
But when there is a tour guide and a group of people around me , I can not get chance to chat with my friends because talking would be very disrespectful .
Therefore , with a tour guide I can not really enjoy my time even though it is ver nice to learn new information about the places that I visit .
