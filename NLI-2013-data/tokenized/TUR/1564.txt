it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic .
I am such a person who is side of this statement .
There are some reasons to support this statement .

First of all , if you have a broad knowledge , it is easy to hire for a job .
Because , in this century , bosses have different idea to hire a person that is if you have more different skills than others , you will be hired .
For instance , you want to work for a computer company and this company is looking for an employee who is good at company desing .
So , I you have this skills , you will be choosen ,

Second of all , you can have some benefits to have broad knowlenge of many academic subjects .
For instance , your daughter have problems with math class and the math teacher advises your daughter to have home-schooling .
In this situation , If you are good at math , no need to hire a teacher to give home-schooling to your daughter .
However , If you dont , you have to hire a teacher .

Thirdly , some people can support that to specialize in one specific subject have some benefits , too such as you can be thebest in your major .
However , they really forget that you can be the best in your major but not in your life .
Because , for instance , if you dont have communication skills , you can face many problems with your family or people who around you .
Thus , it expected to have unsuccessful life for you .

All in all , it is better to have broad knowledge of many acad
