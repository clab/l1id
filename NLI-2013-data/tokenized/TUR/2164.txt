Some people become aware of the limited life span of human being at their early ages and try to enjoy it in the best way .
However , there are some who are able to recognize it when they come to the end .
Though , there is not a direct correlation between the awareness of the limited life span and the age , old people generally tend to enjoy life more than younger people .

First of all , young people tend to assess the problems bigger as they are actually .
Since it is hard for a typical young to foresee the outcomes of the events , they are magnifying every difficulty they come across .
For example , many students in my country , Turkey , think that the university entrance exam is the nost important point in their lives .
Therefore , if they are not able to achive it , most of them are damaged mentally .
However , since older people has a lot of experience , they face problems in a calmer manner .

Secondly , in general , an older man has higher chance of having enough money and time than a typical young person to do what they dreamed .
Vast majority of us have little money to spend on our personal lives , while we are studying , since we depend on our families economically .
Also , due to our schools and summer schools , our time is also limited to do what we want to , while oleders hav

All in all , I am quite disagree with the idea of young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Though I think that youngers have more energy and more desire than the olders , they could not enjoy life due to pressure put on them by their families and the limited finance and time .
