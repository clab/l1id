People come to life once so they might as well enjoy it as they live it .
Both the young and the old people enjoy life .
Some assume that young people enjoy life more than the older people do , in the contrary , some people think that old people would enjoy it more than the younger people as the time passes .
I totally agree with the first idea .
I think young people enjoy life a lot .

First of all , young people tend to have fitter body .
Many of the activities that young people do such as to go to clubs , dance like crazy or ride a horse cannot be done with an unfit body .
For example when I make a tennis match with my mother , she gives up after sometime .
I definitely beat her in every match because she does n't have that much energy .

In addition to this , younger people do have healthier bodies .
They can drink and eat without counting the calories .
They do n't have to think what would be bad for their calosterol or heart conditions .
Hence , young people would be able to go any restaurant or cafe , and enjoy the terrific part of life which is composed of eating and drinking .

The last but not least , since young people have n't experienced many things in life , they try new staff all the time .
For example I have n't done bungee-jumping before or have n't visited Japan .
Young people enjoy life by doing new and exciting things whereas older people have nothing great to do anymore in their lives .
Besides , young people tend to do more dangerous things than older people .
That 's because as a person gets older , he or she starts to think of dying .
Old people do n't want to die therefore they would n't try all the fun things in life which are most of the time more dangerous than the other things .

All in all , as I said before , young people enjoy life more than older people do because not only they have fitter and healthier bodies but also they have the courage to try new things and they do so .
The long and short of it all , although I would like the older people to enjoy their remaining time as much as the young generation , they do n't enjoy it and they ca n't enjoy it that much .
