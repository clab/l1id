Broad knowledge is better or specific one ?

Knowledge has always been a question for all .
How much of it is enough ?
Who is the most knowledgable ?
What ever the qusetion , it is very vital in human life to have knowledge of many in a lifetime .
However , knowledge of general and knowledge of acedemic is absolutely different .

Of course , everybody would love to broad their knowledge on many subjects .
In daily life , we all want to be aware of everything around us .
That 's why , we all keep up with news and tv etc just to improve our vision of life .
But , when it comes to term of acedemic knowledge , this is another case and a lot more complex .
Because , acedemic career needs a lot of hard work .
To specialized on a specific subject does not happen in one year or within an assesment .
Acedemic work is a part of developing and also creating on a subject one is specialized .
In order to write new thesis or experiment or invent in a field , one should need very detailed and intensive knowledge of the field .
This is why , specializing in one subject will be more productive .
The more we learn we feel less knowledgable .
Because , every new knowlege will prove how much more we do not know about .
Also trying to have deep knowlege of many acedemic subjects should be a very hard mission .
This may end up with only gathering the information and not being able to develope it at all .
This is the reason , I do not agree having broad knowledge of many acedemic subject is better .

Specializing in one subject will help the person to become an authority in the subject .
While consuming new ideas and articles about the subject , the person can combine the knowledge and also can have the opportunity even to develope or create in the subject .
