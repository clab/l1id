I do not agree with this statement .
Broad knowledge of a specific subject might not be enough to solve all the problems and answer all the questions about the issues concerning this subject .
So we would definetly need experts of certain subjects to solve our problems in related areas .
We , human beings , developed a lot and we know much more than we can handle .
There is so much to learn .
Individuals can have enough time only to master a certain subject since reading and experimenting would take a life time .
It is better to concentrate on one thing so that you can be rated as an expert and have a good professional life .
There are more than 6 billion people on earth and people are becoming more and more educated .
So there is so much competition in academic and professional arena .
To be able to leave others behind , you need to excel in what you do .
Let me give you a few specific example .

I am a computer engineer and I could have been either a hardware orientent person or a software engineer .
I had to make that choice and concentrate because both areas are vast and I can have enough time only for one of them to learn and master it .
So I chose software engineering .
In this way , I can sell myself as an expert on software area and have a promising professional life .
Because , compaines require specific knowledge about many software products .
So I would need to spend a lot of time for example , on a programming language and learn it to the best of my abilities .
This would be possible when I spent enough time on it and this becomes true if I try to specialise on software engineering by not trying to know everything .
Of course , I should have broad understanding of other areas like , different programming languages or even basic understanding of hardware but that is just to make my life easier not to sell my services as an expert of everything about computers .
First of all , nobody would believe me since it is impossible to know everything .

Another advantage of being a specialist is the fact that you can not be replaced easily since there will not be many experts in your area depending on what you do .
For example my position in my current project is quite secure although many lay-offs are going on since there is not anyone to replace me .
So specialisation secures you a good place in society and in your professional life .

Today the world is demanding .
We are able to live on the moon even .
So we progressed fast .
We know much more than we used to do and this means that our brains have much smaller capacity than what is there to store and comprehend .
This forces me to recommend specialisation as a philosophy .
I think this is a must nowadays ...
Otherwise , as individuals we may not be able to contribute to the society enough .
