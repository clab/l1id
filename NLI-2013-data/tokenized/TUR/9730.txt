Innovation , Risks and Success in Science

The factors which makes a random academician a distinguished scientist , or an ordinary cook a chief of reputation lie in the same place : Innovation .
To introduce new ideas , or even combining the existent ones in a different way changes the course of the lives , countries and eventually the history yet to be written .
However , it takes its tolls under the threats of risks .
Against all odds and all the risks , the innovation is still the key to the success in every profession .

Here is the journey of the same person proving that how innovation and risk taking can alter the course of history .
And in lack of these two factors how a sucessful person can spend years without reaching to a solution .

Albert Einstein was a curious mind striving to explain the connectivity between the forces governing the universe .
He changed the paradigm of the physics from old Newtonian perspective introducing the relativity .
This was also meaning the risk of unacceptance and scornful comments from the peers in physics .
After all , he was just an officer in a patent office studying physics in an unscholarly way .
In fact , his early papers are rejected by the journals .
However , he has been eventually proved to be true by the observations claiming him to be sucessful .

Ironically , in the second part of his professional life when the quantum theorists followed his way to form the next paradigm known as quantum mechanics , he would be the person to build the barriers against the new ideas .
He would say ` God does not play dice ... ' not accepting the probabilty factor in physics .
He spent his last years working on the same problem the way he did for the relativity , having no answers .
The old way of thinking deterministically and adding the beauty of mathematics were not working anymore .
Problem needed a new approach from which Einstein preffered to stay away .

Nobody can guess what would happen if he tried to colloborate with the new paradigm and search for new ideas .
Taking the risk of finding that the universe depends on a probability game was not bearable and Einstein stayed in his track with no other sucess .

The same great mind with two different attitudes bring two different consequences : a ground breaking theory and a solitary research era , giving a good example how innovative and courageous the scientists should be if they are to be successful .
