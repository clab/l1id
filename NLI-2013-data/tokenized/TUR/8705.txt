I think it is really more important for students to teach facts rather than teaching the ideas and concepts .
Nevertheless , the education systems are generally based on teaching the ideas and the concepts .
The ideas of famous people and the some fundamental concepts are taught throughout the education lifetime .
I think this system will not work in near future .
Because of the technological improvemets , the students have a great tendency to learn the facts and the events in the world .
Thus , they will begin to ignore the ideas and concepts .
They will deal with the issues which they really exist .
They will give more importance to the occurences .
I think it would be better when the students learn the facts , after that they can find fundamental idea behind this fact and the students both learn two issues by analyzing the facts .
If this system is formed , the students begin to laern the issues by experiencing the living facts .
The drawbavk of teaching the ideas and concepts is craeting an abstract education for the students .
The student may never encounter with these ideas or concepts in their lifetime .
However the facts are real and nobody can ignore and run away from these facts .
All the students will be adult in near future and will face with these facts .
If they meet the facts in their school years , this experience enable them to cope with woes easily .
Another essential benefit of teaching facts is improving the attention of the students .
The examples of real world will arouse their attention and I think they will want to participate the debates about the occurences .
This system increse the efficieny of education , the other system is so bored in respect of this one .
Because the students only memorize the ideas an concepts
