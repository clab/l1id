I agree that the most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are .
This is the mojor strategies doing by advertisement to reach much number of peole .
But some of them can say lie for selll the product .

Advertisements only give the adventages and best sides of the product , you ca n't show any attention about it 's disadvantages .
Consumers must also learned bad sides of the product .
Furthermore advertisement can tall much more than they are .

In addition to this if you make lots of advertisement about the products poeple want to learn what it is than less advertising products .
Of course they will go to the shopping centr and look your products and usually this looking will finished with buying the product .

In our country there are also lots of advertisement which make person boring in a rest of tv program .
Sometimes it takes twenty minutes .
In fact as me all people change the channel to fin new one which is not advertise something .
If advertiser want to take peole on tv they must do funny and interesting advertise .

Beside of that most advertisement may include more lie than others .
This is selling method and we ca n't know if they tell us true or not .
We must search and ask alot about products before buying it .
We can get this informations who use that product before .
And also politicians have to do some laws for advertisement .
That laws mus limit the advertisement and include some punishment if they tell wrong in the advertisement .

As a result there are lots of disadvantages and advantages of most advertisement .
I agree that people want to buy product alot w'th most advert'sement but it mus n't include lies and harmfull things for people .
They must be true
