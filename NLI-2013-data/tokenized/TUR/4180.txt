Young people are the mediums of carrying on the human race .
Yet , are they aware of their potential in creating the future ?
In order to create the future , youngsters need to be present in today .
In other words , they have to involve actively in the problems that their society faces on by helping their society .

To begin with , the use of high-speed means of technology like internet brings in the opportunity as well as the need that everything has to be done quickly .
That is to say the present era places great emphasis on individuals who are sharp and quick in action .
In a society where everything happens so fast , young people worry about the assets they need to have too much .
Therefore they do not allocate enough time and energy to the people who are out of this system like older ones .

In addition , one of the requirements of modern era to compete in order to get more hinders the young people to develop sensitivity to the other people who do not have chance as much as they do .
As the number of people who live with inadequate resources increases , young people turn their direction away from helping poor and uneducated people .

Besides , today 's world are full of conflicts and wars .
Yet young people are indifferent to these issues and do not want to take part in the political decisions .
In this way they enable the wars and conflicts to go on while isolating themselves from the decisions that their governments make which may be harmful for their society in the long run .

Consequentially , because young people are too busy in meeting the needs of modern age by investing themselves and competing with others , they miss the needs of their societies and at the same time the chance to build up a future for the successive young generations .
