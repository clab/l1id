Our education system is always being criticized because of its non-analytic education .
For example students learn something without even asking questions about the facts and the ideas of it .
They just learn .
However , It 's important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts .
At first , I will try to summarize the advantages and the essential parts of understanding ideas .

Ideas and concepts are the first steps of creation .
Giving the ideas of an event or a problem forces the student to think aboout it .
As a result , the student not only asks questions about the event , but also takes it further by trying to make an explanation to the cause of the event .
This is what is called analytic reflection .
For instance , we can talk about the exam in Turkey before graduating from college .
We study for 2 years or more without understanding the main ideas .
Consequently our future depends on one single test .

On the other hand , learning facts is also important but not as important than understanding the essential .
If a student is only learning facts , he ca n't get any further than providing simple relations between events or comparing them .
He just ca n't figure out why .
But a student wh understood the concepts can ask questions , `` Why ? , Who ? , What ? , Where ? ''
.
He can eventually answer them too .
We can see this as an escalade .
The ideas help us to get to the top , while the facts help us to see two steps beyond .

In conclusion , both systems are important .
They help making progresses to the students ' view of aspects .
However for me , understanding the ideas and concepts are more important .
They provide an analytic reflection .
