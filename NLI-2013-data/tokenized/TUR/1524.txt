I agree that the person should focus on one specific subject .
Basically I can summarise the process for success as `` find and dig it . ''
Discussion might be related to what subject rather that how many subjects .
Sometimes people are concern of money or reputation .
Money is a demonstration of success and reputation is an elevation of social status .

I agree that money and reputation are important .
However , I also believe that if someone is loving what he is doing , ultimately he will receive what he planted .
The person occupied business with more dedication , it will be blooming with many flowers .
Those who reallly perform what they like they can show enduring dedication .

Roumi once said that a person who stands in all gates can never stand in any gates truly but a person stands in one gate will stand in all gates .
People who try to collect everything will end up with nothing .
They will have many distracted ideas .
His efforts were dispersing in many issues and his knowledge will be limited .
He cannot deepen the subject and knows the details .

However when a person specialized in one subject , he gets a perspective of analyzing the problems .
Since he concentrates all his efforts in one field , he can become more creative .
He will think of the subject all the time .

Many people have a problem about timing .
They criticize their mismanaging schedule .
Therefore the time management concept was revealed as a part of business field .
The time management is about work less and do more .
How will we create this seemingly paradoxal case ?
Well , while we are squezing our days in a few issues , we will become more productive .
Every action will be complement each other rather that obstacle each other .

So , I finally recommend to all mentors ( parents , friends , teachers ) to help kids to find the beloved subject and to encourage them to work hard .
