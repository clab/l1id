I agree that there will be fewer cars in the near future , because current technological and scientific developments prove to alleviate man 's desire and need of mobility by driving .
Other means of transportation have come to be used much frequently over the last 10 years due to the fact that they cost much lesser than they used to .
Flying , instate and out of state , is more common and practical by all means .
Besides , when I consider the urgency of fuel in each individual vehical , I can not help but think that the earth 's reserves should not last long enough to support such spenditure .
Although planes run on fuel , they carry much more people at a single occasion .

Just as means of transportation have developed , our habbits of communication have also changed and we have become more mobile , meaning more accessible , so that we do not have to drive to those places where we are expected .
Our daily jobs are mostly handeled from our desks ; over the internet , or on phone .
The unstoppable growth of mobile phone technology enables us to be at multiple stations at the same time .
We can drive while we are ordering pizza over the phone and keep a client on hold on the car phone .

As far as technology goes , perhaps , we will not even need feul-oil cars in the 20 years to come .
The most recent technology pormises to developed more profound models of solar cars , or hydra automobiles .
World 's leading environmental foundations support , both financially and ideologically , that more investments should be bestowed upon technological improvements so that alternative modes of transportation can be attained .
I strongly believe that the world may turn out to be a less polluted and peacefull abode afterall .

20 years may not be a lot of time considering the historical developments of people ; yet , a lot can be achieved in such a duration if the drives and the motives are right .
Less fuel consumption , lesser car , and car accidents for that matter , may be a few motives for starters .
