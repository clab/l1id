As a matter of fact I think we first start with the term young , who are young people , to count a young people should we in a certain range of age or should we distinguish certain behaviours .

We all leave in a global interacting society , as humans we all have functions for the development our social and culturel life , as i 'm trying to say you can not society into parts ( Like young or old ) you uoght to think as a whole .
People do not leave alone mostly they live in crowded cities .
On this cities you are in an interaction with the rest these could be either young or old .
Sharing a place to live with others means rules for society order preservation .
These rules could be written ; like laws or could be unwritten like cultural conventions or practices .
The one who did'nt came against these rules ought to live untouched .

It is easy to blame or recriminate each other for behaving in an un acceptable way .
Instead of this tpe of behaviour we should requestion themselves both as an old or a young member of the society .
We first try to find the mistake on ourselves than putting the blame on other side .

If there 's a clash between young and old members of the society both sides shoul held the problem together and try to find a solution together , as this problem may not giving enough time for their communities or not doing their obligations .

we can say if there is a problem this all ours we should solve it with all parts of the society
