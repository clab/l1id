If we think about the statement , that `` It is better to have broad knowlegde of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific sucject '' , we can make a lot of comment on it .
Because everyone have different ability to answer any question or make comment on any question .
In this essay , the specific subject , that is stated before , is critisized and compared and contrasted .

Firstly , in my opinion , half of people living in the world may choose different one of the choises in the statement from rest of them .
if I say something about that topic , I say that of course everyone should specialize in one spesific subject , that is beneficial for humanity , but he or she also have a little knowledge of everything , because nowadays human population is developing increasingly .
So technology is .
As the matter can be seen , specializing in one specific subject does n't enough for working somewhere you want .
Bosses are searching for man who can do every job that necessery for the firm .
For example , if you are a computer engineer , you must know management because in the future you will be a manager , There is no reason not to be maanager , because nobody wants to die as retired engieneer .
Most people want more than they have .
In order to that , besides you specialize in one specific subject , you should know another academic subject as a hobby .

On the other hand , people who did n't choose specializing in one specific subject , are always loser , because there is n't any job anywhere .
The cruel world makes us to study whole day .
We must study English to pass prep class or must study buisiness administration to finish the school or must increas us culture to become more social , etc .

However I choose the second one , I suppose that the right one is the first choices to become more successful .
To sum up everyone should make his own decision about that subject to becaome successful and happy ,
