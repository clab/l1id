There always occurs some disagreements between young people and old people everytime and everywhere in the world regardless of their citizenship and region .
This will continue until the end of the world as well in my opinion .
But the base and the form of these disagreements changes over time .
Nowadays , the behaviours of young people among themselves or to their society are a major problem in the society .
People come together to help each other .
This is why a community is formed .
An individual can be considered week without its community .
I hereby admit that nowadays young people do not give enough time to build good relationships with their communities .
The also do not help other individuals in their community .
This condition widens the gap between them and their society .

Youngsters may have distinct hobbies other than older people or other young people have .
But they should respect to the other ideas and hobbies first of all .
I consider this issue in order to emphasize the importance of being respectful while communicating in a community .
This will HELP community to reach qualified standards .
Because the communication is very important in a society .
However , young people do not behave in that manner .
For example , yestarday , I saw a young man that is listening music with his walkman phone in the bus .
That 's OK , he can listen whatever he wish .
But not that loudly .
The volume of the music was loud enogh to make us listen to .
Another youngster near him said : ` Hey , can you adjust the volume .
Pull the volume down man !
` After this , they started arguing in the bus and the people in the bus were unhappy .
There are two wrong behaviors in this example .
The first one is the loudness of the music that the youngster listening to : the second one is the attitude of the other youngster while talking rudely .
As a result , other people ( community ) became unhappy .
If the youngsters would hae wanted to help them , they behave differently and respectfuly .

Youngsters nowadays do not read any books .
` I do n't like reading .
I prefer playing with my Game Cube. ' they say .
The young people of this generation are the managers of the next generation , next age .
How can a lazy and untalented person manage a group of people .
A question here may arise : ` Is taking responsibility directly proportional to having enough knowledge - so reading ? '
The answer is always ` Yes ! ' for me .
The more you know , the more you help your community .
Not during your young ages , but during your older ages while working for your country .
Being a very important virtue , reading should not be underestimated .
For an instance , how an untalented and less-reader teacher can help his/her society ?
He/she cannot .

In conclusion , youngsters should be more carrefully while communicating with their community and helping them .
