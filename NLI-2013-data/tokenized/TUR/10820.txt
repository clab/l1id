There are many ways to be a successful person .
I think trying new things and take risks is highly releated with being a successful person and this approach effects positively the way of being a successful person .

Life always brings some problems and extreme situations that we have to deal with .
We all have a different method to handle those situations and problems .
Sometimes we can not be able to solve problems with the ways that we already know .
At those situations we must try new things and sometimes take risks to deal with it .
My past experiences showed me that take risks and trying new things in certain areas let me to be accomplish many objectives and led me to be a successful person .
For example the company i worked for had to make a decision about entering into a new market or not .
This new market were totally in unpredictable conditions and highly volatile to make an investment .
But our manager decided to enter into that new market and that risk taking brought us many new customers then we thought and it surely worth that what we decided .

Furthermore , life does not go the same way .
Conditions may change .
Doing what you already know well does not work all the time .
For example if you are an agricultural product seller and when your neighbourhood becomes more industrialised .
It is better you to change your job to an industrial device seller .
It is a risk taking but it helps you to survive at new conditions .

If you want to be a succesful person you should definetely take risks to survive and go on life .
