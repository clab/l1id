Success Sleeps In Reality

People who are in the search of new things and like to take risks rather than doing in well-known form may be considered successful when it is heard .
However , I totally disagree with this idea of desire towards new things and risks for several reasons .

The first reason that supports my idea is that time is the most valuable concept in human life , and it should n't be wasted .
It means that someone should run after empty dreams or the ideas that increases the slope of life , for human life is short .
For example , when the history is examined , one can easly see that there were lots of mad scientists who dreamed lots of mad things including `` navigation in time '' , but if one looks at the results , there is nothing to applaude .
Descartes , mathemetician and philosopher , can be considered a nice example for life , for the he was so successful although he did n't dream or take risks .

The second reason , that one should n't try new things and take risks , is the comprehension of the primitive knowledge ; that is to say , people may try to learn the theories or methods that have been already accepted by the authorities .
Before creating or commenting , the knowledge should be enlarged as much as possible .
By the way , instead of trying new things or taking risks , one can profit from its own knowledges or try to be satisfied in his borders .
For example , if an engineer learns the current progressions in his major and improves himself , he does n't need to try new things or take risks to be succesful , because he is aldready succesful .

All in all , as the reasons are shown , I think that the idea of resting in peace of its borders , and following my life as it flows is better idea
