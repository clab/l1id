I agree with the statement that it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
When we look around us , we can easily see that people we define as `` successful '' are generally the ones who have and eclectic knowledge on subjects .

As a high school senior who is in the process of apllying to colleges , I 've realized the importance of being a well-rounded person even .
Colleges do n't just want kids who have great SAT verbal scores ; you have to get a high score on the math section of the test as well .
If you want to guarantee your spot in the admissions , you better be ready to take a shot on the SAT subject test .

The people who earn the most money , according to some surveys , are bio-medical enginners .
Have you ever thought why ?
They not specialize on medical subjects but also are experts on engineering .
Or even doctors .
It 's not enough for them to specialize on biology , or anatomy ; they have to learn a wide range of subjects of they want to become successful in their professions .
Also if you have a wider knowledge on things , you can have more options to choose from in your life .

The human brain never fails to amaze me .
I 've experienced that as you put more knowledge into your brain , it just starts wanting to absorb more and more knowledge .
It never gets enough .
Even if one believes that specializing in one specific subject is better , they should start by trying to gain a broad knowlede on things , because it will make it easier for their brain to understand .

Everything happening in this world is related to another somehow .
It is hard to specialize in physics , for example , if you do n't have much of a knowledge in mathematics ; which makes me start to think that it is `` necessary '' to have a broad knowledge of many subjects `` even if '' you want to specialize in one subject .
