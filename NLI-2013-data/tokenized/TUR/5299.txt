With the developmemt of the industries all over the world , a though race or competition has begun between companies to sell their products and therefore keep surviving in the industrial environment .
For this purpose the companies put a lot on advertisement , most of which shows the product much better than it really is in order to sell it .
There are several reaons why a product is perceived much better than it is by the customer .

First reason is that when introducing a product , the advertisement mentions only the good and attractive aspects of the product .
The consumer purchases it without knowing its ' negative sides .
For example a product may have many technical properties , which are also presented in the advertisement , however the product may not be durable and in the advertisement it is never mentioned .

Second point is that many products have some certificates , presented in their advertisement , which do not really account for the quality of the product .
A low quality product can even get a cetificate because the requirements for the certificate are only based on the documents that the company presents to the quality assurance comapny .
The company is not actually examined for conformance to the stated issues on its report .
The advertisements tell that the product is very high quality and shows the certificates it has as a proof .
An example for this type of certificate is the ISO9000-9001 .
This worldwide certificate deals only with the documentation of the quality system in the company and usually fails to account for the actual quality of the product .
When consumers see this certificate on the advertisement of the product they take it for granted that the products ' quality in convenient .

Last point is that advertisements usually do not use real examples when introducing a product .
For example a person who is advertising a sports device is usually an athlet or even a body builder .
However when the consumer watches that advertisement he usually thinks that the man or woman on the advertisement has built those muscles and become fit by that device .
Another example might be on high fat containing foods .
People on the advertisements of these foods are usually slim and the consumer thinks he can also be slim although he consumes that product .

To sum up , advertisements generally mislead the consumers about the properties of the product due to several reasons ; they mention only the attractive and good parts of the product , they expose insufficient quality certificates as a proof of quality and they use unreal examples .
Therefore , consumers should be more careful in buying a product relying on an advertisement .
