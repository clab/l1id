During our lifecycle , we encounter different periods due to our age and we have to obey to bear certain roles .
We try to make a promising future in our younger period whereas we bear more responsibility in our older period .
But when it comes to enjoying life , does younger people have more fun compared to the older people ?
I think not , even though it seems so .

In younger periods of life , we will be persisting , keeping on trying to make a promising `` future '' for ourselves .
Every progress in means of academic performance of fields of business is for making a basis for our future .
In short , we invest , to gain a future .
Furthermore , we have less responsibilities , which may seem to be priceless for many people but not for me .
Having less responsibilities means that you have less control and effect in your life .
When you are a child , your mum will buy your clothes , chooses the meals you eat and even takes stesp in your early academic life .
So , you are dependent on your family in your early lifetime .
As you grow and become older you will increase the span of your responsibilities .

Additionally , younger people lack may be the most important aspect of success and survival in life : experience .
Younger people are worse in decision making and successing in every field they are introduced to as new .

Does being young has nothing to have fun ?
Absolutely there are some .
You can party like crazy , live being dependent on your family and pay no care .
Everything seems to be in order and you do not have to deal with that , then why not just have fun of it ?
As I mentioned earlier , this is an illusionary situation and one have to know that his/her family will not take care of him forever , so he/she has to invest for his/her future .

When we look into life through the older stages of lifecycle , everything is established and in order .
We `` harvest '' our investment of younger periods and have fun of it .
We have established what we dreamed of and we have reached the point , the point of success in our heads .
Therefore , I thing one will be satisfied with his/her life in their older periods .
Now , we have the responsibility of our life , even the lives of our children or others , like our employees .

Another point is that we have the most experience in our older periods , we know how to study , how to be persistent to reach goals and even how to have the most fun out of life !

To conclude , I strictly reject the idea of being younger means enjoying life more .
In my opinion , being younger means that you are an unexperienced , unestablished passenger of the travel through life ; whereas being older means that you are experienced and you are established .
The advantages I have stated throughout this essay of of being older will lead to enjoying life more than the younger ones .
