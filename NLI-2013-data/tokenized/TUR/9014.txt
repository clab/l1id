`` It is more important for students to understand the ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts '' .
I disagree about this statement .
When I was child really I could agree above the statement .
But now everything changed .
In our time students want to learn reality .

Students especially nowadays can learn a lot different subject from different sources .
These sources can be internet or television .
And also foreign countries television can be watched fron students and they can see different point of views .
Also some countries they can learn real history of their countries and war reasons .
After that at class Students can ask teacher some questions about fact .
Before this was not , when teacher whatever says students can take this idea or concept .
For example before I learnt from my teacher about First World War , according to his statements ; we lost the war because our alliens lost .
But now I learnt the facts from different sources especially foreign sources everything is different .
All my ideas and concepts confused .
Globalization started in the world .
After globalization lectures , teachers or speakers any meetings or any speaking places must pay attention every sentence .
Students now can questioned every word and every idea .
Therefore , giving lectures all the time should developed their knowledges .
Students can make for searching because of much spare time .
Teachers can not much time for searching time because marriage and having children can stop them .

Consequently , all the time lecturers shoul leran facts all the subjects especially about history because now every human-being can reach every knowledge or every country all over the world .
They can also meet a lot different countries people and they can learn from them , from television , from internet every reality and facts .
Because The world is globalizationing .
