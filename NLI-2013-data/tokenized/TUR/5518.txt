Many of the companies believe that , the advertisement for the a product is crucial , vital for its presentation to the customers .
And most of the customers believe the scenes created by the advertisements wil come true when they buy this particular product .

Considering the reasons behind these advertising activities makes me to believe that too much of advertisement about one particular item indicates that it should have at least defects to cover .
Addition to this , I will support my opinion based on the facts that ; the life styles that are promoted by the companies , the reliability of the information presented and the threats to the uniqueness of our lives .

First of all , I am against the notion of the belief that , buying a product will change my life forever ( until the new product comes into scene ) .
Many of the women customers believe that , by using a particular brand of shampoo , they will have a hair like Rapunzel , or the fourty-year-old women will become `` chicks '' by using anti-aging facial creams .
So do we have fourty-year-old women around ?
with wrinkles ?
Subsequently , the advertisements try to sell the consumers the life style that is shown on the TV , not just the product itself .

Secondly , I am sure about that , the scenes we watch are not totally true .
The photography of the colorful , delightful food are mostly shot at the time when the food is half cooked .
Also , the hair in the shampoo advertisement was first cleaned , polished and finally probably made with a sophisticated hair designer .
Every type of hair will look as the same as it appeared in the AD , if processed that much .

Consequently , advertisements are harmful for our unique lives .
Out traditional clothes , our grandmother medications , all ..
The colors people like to wear should not be changed over seasons with fashion .
Do you belive that we wear the 60s clothes nowadays because of the advertisement we saw on each day , regarding the new fashion of the year ?
Everyone in this world will soon wear a jean in the future .
It is not so diffucult to estimate what we will be wearing in the next future , just the same type of cloth .

To conclude , the advertisements are harmful for our lives , in the way that the life styles that they offer , the scenes that they create and threatens the uniqueness of our lives .
