In the changing world , there have been lots of changes around us and one of them is in the job environment .
Nowadays specialiazed workers have been more popular .
If we discuss about that if is it better to have a board knowladge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , I think to specialize on one topic is better and preferable .

First of all If you specialize on one topic you will be the one in your own area .
You will be the only person that you know about the whole topic .
Everybody will come and ask you questions about that topic .
You will be the exper .
For example if you are a network engineer you are the only one who know about the network systems between computers , phones and other communication channels .

Secondly , if everybody comes and ask you a question you feel yourself very important person .
This contributes your motivation .
Feeling of beeing only one gives the impression that you are a star and you are one step in front of other people .
For instance , there is a famous coocker , named Emine Beder in Turkey .
She is the best in Turkey , so all television programms try to jinvite her their T.V. channel to increase the ratings .
Because people follow her .
This situation should have make her very happy and motivated .

Thirdly , if you are the one in your own topic your company or firm must pay you a lot or must pay for you what you want to work with you .
You will have right to say a word about your salary .
You can earrn much money to survive your life .
This is the most important aspect .

Finally , as many things around us job conditions have been changing .
Because of that reason people should specialize on their own topic due to the reasons I mentioned above that , to be one in their own area , to feel beeing the most important person and make more money to live .
People are free to make their own choices but I think the reasons that I talked about are very logical , so they have to focuced on them .
