I agree with the the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people .
I think that young people have more opportunities to enjoy their lifes .
The older people can enjoy their lifes when they are retired , they can have a more confortable and relaxible life .
They have all they time for themself .
They can spend more time with their family .
They are not able to do all the activities that a younger people can do .

The younger people have a different point of wiew of the life , they do n't have a lot of responsabilities so it 's easy for them to act how they want .
The older people have to think about their children .
The younger people take the life easier but the older people have to think a lot before taking an important decision because they have a lot of things to care about .
The younger people have more energy for enyoj life that 's why the older people prefer to spend their time at home .
