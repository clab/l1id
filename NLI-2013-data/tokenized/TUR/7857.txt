Have i ever been lost in foreing country ?
Some people may think the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide , However other might support that it is not the best way .
Fortuhermore it is seemed clear to me that it is most efficient and useful idea .
Because of having a no knowledge about the place where people plan to visit and having a good experience .

The first point i would like to make about the idea , There are several advantages about visiting with tour guide in a group led .
First of all i agree this statement .
Hence in other country which we have no idea about how the life is there .
Because of the criminal activities or any accident such as getting lost .
being sick and not available to speak native language .
Consequently i had experience about visiting to other countrt which is Eygpt for touristic reason .
I got lost when i was 14 years old and i couldnt speak arabic or french even english .
Thus i had rough time with finding my parents and guide can help and take care of us .

On the other hand , i have a habit that i would like to discover everything because i believe that this is the best way of learning so because of what had happened me .
I had changed my mind and i am supporting the main idea of text .
Because we have never gone there and the guide have been there more than us , which means we have less information than guide .

Clearly i have had experience about being lost , i had changed my mind to be a person who has a more knowlegde than i have so that i can enjoy and learn easyly .
Furthermore i would go next time with group led with a guide .
