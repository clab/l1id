THE TRICKY ADVERTISEMENTS

Today , with the development of the media , the expansion of the newspaper , the increasing number of the channels , the producers get a chance to introduce their products better .
Once a point of a time , the producers can not introduce their goods as well as it has happened today .
This is , of course , a good thing for the producers and the clienteles .
However , it should not be forgetten that sometimes the products seem much better than they rally are .

First of all , the quality of the product may be seen on the television at the highest level .
On the other hand , when you go to buy it , you can be shocked .
You may , sometimes , think that it is not the one you see on the television .
For instance , one day , I decided to buy a sport equipment .
I saw an equipment on the television .
I thought that it would suit me very well .
When I went to buy it , I saw that it would not meet my needs .
It was not as desirable as I thought when I saw on the television .

Secondly , the function of the product can be shown better than it really is .
When you read it on the newspaper or you see it on the television , you can read or listen lots of usefull and good sides of the product .
You can easily believe what has been stated and you can purchase it .
Most probably , you will see that the product is exegerated to be sold .

Thirdly .
the size of the product can be shown bigger or smaller than its ' normal size .
For example , if the product is better in small size the product can be shown smaller than its ' normal size .
Shall the product is better in big size , the product can be shown bigger than its ' normal size .
that is , you can be traced by the advertisement of the product .

To sum up , we are shown different kinds of advertisements on the televisions and on the newspapers .
They are beneficial for the sellers , but we , the clientele , can be sold the products which are not as good as we are shown .
The advertisement can be used for different purposes and the product seem much better than they really are ,
