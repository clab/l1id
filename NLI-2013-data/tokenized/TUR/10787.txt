I would disagree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks .
Rather , I would prefer to describe the success as a result of being aware of one 's own potential , which is related with ` what people already know and and how to do well` .

People can take risks any time in their life .
In fact , risk taking is an open venture to all humanity .
Nevertheless , only few could manage to be called successful , because they knew what they would do .
For instance , it 's hard to assert that , a person who has an outstanding performance in the school but not social enough , will achive to be a well kown stand up star .
If he tris his chance in show business , that would not be taking risk , but rather unrational , since the result would be catastrophe .
If that student develops a brand new idea in her or his related subject , that would again not be risk taking or trying new things .
The project or the idea of a person derives from his or her capacities .
Considering the hyper rich people and inventors , success stories are created and these are given as examples to the public .
However , there is no clear prescription of being successful that can be applied to all people .
Successful people are the people who could be able reach the knowledge of being their potential .

As in our illustration , the student in the school , being aware of his potential in studying , is more close to be succesful .
