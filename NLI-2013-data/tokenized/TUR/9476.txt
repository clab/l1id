I think it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts than learn facts .
there are several reasons why I think that way .

the first reason is that in our current classrooms we mostly emphazised lecture and forced to memorize certain facts rather than to understand them .
when we ask students if they learn something their response will be yes however , they can not apply their kowledge to a new situation .
they can not transfer their lnowedge , when they faced with a different problem they can not use their knowedge , the reason is that they just memorized those isolated facts .
they can only use in the same format they can not make connections .
different situations are challanging for them and if the format have chnaged everthing seems different to them .
eventhogh they have lots of information they can not use them .
highly educated people become illiturate .

the second reason why I think we should emphasize to understanding is that you can learn something but does it means that you understand it .
for example you you can teach a kid how to tie but can you not teach them to understand something .
The only think that you can do is that generate an environment where they can learn and understand something .
in an environment like that they can experience the richnes of useing their knowledge and earn satisfaction with competing a task the last reason I want to mention is that the direction of education is emphazising understanding rather learning facts .
of course we should also use facts but not as we use now .
what we did right now is giving tons of information .
we see students as computer or store place and store all the information in their brains .
most of the students dislike physics algebra and core science classes because they do not understand it .
if we want scientifically literate citizens , who can judege the situation and can make plausible chose we need chnage our education system and have students understand ideas and concepts .
otherwise we might have students with full of informations who can not use them .
I do not think that is waht we want from them .
