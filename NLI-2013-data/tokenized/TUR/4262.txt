I strongly support the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough rtime to helpiong their communities .
In this century young people seem indifferent to what happens around them .
Actually we can understand rthis issue by delving with their activities .
I will try to lay down my reasons by mentioning my previous statement .

First of all , young people most of the time choose to be lonely .
I reached this conclusion by observing the youth everywhere .
I will try to reconstruct a vivid picture of youth .
Look at the teenagers outside , maybe 80 percent of them listening music while walking or travelling in metro .
When you think over carefully , you willl discover that he or she does not want to have relationship with the community .
By means of this they are standing far away from their community .
Even though they they do n't want to share the view about any issue regarding the community .

Most impportant issues are education in the family and tecnology which cause the youth keep themselves away from community .
Let 's take tecnology , especially television .
When we examine the parents or family daily life , we see the reason why our children are reckless and disrespectful to their environment .
Each member in the family is passing time by watching something , mostly time consuming paparazzi and competition programs .
And no one is talking on this very useful time period .
So everybody goes own way of life and parents do not teach anything about communal life .
As a result , negligent and indifferent young people are forming everywhere .
It means that mankind is not thinking his future .
Because adults are responsible for these young generation .

All in all , as phsciologist said that if there is problem in teenagers , first of all , we have to examine the family atmospheres of this teenagers .
We should not forget that there is no another world so let us tend to this upbringing issue very closely .
Young people mean the representatives of us .
