I do not agree with the statement of fewers cars will be in use in the next twenty years than today .

First of all , the cost of owning a car is decreasing by time .
Only few lucky families had cars 20 years ago .
Today , an average middle income family has more than one car .
New technologies allow automobile companies to produce cheaper and better quality cars .

Not only cars are getting cheaper , income levels of the world economy is also increasing .
For instance in developing countries with high population , such as China and India , GDP growth is more than ten folds during the last decade .
Imagine , if one forth of the population of India and China can buy a car , that will approximately sum up to 500 million new cars .
That is the motivation behind the desire of buying new automobile factories in those countries .

One argument against this statement may be the pollution effect of the cars .
Although conventional fuels create pollution , many scienticts work on projects which are trying to use alternative energy sources for transportation .
Electricity might be the major energy source for cars in the next twenty years , so enviromental problems related with car usage will be irrevelant .

Finally , individualism is another factor that will support car demand .
People of 21th century enjoy to be different .
People show their difference by their clothes , watches , cars etc .
Generally speaking one person 's car shows his social identity .
Maybe in the crowded cities , people commute their offices by metro or bus , but this does not stop them buying cars .
