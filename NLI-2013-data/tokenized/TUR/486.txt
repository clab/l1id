In my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject in an academic study .
There are several advantages of both paths , however specializing in one topic would enable us to concentrate on one subject and to deal with its details closer .

The main reason behind my belief is that there is not enough time to learn everything and have a deep understanding of every subject .
By the increase in the knowledge in acedemic subjects , we have to have more time to consider all spheres of one specific subject .
For instance , a political science student could not have a deep understanding of the Middle East culture and politics in an education period of four years .
In addition to his undergraduate education , he has to have a research in Middle East and should attend to a university or an institute which is specialized on Middle East .
Actually an avarege life of a person is not sufficient to have a perfect knowledge of one specific subject .

In modern societies , the division of labor demands more specialized individuals and the society is evolving into a hegemony of technocrats .
Beginning with the movement of rationalization in the nineteenth century and with the improvement of technology , we have more detailed subjects to deal with , contary to pre-modern times .
So , there it is not only my preference to get specialized in one specific subject , but it is a necessity for the society .
The details are increasing and we ought to get consistent with this development .

We also need to consider that specializing in one specific subject would be meaningless , if it is so independent from the context which it is belonged to .
For example , it would be meaningless to know everything about the history and the culture of the Middle East , if the person would not have the enough information about the history of the whole world and the relation between civilizations .

In conclusion , as a result of the development of the modern societies , people have to specialize in one specific subject .
because there is not enough time to deal with many academic subjects .
