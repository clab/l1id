In my opinion this kind of approach to the subject is not eligible .
Because if you just consider the fact of their doing enough or not enough for the community you could always get the conclusion that they are n't doing enough .
I am quite sure that there steadily is a great amount of work to do in the community .
I think if one is thinking about this problem you have to generally think about what young people are doing in their free time .
There are a lot of activities which could be done by adolescents like sports or activities in theater groups ect .
But they do still too much time wasted for video games , tv and stuff like that .
Therefore , I think young people should generally rethink their activities in their free time .
Besides , there is still the great problem that a great amount of pupils nowadays have great difficulties in school .
They are not motivated to achieve good grades and tend to forget how important their education is for their future .

Thus I think it is much more imported to get teenagers to do something at all before we argue about the sense of community work .
Nevertheless , doing community work could be a way to accomplish this goal .
Doing some projects in their communites could be a great opportunity for them to find something they are really interested like reading fary tales to smaller children for instance .
I did this as well when I was younger and discovered my great interest in telling people stories and joined a theater group afterwards .
The acknowledgement they would surely get could be a great experience in order to get an idea of what it 's like when you merit something you worked very hard for .
Taking care of a small group of younger adolescents could help in improving ther leadership abilities which is a quite necessary soft skill nowadays .
By keeping into contact with younger people they could as well help them solving their problems because sometimes parents are not able to do so because of the fact that they are much older and not familiar with these kind of troubles anymore .
Finally .
I liked to finish this essay with the conclusion that young people should generally do more activities in their free time .
