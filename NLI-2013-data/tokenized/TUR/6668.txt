In the last few years technology is updating itself rapidly .
To follow the new invents become very difficult nowadays .
Especially one of the main problem which we have in our lives is transportation .
The scientists are trying lots of things to help all the world people about this problem .
Can you imagine what will happen10 years later ?

If technological investmesments go on rapidly and scientists work so hard , it is not a different evnet to become having fewer cars in twenty years .

First of all , let us look at the devolopment which have done in the last 10 years .
Ten years ago , it was not thought that everyone would have mobile telephones and comminucate to each other without any cable .
Perhaps the people who heart that had a smile on their faces because that is not posible for them to have anything like this .
When it comes to fewer car event , this is not impossible in this view .

The other thing which we must consider is the way of technology about transportatin .
Although many wide any confortable roads are done , There is still no solution for this problem .
But in last years , the number of travellers increasing faster than before .
So , investmens will be much more on air transportatin .
As we see in cartoons , this can be possible , too .

On conclusion , we can say that , because of unexpected fast devolopment about technology , the use of cars will probably decrease and instead of that the air transportation , it will probably be choosen by many people .
If you see some flying cars on the air a feew years ago , do not be afraid .
That day probably is this day .
