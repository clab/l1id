Travelling by a tour guide or alone ?
Some people prefer the former while others prefer the latter .
To each his own .
However I am a person who likes to travel alone , therefore I am disagree with the statement for the reasons below .

First of all , in these kind of tours , the guides usually give general or most interesting information - according to them of course - and do not state details which I may like .
Therefore I like to have my own books about this certain places and travel with them and read detailed information which are interesting for ` me` .
For instance , while I was travelling around the western Europe , I had these books which gave me extremely sufficent information about the places I have seen .

Secondly , you can take your time when you are travelling alone , however you do not have opportunity to spend your time efficiently when you are travelling by a tour guide .
Therefore you usually do not have time to examine the places that you travel , moreover you do not feel them since there is pressure of the guide because they just want to finish the tour and get their money as soon as possible .
For example , in the same trip I mentioned before , I had an experience like that .
The guide finished 30 minute tour in 10 minute , using the hot weather excuse and then I never attemped to go a trip by a guide .

Last but not the least , by travelling on your own , you have the flexibility of choosing places which you do not have if you take a all included trip .
So you would not face to travel all over the places which you do not like or even hate .
Because it is waste of time and money .
Trerefore spending your energy for the places that you like is more sensible .

To sum up , people who like to gain general information and like to see most interestingly claimed places in a time like blinking your eyes , should prefer guide tours .
However I prefer travelling alone because of the flexibility of time and possibility of choosing place and the detailed information .
