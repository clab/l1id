Cars are the most convenient and usable transportations in the world .
Also , almost every people have car for transportation and for their hobbies , too .
Therefore , I think that in twenty years usage of cars will increase in order to decrease .

First of all , cars have variety of usage areas for every kind of transportation facilities .
Day by day , population of the world increases parallel to the consumption of cars .
Many people need cars for private voyage from their homes to their jobs or for their holidays .
In addition , some people - especially young people - have passion to modify their cars .
It seems to me that cars are the toys of young generation .
Secondly , many people afraid of travelling by plane or by ships in the oceans .
For example ; the most famous artist in Turkey , who is Kemal Sunal , always used car becuse he is always afraid of air plane .
He made film in the Pyramids and he had travelled from Istanbul to Pyramids by car .
Therefore , cars are the first , unique and remarkable choice for them .
Thirdly , car is the cheapest transportation in many countries .
Around the world , a lot of people go other cities or countries for holidays , trips and for jobs .
They always consider the most suitable way for the transportation .
As the technology improving , cars will become more comfortable and cheaper .

In conclusion , in the future there will be more cars in use than today .
Usage of cars is not suspected to decrease because cars are the unique and cheap transportation vehicles in the world .
