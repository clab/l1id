Nowadays , people try to be successful in every ways .
For example big business companies always try to open a new company .
I think this lowers the quality because you ca n't be concentrated on a specific product , and you can use your whole effort on that subject .

First , being concentrated on a specific topic is very important for a successful life .
This specific topic could be everything in our live .
It could be in business life , in academic life .
For example , you will become a boss of the biggest company on your country with mechanical products for long vehicles .
Also you want show yourself to the other countries .
You start to sell the farm products for gain more money but you could become unsuccessful because you do not know anything about a farm products you do not have any experinces abot farm product so how you could be successful without these important facts .
if you concentrated on your major job maybe you could be the biggest in the world with your experinces .
We could say also in academic world also you ca n't be a mechanical engineering teacher and a english literature teacher in same time .
After these specific examples , we can make a result that you should focus on a specific subject .

Second , your effort is very important in successful .
you always make one job in a day than two jobs in a day for a defined success .
For instance , I never make good two things in a day but i make a wonderful one thing in that day because I use my all effort on one specific job .

At the end , in my opinion , for being successful in life you should be concentrated on a specific subject and use your whole effort on that subject .
There is a Turkish speech like that : Be an apple but best apple .
