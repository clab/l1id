Some say that , there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
This makes no sense and is not logical at all when we consider the real facts that we see everyday .
There are two main points which shows that the number of cars in use will increase instead of decreasing ; firstly , it is already increasing instead of staying the same ; and secondly , the world and the countries are getting bigger so they will be more necessary in the future .

First of all , it is obvious that the number of cars are inreasing each day goes by ; so it is not really wise to say that it will decrease in time .
It is not really possible for thousands of people to suddenly say that `` Ok , I do not want to use cars anymore . ''
.
Moreover it is a need for people more than a choice and nobody seems to solve the transportation problems .
The fact is , people will keep buying cars unless there is a better way offered for them to go where they want to go and it seems like it is so far away from now and the future .

Secondly , the cities and the countries are getting bigger ; and it is not a really good option to use public busses , taxi or metro anymore .
Cars seem to be the best option .
Taxi is a really expensive way for transportation and busses are really slow .
Metro is neither but it is really crowded and there happen too many crimes in the metros so it is not a really good option either .
Cars are in the middle of all of these .
It has all these problems and risks as well but in little amounts .
So again , cars are the best option that people have .

To sum up , because of the reasons that the numbers of cars are already increasing and the world is getting wider everyday , the number of cars will not decrease in the future .
In fact , it is more reasonalbe to say that this number will increase .
In every aspect , cars are the best option that is offered to humanity and no one seems to be looking for another option for them .
In order to decrease the number of cars in use , people must be offered something new and better to use .
