Advertisement is crucial for the companies that are trying to have a place in the market .
These firms aims to show their products , or advertise them in a way that will attract the potential buyers .
However , in that competition they are exaggerating the advertisement - making the products seem much better - for the sake of the profit .

Within the the communication network ( i.e. media , internet ) around the world , the advertisements can reach up to many people .
The person seeing a great advertisement of a product that he \ she is planning to buy can easily believe the correctness and the reliability of the product .
However , it may not fulfill his \ her requirements .
For example , my mother had seen an advertisement about a machine that could decrease your belly size 3-4 in a month with regular activities .
It seemed so great that my mother just got the idea to be thinner by exercising with this machine .
Even though it was quite expensive , she bought it .
She had done exercises for a month , but later she realized no change so she put it in a trash .
The point that I want to mention by giving this example is that a person can be really influenced by the advertisement that is shown so great that might enable the audience just believe it .

As a second example of the false advertesiment , one day I have seen a small show whose sponsor is Gilette .
That TV-show is always emphasing how good Gilette razors are .
They are showing a handsome man , shaving smoothly , 3 - razors , nothing left after one sweep etc .
At that time , I was using a cheap razor for shaving and it was quite enough for me .
However , I have decided to change my razor , I do n't know the reason but I just wanted to try this `` hilarious Gilette razor '' .
I dont think that I should mention about what happened afterwards .
It had nothing special .

Growing communication devices enables the advertisements to reach to many people .
However , companies are making their best to make their products seem better in order to improve their income , profit .
