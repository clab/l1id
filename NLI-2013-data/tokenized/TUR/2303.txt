being energetic and active makes the young people to have the strength of doing anything that they want .
by this way they can experience lots of things .

so that they feel the wind breezing on their faces while they go fast and they have the joy of driving fast and as well as the joy of life .

moreover , young people are more curious almost about everything .
for instance the curiousity leads the young people to make a search to find some things new .
the joy of making a search , getting their own results and making some interpretations are very valuable experiences for a young .
to give an example , mostly for travel , old people go only to a place and have some rest there .
but most of the young people do some travellings around the world .
this is mostly a result of their curiousity .
as long as they are curious young people will find some thing to enjoy with , to be happy with .

without any denial , one must accept that the young people do enjoy more than old people .
for young people , being active , energetic , curious makes them to go for the things they want to do .
by this way they take the taste of their life , and enjoy until they feel themselves as young and they realized that they are not done with the life yet .
