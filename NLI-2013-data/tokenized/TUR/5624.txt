Advertisements of commercial products serve as means of distributing information among consumers .
Consumers derive information about products ' quality , terms of use and price via advertisements .
Nonetheless , it may be argued that advertisements open a door to abuse their feature of distributing information in the sense that they may make goods seem much better than they actually are .

First of all , it should be seen that any possible misusage of advertisements is due to competition among firms which try to survive and generate profits as much as possible .
For this particular reason , it is obviously unreasonable for a firm to make misleading advertisements .
Because , this will consequently yield the result that experienced customers , who bought the product by trusting the advertisement , will not buy again the same product since the firm and its products are not reliable anymore .
Therefore , it is irrational and unexpected to come across with misleading advertisements as long as firms tend to survive for long periods of time .

Furthermore , regulatory agencies exist in most of the countries to prevent such advertisements if they are ever brought up by extremely myopic and short-sighted enterprises .
Thus , advertisements , which are supposed to be deceiving , can rarely fill the legal requirements .

As a conclusion , number of advertisements , which are supposed to make products seem much better then they really are , should be expected to very low , if they exist at all .
Because , such advertisements are neither wise and profitable options for firms in the long run nor legal in many countries .
