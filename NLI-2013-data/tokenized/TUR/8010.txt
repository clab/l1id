Fist , I do n't agree with this statement , because If you would like to go a place where you are in a vacation in there , you may want to be a free person .
On the other hand , you ca n't do everything what you would like to do in that time and in that place .
But , sometimes we need a tour guide who introduce us the place or city where we are in vacation there , because some places where we do n't know howmany historical places it has .

Besides this , If you go to travel with your tour guide you may have some problems .
For instance , when you would like to visit some historical places you ca n't choose where you want to go .
So , your travel guide may affect to you .
Your travel guide everytime stay with you .
You could n't have a rest with your family .
The best one is , travel only with your family .

Next , There wiil be many people in your vacation .
And most of them who you do n't see in your life or you do n't know how charecteristic person do they have ?
This point is very important because , If you do n't know a person or people , you should n't go to vacation with them .
Maybe some of them are guilty , we do n't know eachother .
And there will be a lot of problems with your group , If they are n't nice people .

Then , you could n't have a chance to choose them .
I think if we could choose which person can go to vacation with us , it maybe possible to think go to vacation with a grup and a tour guide .
But I never heard that you could choose your persons of group .

After that , maybe in your vacation , some of your group 's member would like to go to other places or would like to do different things , but you do n't .

Finally , the best one is everytime you should go to your vacation only with your family .
