As i learnt from my own experiences , understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts for students .
Students are not able to face with the facts and it is easier for them to try to understand ideas and concepts .

The first point i would like to make is that there some instinct feelings which make students tend to pay more attention to understanding ideas and concepts .
This is related to students age .
Most of students who are below 23 have trouble with their feelings .
The people under this age are tend to choose the easiest ways in order to satisfacte themselves .
The feelings control students .

Not only this feelings determines students preferences , but also the places they grew up play a crucial role in choosing preferences .
For example a person who study at high school is adjusting his behaviour according to what he or she sees from his friends .

Over all , in my opinion people who study at education centers such as schools , private courses , preperation classes etc ...
look like more interseting in realizing ideas and concepts .
This is a burning issue and may be fully cleared in the future .
