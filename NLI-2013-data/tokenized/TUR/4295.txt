Altough there are some young people who endeaver to help their community , it could n't be wrong to state that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
An old saying of my country says : `` Exceptions does n't make the rule disfunction . ''

The main reason of my supportting this statement is the way the young live , the way they behave to each other , the only intrinsic purposes for doing something and their attidutes towards older and younger alike .

Nearly all the young live now selfish .
They contemplate only the benefits for theirselves , which they can obtain from any activity .
They are unaware of the term ALTRUISM .
This is observed to be continuing in accordance with the technology .
The faster the technological inventions are made , the more selfish the people are .
The computers , the televisions and same functioning facilities are the prisons of younger , but the difference is they are happy there .
Everything in order to be done for being beneficial to the community does n't interest them , because they are happy in their prisons .
Their attitudes towards the others is really affected by the guardians in these prisons as well .
And everybody knows who the guardians are .

To sum up , the young are uninterested to the social problems , however whose guilt this is , is obvious : Technological improvements and us , who could not obey this inventions and who let them be the most important part of our lives .
