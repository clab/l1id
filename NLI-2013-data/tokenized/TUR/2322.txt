I do not agree that life is more enjoyable according to young people than according to elder people .
It not a fact which is proved scientifically that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Up to me , when you get older you will learn what kind of facilities and activities make you happy or unhappy .
Because of experiencing more than youngers , being older has lots of advantages .

Fistly , young people are more interested in trying new things .
But it is not sure that they will enjoy what they do .
They will experience an action to learn something .
Sometimes this action can lead young people to be unhappier than before .

On the other hand , when you become older , I am sure that you will be more clear about new things .
Moreover , when somebody gets older , he or she generally becomes what sort of actions change the mood pozitively .
As a result of these experiences , old people gets better time though they had fewer times to live than youngers have .

Secondly , the ages lived teach people to be more patient .
That is why older people are tend to insist on doing something even though they were very unsuccesful on it before .
Usually insisting on something causes to an amazing success .
Tell me , who finds a succesful life lack of enjoy !
As it is expected , instead of insisting on , young people tend to give up doing something that they are not succesful .
This giving up is going to be a reason of not being succesful and unhappiness .

Finally , by the help of the experiences and the patient catched as a results of the experiences , old people like and enjoy life more than young people do .
But it is very clear that one day everybody become older : as a result he or she is going to learn what makes life funny .
