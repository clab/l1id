Everyone works for an aim , this aim is called success or becoming successful .
We all want , try and work for it .
Have you ever thought of the first and the best comman qualification of successful people ?
I thought and share with you : always try new things , be creative and have self-confidence to take risks .
When you look around you will see the most successful ones are the ones who take the radical ideas and do not worry to give life to them .
First ; The old needings of human are the best reason for new things .
If you do not worry about if it will be liked by everyone you will become a great candidate for a successful people .
For example when the television first invented nobody thougt it would spread so rapidly but the inventors belived and now we see what happened clearly .

Secondly , new things mean creativity and i belive you do not need anything in your entire life if you had creativity .
Creative people always achive success , near or far one day they see its helps .
For example in the TV competition called Survivor : it is a coompetiton about human against nature : there is an island and men with nothing .
The competitors are similar in their physical conditions but their creativity make the difference .

Lastly , taking risks .
If you do not worry about others thoughts and have a selfconfidence there is nothing to stop you to success .
In my country there is a man without arms and legs he lost them in a train accident when he was 5 .
But now he is one of the greatest swimmers of my country hemaybe compete in Olympics soon .
He did not mentione the risks can occure when he was swimming .
All he has is self-confidence and belief in himself .

Consequently , i think successful people try new thingns , are creative and has enormous self-confidence to take risks .
If you have these qualifications i believe one day you will be very successful too .
