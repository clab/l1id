It is hard for me to choose on whether learning the ideas and concepts are more important than learning the facts .
The two concepts given are kind of completing each other so choosing one and leaving one out would create problems .
Still I would say that when starting to work on a new subject or issue it is really important to first understand the concepts and ideas because without them it is worthless to learn facts that you would not have something to base the new information and the new ideas given or tought to you .
As a metaphor I might say that the ideas and the concepts can be seen as the cement and the new facts can be the new rooms being decorated in an apartment that was built with that cement .

Leading from this metaphor still I can say that the facts so the rooms are important too because without them why would you build an apartment ?
As a student what I generally do is that , firstly I start and try to understand the deep concepts and ideas then I work on with the fact which help me to understand more in a much deeper way and the most important thing with the concept and idea part is that they are most effective tool for me to analyze the facts offered and given .
