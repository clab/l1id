The way of doing academic researches is always developing and dividing into new branches throughout many years .
As scientific and technologic innovation develops very fast , things to be researched are getting more complex and hard .
Due to this , academic subjects are increasing and their context are complicated .
In my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects for several reasons .

First of all , by specializing in one academic topic you have the opportunity to discover new things in science .
When you are interested in a specified topic deeply , it is possible to consider the details carefully .
For instance , human genome project is divided into several groups and every scientific group researches a detailed part of the project .
By doing this , they can rapidly get results and combine them .

Secondly , working with specific subjects gives you the chance of developing new scientific groups and working in coordination .
Research groups have the opportunity to study properly and organized .
If one scientist have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , he can not afford to concern with all problems and fails .

Consequently , specializing in one subject for academic researches is important to the development of science and technological innovation .
As we share the problems , we will be succesful quickly .
