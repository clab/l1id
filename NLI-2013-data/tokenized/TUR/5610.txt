the humankind always need advertisement to reach good life standart therefore advertisement is a very important aspect of humanslife .
everyone has different point of view about the idea of advertisement .
some assume that , advertisements make products seem much better than really they are , in contarry to those , some think that advertisement is reflects the origin of products .
i personally agree with the second idea .
these are my following reasons .

firstly , advertisement is important because of customers .
for example , last month i decided to give a party in my home .
i live apart from my parents so i did n't know which brand is really good .
actually , i have no idea about foods .
however i had wanted to give a very good party .
when i went to supermarket , i look around and some brands are similar for me. i have sen them in the advertisement so i could remember .
i believe others ideas about the brands and when i prepared the meals , i was very pleasure .
everthing was okay in my party .
i am sure that , advertisements open a light for me. if i did n't have any idea about this products , i think nothing would be better than my decisions which are learned me from advertisements .

secondly , advertisements are important for education .
it is not only important for foods or clothes .
for instance , last year i decided to take spanish course .
i did n't have any idea about which course is better and i had no friends who took a spanish course .
then , i looked in the internet because there are a lot of forums where people tell their ideas about different points .
when i entered the such websites , i was face to face with a lot of idea .
however , when i read all of them , one course is more populer than others .
therefore , i decided to take a course in there .
i think , it has become beneficial for me. although there was some bad informations or ideas in the ionternet , i can select the suitibla one .
in my opinion , this is a kind iof advertisement in the internet and it is the most logical way .

to last but not least , advertisements have an important role on purchasing .
moreover it is beneficial for businessmen .
for example , if i am hungry i want to eat something which is showed in the television advertisement .
and , in one week even if i eat my meal , i buy this product .
i think , this condution affect the rate of purchasing .
by this way , people can sell a lot of products .
for instance , last evening my little cousin was watching television and she saw a advertisement about milk .
in the advertisement , a baby was drinking milk and he was beginnig to grow up .
he is taller after he drink milk .
even if my cousin does n't like drinking milk anymore , he tells us that he wants to drink milk .
i think , this advertisement has positive affects both the customer and seller .
it is a fact that , milk is beneficial for children to grow up healty , so it reflects the main idea truely .
in addition to this , it is important for seller , because advertisement has positive effects on buying some goods .

all in all , as i said before advertisment is important for purchasing and it is beneficial for customers .
advertisement is related with both customer 's necessities and seller 's benefit .
the long but the short is that , advertisement has positive effects on people and it reflects the main products truely .
