Most of the people believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better .
They think that whether they know everyhing about a subject or not is n't important .
In contrast to these , I believe that specializing in one specific subject is better than having knowledge of many academic subjects .

I always give importance to complete a job that I work on .
It is n't enough for me to do only some part of it .
I think , for getting a success it is very important to complete the job .
Eveybody wants to have broad knowledge but there is an important point , do you specialize on it or do you know only a part of it .

In daily life , there is lots of people who are trying to talk about a subject whether they have a knowledge about it or not .
I do n't agree with it .
If I do n't have a knowledge about a subject , I wo n't talk on it , I will only listen people to get their ideas and learn something about this subjects .
If I want to specialize in this subject , I begin to research about it .
And for days I study on it for having the true knowledge .
On the other hand , I always try to add knowledge to my knowledge day by day dy .
Because I know that for getting a success , a person should be adaptable to changes .

I do n't forget a discussion about this situation with my best friend .
We are talking about tennis .
I have been playing tennis since 1991 .
I know every detail about tennis .
However , my friend never plays tennis .
She asked me a question about a racket and I g'ce information about her question but she said she know better than me .
And she began to give wrong information to my friens .
And after this experince , I decide not to talk on a subject that I do n't know or only know a part of it .

In conlusion , I always think that foir getting success it is not better to have broad knowlede than specialize
