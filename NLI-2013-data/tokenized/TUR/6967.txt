Considering the developments regarding energy sources in the past decade , I can say that this statemnt would prove to be true .
The increasing scarcity of petroleum , the lack of progress in introducing alternative fuels , and a growing consciousness of people to use public transport for their daily activities would all lead to this outcome .

Although scientists and many politicians have talked about the incoming shortage of oil since the early 1990s , we have actually felt the first sign of a bigger crisis in the years to come as the barrel price of oil reached over $ 70 last year .
It is now known that the disputed areas and countries with weaker ties and interests with the globalising world could shake the whole world with limiting the production or distribution of oil as Iran did it last year and Russia did when it refused to pump oil to Ukraine and as a result to the rest of Europe .
These high fluctuatins in oil prices will be even higher in the coming future and many middle and lower income housholds would afford at most one automobile or maybe none .

Recently , the introduction of alternative fules for cars has been a hot topic and even some hedge funds have moved in to invest in these projects .
However , aside from some substances that can improve the performance of gasoline and lead-free oil , there is no real progress to replace petroleum based motors .
Electrical motors can only be used in conjunction with the traditional motors and help increase the mileage of the car .
So , with no replacement , oils seems to be remain the main source of power for autos , in accordance with the argument I made above , rising oil prices will still make these technologies unattractable .

As a result of the above mentioned reasons , more and more people as well as conscious governments adapt public transport .
Especially subway systems are becoming more and more popular with citizens and local administrators as they provide a fast and comfortable way of transportation without being an extra burden on the city traffic .
For longer distances , high speed trains provide speed even greater than most autos and a comfort out of the chaotic highways .

The change from automobiles to other means of transportation will be hard and many people will try to resist at first .
However , when there will be no other way out people will definitely give the right decision and leave their beloved cars .
