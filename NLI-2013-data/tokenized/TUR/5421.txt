I agree with the idea that most advertisements make products seem mech better than they really are .
And I think this a natural behaviour for the advertisement business .
In order to understand that , we should ask the question `` why do companies advertise ? ''
.

Advertisement is a tool to increase the profits of a company through the increase of production , which also means that the increase in sales .
Today , lots of companies use advertisements and advertisement is a vital tool for companies .
However , only a few of them really care about whether the advertisements are true .
For that reason , advertisement is known as the art of lying in order to sell .

Advertisements can be seen everywhere , on the bus , at school , etc .
There is no way for a modern person to escape it .
So it a suitable tool for companies to introduce their products .
However , this introduction sometimes includes wrong informations about their products .
For example , a company can make people believe that its products are protective to sun eventhough scientists claim the failure of products strongly .
The public forgets what the scientists say in a few days .
And they are left with the advertisement that tells them to use the u.v. protective products of that company .
As you can see , the advertisement is succesful as it can make people buy that thing but it is misleading .

Besides its bad or unethical usage , advertisements can help people in some ways .
If they are really used for their mentioned purpoes of introducing new products , they acknowledge the customer .
So , the customer will be able to learn the properties of the product and will have an opprtunity to compare different types .
By that way , he can buy a better product for a better price .
This is the ethical and expected use of advertisements .
However the real life is not that smooth .

To sum up , it can be stated that the unethical use of advetiesments cause misleading of people .
However , companies dont care that point as its importantance is related to their profits for them .
However , the ethical use of that tool can help customers in many ways .
