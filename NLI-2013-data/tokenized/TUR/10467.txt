Today we are living in a time that the people always wants to be succesful in their job .
But here the discussion is that : What do I have to do for being succesful ?
Can I be succesful by getting experience by doing the same work for many years or would I have to try something new and change my style ?

Some people prefers doing their job in the same style that they have been always doing before .
They are not changing their styles so with every passing months and years , they are becoming more and more professional .
They are so sure for their work and they are feeling so comfortable .
But on the other hand their capacity is becoming too limited , so it is becoming harder for them to be creative in their jobs .
So with the repetation of their jobs , if he has not been succesful before , it is becoming less possible for him to be succesful .

So what other type of people we have here ?
Well there is a type who can take risks and try new things in their life .
For some people it is not enough to be capable of doing one job .
Yes you are doing your job ok , getting your salary and everything is going quite well .
But there is always ( or at least there have to be ) new thoughts in your mind .
You have to bring them to life or at least give them a chance .
After this period you have to risk your life , because miracles only come into life by taking risks .

In today 's world mostly people who is taking risks becomes succesful .
You have to try something that nobody has seen and tried , Unless you would be an ordinary working man like most of the others .
Yes it is possible to lose lots of things and fail by taking risks , but people mostly learn from their failures , not from their successions .
So with every failure you give it another chance and after a while you get so many experiences by this behaviour .
And yes in life every experience leads to the world of succession .

At the end I could say that yes its too risky to change your style and start something new , and yes you can even fail and lose lots of things , but what else can give you the feeling of being proud of yourself when you do something new that only a few people can do .
Be proud of yourself ...
