There are many people prefer travelling alone , while some prefer travelling with group .
This preference depends on people 's character and the way of their life .
If I go somewhere I would like to be with my friends .
I think traveling with group is the best way .

One reason I beleive that is , it is very difficult to make new friends for me .
I am very shy and not talkative person .
Traveling would be enjoyable with somebody who l can have a lot of thing to talk and share .
Otherwise it would be so boring .
I have not traveled by myself until I came to the US .
After that trip , I decided that I will never travel alone anymore .
I thought that this flight would not finish .

Another reason I think group trip is the best way is , it makes be more confident .
Trying to new thing in new places makes me anxious ; however , if l have a friends next to me , I can do whatever I want .
It gives me brave to do things which is in my mind .
This life can be enjoyable with some crazy things and that is what we always do with group of friends .

Finally , friend can make any places enjoyable .
Even if there is nothing to do , talking with friends makes us happy .
I can not have fun if l go to the Italy to see Rome or go to Switzerland to ski .
These thing can be enjoyable just with my friends .
There should be worse situation .
For example , if l go to the place that l have not known before and I do not like it , it woulde be so boring .
However the group of friends can reduce that easily .
