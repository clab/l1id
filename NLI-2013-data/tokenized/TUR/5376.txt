Since its very early emergence , conception and ethical side of the advirtesement has been harshly criticized both by the intellectuals and common people .
It is true that we all live in the era of globalization and capitalism of which the advirtesement constitutes ` the bread and butter ' .
However , there are still significant opinions claiming for existence of certain game rules which will prevent adviretesements to make products seem much better than they really are .

First , the ever-growing high competition in almost every market leads advertisements to develop such tactics .
Given the high density of competitors supplying , to some degree , similar products in the market , embodying some fictional qualities to one of them is a lot cheaper than improving it .

For instance , taking a bigger , tastier or more delightful picture of an Arby 's or Burger King hamburger ( most of these pictures are competely fictional ) is rather easy and useful to take a better competitive position in the fast food market .
It probably leads us to go and buy one of these burgers and this is the point when the responsibility of advirtesements ends .

To solve this problem of false representation of the products in market , it is necessary to have some sort of governmental interventions and regulations .
For the sake of both consumers ' and competitor firms ' rights , ministry of economic affairs in any given country should have the right and duty of controlling the advirtesement market accordingly .
As long as we do not have such instruments , fictional products are going to stay \ on our billboards .
