last year I took a course which is the electromagnetic theory .
many students who took this course , memorized the questions and answer in order to take high grade in the exam and at the end of the course they took high grades .
however they remember nothing from course and they study very hard in this year course which is the continued course .
I and my friends did n't take high grades but we remember all the concept of the courses .
because we studied very hard on understanding the concepts last year and the second course is quite simple for us because of last years studies .
also we use our information about the concepts of the course on the final project .
altough learning facts provides a high grade , learning the concepts is more important according to two reasons which are understanding the continueing courses and applying the information to the other areas .

fisrtly , understanding ideas amd concepts are strickly necessary for being succesfull on the other courses which related to the course .
if someone does not know the concepts of the one special topic , he/she will not understand the other topics related to special topic and he/she will not do good researches because of not understanding the research topic very well .

secondy , using the concepts of the courses on the other areas .
when we graduate from university , we will work on a company as engineer .
there will be many projects that we will deal with , and we will want to do the best project .
we will use our information and do research in order to find the solution to the project .
if someone know the concepts , he/she will easily connect the information that find in his/her researhes and his / her knowledge of the concepts .

to conclude , it should be more important for students to understand ideas and concepst than it is for them to earn facts .
using the concepts on the other areas and understanding the coming c
