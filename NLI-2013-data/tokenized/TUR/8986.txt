While I was in school I was very unhappy when its time to learn the fact and memorize them because I was having more fun when trying to understand the ideas and concepts .
I still believe on the same way .
I think that trying to understand ideas makes you think on it more and you learn easier .
In an other way the things you have learned keep in your mind in a longer period of time when you try to understand the idea or concept .

When you just try to memorize the facts and do not pay attentinon to the understand its concept I think its like being a car engineer who never seen a car .
A car engineer can know any technical detail about a car 's mechanic but if he had never seen a car he would not understand the what it is for and how it is working .

I had two different history teahers in high school , the one I had in second class was always want us to memorize and learn the facts .
The history teacher I had in third class wants us just to understand the ideas , like why the wars begin istead of when did a specific war begin .
I still remember the things i had learned in 3rd class but still have nothing in mind from the facts that i had memorised during second class .

As a conclusion , the reason that trying to understant the ideas instead of learing the facts makes you think more and help you to understand more , I think it is more important for me and most of the students to try to understand it .
In add'ition the thing you understand stay in your mind longer .
