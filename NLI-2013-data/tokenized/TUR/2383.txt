I disagree with the statement , because every age has its own oportunity to enjoy the life .
Motivation should be the keyword instead of motion to understand what really lies under enjoying life .

Against the undeniable power of the energy of young people older people have experiment to defeat the badly results that life carries .
This can help the older people to immedietly convert the negative into positive .
They only need to motivate themselves and feel confident .

Enjoying life does not mean having a sportive life , a person can enjoy the life by reading , writing or just by watching and commenting about the things that take place around him .
Everyone likes to watch the concept that they created before .

Young people have the ability of being more healthy but they do n't have free time and money to achive the activities that they really want .
However , older people have the financial power to enjoy these activities if they do n't need to spend so much phyisical effort .

The enjoys can differ in different ages .
The things which are very fantastic in the young hood can be very boring when you are old .

Finally every age contains its own way of life and in every age the person can create some motivation to enjoy tye life .
