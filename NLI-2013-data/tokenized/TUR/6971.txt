What will be the future of car ussage ?
People like travelling with cars , even the destination is near to their locations , and the car industry always pushes the use of cars with different kinds beatiful cars .
At this point , what if I claim that in twenty year there will be fewer cars ?
Are you suprised ?

Yes , I claim that the usage of car will be decreased !
There will be two reasons for this decrease .
First one will be the restrictions of governments due to state planing and avoiding pollution .
If you have a car , you may probably facing with the parking problem .
If there were less number of cars in use , that was not be a problem for us today .
Besides the parking problem , the time wasted in traffic jam will make governments to restrict to use of cars .
The third thing that will push the governments to restrict this usage will be the raise of air pollution due to cars .
What will be the solutions provided by them ?
There are two thing that can be done .
One of them is to allowing at most one car per citizen .
The other is allowing some cars in some days ; for example , allowing just the even numbered car plates in the even numbers of months .

Besides the restriction of the government , the health problems will make people use their cars less .
Today , the foods with huge amount of calories can be easily accessible and most of the job holders are white colored .
This means that most of the people have to do something to lose the weights comming from all the time sitting and consuming foods with much calories .
Of course , the best thing to do is doing sport .
But this time may not available to everyone .
So , it is better to use cars and walk at least for the near destinations .

In conclusion , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use due to two facts .
One of them will be the restrictions of governments due to state governing and planning , and the other reason will be the health problems of people .
These causes will force people to use their cars less .
