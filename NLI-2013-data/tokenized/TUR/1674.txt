Considering the academic period of the education there can be say alot of plots , ideas and many other impressions on specialize in one specific subject or is it better to have a variety of many academic subjects .
On answering that question , primarilly we have to deal with two major points in education which indicates us the position of our life and future outcomings .
The first is our life condition .
The latter one is about to the plans and feed backs .
If a person in academics wondered to make an extend to vary his knowledge , mostly he or she would have no any economical problems or any anxiety on his working conditions .
To explain that , they have already satisfied with their life style and they wonder to know much more knowledge .
Besides their motivation on learning varities have almost acts them to doing that relentlessly .
For me to become one pointed or one focused trainning programe makes person much aware of life and in worklife .
In work a life for instance , person must be well qualified on his or her matter .
While dealing with the trouble in work sector , person must be elite on his or her section for being a qualified one .
Thats why , focusuing on one section would be more essential and vital for the person in a specific range .
It is also crucial for me that a person must aware of his life standarts .
Chosing one section field may not help utterly to person .
Being aware of field and determined what to do are also other necessities .
A great deal of time have to be spended on one section field .
You have to asses your knowledge oftenly or you may fail in advancing information .
Holding both advantages and disadvantages focusing on one field is my indespensable selection .
