I do not agree with the statement that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today .
There are several reasons for thinking so .

Globally speaking , the transportation media is not changing for a long period of time .
We have cars , airplanes , bicycles , motorcycles , trains ( above an under ground ) , ships for providing different means of transport .
Cars are the vehicles that are commonly used for private transportation .
They provide people privacy during their journeys everywhere and privacy is something that man wants to have especially during transport .

Also there are other social criterias that force the usage of cars .
The first thing to mention is that it gives its owner a social state .
Owning a car means a higher standard against the ones that ca n't afford a car .
So it 's in fact a sign of wealth in most of the world .

The use of the cars is not directly related to the purpose , - transportation - there are many other factors .
One of the biggest factor is the car manufacturers .
Car manufacturing plays a big role in the macro-economy .
If the manufacturers are still making cars , then someone should be there to buy and use it .

But if the manufacturers can find a different way of gaining money , like manufacturing sci-fi vehicles that can be used instead of cars then the number of the cars that are going to be used in the future will be fewer that the amount we use today .

One other reason that we will not be able to help ourselves using cars is that there is still huge amount of resources around the world .
Most of the cars today are running with gas , and the earth still has n't run out of it yet .
Maybe in the future when the gas resources will dry and new kinds of energy will be used in different types of wehicles .

To summarize , there should be certain facts in order to predict that the usage of cars will fade out in twenty years .
But we do n't have those facts now .
