Learning takes times and in that time there are several things that students should be careful about them .
There are many ways to teach things to students .
actually there can be a debate about which learning way is more significant for students .
Understanding the ideas and concepts than to learn facts is more acceptable because of the fact that students shuold focus on gettings things in logical way in their brains , pay attention the solving problems and learning things in detail .

The first reason why the understanding ideas and concepts are more important is to focus on getting things in logical ways .
this is really important issue because while student try to learn facts they can ignore the main point which is estabilishing the logic set .
moreover students should be involved into the subject .
if they are get solved the main ideas and concept that can be more efficient for them .
they should not waste their time by learning facts .

The second reason is to pay attention problem solving .
student can solve the problems or troubles that they face by understanding the ideas and the concept .
If students focus on the facts than the main problem this is not a useful thing for them .
problems should have the priority which is the first to solve .

The third reason is to learn things in detail .
this conditions happens only by understanding concept .
if the student does not get the concept he \ she can not learn things in detail .
furthermore to range things in detail needs understanding the whole concept except learning facts .

In conclusion it is more significant for students to get known concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
all the things were considered the final decision must be that the students should focus on detail and concept to get things done .
