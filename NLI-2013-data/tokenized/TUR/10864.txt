Everybody wants to be successfull in life , nevertheless only some people achive this .
I 'm firmly agree with the statement that successfull people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
In the present essay I will endouver to figure out my reasons .

From my point of view , one of the major factor in reaching success is self-development .
But how can it be possible while always doing the same things .
You should try new things to reach better solutions .
Otherwise you can not develop what you are doing .

Moreover in our high compettative era it is more difficult to be successful .
Because everybody endeavor to do their best , you must do something different .
Being different always make you more easy to being recognised , nevertheless you must try something different , even something never tried before .
And this means risk .

When we consider the successful people lived in the history , we see a common point .
This is risk taking .
Although there are many people in history who has taken risk and than fail , I think we must be thankful for their effort because we have reached our modern era with the efforts of such kind of people .
For instance Madam Currie risked her life to find some radiactive materials .
But she made a huge progress in chemistry area .

In conclusion , I want to remark that doing what we already know how to do well , without taking risk in lfe , we can not make progress .
From my point of view success is worthwhile to take some risks in life .
