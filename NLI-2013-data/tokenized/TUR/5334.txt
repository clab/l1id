Advertising is one of the best methods of corporations for selling their product and making their profit higher .
Everyday people watch advertisements through the newspapers , magazies , radios and televisions .
However , with some techniques , advertisement makes a product to seem much better than they really are .

On televisions , while we are watching a car advertisement , this ` supersonic ' car can be driven perfectly at all areas from warmer climates to poles .
However , it is sure driving is not the work of car and it mostly depends on the driver .
Moreover , the car in the advertisement looks bright and very clean .
Sure it can be clean sometimes , however there is no possibility that a car can be clean at any time in any where .
In addition , it is not shining like a sun in realm .

One of the differing product is snacks .
In an advertisement , when someone opens the pack of a snack , it is perfectly full , the company puts as much as they can to make us happy .
But it is also not true , when I open a patatoe chips , I only see a funny quantity of chips and I have to buy more to be satisfied .

Most funny advertisements are about computers .
Because of the majority of puplic do not know much about computer based devices , such as microprocessors ; hard disks or monitors , the company shows the product like it is product that came from space age , that product can do whatever the user wants , never fails or never needs any technical knowledge to use .
However all computer users know in real world it is impossible , they have lots of problem while working with a computer .

In conlusion , advertisements really make people to think them better than they are and the consumer understands the fact about it until the product fails at some point .
