There is a saying in my language that goes like : ` If only the young could know and the old could do ' .
This explains an important lesson , but one has to attain a certain degree of wisdom to understand it .
In my opinion being young is more enjoyable , being older may make somebody more experienced but it would not make his life less boring .

While you 're young your mind is fresh , open for ideas and future is full of possibilties .
Excitement is more preferable than the regret which inevitably comes with the old age and even feeling of fullfillment ca n't beat the hapiness you feel when you 're upon a new discovery .
Just remember your greatest triumph .
Would you feel the same after ten years passed ?

Nobody can deny that having an energetic , heathy body is better than being frail , dependant on medicine or on someone .
You ca n't try parachute jumping if you 're past 60 .
Doctors would n't allow it .
Even the eating would n't be the same with lots of constraints .

It 's always easier to meet and get on well with new people as a young person .
People accept and trust each other easily .
It 's simple to find common ground when you 're young .
Older people tend to be more rigid in their views .
Traits and ideas begin to turn to stone .
After a certain age it becomes impossible to change them .

Let 's face it ; people do n't get wiser when they get old .
They only get old , both in mind and the body .
It 's becomes harder and harder to deal with them so unfortunatly some families even consider to send them away .
