The life is a relatively short period for some people .
However , if you succeed in achieving the benefits at any age , it will no longer be a problem .
Enjoying the life at older ages will bring you the feeling of a long life .
It also comes with the question of the difference between young people and the older ones about the enjoyment gathered from the life .

As far as I 'm concerned , older people enjoy life the way it has to be and it brings them many advantages against younger ones .
At earlier ages , people are not even aware of the time passing rapidly and have the lack of experince which will let them enjoy the life the way it is meant to be .
On the other side , being older gives you the comfort of knowing what to do and where to do .
Especially after retirement , you have nothing to worry about whereas younger people feels the pressure of the responsibilities against their families and also the dilemmas they usually come up with .
Moreover , older people do know how to spend their money to get the most of it .

In addition to what I 've said before , of course there are many disadvantages of being older which maybe seems to badly affect your life .
Nonetheless , if you have the right point of view , you can easily see that those are not even taken into consideration .
For instance , being less energetic is an important lack against the younger people .
However , if you use it efficiently and effectively , it wo n't be a problem to cope with anymore .
With that in mind , if you care for yourself enough , you can also stand against health problems longer than you think .

In conclusion , I completely disagree with the statement provided .
Older people really know how to enjoy the life .
