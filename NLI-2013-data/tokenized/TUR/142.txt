I strongly agree the idea that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
TV , newspaper , internet , color and famous artist can be very tool for ads .

First of all , TV and newspaper are very crucial tool for advertisements .
For example we might watch TV at least one hour per day .
This means that there is a possibility to see the ads on TV .
They are just showing the products , we dont know anything about the quality of these things .
They can hide everything on TV .

Secondly , internet is a very powerful for every kind of advertisements .
For instance , I was looking for an apartments to live in USA when I was in Turkey .
Every apartments looked to me great from their web page .
When I came here , I checked the apartments that I saw ads from the internet .
Everything looks different .
There was a noise on the floor while you are walking .
We can see just a picture from the internet .
We cannot realize every properties of apartments from the advertisements .

Finally , advertisements are necessary for companies to sell their products .
They would like to use different color and different famous person .
Every people might have a favorite color , so they can be attracted by products .
For example green color may attract muslim people , red might attract communist people .
They would not know about the quality of products .

Advertisements just gives us some idea about the physical appearance of products .
We would not like to see every details of products from their pictures .
