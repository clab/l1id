Nowadays group traveling is more popular .
Everbody try to travel somewhere by a group such as somewhat europe tours or Africa trips .
Although some people think that the best way to trip is an alone without tour guide , I do strongly support the idea of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because of two reasons , first one is tour guides are know where we have to go and secondly if you have never been to there you need a leader who helps to you how to visit and how to spend their time enjoyable there .

First of all , If somebody wants to travel somewhere certainly she/he must get tour or tour guide because if you have no idea where are you and you need some help from someone this person shoul be your tour guide moreover if you spend a lot money for this travel it is so normal to wants to see important places .
Nowadays tour guides have well educated persons about how to assist the other persons in addition to that they have an idea and knowledge about that area , for that reasons if somebody wants to travel somewhere such as France or Spain and also if you have no idea about that countires you have to travel is in a group led by a tour guide

In addition to that , if you wants to travel in Spain firts of all you must get a lot of information about Spain if you could get when you go to there you need a leader who helps to you to go somewhere or important places and also how to spend your time enjoyable because you dont know how to go there and you have knoe idea such as weher is the most popular disco 's there , if you are not use a tour guide maybe you can waste your time in one places if you pay a lot of money for this trip you wants to see a lot of places .
To illustrate nowadays most of businessmen are using this way so they are using tour guides while your are going to abroad when they are finish their meeting going somewhere to see important places by the way , because thet havent got any times to visit somewhere for that reason busunessmen are travelling by tour guides

In conclusion , everybody travelling somewhere I suggest that if you wants to travel somewhere that is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , I strongly support the this idea rather than the travelling alone without a tour guide .
