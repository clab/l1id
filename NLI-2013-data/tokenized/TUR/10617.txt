Being a successful person is an undefined problem .
In order to answer this problem we should clearly define what we mean by being a successful person .
If being succesful is defined as learning and experiencing new things one might be right by saying this sentence .
But in my opinion being successful is doing what you already know perfectly .
Success is the measure of how well you have done a job or a work .
It is clear that by learning so much new thing and having new experiences does not allow you to do your job or work perfectly .
A person 's target should be doing the job or work which he/she specialised in .
So , trying new things , ideas or taking risks wo n't allow you to focus on your target .

It is obvious that learning new things , cooperating with the new developments and having some informations about the topics which you have n't known how to do well is not bad at all .
It has important advantages for people .
For instance , think about an engineer .
He designed a really functional device for listening music .
But he has to sell this product in order to earn money from his design .
And in order to make money he has to know how to negotiate with people .
It is not a right behaviour to say that negotiation is an business man 's job , I do n't have to negotiate with people .

Instead of being a man who know nothing about everytthign I choose to know everything about
