Some people belive that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
Others belive the best way to travel is on your own .
Both opinions have its adventages and disadventages actually .
I agree with the second opinion .
To me , traveling on your own is much better .

First of all , when you travel on your own , you are free to go wherever you like .
You can design your own tour according to your likings and interests .
You can manage your time better .
That will give you the opportunity to spend more time on the places you like better .
Another benefit to traveling on your own is that you can manage your spendings according to your budget .

In a group , the places you will visit are determined by the tour guide , and unfortunately , you cannot change it .
Traveling in a group led by a tour guide costs a certain amount of money , which probably would cost you less if you plan it yourself .
You should follow the tour guide and go the restaurants the guide determines as opposed to getting your own food .

For example , my husband and I planned an `` interrail '' trip in Europe couple years ago .
It was all on our own .
We planned in advance where , when , how , for how long we would go .
It was more fun to explore the places on our own since we hand the chance to interact with local people in their regular daily life .
We made friends too .

As a result , I strongly support the idea of travaling on your own .
You have more freedom , you interact with people and you make friends .
