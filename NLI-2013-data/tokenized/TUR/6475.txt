Nowadays it is often mentioned that we are using up our natural resources and that there will be very few resources of fuel in a few decades .
As the usable amount fuel will be getting less the the cost will get higher .
Even today for a few years gas and fuel prices have gone very high .
As a result of these it is claimed by some of the researchers that there will be fewer cars in twenty years time .
Though I do not agree with this idea , I even think that there will be more cars in twenty years .
There are two reasons that i strongly claim .

First reason of the fact that there will not be fewer cars in use in twenty years is the alternative energy sources .
As engineers we predict that alternative energy sources will be in use in ten years time like sun and hydrogen energy .
There are really important researches on the use of these energies for cars .
Even in Turkey there are more than 40 cars using sun energy built so far .
Moreover cars using hydrogen energy has already been built but still being worked on .
When we come over this energy problem , in other words make the last car products working with alternative energy there will certainly be an increse in the number cars in use .

The second reason is that in twenty years there will still be plenty of petrol that can be used ( may be more expensive ) .
And if we consider the populaion growth and the increase of wealth we can conclude that in twenty years there will more people using cars , even one family will have four or five cars !

As a result the claim that there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years is completely wrong from the point of view that I have here .
As an engineer I can say that cars in use will increase day by day
