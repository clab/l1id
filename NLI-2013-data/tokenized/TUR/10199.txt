I totally agree with the statement .
Successful people try new things , take risks .
because this is the only thing how they can keep their success going on .
I do n't have big ego , but my friends and people around me say that I have been a successfull person so far .
This is really nice to hear , but what really make people think I am successful .
For example , I am an exchange student .
I actually live in Turkey .
I crossed Atlantic Ocean and I came to the USA without my family or without my friends or without the places I used to see .
This is really big risk .
Since you do n't really know what you might see and what might happen to you .
New country means a new world and also a new enviroment .
I know the life in Turkey , but I felt that I had to see new lifes styles on the earth .

Let 's talk about an old leader of a country : George Washington .
I do n't know G. Washington very well , however I can say that he was pratically the founder of USA , he might have wanted to stay under the rules of Britian , or be an empreror .
But he took risk and he did what he believed in ( Democracy ) .
His ambitious was an independent America and he did it .

How did we improve our technology ?
God did n't give us everyting .
We had to something .
Humanity had to explore and invent new things for a better life .
If Edison liked candle light and he was not curious about new things , would have we had light bulbs ?
No , I do n't believe so .
Even tough we had , I am sure It would be later .
He tried a new thing and actually he took risk against people who were disagree with him .
He did not want to do what he already knew how to do well .
And now , we can say that he was one of the most successful scientist ever in the world .

How do you think that electricity was explored .
Thanks for Franklin , his curiousity provided better life for us .
I would not be able to write this essay on internet unless he tried new things .
That was one of the thing which made him successful and unforgottable .

To try new things could make you popular in your friend group .
Since every new and interesting thing you do will provide you good points .
You might be seen as the crazy boy/girl .
In fact , that makes you interesting person rather than successful person .

For those reasons , if you want to be successful person , you should start to try new things and take risks .
Because what you already know is not enough .
