The purpose of advertisements is to convince people to buy a specific product .
The business world especially marketers thinks that it does not really necessary to tell the truth , if you could sell something .

First of all , advertisements are one of the most important tools of marketing .
Their first and for most purpose is to attract people and persuade them to buy .
The goal of advertisements is not to tell the truth .
They can tell to truth but it does not mean that it is not just a way of marketing .
It is still tring to convince people to prefer particular thing to others .

People usually buy things which they saw on advertisements , and usually they get disappointed with the result .
Even though people think that they are buying the same thing , the reality is that the product is always exegirated in advertisements and it will be worse than people thought .
The basic example for this will be hamburgers .
When I go to a fast food restaurant , I saw lots of pictures of hamburgers , and they look really big .
When I buy one , I always find it to small to saticify , because the pictures convince me that they will be really big .

However , one of the easiest way of getting information about a product is advertisements .
Before buying something people want to learn more about it .
They do not want to buy which they really do not need .
People see advertisements in everywhere so they do not have to spend too much effort to obtain an information .

Altough advertisements are the easiest way to learn something about a product to make a desicion , people should reconsider every detail that they heared from or saw on an advertisement if it can be true or not .
They should be aware of the reality that the ads are for convincing people , not for telling the truth .
