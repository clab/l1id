First of all , i want to express that life is taking risks .
People born with risk , they improve or change their and other 's lives with risk .
Think that you are in an unknown forest that you do n't know anything about .
You can stay and wait someone to come and escape you or you can start to move without knowing where you are going .

Maybe the first way is the secured one but also it is the closed one , it is closed to movement , finding , improvement or disappointment .
Some of you can think that it is not logical to choose the way that goes to disappointment but i do n't think so because every acknowledge is reached by suffering and disappointments .
Consider Van Gogh , Edison , Tresca and the others ...
How did they paint the incredible pictures or how did they create the complex physical formulas ?
How did the people go to the moon ?
They all took risks to improve ...
Even we have born on this theory because falling in love is also a risk .
If our mothers and fathers have not taken that risk , we would not be on the Earth today ...

Let 's think on an other hand ...
While we are searching for something , in fact we learn very different things from we are trying to reach , different problems and views force us to think in different ways so we think more and more ...
We find ourselves in a different field and we produce more problems and solutions .
It means we change and improve ,,,, Yes , but what is the success ?
Is it to gain too much money or have everything ?
Absolutely no .
It is to change , not to step on the same land ...

We have borned to this beautiful World , we should try to change our World better and better .
For us , for others and for our children , we should courage to take risks ...
For all the beautiful and peaceful things ...
