THE FUTURE OF CARS

The 1900s century has an important role on the future of the world .
In last hundred years we saw a big change or we can say development especially in the technology that one of its child is car .
World is changing every second we must keep our speed as fast as world speed .

Today , the car is necessary for us to go somewhere in our daily life .
It is a part of us so that we cannot do anything like oxygen we can not breath .
Instead of this , so much development is occuring and as result of this the needs are increasing .
When we wnat to go shopping we use car or want to go office we need it .
We make our life as comfortable as we do .
But people have some problems resulting of this comfort life .
For example we have a big traffic problem .
Sometimes it is being ridiculus that we can not solve this tragedy .
We are making ourselves stressful .

In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today I hope so .
Because we use the way to go anywhere .
In order to go anywhere we can fly also .
That is the point that people wake up and instead of using cars they will use aircrafts .
It wo n't be a suprise because , today , the scientists are developing the flying cars , no traffic problem and no stress .

Additionally , the capacity of the machine that we use today is limited because of the strict roads and low level technology .
But in the future we do not have a problem like this .
No road no structural problems .

Finally , we have to live in our world so that we must search the ways that how to live in a beatiful world and to do everything we can do for our and our childrens future .
We have to keep in our minds that `` no pain no gain '' . today we have a lot of pain like a pregnant mother .
