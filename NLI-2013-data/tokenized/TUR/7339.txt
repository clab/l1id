I do not agree that the best way to tarvel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I can agree that it can be good but in my opinion it is not the best way

I would like to give an example from my own life in order to illustrate why i do not agree .
Before I came to New York , I was in Madrid in order to get masters degree in law .
When i was in Madrid , I did not have so many oppotunity to work as a student .
For this reason , I used to work as a translator or an assistance for a tour guide .
Many times I attended many tours with tour guides to help them .
Last year at this time , one big group which consists of more than 35 people came from Turkey and the travel aggent wanted me to help the tour guide and I helped .
I was together with this group for almost 8 full days .
As far as I could understand from their behaviors and opinions , all of them were much more different than each other .
I would like to give an example from one of our activities such as visiting the museum of Prado which is one of the most famous musuems all over the world .
While some of them wanted to visit there , a few of them did not .
Like this example , there were so many conflicts among people who came for this travel , in addition because the tour guide got angry with them , he was travellling by himself and he did not want to help anyone during the tour .
Because of him , I had to help them as i was a tour guide even though i was there just to help this guy .
As long as i was in Madrid , I faced so many events like this while i was working as an assitance of a tour guide .
If there are so many people such as more than 10 people in the group , as far as i know and have an experience , to satisfy all people is getting difficult .
In my opinion , when all people who attend these kinds of travels know each other , we can consider that one of the best ways to travel in a group but If they do not know each other , I can not say the same thing .

For all these reasons , it can be summuarized the trip or travel can be best way when you travel in a group , If you know with whom you are going to travel .
