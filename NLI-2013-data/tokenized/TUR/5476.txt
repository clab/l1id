I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
First of all , the techniques used in advertisements such as color , use of cameras , background and a cheerful music create a more appealing atmosphere that induces people to buy that product .
The advertising companies are very talented to make products look bigger or smaller with clever positioning of the cameras , depending on which of these two are merited .
Many products are purposefully portrayed differently to the consumers by advertisement tricks .
Many food items are dyed with a special food coloring that make them look incredibly delicious so much so that even the best cook in the world cannot give them such a look .

They even create a fairy tale around a product to make people believe in the qualities of the it .
For instance , many products from cars to perfumes are presented with an appealing feminine figure as if the beauty of the model does indeed convey the beauty of the product .
So women may buy a perfume not because it smells terrific but because it is used by a famous celebrity .
The image or the fairy tale created around the product conceals the real quality of it and makes it irresistible .
The use of famous people can even be very much disappointing for the real consumer because people usually ignore questioning the necessity of buying a product when they see a famous and loved figure using it .
This phenomenon which could be called the `` the celebrity effect '' is very much responsible for disappointed consumers in the long run .

Another factor that hides the real quality of products is the advertisement promotion .
People start to use or consume products for their temporary benefits such as reduced fee for mobile phones for a limited campaign period but after that `` path dependence '' is created among the consumers and people are used to using that product , all of the temporary benefits are removed .

To conclude , advertisers are doing everything to create an image that does not quite exist , or exists only partially .
I think the consumers should go and see the products in real life to make the ultimate decision .
