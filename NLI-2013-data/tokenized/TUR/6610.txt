some people thinks that cars are not very nesesary for our daily life but some people also thinks that cars have very important roles in our live .
I think in twenty years there will be lots of car in use than there are today .
In this essay I will give some reasons and good examples why i think like that .

the first reason is that most of people would like to have a car .
because cars are the most comfortable and most exited preference for the people to go somewhere quickly .
In fact this reason is really a considerable one that why people can not change their opinion .
for example I have a car and when I want to go somewhere my first option is taking my car .
instead of taking busses or walking .
and i really sure most of drivers think just like me. because it is the most comfortable one , even though it is not the cheapest one .

the second reason is that people do not consider the traffic problem and this problem should be solved by goverment .
they think that goverment should make big wide roads and design perfect traffic regulations .
people just use their cars and do n't think the one of the reason of the traffic jam is their cars .
And also goverment can not take radical decisions about traffic because everyone has a right to use his or her own car everywhere he or she wants .
because of this there are not fewer cars in use or we can say that there are lots of cars in use now and it will be same in the future

in conclusion because of most people would like to have a car and do not think to help about the solition of traffic jam there wont be fewer car
