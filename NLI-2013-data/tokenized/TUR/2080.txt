I agree with the idea of that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
When we look around us , we can easily see that young people are walking around the city , going to the theatres .
doing something else , while older people staying at their houses .
Young people enjoy life more than older people because they have the energy that the young ages give to them and also as a result of some religious things .

Firstly , young people naturally have the energy to be able to more active than the olders .
If you are young , you do not have any important health problems , you can walk , run as long as you want .
Young people have an energy inside them which does not let them to be stable .
In my country , Turkey , we describe this situation as ` not being ablo to fit her \ his cup` .
As a benefit of this energy , they enjoy life more than older people can do .

Moreover I greatly believe that , especially in my country , this situation , that young people enjoy life more than older people do , is a result of some religious circumstances .
Older people think that they are close to death and they feel the end of their life .
So they consume their time especially for praying and doing something for the life after death .
Older people think that using their rest of days for entertainment is very disadvantegeous for them .
However , young people does not afraid from death , because they are not close to death as older people .
So they walk around , go to discos , theatres and they gain the taste of life .

To sum up , it is very clear that young people tend to enjoy the life .
As a result of the energy that they have and not to feel themselves to close to the death , younger people live their life more entartainmently than the old people do .
