The pace of the development in science and technology is hard to compare with any of the previous periods .
We witness a post-industrial revolution , or in other words we are transforming into a knowledge-society .
With this great transformation , academic world is also reshaping its way of doing research .
The number of the research areas are increasing and interactions among disciplines become more frequent .
In this context , a broad knowledge of many academic subjects will contribute much more to our scientific knowledge than to specialize in one specific subject .

Specialization in one specific area is sometimes good for instance , in discovering a new medicine .
But , there may be waiting a number of opportunities with a broad knowledge of academic subject .
Therefore , in scientific research there is an incresing tendency to make inter-disciplinery studies .
For example , economics and physics are rather different two subjects .
But , scientists from these fields are arranging joint-congresses in order to find solutions to the problems of theis fields .
Biologist and sociologists are collaborating to understand the nature of the behaviors of animals living together like ants .

This kind of inter-disciplinery approach can open new doors for some critical inventions .
Using nano-technology for some vital heart problems saves a lot of peoples life or at least increase the quality of their life .

Finally , in a very rapidly developing enviroment of sciences , inter-disciplinery studuies will bring a lot of suprises to our lives .
So , it is better to have a broad knowledge of academic subjects and education systems much revised with this approach .
