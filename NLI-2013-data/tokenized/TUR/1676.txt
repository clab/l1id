Due to the current level where science has reached by means of content and achievement , it is obvious that you need to specialize in one particular area rather than dealing with different fields .
In otherwords science has all its resources from the academic studies and subjects and moving them to a next level by means of continuing this progress for the commonwealth , we need to focus on one specific subject while being aware of the influences of the other related fields as well .

When we consider the politics as an academical subject , we cannot separate it from sociology or related social sciences .
Therefore we should be aware of the sociology in order to study politics as a science or an academic subject , however in order to be succesful in the related academic subject , this line has to be drawn very carefully by means of knowing where to stop .
If we take a look at the people who are specialized in their academic subject , it is very common to see the examples of above model since all subjects in certain limits are effecting each other , sometimes supplementing , sometimes resulting in contradiction .

On the otherhand the definition of any academical title requires very deep knowledge which should make our way into having a broad knowledge of one specific academic subject which we are specialized rather than dealing with different subjects .
The professors in universities realizing academical studies is a good example to be considered at this point .
But as discussed above we should not ignore the above model in terms of having at least a basic information about how the other subjects effect our study .

History is also another factor to be considered in terms of comparing the examples .
Many sciencists had worked on particular academical subjects in order to progress themselves and accomplish their responsibility against the humanity by inventing different devices , offfering different thesis which are still lightning their followers .
Such as Edison , Einstein and many others are good examples of this heritage .

Consequently the academical subjects has to be handled one by one or specifically in order to be more innovative and useful for the humanity .
In my opinion , past is the best mirror supportting this approach .
