The lives of youngsters have changed a lot throughout the years .
Some people agree that young people do not give enough time to help their communities nowadays .
In my opinion , young people do not help their communuties as much as they use to , because they think that they have better things to do like the use of technology and studying .

Technology has driften apart children from their communities .
The smallest community is a family and some young people do not even help their family anymore .
For example ; their is a huge difference between my mother and I. She always tells me stories about how she use to help her mother with the house work and chores since she had nothing else better to do .
I do not get involved in these kinds of events that much aroung the house because of the technology that surrounds me .
I am so busy watching tv , or playing video games , or talking on the phone that I do not realize some of the things that goes on around the house .
Technology is one of the reasons children today do not help their community that much anymore .

Studying has been an important fact on why kids can not help their communities as much as they use to as well .
The amount of work and the subjects taught in school have changed so much lately that kids sometimes have to study all day long .
For example ; my school gives out a lot of homework for one night and it takes me quite a number hours to finish it , and by the time I am done it is time to go to bed , but my mother tells me that in her time they didi not have that many homework so when they finished they had the time to help around in the house or in their neighborhood .
Kids do not understand that sometimes helping people or helping a community is the best thing you can do in your life .

As a result , young people have to move away from the technology that has been drifting them apart from their community , and they have to be taught to study with a program so it will not take that much .
Helping people is much more important than watching tv or studying .
