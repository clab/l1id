Time for vacation with friends ?
And losing again in the middle of the night when trying to find the hotel ?
Do not think so , because the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide has all the benefits that you can expect from a wonderful trip .

Firstly , no worries to find out the hotels and places to visit when you have your tour guide .
Leaving the guiding job to an expert leaves you plenty of time to enjoy your vacation .
More time to chat with your friends and enjoy the views are only a few options that you can spend your time instead of looking up to maps to see where you are .
A planned trip with a tour guide gives you the perfect vacation which includes places you wanted to visit , views you wanted to see , and times that you spent with your friends .

Secondly , all the expenses that you paid for a tour guide pays back to you more than you expected , because at the end of the vacation you would be relaxed , and enjoyed the vacation .
For example , your tour guide would have booked your rooms before you called the hotel , got the information for local events , even made reservations for the dinner already .
Would it not be awesome ?
No stress , just relaxiation when you have your tour guide .

Finally , whenever you need an emergency help , your tour guide would be the first one who knows about the pharmacy and hospital that you would ask for help .
Knowing that everyone is safe in a big group makes less stress in your vacation .
Also , having a tour guide takes away the pressure of wondering about everyone 's vacation in your group .

To sum up , I agree the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
