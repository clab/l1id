The human kind always need enjoying to reach good life standarts therefore enjoying is one of the most important aspects of human life .
Everyone has different point of views about the idea of enjoying .
Some believes that young people enjoy life more than older person do and I totally agree with the idea .
These are my following ideas .

First of all , youngers have more oppurtunity to enjoy more than olders .
A lot of sports and enjoying activities are generally made for young persons because of the fact that they are motre healthier and powerful to enjoy the activities .
For example , out door activities are very enjoable and realy provide youngers to have good times .
However these need a strong body and heart to feel the enjoying point of adrenalin .

In addition to this , youngers have less problems to enjoy more than olders .
generally young persons have less responsibility about life .
Moreover they have less health problems to survive .
All of these enable them to enjoy more and have good times .
For instance , my grandfather has some money and health problems .
Hence all of these prevent him to enjoy more than an independent child .

The last but not least , youngers have more time to meet the world and taste new things of it .
For example forty years ago there is not the sport of paragliding and the people of the past couldnot find time to taste the enjoyablity of the sport .
However , paragliding is my favorite sport and i can realy enjoy and have good times with my friends in pragliding trips .

All in all , as i said before young people enjoy life more than older persons .
Enjoying is related with both more oppourtunity and less problems as well as more time to taste new things .
The long and the short of it is that , yong persons should try to find the way of enjoying until they become older .
