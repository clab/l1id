Being succesful person is the dream of nearly everyone .
Since we have started going to school , our family and our teachers advise us to be successful people and they show us many different tecniques for being successful .
I believe that being succesful can not be done with the tecniques that people show us .
I agree wit the idea that `` successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' .
Just as stared above , for me being succesful means being innovative person .

I believe repeating something that has already done does not make people successful .
But of course for being a successful person should know what people have done before .
For example a sociologist already know what other theorists have said .
So it is so easy for a sociologist to repeat what other teorist have said in his article .
But I think this is not a success .
Successful people should bring new ideas and even sometimes should take risks and challenge the existing ideas .
Without challenging existing ideas or bringing new perspectives a sociologist can not be a successful person .

When we look at the history we see many names who originatd new ideas .
But nobody knows the other names , only their names are known .
It is obvious that , trying new ideas always take some risks but do you think , we would be familiar with the Einstein if he did not take that risk ?
Of course no , Einstein was perceived as a crazy man when he originated his famous theory but the time showed that he was right and time proved that he was a genious .
Of course he faced with many difficulties because of trying new ideas and if he only applied the things that he already knew , nobody would remember his name today .

It is obvious that making the things that you know very well is the easiest way .
you can be happy by doing that , you can also be rich and famous for a short time however , this does not make you successful .
The key of being successful is producing new ideas .
