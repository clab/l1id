With the invention of information and communication technologies , the people have witnessed great transformations regarding all aspects of our lives .
They bring many things to our lives via televison , radio or computers .

Advertisement has been always an important notion of that new era in the last decades .
Because , industrialization supported with technology will bring also many and more diverse products to our lives .
So , advertisement can be accepted as the best way to meet the products to people .
You can reach to people by using the screens , radios or even internet .
It is a great way to tell everything to people .
But , if you use it wrongly , it may cause also great problems for them .

What is the aim of an advertisement is an important question to answer .
It is very simple to say that if I like something on TV advertisement , for example a health soap , i will definitely give the decision to buy it .

But , the advertisement do not tell the everything about the product ?
Normally , people believe in the words of the advertisement .
After that , they decide to but the product .
But , if the owner of the product decides to give less or wrong information about it , in order to make the people to buy more , this may cause unfortunate events .
I may have possible allergies to some ingredients of the soap that i did not get from the advertisement .

I do not want believe in that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
Even , I 'm not aggree with the statement .
Although , there will be always bad examples , I know that people will say always the truth to others .
