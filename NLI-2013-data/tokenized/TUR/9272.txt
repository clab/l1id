Many people will have different ways to responding to this question .
but most would say yes it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
understand ideas and concepts opens more doors in life , once studenc understand concepts and ideas facts will come to them and , students will know what they are talking out later on .

First of all , understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors in life because if the student understands the main idea of something the concept will natrally come to them .
for example , in bussinuse if the students boss syas to them go do this this and this the student will imitaaly understand the idea and once he has understood the idea he will naturally understand the cocept in order to do something .

Second , once the student understans the idea and concept behind something the facts will automatically come to him .
for instance , once the student understand an idea he understans a concept so then when he understands the concept he can understand facts because because all facts have and idea and concept behind them .
moreover , it would be hard fo the student jsut to understand the fact and not the concept and idea because everything in life has concepts and ideas even facts .

Finally , the student will know what he/she is talking aout later on .
say for example a student is trying to impres someone and she only knows facts she will say all the facts but will not undersatnd what she is saying or even whats going on .
however , beforhand if this student were to know here concpets and ideas she could easiy know what she/he is talking about later on when she gives a speach or wants to impres someboady .

In conculsion , ustudents will know what they are taliking about , once the students know concepst and ideas facts will jsut come to them and , understanding ideas and concepts opens more doors to them later on in life .
So all in all understanding concepts and ideas has many mor advantages that just know facts .
