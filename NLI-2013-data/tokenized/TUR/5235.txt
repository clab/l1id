I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The logic of advertising is basically to sell more products and to make more money as a consequence of the the advertisement .

Advertisement is a way for the companies to show their products to a large number of consumers .
They are the must of a modern life .
In a modern life the demands of the people increase as the world changes .
The demand can be of new tools , machines , cars , houses and any other things that you can imagine .
As the people need more of these the producers and companies make new tools and machines and ideas to attract people 's attention .
In a growig world you do n't have the opportunity to reach every people unless you do not advertise your product or idea .
To appeal more and more people an advertisement must show all the good sides of the thing and should not mention about the bad sides of it .

I am sure that you are familiar with the situations such that people coming into a problem with anything he or she can buy by just believing in the advertisement .
Cellular phones are a good example , I had friends who chosed their cellular phones according to the great advertsement done about that item , but most of them were not happy with the product they bought .

As I mentioned before , the logic of the advertisement is selling more and making more money as a consequence .
As long as the reason is making more money , the companies will not interested in the consumer 's approval for the short term .
They will try to sell more and to do this they will need advertisements that are lacking the disadvantages or bad features of their products .
And in this advertisements , again for the same reason they will exagerate the even the basic features of that product .
