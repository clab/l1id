Young people enjoy life more than older people .
There are two reasons for my choice .
Firstly , young people are more healthy than older people .
Secondly , young people want to learn many different things especially enjoyable things .

Young people are more healthy than older people .
Health is important for doing enjoyable things .
If you are not healthy you can not work , go to school , watch TV .
Shortly you can do nothing that you have to and of course you can not enjoy .
When you go to a pub , you dance and sometimes you drink .
When you dance you really get tired .
Dance needs energy and energy is in the youth .
Also most of the old people have to use drugs and that ' s why they can not drink alchol .
Another reason , the old people have to sleep long hours to feel well but the young people do not .

Young people want to have experiments about everything enjoyable .
Old people lived many thing and they do not want to learn something new .
They do just that they have to such as sleeping , working , eating .
The old people want to relax .
Young people climb mountains to experince the feeling of affair because the feeling of affair is new for them .
But an old man does not choose to climb a mountain .
He can choose to sit in front of a sea and drink coffee .

Young people are healthy and willing to learn new things .
That ' s why they enjoy life more than older people .
One day the young peple will be old ones and so they should enjoy now and relax in the future .
