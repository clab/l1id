Can somebody know everthing in the world ?
Of course no .
So why do we try know everthing .
If you think i have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
it means you do not know anything .
Because one person can not know everhting , you just know something about everthing and it does not work in the academic world .
But if you specialize in one specific subject , it means you can know a lot of thing on this subject .
Therefore it is better to have specialize just one subject .

I will give an example from the real world .
Why companies have a lot of section and their own manager ?
Because they are specialist in their section .
The owner of the company has a opinion for everthing but he can not know everthing so he has to ask somebody , who is specialist on this situation , what he should do .
We can use this information for academic world .
If you work on a lot of subjects , you can not spent enough time for every subject .
You can not know everthing for every subject so nobody will ask you some help for their work because you do not have enough knowledge for them .
They need specific answer .

For example you are studying material science and engineering .
You can not know everthing about every materials .
You can just know all materilas behaviour and some other basic things .
So nobody ask you something about it because they can find this knowledge everywhere .
But if you are specialist on the cast iron , it means you know everthing about cast iron .
Therefore if somebody needs some help about cast iron they will ask you .

As you can see , you can not know everthing for many academic subject .
it is better to know everthing about onething .
We should spent our time for specific subject .
