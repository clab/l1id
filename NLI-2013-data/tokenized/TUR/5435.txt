Advertisements occupy a big part in our lives as the every communication tool that we use ; such as televisions , internet and newspapers gives advertisements of many products .
Even if we do not want to admit that advertisements cannot direct our shopping preferences , most of us are affected from the advertisements we see .

First of all , the advertisements affect our shopping preferences in a way that we prefer to buy a product that we have heard before .
Most of us do not want to pay to a product that we have never heard of because we do not want to take a risk .
Advertisements make a product known by the community and knowing a product causes us to trust that product .
As a result , we prefer to buy a product that we trust .

Secondly , we think unintentionally that the products investing high amounts of money to advertisement are really qualified than the products that do not make any advertisement .
For instance , The Coca Cola Company really spends a huge amount of money to make advertisements all over the world and its products really make good profits throughout the whole world because we all assume that cola produced by the Coca Cola Company is better that any other cola that is producerd in our hometown .

Lastly , advertisements can present an innovative product .
We may not realize that we need such a product until we see its advertisement .
For example , cell phones are used by many people all around the world and every day we learn a new feature that is added to cell phones by means of advertisement .
We realize that a cell phone that can play songs is necessary for us only after we see its advertisement .
In fact , we do not need a cell phone that can play songs , but advertisements cause us to think so .

In conclusion , advertisements make a product seem better in a variety of ways and cause us to buy that product .
