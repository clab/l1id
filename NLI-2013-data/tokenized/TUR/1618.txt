If this question has been asked approximately 30 years ago , probably the answer would be specialisation .
Nevertheless the world system has being sharply changing after the technological enhancements ; so , the kind of having information .
Now , I believe that , having a wider academic information is more valuable that just concentrating on one , because of globalisation , optimisation .

The first reason I believe in this manner is , the wide spreading concept of being a '' global '' person .
After the enhancements of the communications technologies all over the world , owning information had become so important .
That is why every individual company tried to have as much knowledge as it can .
As a result of this everyone has begun to have at least some information about every issue .
If you are so stubborn not to join this trend you may not be a social individual in todays life .
Thus , instead of specialising for a subject , having a framework for several kinds subjects is a more valid in todays world .

Apart from this social point of view , broad knowledge of information is extremely significant for optimisation of ongoing jobs .
Since all of the tasks takin place in our world has several varialbles in it ; altering the way the work goes on .
For a better optimisation - even for approximation - you have to have knowledge from variety of branches .
The paragon is industrial enginners .
This enginner type is not concentrating on a specific kind of engineerin , even those people get courses from managemant and economics as their core studies .
As a consequence of this , they have the opportunity of having a wider perspective for optimisation on going works .

Besides , having broad knowledge of several academic subjects may yield to unexpected outcomes such as deficiency of required knowledge or overexagiration of the known infomation .
This insufficient information , may lead to false results for a work .
For instance , if you really want to work for an enhancement of product , or a new innovation , you may come to a mistaken product , which in return may mean , waste of money and a lot of time .
Overexagiration of knowledge unconciously may also lead to same conclusion .

To sum up as I consider all of these three results , I come to a conclusion that haing a wider academic information accumulation is better compared to specialisation on a topic .
However , people should be aware of the danger of overexagiration and deficiency of knowledge .
