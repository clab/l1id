in my opinion , succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Because of their character , they are succesful .
for example , the architects build buildings .
Aldo rossi is one of the succesful architects .
He has a lot of drawnings , industrials design , buildings .
in his school years , his teachers didnt like their drawnings and buildings .
they made him to draw the way they wanted .
If he didnt do the teachers wanting , he didnt graduate from the university .
so he give up studying in university .
Then in his work , his boss wanted him to draw the way his boss wanted .
He didnt give up drawning .
He has alotof drwanings altenatives about one building .
in addition to this one drawning about his design is not enough for him .
So you can alotof drawnings about one of the buildings .
Also he searchs while designing .
He always tries alot of alternatives about his design .
so he takes risks .
for example : His building or his design arent sold or liked by the people .
In addition to this other architects disagree with him about the buildings or his design .
But to explore new things ( pozitively or negatively ) makes him more successful .
By the way this make he is different from the other architects .
By trying new things and taking risks help him while other designing .
He can easily improve himself and her career .
so her designs and products are not similar .
In architecture the variety is very important .
So aldo rossi is very successful architect .
On the other hand , if he only doing what he already knows how to do well , he repeat himself and his career .
So aldo rossi isnt known as a succesful archtect in the world .

In conclusion , trying new things and taking risks is very important in our career .
If we want to be successful , we always do the best that we can .
