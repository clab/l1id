Most of the old people says that being young is a very good thing .
However I think that they say this because of their poor memory .
In general they do not remember how they struggle with the life when they were young .
In this essay , stating three main reasons , I will show you why being old is much more better .

Fistly , life has no risks at all , if you are old .
Old people have already chosen the important ways that they have to choose throughout their life .
So , there is no need to wonder about the future , which is realy a boring thing .
The fact that they benefit from this no risky life can be observed from their attitude of indifference to the daily situations that a young family member has come across .

Beside their non-risky life they also have a confident life with real friends .
Different from the young people the friends of the old people are old friend , so they are , in fact , best friends .
An old person has already examined the friendship of different types of people and already founded good friendships .
However a young person should try and loose through the early yerads of his/her life .

Moreover they have got broad knowledge of people , life , world , whatsoever .
This great knowledge brought about by their huge amount of experiences , education , and intellectual practice , such as reading many books , helps them to understand the world around them much easier than a young person can .
In general , a boy or a girl has a confused mind , confused by the conflicting data that s/he obtains from the life .

In conclusion , the absence of risks , the presence of good friends and broad knowledge makes the old people 's life easier than the young one 's , as stated in this saying ` A young person suppose that the life is nothing but an old person knows '
