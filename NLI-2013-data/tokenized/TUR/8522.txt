I do not agree with the idea that it is more important for the students to understad ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
I mean understanding the ideas and concepts will help the students in some ways but this will not be enough for them to learn the things elaborately and accurately .
Learning the facts in an operational way is much more better for the students than only repeating some concepts in the textbook or memorizig them .
I think all the classes should should include an application part of the lessons which is given in it .
Imagine that you are in a biology class and learning the anomal behaviours .
Will it be satisfied for you to read the passages in the text book ?
Of course not .
It will be better to see real life patterns on animal behaviours to learn the concept adequatly and accurately .
So in such cases students might visit a zoo or a national park by the control of the teacher in order to see the real life facts in a natural way .
Another good example could be a computer science class .
We all know that computer programming is an operational thing and the best way of learning it is to use the computers in the computer labs .
You may use the textbooks again to understand the concepts but that will not be enough to imagine the proggramming in an excellent way .
You should use it and learn it by making mistakes again again much more better than reading its usage in the text book .

Another cricual point on this subject is the fact that it is already proven by the educational psycologists that learning the things by real life experiences is much more effective than learning the ones which are previously prepared by the teachers .
Suppose that you are making a cake from a cook book .
Will your cake be excellent in the first time or will it get better by the time you make it again and again ?
