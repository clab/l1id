Nowaday people have a lot of work to do .
Children are start with kindergarden then elementar school after that highschool and university , after they graduate they are doind their masters and if they are lucky , they find a job and start to work .
After all these things child became a man .

I 'm now 18 years old and my all life long I studied and I am really not sure when it is going to finish .
I 'm from Turkey and in Turkey life is soo hard , if you want to survive you should work hard .
I 'm studing in U.S. right now because I want to live better in future .
I belive that after I became 60 I will have money and I will travel the world and my sons will take my place and continue to my job .

As I understand old people tell young people to enjoy their life because they think that school is not too hard and there is no illness .
Also young people tell the old people to enjoy their life but in a diffrent version .
Young people think that old people are just watching television and travel but also old people try to fight with their illness .
When you get older life became more difficult because you cant control your body easily and your movements became slower .

In my opinion every age has enjoyable part but of course not so much time to do that enjoyable stuff .
I know that my parents trying to make my life easier and enjoyable for me and I know that in future I will make them happy and I will make life easy for my parents and for my sons .
If every people will do the same thin this world will became a better place for everyone and people can enjoy the life without any age limitatons .
