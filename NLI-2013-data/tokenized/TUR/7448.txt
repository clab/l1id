Travelling , visiting different countries and meeting various kinds of people is my hobby since my childhood .
Since both of my parents are journalist , I have an opportunity to travel a lot .
Depending my huge experiences in travelling ( you can call me expert ) , I strongly believe that the best and the funniest way to travel in a small group , preferably close friends who knows each other very well , led by consensus of that group .
This short essay will explain why I prefer travelling in a small group is n't led by tour guide and disagree with the given statement in the question .

First of all , travelling times are supposed to be the most enjoyable times of the people since they are away from their jobs , responsibilities .
In these kinds of times , people should spend their times with the friends because in the routine of the life , we share limited times with them .

Secondly , buying informative books about the geography , history of the places that we travel is much more accurate information for me than trusting on the knowledge of a tour guide that we do n't know whether or not s/he is expert on the region .

Thirdly , travelling in a group that does n't know each other very well may cause irritating problems .
For example , last summer I joined a tour to Turkey , led by a tour guide ( unfortunately ! )
and we waited for exactly three hours for a person who was shoppin , ignoring the people who were waiting for her .
We lost very valuable hours by only sitting in the bus because our tour guide told us so !!

Fourthly , chatting with the people that you are n't gonna see them in the future and wasting your time by listening their childhood or their relationships with their husband/wife is another thing that affect my opion about travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
In my style of travelling , you can chat with your friends and also listen them because you are caring for them .
They are your friends , not the aliens that you have to spend days with .

Last but not least , deciding together with a consensus about what doing next is much more better than taking directives from a tour guide .
It is your holiday and somebody tries to decide your schedule .
In my view , it is unacceptable .
I believe in democracy and freedom of individual and even by a tour guide , I do n't want to be governed .

To sum it up , I definetly prefer travelling with a group of my friends and we do n't need any tour guide because our hearts and minds are our guides .
