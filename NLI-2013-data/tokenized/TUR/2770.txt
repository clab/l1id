Young people enjoy life more than old people because they don t have health problems as many as old people do .
While we are getting old we loose most of our abilities like ; hearing , seeing far or close objects , if we are unlucky , walking and many like these .
Most of the old people that we know takes medicine in order to regulate the ordinary and normal body conditions for example ; my grandmother takes pills in order to regulate her heart beats and grandfather of mine takes medication to avoid his blood presure increase abnormaly .
I hear their complains about these problems every single day .
Most of the time , I think the only thing that can be spoken to an old person is heath problems or medicine .
After getting retired , seeing their childrens weedings , having decreased on the abilities that they used to have , the thing they expect from their own life becomes just dieing in peace , and I think this is the most significant idea of many old people .
I witneesed it from my grandparents and their friends who are over 60 years old .

On the other hand , I also know a lot of young people who has no health problem and who are very happy with their lives .
Enjoying the life despite some other problems which old people don t have after their retirements as ; earning money , affording a good life , hard work conditions , is still possible for them because they don t have to worry abour their health .
Most of the young friends I know care about their lives in order not to be like their parents , complaining all the time about doctors or the que at the hospital .
They go to sport centers , take long holidays , travel to other countries , go to picnic , try different types of sports , becomes a member of a club ...
So they also consider that not only being young , but also staying healthy is necessary .
In my opion , young people who knows how to enjoy life and keeps their health as long as possible , accomplishs to enjoy life more than unhealthy old people do .
