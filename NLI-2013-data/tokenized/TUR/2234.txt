The life brings out too many alternatives for a person for enjoying the life .
The hard thing for him/her is being able to do that thing .
The reasons behind this `` ability '' can be the age , environmental factors or family situations .
But if we consider only the age , I think young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Altough I am only twentytwo years old and have not experienced being old , I agree this statement from my observations .
My basic arguments and observations are as following ; young people have more physical abilities than the do older people and they mainly do not think about all the apects of a situation These two help them while enjoying the life .

First of all phisical abilities are very important .
Because if a person is not able to go , do , or reach something there is going to be a limitation for him/her .
For instance , I think that sea holidays are important experineces for people .
Although it seems relaxing , it contains traveling , adapting a different weather if the person has gone a different place , and lastly sitting under the sun .
These are very very vital elements that can harm an old person 's health conditions .
He/she has to think very carefully before going and if she/he is gone she/he has to take care of himself/herself .
but mainly young people do not have these kind of limitations and can go if the conditions let them go .

Additionally , older people mainly think deeply about the situations that they face .
I think this is an unconcious fact and a result of being experienced .
The experience that they have help them to predict the results of the situations and they may hesitate about doing something .

However , I think this case being unexperienced is more advantageous .
Bacause , a person with lack of experience does not consider mainly the results of something .
In this point I am not talking about considering the circumstances at that time .
The point I want to reach is caring too much about the results and I think what the older people do is that .
This makes them too caringabout the results and limited .

In conlusion , if only the age is considered , younger people have more advanteges for enjoying the life than the old people .
But in fact it is not the only parameter for the enjoy a person has from his/her life .
An old person can enjoy life than do a young person if additional parameters like family conditions are included in this statement .
