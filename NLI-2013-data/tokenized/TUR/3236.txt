Human behaviours can be affected by lots of changes like living standards or technology or geneticly .
Whatever the reason today 's adults are insensitive to their society 's problems .
We can categorize these reasons into two groups such as external and internal effects which may cause children do not give enough time to helping their communities .

The internal effects are the first reason that makes children stray away from their communities .
Parents have the biggest responsibilty about ths issue .
They should explain and direct their children to understand and like helping to others .
In additon , television and games make children asocial .
For example , most children likes playing with computers than going out .
This makes children not aware of what is happening in the world or society or even in their house .

The external effects are the second main reason why young people do not give enough time to helping .
Competition in school or working areas make people work harder and harder .
People became robots thinking only their things to do but nothing else .
In addition to competition , money is another cause .
Some people forget their culture and responsibilities to their environment n order to make more money .

To sum up , because of external effects including insensitive parents , television and computer games and internal effects consist of competition and wanting more money can make young people do not give enough time and effort to helping their communities .
