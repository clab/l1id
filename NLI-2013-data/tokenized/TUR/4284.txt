Everybody has different opinions and thoughts about the upcoming generation .
Some people does n't think that young people give enough time to helping their communities .
As a young person I agree with this statement and i think that young people can do more to help their communities .

Every country is raising the childrens with different cultures , thats why I just can give opinions about my country .
Nowadays , we see that most of the criminals are young people .
I ca n't really say that it is all the young peoples fault .
I do n't think the community is helping young people with their problems also , which makes us come to this point .
If the community is not giving enough attention to the young people , they ca n't expect young people to help their community also .

I know that young people are the survivors of their country .
They have alot of responsibilties for the community .
Most people expect them to do better stuff than they are doing now .
There is a big generation gap between our parents and us .
They do everything to help their community and we have to take them as a role model for us , but because of this generation gap young people just do n't think it is very interesting .
I know that young people does n't help the community but we have to think this statement from a different point of view also .
They are young people and they have their own problems which makes them think that it is more important then the world .
I am sure that no matter which country they are from it is all same with young people .
That is not fair to put the responsibilty of the community to their shoulders .
I am sure that nowadays young people are going to be good adults which help their community and going to have alot of responsibilty .
