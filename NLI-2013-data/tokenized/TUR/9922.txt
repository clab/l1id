I think taking risk is a must in real life since we can not determine everything in our life .
Risks can lead people to earn much as well as to loose much .
In fact people should consider on loosing something if they want to obtain a success .

People can choose to keep on doing the things they have been already good at , but I think by that way people force themselves to be happy with the current situations rather than trying to find out something better .
For example owner of a small pizza restaurant can earn enough money to look after the family and to afford the rent of a house and a small car .
On the other hand if he chooses to extend his business , he can earn more money and he can use the money for the other things he want such as going on a holiday or buying a summer house .

I am one of those people who takes risks .
Last summer I went Berlin for my summer training in stead of performing it in my country .
It was a risk because I did not know German , I had no friends in German also the company did not afford me a place to live .
I believed that having a trainee in a such big company will help me soon since I would gain so much experience and also I would have the chance of working in an international company .
It was really hard for me since I had have to live in a hostel for two months with little money and I had some difficulties in communicating people .
Consequently I converted that disadvantages to an advantage for me .
The company made an announcement that they look for engineers that can be work in their Istanbul office and I am the strongest candidate for that job now .

To sum up there is no limit for upgrading the situations , but it is up to people at which level they stop to upgrade .
Also it is up to people always ask for more invest sometho \ ing to h \ get more
