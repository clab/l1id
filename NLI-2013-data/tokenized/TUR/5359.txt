Most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The usage of beautiful or handsome boys , nice events , nice feelings or with the usage of plastic versions which is more close to the ideals of people , in the advertisement makes the person believe that the item is worth buying .

First of all , the advertisement use an ideal person , who is regarded as a role model , to sell their product .
When you buy an item for being like the role model , you usually have a dissapointment .
Buying a specific shampoo brand in order to have as nice hair as the woman in the advertisement usualy ends up in dissapointment .
The product usually look better or seem to be better with the role model but when you buy it , the item is not nice anymore .

Secondly , the advertisement usually shows nice events and when you see the item you immediatly think of the event .
Like chips advertisement displays a person with many friends and they eat the chips together but buying a packet of chips will not make you have lots of friends .
Most of the time you buy the item in order to have the event with it but when the event doesnot occure wih the item , you become dissapointed .

Also the advertisement shows that a certain item is related to a certain feeling .
Buying an ice-cream will not make a boy falling in love with you but you see such things in an advertisement and belive that you wil be in love or find the perfect match of yours by buying a cone of ice-cream .
Most of the time , the item is not the one you want , you want to have the exact same feelings of the protegenist .
When you buy the ice-cream , you usually see that it is not what you wanted and you become dissapointed .

Apart from the feelings and becoming like the role model , the advertisements usualy use the plastic - ideal versions - of a specific item which make you want it .
Mc Donalds shows very nice , tasty hamburgers but actualy the advertisement does not show the real one so the one which you want is not the same as what you get .

Most of the time the advertisements make a product seem much better than it is by using various methods , with the usage of role models , nice events , nice feelings and plastic - ideal - items , which causes dissapointment after buying the item .
