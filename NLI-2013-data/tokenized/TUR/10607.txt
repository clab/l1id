In an entire life it is very important being successful .
It is significant in school , in businness life , in daily live , in private life ...
Mankind always want to be succesful .
But if people want to have success they have to take risks and try new thinks .
They have to have some new atractions in their lives .

First of all a man living a monoton live can not be happy .
After people taste new things happiness becomes and thank to happiness success becomes .
For instance if we think of a people who trys new thinks we can see that he or she is successful .
If we consider that 's why we 'll find the exact answer .
Because change is the only thing that never changes .
Regularity is boring .
Diversity and to alter is amazing .

Secondly , it is a fact that creating brings success .
Being creative is a huge step to forward .
For example in businness when comparing two companies people prefer the one which renew itself .
Because when one of them sells always the same the thing the other one brings alternatives that they already sold .
They sells the old ones and the new ones at the same time .

Lastly , in our daily lives from our clothes to our minds changing is good .
If we always think about old fashions and old times we can never be successful .
We have to take risks in all our lives .
For example when we join in a new community for make friends we have to take risk .
Making friends is one the most significant success in the world .
If we always think like `` My old friends were different .
I could trust them .
Now how can i trust someone else `` There will be no gamble in our lives and of course no happiness and no real success .
\ To conclude as it mentioned before taking risks and try new things always bring the biggest success in our lives .
If people want to be happy and successful they should fit in the new world and change when it is necessary .
Whether in our daily lives , school or in businness life or private life to have success it is important to renew .
So that as successfull people know how to reach success they all try new things and their lives always contains gambles .
