In recent years , some people argue that there will be fewer cars in use in near future since the innovations in transportation technology .
However , the argument seems me far from reality .
Although , there are some studies in this direction , I do n't think that cars which have an important place in our lifes can be replaced by easily in twenty years .
The statistics and the projects of governments justifies my beliefs .

First of all , our past experience challenges to the argument .
If we look at the statistics to understand how the tendency of the numbers of the car in use is , we see clearly that there is a permanent increase in car usage .
In other words , the statistics of past data does not support the prediction in argument .
It can easily be seen that all the statistics beginning from the invention of the cars to today demostrates that the usage of cars has dramatically increased .
When people have better economic conditions , they desire to buy cars .
Inceases in population in all over the world also served this tendency .

Secondly , nowadays many developing countries continue to built new roads .
For instance , in my country - Turkey - there are regions where roads are not even suitable for cars and the government is too eager to expand the total kilometers of high ways to make car usage easier .
In this purpose they expense a significant part of the budget to the transportation project .
This efforts to increase high ways and to make them secure made also the people more eager to use cars .

If we talk about a far future when there is no need to use cars because of the adaptation of helichopters or a fututre where world has connected with metros then we can expect the cars to disappear .
But , today they are crucial for our comfort and I ca n't see a vehicle that can replace car usage .
