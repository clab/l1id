i agree , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
if a student understand ideas and concepts , he will be able to do the work .
he will learn while doing a job .
for example , if a computer enginer learn how to write a program or how to make a website on the net , he will do the best thing .
moreover , he will add his creativity and do something which is not made by anybody .
and he improve himself when working and creating .

if a student learn facts only , he will do work like robot .
he do what he learn in class .
he does not do anything else .
this make decrase in his creativity and some time will come he never do creative work after all .

famous universities teach only ideas and concepts .
they not teach fact .
students which are graduated in these popular universities will become good place in their work life .
in addition they earn a lot of money .
if they learned only facts in universities , they would be a unfamous , ordinary people .

countries are require people who learn ideas and concepts of work .
they give a good job for these people , give good wage and everybody knows that people 's name in the country .

i will learn and understand ideas and concepts .
i will concentre only thats while i will be studying in the univesity .
