I will agree with the argument that it is much more important for the students to understand the gist of the ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
It is obvious that students will not spend their entire life at school .
Eventually , they will graduate and will work in environments where they will need to apply the ideas and concepts they learned at school .
In order to be successful in their professional life , it is crucial for them to absorbe the material that they are given at school such as ideas and concepts .

A student in international affairs major must know realism , liberalism and the theories behind it .
He/She has to know how communism has emerged , what lied beneath it .
How it differs from liberalism ?
What constructivism means ?
How it relates the current school of thoughts ?
Knowing the facts will not solely help the students to analyze what the real situation brings .

It is not argued here that learning facts is not important and students do not need them .
It is obviously important .
Ideas and concepts should definitely be applied to facts , meaning real world situations .
Without applying the theories to factual incidents , learning concepts will be useless and meaningless .

However , without understanding the gist of the theories , students will encounter hardships in analyzing real world situations .
Without knowing what liberalism is and what it brings to the countries , a student will not be able analyze completely the certain facts that he/she faces in professional life .

Another point to mention is , ideas and concepts do not change abruptly .
It usually takes a certain period of time for an idea to evolve and to find credence .
But facts change all the time .
An issue that is important today may differ tomorrow .
A student has to update his/her knowledge to keep up with the agenda .
And without having the fundamental background , a student will not achieve success in analyzing new facts .

To say the least , I agree with the statement that it is much more important for a student to understand the ideas and concepts than just learning facts .

Ideas and concepts do not change
