Majority of people are really effected from advertisements ; as a result of that companies use this way to support the consumption of their products .
I agree with the statement that products seem better in most advertisments .
Not tested products are selling on markets /

Firstly ; the most important thing is to effect women who spend most of their time by shopping .
Especially make up products are on market with just small changes .
By changing its cover or smell its sold like a new product .
Also hygenic products must be tested .
Sometimes in advertisements it says ; our new product is for sensitive and allergetic person nonethless when you use it you see that it is not real .
Secondly children want to buy whatever they see ; Bright covers or little toys which are given with the product effects them .

On the other hand with the improvement of technology new products are on market each day .
For example last month I bought a new mobile phone which I saw an advertisement on TV .
It is said hat it does not effected from water and I dropped it in the rainy weather and as a result I can not use it anymore .
After market services must be effected

In conclusion ; I agree with the statement that sometimes advertisements are not showing the truth .
They mostly the new producing way of a product with small changes .
