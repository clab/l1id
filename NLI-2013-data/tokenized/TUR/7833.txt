If I had the chance to visit the parts of the world that I have always wanted to , such as France or Italy , I would definitely choose to be accompanied by only a couple of the people who share the same interests with me rather than a large group and I would not want to be accompained by a tour guide .
Therefore I disagree with the statement of `` The best was to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' .

The main reason for that is travelling with a group brings about many problems such as time limitations .
You would be required to stop at ceratin times since people in the group will have needs such as food or refreshments and you would not be able to decide when you want to do the things whenever you want to do them .

Secondly , every person in the group will definitely have different tastes and every person in the group will want to visit different parts of the region and they will want to spend different amounts of time at every different location .
For example , some people might want to visit the bars or clubs of France whereas the others might want to visit the palaces and museums .
This would lead to disagreements or unequal time spent at the visited locations .

Another factor that led to my decision is that when a person travels with only a couple of people whom he knows or alone , he has the chance to choose the route that he is going to take and he can stop at various places for quick visits such as cafes or places on the way .
However when travelling in a group led by a tour guide you would have a set and specific route to follow without any kind of flexibility and random quick stops at places that interest you would not be possible .

In conclusion , according to me , travelling alone or with only a couple of friends who share the same interests with me , without a tour guide would be my preferred way of travelling because it would give me the opportunity to choose my own route , I would not have to stick with the time regulations of the group and I would visit the places I want to visit , whenever I want to visit them instead of that of the group .
