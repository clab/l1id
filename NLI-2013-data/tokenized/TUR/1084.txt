People are very different from each other .
Some people have desire and talent to learn and some have different abilities on different subjects .
It is like , some can perceive things better but some can not .
Or some people can jump higher while some can not .
These are things about genetics and come with us as we are born .

If we look at it that way , we can not say that it is better to study many academic subjects .
We also can not say it is necessary to study an academic subject .
It is just about people and how their interests and talents direct them .
Gaining broad knowledge is very important however universities and academics are not the only path necessary reaching it .

We can give artists as an example for this .
Some people still argues about that art can not be teached .
Some believe it comes inside the artist as they are born .
Not all the greatest artists in the world are graduated from university .
For example Leonardo da Vinci .
He didnt go to any art scool in his life .
But some things inside him differenciated him from the rest of the people .
We can not say he doesnt have a broad knowledge .
Example can be widened by athletes .
Maybe some of them just couldnt graduate from a single academic course but this is because he is not that type of human .
He is living in this world to do different things .

I am not saying that it is bad or impossible to have broad knowledge on many academic skiss .
Some people are capable of learning and filling their brains with a lot of information .
Some may say if is ineffective but i dont think so .
One `` can '' know a lot .
It is just a matter of choice .

It doesnt matter which way we choose .
The most important thing here is to choose the subject we like and we can .
If we are not happy with what we are doing it is impossible for us to be effective in the world no matter how much we know .
