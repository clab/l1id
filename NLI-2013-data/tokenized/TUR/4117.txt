Societies are bound together with the common values within their sharing and respect elements .
However , young people are not struggling for understading their communities .
For this reason , it is possible to argue that youth is the key element for understanding the combining values of a community however they are lack of this responsibility .
Three important reasons for this problem are the existence of variety in activities , people becoming more individual and lack of guidance from universities .

One of the main problems of youth not to give attention to community occurs with the variety of activities that they can participate .
Existence of many attractive activities , social centers and even university clubs makes young people to choose one of the things that they like .
For instance , if a student likes ceramics and learns an associated club in his university , he will possibly choose to perform his interest .
This situation can be applied to many university students in which they are regretting the need of community help but rather choosing to accomplish their individual needs .

Secondly , because of the technological improvements and its achievement in reaching every person , people started to think more individually and for their own seek .
For instance , the introduction of the internet to people especially stopped young people to take place in society and to communicate with each other .
Rather they spend their time surfing in the internet just looking for their own interest .
Because of this developing structure among the youth , it becomes harder to expect them in enrolling civic involvement works .
With the existence of many tools forcing youth to become alone and individual , the less respect for the community would occur .

Universities are the most important centers for young people to shape their charachters but guidance for community work is missing in most of the universities .
Rather universities started to become institutions as a key figure for job applications and better living conditions .
Recent information also shows that universities are trying to affect students by their success rather than enforcing community values .
As a result , lack of guidance towards community work also triggles the youth to become individuals .

As a result , young people are rather studying and behaving for their own good .
In the increase of this event there are important steps like university behaviors and technological improvements .
But it is very important to reduce this behaviour of the youth for the common good of the society .
