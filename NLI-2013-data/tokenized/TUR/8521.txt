Understanding is the basis of learning .
Manipulated knowledges forms the ideas and consepts .
Ideas and consepts are reasons of the facts .
Indeed learning facts without understanding theory behind them is useless .
In addition learned ideas and concets are also useless without relating with the facts .
These two are connected to each other .

Ideas and consepts are important on learning but without relating with real facts , teaching system constructs useless brains .
Students sure need to understant the main theories behind the real events .
Understanding main ideas give the ability of making brain storms and ability to find relations between knowledges .
According to the student psyhcology , when the ideas do not related with real examples , knowledges hung up in the air .
For instanece , I were giving extra physics lectures to my neigbours little boy .
He always ask me to give real examples for the subjects .
It is neccesary to inform students about ideas and make relations by facts .

If consider the other option , teaching students the lectures based on facts .
There should be many questions occur in their minds .
Why , how , when ...
It is geting more and more difficult to answer all those questions by only informing them with facts .
An instructor can not possibly teach about chemical lessons .
Matter consist of atoms and atoms inhales electrons and protons .
It is impossible to understant main scince theories with facts .

To sum up , education can not be established on only ideas , theoris and concepts .
They should be related eith the real examples and facts .
In addition no one can possibly teach or undestand most subjects by facts .
