Nowadays , there are lots of companies working on same products that causes competition .
In order to gain more money even they are not good , they are trying to sell their products by making good advertisements .
Products can seem much better because of technological equipments that are used in making advertisements , quality of people used in it and psicologicalosophica effects on people .

The first reason that we can see the product much more better is technology .
For instance , when you see a face cream advertisement in TV , smooth faces effect people especially women , However , smooth faces are just the results of computer skills .
Without thinking about this game , people can buy that product in order to make their face look like the women in advertisement .
However , they cannot reach that goal .

Good looking people that are used in advertisements is the other reason that products seem much better .
For instance , some clothing advertisements effects people by good looking men or women .
The clothes are look great on them .

The another reason may be philosophical .
Showing good features of life in advertisements are very smart idea to effect the people .
For example , one of the water advertisement in my country is about showing happy and healthy baby with her mother drinking that water and seems very effective .
I think this kind of scenes in an advertisement are very significant to change the people 's mind to buy their product .

To sum up , I strongly believed that the products are not as good as they seem in the advertisements .
The behaviors of company owners are normal because they are trying to sell their products .
Thus , we should just know the fake of this illustrations and buy the products that we trust .
