People have choose many paths to findout which way is right for them .
We finished our schools or try to find which way gives us the key of the success .
We can tryout to finish university and worked about our subject and there was a time comes up , we can change our mind or this job was't suit for us .
We want to be success in our lives , be part of something be remembered in history or just for a better life conditions .
Thus , we have to take two risks .

One of the risk is staying and doing what about you already know .
In additon , you do n't take any risk of all .
But , you can try to upgrade your proffesional carrier in higher levels then you become a successful man .
For example , i know one man which he was a computer engineer and he loved his job .
In a time of period , the job could n't gave enough success fealing at all .
He became a an unhappy human being .

The second risk is you tryout new things about your live .
A cussessful person can forcast the what 's the next finest job or opportunities within five or ten years .
Thus , he can manage , organise and can make future plans .
For instance , the computer can change his jop to a airport pilot or a just a doctor .
He can rescure so many lives or he can visit all of the world .

In concluison the risks , the pahts you chose show way to a successfull life .
In my opinion its better to tryout new things becouse you can upgrade and meet so many ways and peoples .
