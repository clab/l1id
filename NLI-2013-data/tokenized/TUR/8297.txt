In our world in the schools they give some topics to studennts and they tell them to learn these .
The students do npot care about ideas and concepts in it and they just learn what they gave .
I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

Firstly , at a school there are two kinds of students .
The teachers gives them a topic to learn .
One of them looks at the topic as a fact which he should quicly learn ' the other looks at the topic more detailed .
He thinks about the ideas and concepts and this makes him to learn easier .

Secondly , if a student makes some guesses on the topic or searches for it it makes him to learn easier .
After doing this student learns every detail about the topic and after that it is very hard to forget it .

Thirdly , the education system is very important .
For example in our country the system is very bad .
We have a OSS system after the highschool we attend this exam and if we win we should go to university .
This system makes us to think not detailed .
So we do not care about the ideas and concepts because we should learn everything immediately as a fact .
The reasons are not important for us because we shoul win the race .

Lastly learning thins as a fact not understanding it makes us to think more small .
Because we do not know anything else except the topic .
We can not think bigger because we do not know how to think we just read and learn like a robocope .
The other things are not important for us .

To sum up , I think it should be more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts if they really want to be a high person .
