Succesful people always try to do new things this is like a habit for them .
When somebody commonly journalist ask about this subject , they always answer with similar reasons such as for public acclaim or everybody wait new things from them or just for feeling .
Here I want to share my ideas about this subject .

First of all , generally successful singers or artists have this kind of problem .
They have to do diferent things every films or albums .
If they do not do this , their funs can loose their interest to them .
Therefore this is the starting to ending for them .
When they loose their admireing images , they will be nobody like ordinary people .
For ` nstance old movie stars we do not remember most of them know and their star do not rising .

Secondly , I think to be successful is a habit for successful people due to the fact that they akways follow success .
For example , some of the well known businessmen are always try to produce and sale new things .
This is like a habit for them such as Nokia , they alwat produce new generatin phones and sale to society .
They always need to top of the mountain .
They can not accept to be second .

Finally , if somebody being a success , all society waited new things from them .
This not only their aspect but also our responcibility too , In conclusion , successful people addicted to success , This is not always good for them .
Sometimes they feel unhappy .
Although , if they do not have this addiction , we could not establish much more .
