Specialization or Broad Knowledge

Whether or not specialization should be favored in academics is a controversial issue .
It is not easy to completely state that specialization on a specific subject is better compared to having broad knowledge of academic subjects .
However , I belive that specialization on a specific subject should be accompanied with a broad knowledge of other subjects .

Firstly , it is practically not possible and reasonable to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Human time and energy would not be sufficient to have knowledge on many issues .
Even though it is ideal , specialization in a subject is only possible for mankind .
To have a broad knowledge on academic subjects is not reasonably possible , since it is contrary to the idea of academics .

Furthermore , specialization would help for the evolution of human civilization .
Progress could only be achieved by knowledge and only by specilization such a knowledge could be achieved .
Knowledge is attained through concentration , research and experimentation .
However it is not possible to experiment in all realted academic subject .
For instance , if Newton did not contentrate on physics but have bits and pieces of physics , biology and chemistry he wouldnot be able to develop his theories .
Similarly , if Freud did not specialize on psychoanalysis many of his assertions would not exist .

On the contrary , it must be kept in mind that an academics require an awareness .
In order to be a serious academic , apart from specialization general knowledge and awareness is required .
An academic in social sciences should be open to learning about chemistry for instance .
Specialization only has a value if is exercised within the context of relevant disciplines .
For instance , a commercial lawyer , must know the codes , doctrine as well as the relevant history , economic structure , managerial problems , business practice .

Consequently , in the 21st century it is required for humans to be specialized .
The primary reason for specialization is the progress of mankind .
In addition to that , one most always keep in mind that a specialist always have to have broad knowledge
