The humankind always need to trying to reach goodlife standarts therefore trying new things is a very important aspect of humanslife .
Everyone has a different point of views about the idea of trying new things .
Some assume that successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well in contrary to those som think that people should execute things which they already know how to do well .
I actually agree with the first idea .
these are my following reasons

Firstly , success is releated with responsibility .
When successful people try new things and take risks they trust on their responsible characteristics .
For example i know a proffessor who is so successful at his job .
Furthermore he always knows his duties and behaves according to it .
In addition to this he never leaves his jobs about a luck .
He usually plans his works and live for it .
Actually this feature brings the success to him

In addition to this , success is reletead with the experience .
If a person has experiences about the life or business or human psychology he/she can get the success very easily .
Also these experiences help the person to try new things and take risks with a comfortable way .
Plus the person can feel relief depending on the experiences .
for instance i have a friend who is so willing to travel and see the world .
Moreover she has many kind of experiences all over the world .
Basically these experiences help her in her job to be more successful .
She does not afraid of trying new things thanks to her experiences .
If the people do not live the experiences they can not know the things which they face .

The last but not least success is releated with knowledge .
Knowlegde enables the people not to hesitate try new things and take risks .
Furthermore people can get the risk more easily because of the fact that they can know diversity of information what they will do .
Next people can feel more self confidience with the knowledge that they have .
They do not think what to do in a long time .

All in all as i said before success is releated with both the responsibility and the experience as well as the knowledge .
These valuable things make people try to new things and take risks than only doing what they already know how to do well .
The long and the short of it is that there is an old saying that change brings life .
i hope people do not disregard what i mentioned
