Being a succesful person changes according to people 's thoughts and personality .
One considers that earning a lot of money is success but the other considers that painting a beautiful painting is makes a person successful .
But the common thing is that all these people are trying new things and taking risks .

The first advantage of taking risks is earning self-confidence .
The people who have succeeded something and moving towards to a new adventure become more self-confident , and it makes people more easy to success another thing .

The second point is , new experiences instead of things that already known how to do well , bring new successes to the person with them .
And the reputation of the successful person at the society that he lives increases .

The other advantage of trying new things and taking risks is , promotion .
There is always someone who is watching you and your every step during your business life .
Being successful and trying another thing knowing that you are going to be successful again has a positive affect on your boss or lecturer etc. and makes everything much more easier to get a promotion and receive a higher salary check .

Observing what is happening around you and being open-minded to new ideas that you have never tried before may help you to be more self-confident and successful person .
