Having a wide perspective and a broad knowledge in many academic fields is much better and necessary than specializing in a single subject , especially in our modern and diverse societies .
This necessity becomes much more apperant when one considers social studies .
Academic work in social fields , because they are mainly dealing with human beings and their actions , unlike engineering , requires a broad understanding of human behaviour in order to make meaningful and accurate assestments of their actions .

Many of the issues that we face today are very much inter-related .
It is very hard to isolate a single problem from the other and specifically study it without ever engaging its neigboring fields .
For instance , a sociologist who plans to study the criminal tendency among an specific cultural group must not only have information about the history of these people , but must also have an adequate amount of knowledge about how economic conditions which might influence human behaviour should be interpreted .
Moreover , she must have a knowledge of interpreting economical data , which would also necessiate a minimum level knowledge of statistical data .
Hence , as illustrated above , a study on criminal tendency would at least necessiate knowledge of history , economics and statistics .

Another difficulty with focusing in one specific subject is that it narrows your perspective and may result in disorientation regarding the place that the specific subject occupies within the general picture .
Every social event , apart from its internal structure or working , is also interacting with other parts of the social field in an active way .
Therefore , many times in order to get a meaningful analysis of the particular social structure that one is analyzing , it should be placed within a wider context and interpreted within the light that the context sheds on it .
Without this broader outlook , it is possible to fall into many cliches and misinterpret a social structure .
For instance , some practices concerning woman in many eastern cultures might seem oppressive to a western academic , if she only focuses on that specific practice .
However , a broader perspective which puts that social practice within the context , for example a religious context , could make it much more understandable .
The act which seems oppressive might be reinterpreted as based on the consent of woman , and therefore not constituting a form of power relation .
Therefore , putting things in context and looking at them from a wider perspective would yield to better results .

We are living in an increasingly diverse societies and it is much more easier for different people to interact with each other due to the advencements in information technologies .
Within this diverse world , any academic who takes interest only at a single specific field would be lacking the necessary tools for producing meaningful analysis of society .
Therefore , what the modern world needs is academics who are trained in different fields and academics who can put together information from different fields into meaningful wholes .
