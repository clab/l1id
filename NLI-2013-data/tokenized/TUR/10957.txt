Being Successful

Some people try to create new things and take risks although some people only doing what they already know how to do well .

Being good in my work and getting success is important for me beacuse i am trying to do my best .
Some people thing if they do what they already know they will be successful .
Thats not such a bad idea .
But , on the other hand some people look the situation like that they thing if they can produce or try new things and take risks they can be more successful .

In my personal opinion trying new things and taking some risks is the best thing that you can do in your life beacuse you should find new things for the next genarations .
Besides if you can find new things you can be more important business man also you can get the success easier .
As an example if i had a big company i would like to see my employees that they are trying new things while they are working .
I will share what i thing and ask what they thing .
After we discuss some things i will choose the right desicion .
For doing that you can be a good business man or a good employee .

In the meanwhile there are some bosses that they only want from their employees just do what they know how to do well .
Doing something good is important as well but if you are a man who is n't open new ideas and you are't produce new things you are not be a good employee or a good boss .

Despite for all these resions create some new things and take risks to being good in your job and show something for the next generations otherwise you would not do your job good in this life .
