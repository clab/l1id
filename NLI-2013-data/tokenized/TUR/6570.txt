There has been a continuous change in the world for several years .
I think that the ongoning chage will continue for the following centuries .
The changes will have particular effect on daily subjects like transportation , work life , education system and so on .
In the light of this idea , I definitely think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Actually there are three main reasons that will cause this decrease .

First of all , the oil reserves on the earth has been decreasing .
The decrease in the amount effects the oil prices .
Even in the last 3 years the oil prices increased dramatically .
I think that , this increase will continue according to the decrease in oil reserves on the earth .
As the price of oil increases , the number of people who can afford a car will decrease and the total number of cars will diminish .
Secondly , I think that cars are not a good way of transportation and in twenty years , other means of trasportation will be invented .
The cars are not feaxible to be used in both over the sea and in the air .
As the requirements of the humankind increases , they will search for more flexible means of transportation .
For instance , flying vehicles can be invented in twenty years and that can be very feasible to used .
Therefore the car requirement will decrease and there will be less vehicles called ` cars ' .

Lastly , by the spread of internet and its tools , the requirement for transportation may decrease and as a result the number of cars can diminish .
Since internet is widely used both in our transactions and eduation , in twenty years , students attending their lectures from home may increase .
Actually , this system has already been started to be used in several countries and appreciated by the users .
Furthermore there is a new consept called `` telecommuting '' which means doing your job at home by means of phone , internet and fax .
This system is very suitable for several jobs today .

To conclude , I think that the use of cars will decrease in twenty years .
According to the decrease in the oil reserves , increase in the requirements of flexibility and spread of internet all over the world will have particular effect on the number of the cars in the traffic .
