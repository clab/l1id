Most advertisements are making products seem much better than they are even thoug others are not .
Firstly , I used some products which was not as useful as it was in the commertial .
Secoundly , most advertiesments are showing increadable usage of their products .
That is why I think most advertisements are making their products seem better than they are .

I used some make up products in order to relieve some skin problems .
Its advertisement was very good prapere becouse it was shown as a really good product .
However , when I tried it , it did not work well .
Most of advirtisements are the same .
When people use them , people see that they are not as good as they were shown in

In addition to this , most of the advertiesments are showing many increadable things and most of them do not seem true .
For example , a acne cleaning jel advertiesement is showing how the product is effective .
the advertiesment is telling that acne problem will disappear in 1 week .
This is not posiable .
Even though people who has acne problems use increadably good product , acne problem can not disappear in one week .
On the other hand advertisers are using some famous stars in order to make their advertisers better .
Even though they use famous people I do not believe this kinds of advertiesments .
That is why I do not prefer to buy products have this kinds of advertisements .
