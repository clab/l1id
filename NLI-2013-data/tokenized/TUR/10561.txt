Risk to Succeed

Success is a path , not a situation ; so it needs skills for adjusting to the new circumstances , and more importantly creating own opportunities by taking risks .

I also agree that successful people are different than the conservative ones ; because thay have a different view on trying and also the skills to accomplish their targets .
Of course risk taking does not mean to make stupid investments , but plan and coordinate everything .

In every risk you take there is a chance of failure , but if you get afraid of failing you will also wo n't get successful .
In Chinese alphabet there are two icons for the risk concept .
One of them is opportunity and the other one is loss .
If you do n't take any risk you will never find the make benefits from an opportunity .

John D. Rockefeller who was one of the richest people of the world , once said : `` Do not be afraid to give up the good to go for great '' .
He is considerated as a successor because of his attitude in risk taking .
He cleverly saw the American 's need in changing in transportation from railroad to the motorway and used his chance in creating the world 's greatest oil company .

People who are doing only they know , will mostly do one thing on their lives .
Maybe that will give them a more stable life with very low risk but they will never have to become very rich .

I am a risk-lower myself ; and I try to look behind the scenes .
Because I know there is always an opportunity behind .
Because success is kind of a comparison
