The cars are inevitable vehicles used for the transportation purposes .
Nearly every family owns a car nowadays .
But in twenty years there will be fewer car in use than there is today due to the advances in public transportation , high oil prices and the increasing awereness of the society about the environmental drawbacks of the cars .

As the modern cities are getting larger and larger , the existing public transportation systems are improved and new ways of public transportation are introduced to the use of the society .
In many cities , new , wider and more comfortable busses are provided by the local administrations .
Moreover , the bus routes are extended in a way that they will cover all the parts of the towns and cities .
So that a person who has to commute to work in an unaccessable part of the city by bus , now can use the comfortable buses and thus the need for the car dissappears .
In my opinion in twenty years the advances in the public transportation system will result in fewer cars in use .

Furthermore the oil prices are too high .
Each day , the ratio of the people who can afford life with car is decreasing due to outrages oil prices .
Also the prices are fluctuating and eventually increasing because of the wars in the areas of oil production .
Due to economical reasons , people will quit buying and driving cars in the near future .

Moreover the society became aware of the fact that cars are giving great harm to the the enviroment .
The usage of unsustainable energy sources , the oil in the case of cars , is causing serious damage , such as air pollution .
With the help of scientists and media , the society is getting aware of this fact and in the end the usage of cars will decrease .

To sum up , there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years than there are today because of the advancement in the public transportation systems , economical reasons regarding high oil prices and the increasing awareness of society about environmental damage caused by cars .
