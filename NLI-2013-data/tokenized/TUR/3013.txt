Enjoying life is not always directly related with the ages .
Its actually requires both skills to be more dynamic as most of the young people do and to have more encourage as the older people have by their life experience .

Maybe the word of dynamizm may not be enough to explain how is important to have a certain attitute to enjoying life .
The one first must be peacefull with own and with surrounding .
Then self-confidence becames and it makes the people more relax .
Since most of the young people has much less concern to worry about than I agree the young people has more potential to enjoy life .

Also the chemically wise that for sure there is much more activity in the body of young people .
It might help to be more healty and dynamic and makes easy to live .
Even emotionally , it is correct that the younger people are more active than the older ones .

Do you think , all these fact says us that the younger people can enjoy life more than older ones ?
Mostly but not entirely .
There might be still something missing I guess .

Young people are more suitable to get dissapointed by intersections between their great expectation due to huge imaginations and the concrete tough rules of the reality of life .
They are also more attent to take weong decitions due to their blowing blood and rush of everythin .
How the people can be happy with this dilemma ?

Here the life experience comes as a solution .
While the one gets more and more experience form the life - mostly the bad ones - then gain more abilit to evaluate better the conditions and to take better decisions ,

So finally it would be better to be a older who have younger blood .
