The young people , in today 's globally challenged environment , do not give enough emphasis on helping their communities .
I fully agree with this issue of socila responsibility .

To cover the subject from various angles , the potential reasons can be listed and defined .
First , the parents , today , are all working professionals and therefore they do not spend enough time on the subject with their children and let them realize the importance of helping their communities .
Because this area is not covered by the parents , it is only shown or taught in the schools which can not provide the basis for the subject to be covered fully .
Because young people are influenced mostly by their parents , as they get less attention from them , the subject matter is not held properly in the families .

Second , because of the economic needs of the society , the education and the trends are all influenced by the factors that create profit .
And since helping communities is not a matter of profit , the importance of the issue is not expressed via printed materials or media .

When we combine these above factors , we can come to a conclusion where it is an outcome of the efforts of the society in the end of the day .
Young people of todays ' globally challenged world are caring more on what they wear , what computer plays they can purchase and play .
They are becoming less and less oriented in the real world and society problems .

Lately , the individual professionals , celebrities and corporations are stressing more emphasis on the issues by promoting the idea of corporate citizenship and social responsibility .
This pormotion has become a trends in the last two years and the campaigns are generating more profits for the community .

It is believed that this new trend will become effective on not only the young people but also the middle aged and elder people .
Since it is widening and strengthening the scope of helping the community via media and printed press .
Yet all trends today are created and influenced in filling the gaps of the lack of social awareness .
Where it can easly be concluded that the lack of the young people helping the community is also observed by the whole world and actions are started to be taken to change it .

Thus , it can be concluded that the young people are not giving enough time to help the community but their attentions can be converted into the subject matter and they can be benefitted .
