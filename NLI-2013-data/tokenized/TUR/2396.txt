The lifestyles and activities of the young and old people are always compared .
While the young people think that the way of life old people lead is slow and boring , old people complain about the speed of the young people 's life .

People , young or old , have a limited time to live ..
In addition to this people should live their life full of enjoy and with activities .
Wecan clearly observe that there are more activity for the young people around .
It can be seemed as a discrimination but it must be accepted that in today 's world young people spend ore time at outside and also spend more money .
In this situation it can be concluded that young people have more chance to enjoy life .
On the other hand , what about the people whose age is old but young himself ?
I mean that sometimes age does not the meaning of everything .
Person who has had a enjoyful life can continue his life in same way .

In addition to this , the concept ` experience ' is very important .
When the people are young they do not have the chance of aware of what is true and wrong .
Therefore it is possible to make mistakes and destroy his life .
Ofcourse it is not something certain but even it is just a possibility it is a situation that must be thought on .
On the other hand old people who had several mistakes before gains experience and make less mistakes .
And in my opinion it is a good way of enjoying the life .

Another important thing is that enjoying life is also up to the preferences and ideas of the people .
There can be young people who enjoy doing things that associated with the old people .
For instance , a young person may not like the night life .
Instead of this he may prefer to dtay at home nd chat with family at nights .
Another example is fishing with a boat .
Most of the young people think that it is boring but it can be also a source of enjoy for a young person .

In conclusion , it is important to belive in life and its beauties .
If a person knows how to enjoy life it is not importanr if he is old or young .
