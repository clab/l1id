I believe all people may enjoy their lives independent from their age because all of the life stages has their own advantages and disadvantages .
Thus , I do n't agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Assume that you 're 70 and you do n't have grandchildren .
If having children of your children is important to you , then you wo n't be happy and wo n't be enjoying your life .
Furthermore , assume that you are in your twenties and you cannot go to dance with your friends .
Again if it is relevant to you , you wo n't be enjoying your life and age .
On the other hand if you have all your expectations from your age , then you 'll be the best person in the world and enjoy your life more than anyone in the world .

First of all , it 's true that being young brings some advantages about enjoying life .
Like you 're energetic , healthy and careless than old people do .
Traveling , making sports and dating are easy for you .
However , it has disadvantages .
You may travel more than an old person but in case if you have enough money and permission .
You cannot shut the door and say to your parents that you 're going to a spiritual trip to India .
They will ask you why and most probably they wo n't let you .

Being older has also its disadvantages and advantages .
When you are old , this means you are full of knowledge at least in one specific topic .
Moreover you have one-life long experiences .
Therefore , people like and want to talk to you due to getting benefit from your knowledge and experiences .
You have lots of things to tell such as your memories of childhood , experiences in your work and all these funny and bad luck events .
You have faced more years of the world 's history that youngsters cannot have a chance to see .
Of course , as a direct disadvantage of this view , you will not be able to see the next generation .

To conclude , elder people may also enjoy life as much as young people for me .
It 's solely about what you expect from life and what the life gives to you .
If they fit to one another , you will be enyojing your life at a maximum level whatever your age is .
