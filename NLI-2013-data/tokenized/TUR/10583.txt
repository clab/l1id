In order to be successful , people use methods , in accordance to their personality , problem solving methods , and style of life .
Throughout history , we see people who became successful by simply doing what is done before , or taking the way no one have taken before .

To start with , I can say that majority of people try to be successful with using already established methods .
Some have the results which are supposed to be had , some even fails to apply a method , and some had extraordinary results due to various reasons .

As an example , I can say that Sir Alex Ferguson , Scottish manager of Manchester United football team , is one of the most success people that I have ever seen during my life .
He is having his twentieth season as the manager of the club , and he not only had several achievements as a manager , but also honored by the Queen by being given the honorific `` Sir '' .
I can also state that he is having the same type of managing since the first day as a manager , and never gave exceptations from his rules , his tactics and his managing style .
We all witnessed his fights with his squad 's star players , like David Beckham and Ruud van Nistelrooy in order not to make any exceptations .
He was the same when he used to manage the Scottish club , whose name I cannot remember at the moment , thus , i can say that he is simply doing what he knows how to do well .

On the other hand , there are also people who had success by trying things that were never tried before , andd taking risks .
For example , Austrian psychologist Sigmund Freud , who is also called father of psychology by some experts , tried a lot of new things , claimed many new things about the human psychology , and founded the school of `` psychoanalysis '' .
He added new terms to the literature of psychology like ; id , ego , superego and defense mechanisms .
He tried his own methods with his clients , and certainly was very successful at that .
There are many theories whics have their basis in psychoanalysis , and many theories were constructed in opposite to pschoanalysis .

To summarize , I believe that it is the person that becomes successful , no matter what his \ her way is .
If he or she has the strength and puts enough effort , there is no reason not to be successful .
Just have faith in yourself , and and you are half way away to being successful .
