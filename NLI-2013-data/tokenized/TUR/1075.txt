I think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
First of all I can have idea for a lot of thing .
If you specialize in one specific subject you can only talk about it .
Hovever if you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can talk about a lot of things .

I want to have idea for a lot of academic subject always .
When I was in secondary school I have a teacher who have idea for everything .
I want to be like him .
He was also the most popular teacher in my school .
All of the students love him and also all of the teachers love him .
May be this is the most important reason having broad knowledge of many academic subject for me .
Also i have lots of reason for it .
I want to be a person who can talk everything .

Some people can say to specialize one subject is better than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
May be it is good for talking your special subject but the others ?
You can not say any about other subjects .
For example in my university there are lots of profesor can not say anyting about other academic subjects .
Most of my friend do n't want to be profesor because of this reason .
They think if you specialize in one specific subject you can not say any about other subjects .

I want to explain my idea about having broad knowledge of many academic subjects or specializing one specific subject .
Also having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better for me .
If you have broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can talk about a lot of things .
Do n't you want to be perfect ?
