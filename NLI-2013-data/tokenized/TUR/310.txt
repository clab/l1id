The humankind always needs to take risks to reach good life standarts .
Therefore taking risks is a very important aspect of humans life .
Succesful people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Some people think its really good idea but on contrary to those some people think that its not a good idea .
I personally agree with the first idea , these are my following reasons .

Firstly , taking risk is a good idea because if you want to do something well you should take a risk .
If you want to earn more money you should get risks .
For example I read in the newspaper a businessman has a succesful company but he bought a new company although he doesnt know anything about it but now Its the well known company now .

Secondly , its your luck to being a succesfully about your business .
Taking risks always earn us something .
Sometimes you can lose but you shouldnt finish to taking risks in your life .
We can see that in our world who is the most rich or succesful man or woman came to these day with which risks theytook many years ago .
In my country everybody says `` If you dont think to take risks in your life you always be with the same forever '' and I really support that sentence .

Finally , all in all as I said before taking risks could improve our everything if we can do it succesfully .
Succesfully people should try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
But he or she should take care about his or her main thing which they can do succesfully , they only should take risk about it .
Because its important for them .
