To be a wise enough person people should know lots of thing from different fields .
However knowing everything is not possible even for the machines having a large capasity of memory .
In my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject because one may do not have a conclusion while dealing with details , it is not possible to be good in all fields , filling the memory is not necessary .

Firstly , if one tries to investigate and make a knowledge of many subjects then he will not have time to make his conclusion or even he may not have a conclusion .
If he specialize and investigate the other fields just when he need , then he must go in details so the possibility to have a conclusion is higher .
For instance , as an academic research area mathematics is so wide even in the branches .
It already takes so much time to learn one field .
If one tries to know all the details in other branches then it is impossible to have an article about his research .

Secondly , it is impossible to be an expert in every fields .
Finally , human memory is not so wide to keep everything .
The things that is not used anymore will be deleted after a time .
So filling the memory with the things that will not be used is unnecessary , since it is not necessary to know everything .

In conclusion , it is better to work on a specific subject than to work on many subjects .
