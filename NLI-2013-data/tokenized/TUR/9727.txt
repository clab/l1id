I believe that this statement holds a great deal of truth .
To be successful , we must get rid of our tunnel-visioned outlook on life , and open ourselves up to new challenges .

I see success as a relative concept .
Upon achieving a goal , I may belive that I have succeeded , yet someone else may see my success as quite ordinary and dull .
This is due to the fact that each and every individual sets their goals differently from one another .

I can recall many moments in my life when I had the opportunity to try new things .
Unforunately , I can also recall moments when these opportunities were not taken .
One of these distinct memories is of the track and field competition that was held annualy at my school .
Every year , my friend Alexander and I participated in the same races because we were used to them .
I would always come first in the long jump , and Alexander would be first on the short-distancd sprints , since he suffered from asthma and could not take the longer-distanced races .

Year after year , the races were the same for me and Alexander , and our triumphant victories over the other particpants seemed to become trite as the years passed .
After the fourth year , it did not seem like a success to us .
It lost its element of surprise and astonishement .

When the fifth year came , I was sure we would participate in the same races , which by that time , seemed more boring to us that a four hour TOEFL exam .
However , I was surprised to see Alexander sign up for the one kilometer race .
I asked him what would happen if his asthma kicked in .
I will never forget his reply .
`` The only way to succeed over my asthma , '' he said , `` is to challenge it with something new . ''

That year , Alexander did not come first on the race .
Yet he succeed .
How , you may ask .
He managed to come out victorious from his battle against his asthma , by trying something new and challenging .
I ended up getting my fifth gold medal for the long run competition .
Now I urge you to ask yourself .
Did I succeed , or did Alexander succeed ?
