Traveling in a group led by a tour guide have advantages and disadvantages .
First , people who travel with group by a tour guide can learn many information from a tour guide .
In addition , they can improve their knowledge about places which they visited .
Second , it is opportunity to make new friends in a group .
Furthermore it is enjoyable talking and seeing new places with other people .
Because of different opinions about new places , people can share their ideas and enjoy with a group .
On the other hand , traveling in a group can be stressful because people must think other people and listen a tour guide .
They can not be more independent .

I prefer traveling with my family because i feel more comfortable when i see new places and show my opinion .
I deem that i can learn information about places with traveling in agroup led by tour guide .
On the other hand , my family say about the historical places and its information .
We are more dependent and if we are getting the place , we can change our way to other place .
In my country , Turkey , people usually prefer to travel in a group led because it is less expensive then traveling with their families but it is more stressful and exhausting .
Furthermore , because of economic situations in Turkey , people can not effort to travel other contries or to travel with themselves .

In conclusion , i would like to travel with my family and my friends eventhough it is expensive in my country .
I have come to America by myself , now i struggle to learn information about America by myself .
