The Fake
The world is globlazing every day and this make people to aware of everything that happen in casual .
It is because of the communication through the television .
Firstly the television has a great place in people 's life .
When we come home from work , school or outside it is always in front of us and it affects us very deeply .
By the television some advertisements can be seen .
When something new was descovered that includes food drink or clothes its advertismenyts are always on the television and that makes people consider about buying that .
It is clearly understood that people are more interested in the products that they see on the television .
If the advertisement producers make the advertisement very successfully people starts to admire to those products .
For instances When my family goes to shopping , they buy familiar things and those that they see on the television screen .
I am definitely agree statement about the advertisements that product seem much better than they really are .
Even if the materials are poor for use the advertisements convince people to buy it and show them charming .
For example last year there was an advertisement about shampoo .
It was unknown and the its first year of the company .
When i saw the shampoo on the television i really intented to buy it because it seems not only attractive but also popular beacuse it is known by everybody .
Unfortunately when i used it many times i concluded that it is only seen better in shape not in use .
After that i shared that event with my friends and almost all of that agreed to me and now all of us are careful while shopping .

All in all , as i explained that above , i agree the following statement .
People normally cares the visuality but when they use it they understand their fault .
To my mind people should be think two times when they buy something and they should not belive in attracted advertisements .
