Although it may seem like young people do not contribute to the development of their society as much as in the old days , I strongly believe the opposite .
In my opinion , daily life and social issues have become so interrelated that it is difficult to distincly see the youth 's contribution to his/her society .
Consequently , youngsters help their communities in the form of joining social affiliations , taking active role in political discussions and even working while they take part in educational activities .

One way that youngsters contribute to the well-being of their society is through community work they do in their free time .
It is possible to see many university students voluntarily participating in clubs where they have the opportunity to help children , people with disabilities and people who are in need .

Another solid example of youth 's contribution to the society is their desire in expressing their political opinions and taking the necessary action .
In my opinion , a strong society is the one in which politics can exceed the walls of the parliement .
In the country where I live , young people form active groups to contribute to the well-being of their country .
Thus , their contribution cannot be neglected .

Finally , it is not so difficult to come across university even high school students working on part-time jobs .
To be more specific , half of my friends are both working and studying .
Considering the time they need to allocate for their studies , working while studying is not an easy task at all .
Thus , it should deserve the society 's appreciation .
By doing so , the youth makes a significant contribution to the economy of their community .

There are various examples suggesting that the youth is still actively helping their community .
Thus , it would be wrong to thing that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
It is just that they do it in a different manner than the usual .
