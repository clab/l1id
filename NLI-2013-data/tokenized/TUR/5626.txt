The humankind always should invent and use new products to be the modern person therefore using new products is an impotant aspect in humankind 's life because it could harm the humankind .
I personally do n't agree with idea of making the product advertisements much better than they really are .
These are my following reasons .

First of all , The humankind always need to intelligent in different situations but not selling the bad product with a very nice advertisement to sell more than they plan to .
All the people would like the product advertisements which are most of lie .
For example , I have listened and watched to an advertisement of a new toothpaste that showing the new product as a very efficient thing for your mouth health .
But when I had listened to the radio I have figured out that the new product is a just typical toothpaste that do n't have any additional ingredients rather than the regular toothpastes .
In my opinion Humankind should do more important things that could develop our generation rather than selling typical products with good advertisements .

In addition to this , The humankind should'nt believe to the advertisements that are not lying on proofs , For example , A person wants to buy a shampoo that he has got used to but he sees a new product that is the half price of the shampoo he got used to , Would n't he just try out once because of the price no matter his or her budget is .
In my opinion we all do try it once before we buy the product wer used to buy .
This is a very efficient point that a lot of people have been missing or ignoring .
Not only the money but also the power of it could do whatever the product owners do .
For example , Have you ever seen an expensive new product in markets .
The new products are always the products which are cheaper than a dozen .

The last but at least is that the most important thing we should not ignore is education level of the people because of believing the new product 's advertisements .
It has been always a stereotype that the cheap new products have no difference with regular products .
In my opinion if the humankind needs and wants to reach higher , they should educate the people rather than telling them lies about unnecessary product advertisements .
Not only this generation or the next but also a lot of generation is going to live in this world .
That 's why we should start to change our attitudes to reach higher .
I 'm not telling that people should not do things such as these advertisements , They should do with in a circle of limits .

All in all as I said before , Humankind have more important things than making advertisements for new products to make them better than they really are with advertisements which could be the most efficient aspect to catch people 's eye on .
The long and short of it is that the humankind should be interested in more important things rather than advertisements .
