The statement asserts that young people enjoy life more than elderly people do .
Many individuals believe that young people have a lot of energy and opportunities to enjoy life .
Some individuals think age is not important to get satisfaction from life .
I agree that person do not need more energy for enjoying life .
Also for me , age is not important and the important thing is person 's mind .

First , you can be twenty years old , but you can not find anything about enjoying life .
Who can help you ?
Person 's own belief is very important for enjoying and being hapinness .
If person thought he \ she is very old to enjoy life , everything finishes there .
For example , my granddad enjoys life more than me .
Because I am very pesimistic about my life but my granddad enjoys life in every situation .

Second , elderly people have alot of experiences about enjoying life .
For example , I can not create a lot of opportunities for my self but my dad can find activities easier than me .
He starts to stupid things for me but for him they are very extreme events .

Third , young people seek a lot of reasons for enjoying life .
For example , I can not get satisfaction easily from every result but my mom can be happy and enjoy life with very small things .

In conclusion , people ' mind are very important to enjoy life .
One disadvantage for young individuals they do not have many experiences to get satisfaction .
Second one is young people look for many details for being happy .
