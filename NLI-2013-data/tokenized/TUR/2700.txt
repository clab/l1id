Do the young people enjoy life more than older people ?
My answer is exactly no beacuse of two reasons ; One of the reasons is that the life is so hard to understand to young people because of their lack of experiment and education .
And the understanding the life can raise the taste that you take from it .

The other reasons is that you can know about yourself much when you get older , and if a person knows about himself/herself enough , this maturity gives him/her a chance to rule on him/her life in a more correct way , so they can enjoy their life more than the others .

Knowledge about life and about ourselves .
I think that they are the keys of happinies .
Socrat , the famous greek philosopher , says that `` know him/herself '' .
I think this advise is explain the most important thing in humans life .
