I agree to the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
The modern world has many commodities that keep youngsters away from doing something charitable , or even doing something for themselves or their families .
The TV , internet , video games , and extended means of entertainment blur the eyes of the young population , making them blind and deaf toward their environment .

The concept of free time nowadays have reduced to home and outdoor environment .
The young people are not motivated to do something useful during their free time .
By media , commercialization and more attractive means of entertainment they are kept unaware of things that go on with the community .
For instance , you cannot see a single young person in a retirement home today , unless they are forced to go by law or family .
This is because they are both unaware and unwilling to perform community work .

Another reason is that they do not give enough time to communities is that no means of authority advises , encourages or requires them to do community work .
They are merely ignorant individuals who are unaware of what is going on in the community they live in .
Charity work is shown as something irrational , giving no individual benefit and taking up a lot of useful time that can be spent on other things .

As far as the competitive educational system and technological improvements in entertainment industry goes , these young people will be less and less involved with their community .
If the parents keep on reminding their children that academic success is their sole responsibility , - which is not - they will be less involved .
Unless something is done by parents or the governments , the next generations will be less sensitive , more selfish and an asocial which are traits no human being should adopt .
