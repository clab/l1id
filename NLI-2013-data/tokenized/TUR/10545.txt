THE WAY OF SUCCESS
The answer to this question depends on your own experiences and the succesful people that you know .
For me , if a person wants to become more successful , he or she obviously take some risks and try new things .
Risks are the way of the succes .

Firstly , by taking risks , you can make your position higher or earn much more money .
People can learn new lessons and ways , gain a lot of experiences by only taking risks , making mistakes and trying new things .
For example , my father who is a really successful manager in a big company had a lower position , an engineer who earns really less money for working a lot , when he first started to work .
Then , he made a big decision for changing his destiny .
He and my family moved to a foreign city without any information and experiences .
I did not know this place and also I had never heard anything about it like my family .
It was a big change for me and my father .
However , this important risk affected my fathers carreer in a successful way .
If he did not decide to do it , maybe he would not become a manager as he is now .
It is really important to make right directions in situations .

Secondly , nobody can become better if he does not take risk and try new things .
This is a strict rule of life .
Succesful commanders , generals , presidents always take some risks and try nwe things .
For illustrating it , Ataturk , the saviour of my country , is an extraordinary example .
He took some critical risks to be success in First World War .
Our army was weaker and smaller than our enemies .
However , Ataturk and the army attacked some really important times .
It was a huge risk but by taking those risks , my country is a free one .

In conclusion , we should take some risks and try new ways in some moments of our life because human life span is relatively short .
It is the way of success .
