Actually , for some points I agree with the statement , and for some points I do n't .
Because , in my opinion , ` ideas and concepts ' and ` facts ' are two interrelated issues that can not be seperated .
I will explain this statement with some examples .

For instance , we can think about history .
In history , there are many facts which had also results that affected the world in a positive or negative way .
From a closer past , the war in Iraq will be a good example for a fact .
Of course , there are ideas and concepts behind this war , however , ` the actual war ' which is occuring has more significance .
If we are aware of this fact , if we know it , we can do something to stop it .
Ideas and concepts that will be thought as solutions , come after this realization of the situation .
Another example for history will be the agreements , negotiations between different countries .
These are facts to be known because they them are made at a specific time and some of them come to the present day .

As another example , from a different field , we can consider art and architecture .
Both of these areas create artifacts , art products .
But beyond that , they produce ` concepts ' , ` ideas ' and use the intellectual background of an individual ( trying to mean the artist , or the architect ) .
So , what affects an individual ?
The medium that he/she comes from , the different thoughts of philosophers , thinkers he / she pursued .
For instance , we can think about Leonardo da Vinci or Michel Foucault , or Frank Llyod Wright , or Zaha Hadid , and so on ...
Still , professionals are discussing their ` facts ' , which I understand as their art objects , books , or artifacts .
The purpose of these discussions is to figure out the main idea , the concept of the people .
Having any idea about these people leads them , encourages them to find out their own conceptual capacities .

In the light of these two examples from different fields , I want to emphasize that understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts have both equal importance for the students .
They are not free from each other , rather , they both depend on and affect each other .
A new idea comes from knowing the facts - and others ' opinions as well , and facts are results of specific ideas and concepts .
