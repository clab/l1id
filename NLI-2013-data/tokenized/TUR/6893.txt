Although the other transparation vehicles like trains , planes and ships are improving the percentage of usage of them , in the future I strongly believe that the numbers of the cars will be more than today .

Because , a car is a need for a person today like air , food and water .
All of the people try to have a house and a car for a better life .
A car makes life more simple that you can go everywhere without waiting any other vehicle when you need .
You can go your work , shooping and other social activities you wish .
This situation leads to gain time , so you do not lose time for waiting .
Today , time is the most important thing in a modern people life .
Therefore , people prefer to have cars to gain time and making life more easier and comfortable .
This event shows that people will continue to have cars in the future , too .
The population of the world is increasing day by day , so more people means more cars will be in the future .

A second reason about the fees of the car .
Today , there is a big computation between the cars producers .
All of them try to produce a better and chaper car .
That computation causes to decrease the fees of the cars .
Therefore , people who have not enough money to take car , can buy a car because of the low prices .
Another reason may be about the technology .
In the future technology can leads to us to drive flying cars .
Flying cars can destroy all the disadvantages of a normal car like tarffic problem or traffic accident .
Today , most of the people rather to use metro or ships to travel because of the trafiic problem and accidents .
If in the future scientists will be successful making flying cars , then people can prefer to use cars instead of trains and ships .

As a result of these reasons , I think in the future the number of the cars will be more and people will continue to use cars effeciently and affectively .
