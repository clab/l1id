I am definitely not agree with the idea that asserts older people can not enjoy life as young people do .
I will explain my reasons of course .
First of all , I believe that older people know a lot about life .
They have a lot of experience about life .
This gives them a very significant advantage on doing the right things .
It means that they can do the proper things to enjoy .
They do not vaste time to see if something is enjoyable or not .
Because they know what is fun , they will just do the things they like .

Second , although many people believe that older people does not enough energy as young people , this is not something totally true .
If an older person take care of herself or himself then there is no need to worry about .
Older people can do anything that they want , provided that it is safe .
Of course some things may have some risks , but do not forget that the young people also have these risks .

Third , enjoying the life does not need to have the same meaning to everybody .
Different people like different things .
It is not something releated with age .
While some people may find the literature as enjoyable , some other may not .
For example , I am not crayz about football , but my little brother is getting mad at playing and watching football even just seeing the players .
On the contrary , despite my love of literature , he has no interest on this .
There is not a generation gap between us .
There is only two-year gap .
In my opinion it reveals that age is not important to enjoy something .
If a person wants to enjoy something , he or she will definitely find a way .

To sum up , as I tried to explain above , I do n't think that age matters in enjoying life .
It is not the age that making the things enjoyable or not , but characters of people that makes the world enjoyable .
If you want to enjoy the life , take my word for it , there are limitless opportunities to do so .
It is up to you .
