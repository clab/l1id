`Getting Proffesional ' is a trendy term which is used for the specialization in academic communities .
It is also popular in European Unioun education system , which demands the specialization focused programs from the universities of member countries .

However , one could always argue that the variety of a education system is more important than the proffesinal based education / I agree on that type of system because my educatinal background depends on variety of different subjects .
such as communication , science , technology and social sciences .
I espcially want to mention highlight one of these subjects which is called ` Science , Technology and Society ` .
My aim of emhasizing this topic is to point out the variety and importance of multidisciplinary subjects of modern education systems , the disiplines which provide a huge scale of information that the professinal world demands form the gratuates .

For instance , by studying such kind of program , you automatically increase the numbers of sector opprtunies that you can find a job .
Moreover , it provides a wider world view and accordingly a better vision of handling the problems and eliminating the handicaps .
In this case , if you have a problem at the factory you work you could always search the mechanical problems but at the sametime you could seize the social reasons about the workers , working schedule or the management , Whereas this mwthod sound reallt proper for the demands of though busise All in all , I believe as a result of living in a modern age , we face with lot complicated problems that we should deal with .
As a result , the complex education systems are the only solutions to satisfy the multifurios needs of moderniy and modern humanity .
