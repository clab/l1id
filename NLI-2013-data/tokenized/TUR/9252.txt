Nowadays , countries put high importance on education .
With globalization , government ' s aim is to give children a good knowledge about the world , ability to evaluate events and prapare them as the future world citizens .
For that , it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
The three advantages of understanding the content and the ideas are being open-minded , ability of questionning and ability to criticising .

Being open-minded is possible with having a meaningful point of view about the world that we live in .
Sharing different ideas with the help of the communication helps us to create empathy between people .
Understanding ideas of different people helps to see the wisdom of human mind .

Ability of questionning comes with the ability of understanding concepts .
Not accepting just the facts but questionning them prepares students for a global education in order to search the universal truths .

Ability of criticising is another important reason to achieve for students in order to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
Criticism improuves the point of views of people with the help of communication .

In the end , I can say that there are several reasons for that I agree that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
Briefly , these are the three of them ; the importance of being open-minded , the advantages of questionning and criticising coming with the ability of understanding the ideas and concepts .
