I believe that it is better to have broad knowdledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
By this way , we will be able to talk about many subjects when it is necessary , it will be more fun to learn new things rather than focusing on only one thing and it will be much more easier to focus on one subject in the future when you have some knowdledge about all subjects .

People are usually more likely to respect to a person who have some knowdledge about any of the topics .
In my opinion , everyone should be able to add something to the conversation when there is a discussion .
If we have a broader knowdledge , this will make us more privileged .
At the same time , we will easily adopt ourselves to the conversation compared to the one who is specialized in one subject , because we have a basis of that informatin before .

On the other hand , it will be much more fun to learn new things about different subjects .
Because humanbeings are more likely to learn new things and this will help us develop ourselves .
In the process of learning , different topics are usually much more successful to grab people 's attention .

What 's more , specializing in one subject is the next step of having broad knowdledge about different subjects .
First of all we should all become familiar with different academic subjects .
We should study many subjects briefly and try to gain some information .
After that , according to our interest we should determine the area that fits best to our interest .

Finally , we can sum that learning deeper about one subject , specializing , is the part which comes after having broader knowdledge about many academic subjects .
At the first glance , you do n't need deeper knowdledge .
After practicing many subjects simply , it would be easier to choose the subject that you should specialize .
