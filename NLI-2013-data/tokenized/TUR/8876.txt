It is more important for the students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
My reason is memorazing a bunch of facts about a topic will not able to indentify and clearly understand the concept of the subject would be awful for the student .

On the other hand only learning the facts about the subject the student only know about the coclusions .
They always spend their times for memorazing the informations because of this many important hour for human life spend for nothing .
The most important thing is understand the idea and the concepts .

In my hometown , many of high schools ' students have to pass an exam which is called OSS which is for apply the university .
The stundent responsibles of the four yerars high school educations .
The problem is you have to memorize lot of facts and details about the questions .
The details which she or he will forget after some decades days later .
This situation shows that facts of students take the exam and they spend a lot of moneys and hour for nothing it was onlly about the pass the exam and a result of this preparation courses do not give a chence improve the your knowledge .

In my opinion the students must be aducated in a traning which enables them to use their potentioanl about the subject .
This kid of work gives a chance them to understand the ideas and concepts of work .
In addition to this in an effective learning sytems for example learning with activities , diagrams , and traning useful for the students .

The students could choose their courses to understand the ideas of the subjects and concets , because if the student wants to study abour for his or her master learniong facts doesnt help him or her .
