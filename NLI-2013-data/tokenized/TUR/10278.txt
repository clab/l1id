Every people would like to be succesful in order to reach their aims which would differ person to person in terms of the place of domicile , education , likes and disilkes .
The desire to be succesful makes people find out different ways to reach their goal that some prefer taking risks and trying to find out what kind of things would be prefferable in order to make more money , taking different kinds of self improvement courses or self conciousness courses .
On the other hand some prefer to do the things they have a know-how and try to make them better in this thing which they beleive they will reach their goal .

Business life is a hard place to stay stable and to be successful constantly because there are plenty of criteria to get into a job and qualifications which the employees seek for , for instance ; the ability to be a good negotiator , being socially and verbaly strong annd dynamic .
some people have soe of these qualifications that they try hard to take a good educaton and some have personal skills from birth and some take courses in order to improve themselve .

Risk is an important character in business life that you may get the return of it or you may loose everything .
some people likes risks and enters in to new ways in oder to be successful on the other hand some people are risk averse and do not take many risks in order not to go bankrupt , for instance .
I disagree that `` successful people try new things and take risks '' because I think it depends on the character of the person liking risks or being a risk averse .

I beleive that if a person do not like risks and has a know-how about something and beleives that he/she can be better in this field by working a lot and searching new strategies or taking lessons about that topic .
Working and trying hard for a task which a person does best and deepening about that topic would be beneficial for this person to be successful .
