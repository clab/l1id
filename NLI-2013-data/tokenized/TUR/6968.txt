I do not agree with the statement that the number of cars will be smaller in number in near future than they are today .
It is evident that the traffic within the city center is getting worse each day and the public transportation is gaining increasing importance .
Especially around big cities , like Istanbul which I am living in , it is true that people are increasingly avoiding car usage due to the above mentioned reasons and have the tendency to use public transportation or taxi etc. instead , which might lead one to think that the number of cars will decrease in time .
However ; there are other dimensions of the subject .

First of all , even if some people are becoming increasingly reluctant to use their cars in city , most of them still feel it necessary to have one .
The reasons vary .
One could be privacy , which you cannot have with public transport .
The other could be availability ; all of us have experienced not being able to find a taxi when you have an important appointment .
Your car is always at your service and is actually a medium for independence .

Besides , the increased number of suburban living areas makes the people living there almost totally dependent on cars as public transportation is wider and more frequent around city centers .
Finally , due to increased technology and the saturation level of the market , cars come to the consumers at lower costs when compared to past .
The companies are extending product ranges to cover the maximim number of consumers within a wider range of economic status .
Therefore cars are more affordable and also convenient to use compared to last two to three decades .
I think these improvements will continue with an accelarated speed and cars will reach a wider range of population .
Even if the frequency of the usage of an individual car might decrease , I think the total number of cars in use could only increase during the next twenty years regarding the above mentioned reasons .
