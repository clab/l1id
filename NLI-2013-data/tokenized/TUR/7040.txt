There are advantages and disadvantages of cars .
I 'll be discus advantages and disadvantages of cars .

First we look advantages of cars .
Cars are important and they give us the power of transportation at the time we want .
And also car creats a private place like houses .
Cars are flexible .
For example , if i want to go holiday now , i can use my car and i do n't need to wait any bus or train .
They are protect us crowded of mass tranportation .
And using a car gives freedom feeling .
When you drive your car , you feel that you can go everywhere .
Now new technologies are created and cars are going to more echonomic .
New cars are working with natural sources like electicity and they are friend of nature .
They work more slience .
They are building with recycleble and stronger materials .
Car porduces thinks drivers safety and modern cars are very safe .
In 20 years cars will be more trustable and safer than today .

On the other hand , mass transportation rising .
Lots of people uses mass transportation and every day more people uses mass transportation .
The people choose it because save lots of time it is faster than using own car and it is more echonomic .
There lots of alternative , for example train , bus , metro .
They save us the trafic caos .
If i want to go center of city i choose always metro because it is very hard to drive car in traffic and driving car takes more time .
One more disadvantage of cars , they rise up the pollution level .
Cars are more dangerous than mass transportation .
There are lots of people dies every day because of human errors .
May be future cars will be more trustable but there will be always human factor .
Human makes errors very easy .

Finally , i agree the topic .
people will see the advantages of mass transportatin and disadvantages of cars .
i also think that in twenty years there will be fever cars in use than there are today ...
