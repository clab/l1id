In the world , there are so many cars that people can use them for transportation .
It is necessary because of illness .
When one of family members becomes ill , she needs a car .
That 's why , ambulance may not come immediately .
However , cars may not be used in the future because people do n't want to use them such as telecommuting , air pollution and price .

To begin with , telecommuting is important for people because people will want to work these kinds of jobs .
Thus , they do n't need to use their cars ; that 's why , they work at home .
They also do n't go out for this reason .
Moreover , telecommunication supplies people with reducing traffic jam .
As long as people work these works .
There are n't any taffic problems since many accidents may happen for this reason .

In addion to telecommuting , air pollution is a real big problem for us because people may want to prevent air pollutin for many reasons .
Automobile gases are terrible and expand bad smells .
People can affect them in a negatively .
Furthermore , people want to live healty without automobile gases .
I think that goverment use this reason in order to decrease cars on the roads .

Besides telecommuting and air pollution , cars are expensine because technology .
When we looked at he past , cars are more developed than the past .
Also , prices are so expensive that people can not buy a car .
This is a good reason to go down automobiles for the future .
Moreover , For instance , I work a job , but my earning is not enough to buy a car .
Hence , I can not afford to buy the most developed cars .

In conclusion , In the future , I think that people do n't want to purchase automobiles as a result of these reasons .
Therefore , people should prevent these problems .
I consider no cars and no problems for future .
