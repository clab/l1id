Advertisements are the most common and colorful part of our lives in the 21st century .
Everyday another selection for a material is made or invented and coming to our TVs or newspaper pages to show us his advantages .
people have different ideas about the issue that most adverstisements make products seem much better than they really are .
Some think that it is right others think that it is a wrong way of thinking .
I 'm personally agree with the firt ones .

First of all , advertisements make the products seem bigger .
Every advertisement is a little circus show to make you believe that ` this one ' is the ` one ' that you have been looking for since your childhood .
To make you believe they will try every method , especially do not believe in the size of the product in the television .
For example last year a newspaper begin to promote a tape .
The tape was the best that I have ever seen , I mean ` the tape of my life ' .
I ordered the product and when the box came to my home I was really amazed , however , there was a little problem ; the tape was more little than I saw it in the advertisement .

Secondly , most advertisements make the audience believe that the product is cheaper .
The life in big cities like my own is very expensive to live .
So , I am really careful about spending my money and always looking for the prices of the materials that I will buy and I am always looking for the information on prices in the advertisements .
For the 20th birthday of my best friend I promised her to buy the dress that we saw in the magazine together .
In the adverstisement it was not looking so expensive .
I was thinking like that until I went the store to buy it .
It was much more expensive than we read .

Lastly , advertisements make the material seem more useful .
For instance , a friend of mine who has a kilo problem , began to use a material advertised as a ` losing calorie miracle in 3 months ' , it has been 6 months and she is not looking lose much more than only 1 kilo ...
The product seem her much more useful than she experienced .
Thus the information told by advertisers is not so accurate and convincable .

All in all , adverstising a product is something made to show that it is the best that you 've ever seen .
So , the advertisers will try to fascinate the audience and by making the stuff seem better than it really is , they reach their goals .
The products shown in the advertisement can be smaller , more expensive and less useful than it is seem to you .
