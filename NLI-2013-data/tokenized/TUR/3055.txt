Old people enjoy life more than younger people do .
I think age of people does not affect the enjoy that they can take from life in a negative way .
The most important fact that affects the level of the enjoy they get from life is the characteristics of people .
According to me , the enjoy depends on that the person is social or not .
A young person who is not social may not enjoy from life as older people do .
A social person at older ages can be a member of social clubs , attent to touristic journeys or join to social activities .
However , unsocial young person can stay at home and do nothing except eating , drinking and sleeping which are only the basic activities of a human being can do .

An advantage of old people possess in enjoying more than young people is the age .
Age can be thought as a limiting fact at first ; nevertheless , if we thought more we can realise that it is not .
Young people should work hard to earn their life in economic means and for their career .
They should also spend their time with their families .
In short , they have limited time for too much acivities or duties .
In contrast , old people have no limiting time problems .
They do not to think about their life , their work and their family , since their life is at a stable phase .
On the otherhand , young people have a lot of stress source which decreases or limits the enjot they get from life .
Moreover , their economic status maybe better than the young people .
They can have enough money to spend in social activities .

Another advantage of old people for enjoying life more can be experience .
As they live more than young people , they can easily find anything to enjoy .
For instance , they can go to a holiday instead of palying card games with their friends .

However , one can say that there are several disadvantages for old people to enjoy from life .
Health and old ages are inhibiting agents of enjoying life .
Old people can have sicknesses more than younger people .
In addition , old ages can restrict them to do certain activities like sport activities .
Nevertheless , an old but social person can find alternative activities according to his or her age .

In conclusion , I believe that the age of a people does not defines the level of enjoy that they can get from life .
Furthermore , old ages can provide more opportunity to people to enjoy more from life .
