For students to become successful in the future when they graduate from school and pursue their career in different fields , I beleive understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts .

The facts related to history and politics tell us what happened in the past and we can use those facts to compare the new situations to those that happened in the in the past .
Similarly the scientific facts such as quantum theory helps scientists build up their work based on these facts .
However , being able to use ideas and concepts are much more important when we face new situations .

Especially in today 's competitive environment , we need to make decisions that will help us become successful in tough business areas .
Most of the times our ability to make judgement for a situation comes from our knowledge about different ideas and concepts .
Learning these things in school will give us the tools we need to use in the business world when we graduate .
The facts wo n't help us much when we face a situation where we need to make a decision .
We need to understand what consequences may occur as a result of our decisions and how our decision will affect the future .
To be able to understand this we need to be able to have analytical skills so that we have a good decision making process .
I believe that this is accomplished only by understanding ideas and concepts .

In my home country , the educational system is based mostly on facts not on concepts .
We learn the facts with details in colleges but I do not think this prepares young individuals to use their judgements in the business environment where decision making plays an important role .
Especially in today 's competitive environment I beleive that making the students ready for business life is much more important than just teaching them the facts .
