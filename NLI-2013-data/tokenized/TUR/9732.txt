I am a business guy .
So i take risks .
In my opinion , everybody has to take risk in their lifes .
But risk is risk .
So you can not make sure if you take it , it is going to be good for you or not .
No body can know that .

I can give an example about my uncle who was one of famuous importer in my country , which is Turkey .
As i said , he was a big importer and he was bringing fruits from other countries such as , USA , Peru , Chili etc .
He had been in that job for about 10 years before he decided to change his goods what he was bringing .
Actually he did n't change basicly .
But he started to bring more tropycal fruits such as ; pineapples , kiwi etc. rather then the others ..
But he had not thought that if you want to change something in company you have to think all changing .
For example of his company is that company had to buy new vehicles for carriying fruits .
Because those new fruits more sensetive then he used to bring .
It is a big problem for company cause of these vehicles are expensive .
Beside that , they did not have any experiences about new fruits .
They did not know how do they have to do keep them or how long they can keep .
Some more problems and then everything was going bad .

I am not telling do not take risks .
If i was he , I would do that as he did .
But if we want to do thing , we should think about everything .
I love this phares '' the only thing not change is changing '' .
So we need to change something and while we change , we have to take risks , Whatever i am in future i will always take risks .
Because i believe in that taking risks is the most importent thing in life .
