we are living in crowded city and there are lots of cars .
transportion very important part of the city life because we chance place so many times during the day .
for my self I am almost getting crazy with that crowd .
we have to solve this problem , we are getting aware to emergency of this situation .
I agree with this statment .
there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
because this traffic proplem can be remain like that and also petrol sources reduce day by day , we have to find another source for transportion and every thing .

Most of the government try to attact people attantion to the importance of public transport .
I think it is easy way to solve this problem , if they use the public transport there wont be any traffic jam and people can go to job an time besides there will not be air pollition at all .
in the traffic jam people 's car became unseful things .
because there is no point to buy a car .
if you ca n't go to anywhere why you have a car .
in this point I think people will change to their minds about car and start to use more public transport .

I have another reason to sopport this statment that is limits of petrol source .
none of the source we can use for ever that is why we have to find other sourge , new source will change the way of transportion and maybe in twenty yearys we wo n't use car .
instead of car we can use electrical machine , I think these days we use one of them , that is underground .
it is a first pattern of the alternative transportion .

Consequently , I belive that there will be fewer car than there are today .
Actually this is some kind of obligation because limits of the source and cars not very useful at all .
I hope we can find new way that is less cause to air pollition .
