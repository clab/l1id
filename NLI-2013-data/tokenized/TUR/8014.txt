As people who lived long time ago said the best way to travel is hanging alone even though it is risky .
I am really disagree about traveling in a group led by a guide for several reasons that are getting a book that is about where you are traveling instead of tour guide and being so relax during the trip insted of depending on someone .

In my opinion , is it really hard to get a book that explains everything what you need ?
i dont think so it is really hard cause you can get a guidebook from aven simple gas station .
For example , there is a movie that is named Euro Trip is really funny but also it is really educated cause in the movie there was a guy whose name is Alex who got all knowledge about historical places in Italy .
Anyway they went to alot of diffrent places in italy and they were themself ovar there because of alex .
The important thing is one of the guy who has been working as a guide boy for 10 years was so suprised cause alex knew averything even though he had not been there before .
So people can get all knowledge from the books instead of the tour guide .

The other important idea acoording to my side is traveling comfortable cause if there are are many people with you , they bother you all time , and also time is not going to be enough cause traveling with everbody is really slow .
For example , when i was in istanbul that has alot of historical places , i wanted to visit place that is named Topkapi .
Moreover , i was so angry during the visiting cause everybody was asking a lot of unimportant questions to the tour guide , so i couldnt see all those beautiful places .
Moreover , i had to change all my trip , retiming my plane , cause of the other people .

Finally , as my father said if there are many people in the same place , there are gonna be alot of problem in that place .
So even though there is no body with me during the trip i am sure i will be so happy alone cause i will do what i want .
