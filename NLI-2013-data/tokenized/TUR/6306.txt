Nowadays cars are the most common transportaion vechiles for human race .
The reasons for this fact are firstly cars are individualstic so you can use whenever you want .
Secondly it can be faster than public transportation .
Finally and absolutely cars are much more comfortable than any other vechiles .

But what are going to happen to cars in future ?
I think in future the cars will be use less often than today .
There are too many reasons for this opinion .
For example in my country the number of cars are increasing but the roads ca n't be enough for this much cars and the drivers are exhausted about traffic jam so they start to think about getting rid of their cars and using public transport .
Furthermore I think the biggest problem is gasoline prizes .
They are getting higher and higher so one day we might not be afford to buy any .
These are the socio-economic disadvantages of using cars .

Also there are different possibilities to make cars less important and less usable .
Technology is growing so fast and scientsit can make faster trains , faster planes and the stations and airports are becoming more comfortable places and the tickets for more comfortable transportation are n't as high as they were before .
By this way using plane is n't a luxury anymore .
Furthemore technology might make a flying cars like in science-fiction movies .
i think this is n't a waiting for too much because 40 years ago automatically openning doors were utopia in books or movies but they are real and common now .
So maybe someday we will travel by flying on ourselves not in planes .

In conclusion by the developing of technology and the socio-economis difficulties of having cars makes us to find alternative ways to transport .
Even now cars are very popular that does n't mean that it will go on like that .
New discoveries will make cars unpopular but this will take long time .
