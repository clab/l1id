A person is succesful because the person has different skills than an average person has .
I believe that succesful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
Successful pople are open minded , and they experience new things to improve their skils .

First of all , successful people have wide horizons , and They have no limits .
They try all types of new things so these new things make the people achieve succes in their life .
For instance , Bill Gates is a successful person .
He had a broad horizons , and created the microsoft .
He had an idea to create an application in order to improve people 's lives .
His work in technology made people gain some extra time in their work .

Second of all , people who like to experiment new things reach succes in life .
Successful people should have new ideas , and these new ideas lead people to experiment .
Experimenting a new thing let other things to come out .
People with new experiments and new ideas help society to rise so these experiments positively affect the public as a whole .
for instance , the turkish leader Ataturk is a successful person .
He experiment new revolutions in Turkey .
He brought latin alphabet instead of the arabic alphabet , and also he let woman to vote in Turkey after he was chosen as a presedent .
His revolutions led Turkey to be secular country instead of being a religious country .
He made changes as whole in the public as a individual .

As a result , trying new things and be open minded lead people to success .
I believe succesful people have a mind that is very broad , and they can bring their dream true in life .
They can make possitive affect on the pei
