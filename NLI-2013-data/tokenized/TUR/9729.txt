TAKING RISKS

Mostly people are afraid to take risk in their lives .
They prefer to live in safe .
That 's why they do not want to change their conditions .
But in my opinion people should take some risks to improve themselves .
There are many people who are successful take a lot of risks .
So successful people try new things and take risks : although some peole think that they only doing what they already know how to do well .

First of all , risks and new things expand the vision of people , because every new thing and risk brings new experiences .
By this experiences people can meet with different conditions and solutions .
So their vision is changed according to their experiences .
For example ; my father is an engineer .
When he graduated he went to Germany for his intership .
He worked as a worker in a building .
During his intership , he experienced and analised how he could built a strong building .
Now he has own company which is related with building structures .

Opponent argue that , successful people only doing what they already know how to do well .
Good productions bring success .
For this people should know how to do and improve it .
In this way , they do not need to take risks or experience new things , because they can maintain this from books .
It is unlikely to be true .
Books are not enough for improvement , because they only include theoritical knowledge .
In practice , experience is more neccessary instead of theorical knowledge .
Also by taking risks and trying new things , people improve their experience .

To sum up , if people want to be successful , they should try new things and take some risk .
By this , they can improve their abilities such as problem solving ability .
According to their experience and vision , they create their own practical solutions .
