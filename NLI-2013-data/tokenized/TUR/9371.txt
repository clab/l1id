Some people think that its more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it is for them to learn facts .
I think thats something true .

I think knowing the main idea about something is very important .
It is useless knowing the fact without knowing the idea or the concept .
Having the knowledge of something is different .
Understanding the main points of thing and getting the concepts of them will get you to a point where they will be usable when you need them .
Having the idea of something makes that information usefull and gives it a value .
Because it means that something which has been learned , but not just taken in memory because of your teacher says you have to .
Getting the concept of something will be better because if the teacher asks you something about it and if you have only improved the result or the fact of it , it is quiate impossible for you to answer the question .
For example if you know the fact that the light will be on when you push the button , thats ok .
But if the teacher asks you why , it 's useless knowing the fact .
If you would have improved the main idea of light than it wont be a problem for you .

Never the less , having the knowledge of something will show you the facts eather way .
It is very important for you to understand the concept or the idea of something .
If you understand it , that means you can also understand the facts and the solutions of it .
For example , if you know how the light works that means the you can also permit the fact .
If you take a shower with a hair drier which is already on , its likely for you to burn .
Its all about knowing the main idea and getting the concept of it .

In conclusion , understanding ideas and conceps is far better than learning facts because knowing the main idea is very important and having the idea of something will show you the facts anyway .
At schools , the teachers should try to make clear the ideas but not only the facts to students .
