Albeit this is a possibility , I do not think that it is likely to occur .
there ara a couple of reasons which make me think in this way .
first of all , it is a very clear fact that the oil reserves we have today are coming to an end and probably in the very near future scarcity will be more apparent .

Even if the car producers find it still accurate to go on productin in this situation , they will have to sell it very expensive .
And this will affect the consumers .
They will think on the one hand the prices of oil necessray for dunnin the car and the on the other hand the price of the car .

It is nearly a common idea that in a near future alternative resourses will be used .

They like its comfort .
