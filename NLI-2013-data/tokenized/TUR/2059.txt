It seems that because of young ages and so more flexible bodies young people are enjoying life more than their parents or older people around them do .
It may be so , technically , but in fact not , at least not from what I have learned from my experiences .

First of all , young people are at the beginning of life .
They are just trying to collect the tools to explore a new , unknown and charming land .
So they are focused on constructing their lifes for their futures instead of living in present time and enjoying their experiences .
They have to go to a college or a university first of all to guarantee a sustainable living .
And preparing for all those exams and trying to cope with all unpleasant side effect such as stress , sleeping problems and depression is not so enjoying .
Going out with friends sometimes and getting into drinking rituels does not mean that they are pleased with their lives or they are enjoying life .
Because of the pressure of a comfortable future life , real life is forgotten .
To graduate from a college is even a problem because that is the end of your student life and you are now expected to find a good job and try to survive , you cannot depend on your parents from now on , nor your friends : you are completely alone in an unknown world .
You have to woork a lot , to be considered as a succesfull person for yourself and for the people near you , you should buy a car , and then a house .

Untill here , these are my experiences .
Here are my fathers ' and my mothers ' : My father has just retired , he is an actor and he worked for a state held theater organization more than thirty years .
He had to put off all his wishes and desires because his children were in college and they needed money .
But he does just what he wants now : he is travelling a lot to see different artistic performances in theater , he is working on his own plays , reading lots of books and he is passing three monts of the year along the sea coast in our summer residence in that unique environment in one side a forest , in another side the bluest sea of the world .
My mother also passes most of her time in our summer residence , where I hadnt seen for four years .
She goes out whenever she feels bored to the nearest theater to watch the coming films and it was ages ago when I last saw a film .
She sometimes visits my brother living in one of the most beautiful winter sports center of my country .

So , whenever I look at them , I feel that enjoying you life is a very very long experience , a gift perhaps , attained after so much struggles , or may be a sort of achievement and cannot be wholly understood by young people .
We are just at the beginning .
I hope that someday it will be our turn .
