The tecnology changes and effects our lives very quickly and very effectively .
Sometimes the changes are so good and sometimes they are not .
The tecnology invents lots of things that we never imagine before we saw them .

In twenty years , I think , many changes will occur .
Maybe we are gonna travel by planes to everywhere or our cars will be able to fly also ; who knows ? ..
I cannot say this can not be happen but I do not think this will be happen .
I do not agree with this statement .
Because most of the people prefer to use cars than any other transports .
Cars are the most common transports , I think .
Because almost everyone has an one , even , in a family every person has theirs own cars .

I do not think lots of years later this common transport is not gonna using .
And also there are plenty of cars races .
Most of the people like this racing and they want to drive a car like them , too .
For instance if you are driver in formula 1 or another organization like this you can not give up cars because you are really addicted to cars like a medical substance or medicines .
The life is for you the cars .

Moreover these vehicles are very usefull and economics than the others .
For instance the plane tickets are very expensive so you can not travel by a plane if you can not afford this .
And also if you want take your cars with you can do this .
But you can not take a yacth or something else like that .

In conclusion , cars are very usefull for our lives and so economic to affords theirs ' needs too .
