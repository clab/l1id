According to me successful people try new things and take risks .
If someone wants to be good at anything , he has to do something original .
original things take attention and people care about them For instance , let 's assume a group of students working on synthesizing a chemical compound that can be used as a drug for cancer .
Every student works on the synthesis without asking or questioning whether this compound is experienced before or analyzed in a laboratory .
In this case , if a student wants to analyze , this will differ him from the others .
This one asks the work and thinks the consequences of this synthesis and also questions whther it will be used practically .
The compound can not be used because of its structure or may not have the specialities to be used as a drug .

In spite of the fact that , questioning either the situations in which people are or the works which people do , provides some one to improve himself .
As in this example , the student who wants to analyse , besides synthesis , may learn about the analyzing methods .
This a simple purpose for improving himself .

From another aspect , everone can not take risks easily .
Generally people are afraid of the consequenses .
But on the other hand , by evaluating the advantages or disadvantages of a new way ( a new route to synthesis for instance ) or a different solution to a problem , may result sufficiently .

So trying another synthesis route may have risks .
Due to the fact that , the chemicals are difficult and dangerous to deal with , chemical reactions shoul be considered very carefully .
But with a good research a student can change the way of synthesis .

Finally , people have risks all the time in life .
To be succesful , people should take risks with cryticisizing every aspect .
In addition to that , Questioning leads to learn more .
In today 's world , the more knowledge , the more success .
Competition in every area force people to take risks and to improve themselves to survive .
In order to live in better conditions , people should try new things .
Unless they ` regenerate ' themselves , life can not be a place to live , to survive .
