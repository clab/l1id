There are some people who like adventure , to figure out everything by themselves which gives ythem self confidence of being able to do something by themselves without needing anybody .
There are other kind of people who like to be with in a group of people working through a lot of issues together .

The best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
i agree with that statement because the travel guide will guide you through your way in your trip .
This will save you a lot of times and there is no chance of getting lost where you do not know anything about .
There is a say in Turkey it says `` the shortcut to your destinationis the way that you know of '' what this says is that if you use the way that you do not know anything about you are more likely to get lost which will create extra time to get to your destination but if you use the way that you know it may increase the amount of time it will take to get there but not as much as in case when you get lost .

Especially in tours people usually go to new places to see the culture differences appereance of the new place .
you have no idea where are you and how to get back .
but if you have a tour guide even though you will not be able to go wherever you fell like going but you will go the safe places and be back on time .
tour group will help you out with the question you have in your mind about the place that you are visiting which actually will help you to leran something new , something about the place .

I strongly agree with the statement because i know that `` the lost sheep will be hunted by a wolf . ''
