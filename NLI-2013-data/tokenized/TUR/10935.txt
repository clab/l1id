Risk equal to success .
Two type of people we can see in our life .
One of them who dont take risk and continue his or her boring life and other one is who get risk and has a not so balanced but intruduce success and lose in his or her life .

So many people like cilently life no risk , no fear , dont think so much tomorrow .
That type of people never get a success in their life .
Their succsess is only buy a new car or go holiday at abroad .

Succsess is encourage you make better .
I think that risk connect you to life more strongly cause of when you get risk that make you all the time awake and thinkful .
You should think not like other people you ought to see all apportunities what make your risk more successful .
You should read and research new things in the world .

At the end when you reach succsess again you feel your self more brave to try new things .
Because one time you get success and next time will why not ?
Than you start search again new things for try again .

I agree that successful people should try new things and take risk in order to reach new succsessions .
