Nowadays , some people think that there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Technology is growing everyday and also transformation is improving too .
This makes people use busses , trains , ships and planes .
On the other cars are getting cheaper everyday with technologies improvement so everybody can buy a car today .

Today if we look to car prires , we can see that there are cars for everybody 's budget .
In my country nearly everybody know how to drive a car and they say that they ca n't live without their cars .
They drive to shool , to work and also they are driving for hobby .
When you come to Turkey , you can see the families which have three members , have three cars .
We can understand that cars have big part in our lifes .
I think in twenty years everybody will have car and the traffic problems will be more than today too .

Car firms are improving their selves and they are producing more cars than last years .
We can see that the firms such as audi and bmw are re-newing their models with new skills every year aproducing new cars although they .
According to a article in the Autoshow magazine the smallest firms are producing at least 350 million cars in a year and it shows us that trafic will be more crowded in the future .

As a result there will be more cars in use than there are today .
In my opinion goverments should build more roads .
