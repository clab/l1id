Young People and Communities

In our developing world many things being changed .
Nowadays , young people do not spend their time for their comminications .
I agree , that young people do not give enough time for the communities .
I beleive that young people has some reasons for to not have enough time for communities .

First of all , our world changing everday .
Nowadays people need money to stay alive so it is sometimes hard to spend time to helping communities .
Being a human brings more resposilities and hard work .
Some young people working in part time job they do not only earn money but also they earn experience .
For instance ; I do not hate to spend time for my community on the contrary i love it .
In fact , I am working in my business and studying in university so I do not have enough time for my community .
World getting harder and harder each day to stay alive thats why young people spendign their time mostly to earn money .

Secondly , there is other reason which is effective on young people to not have time for comminity .
In our world technology developes by day and day .
After internet has been dicovered young people gets worse and worse cause of it pushes person to lonely life .
I accept that internet makes our life easier while we loose our young generation to spend more time on internet instead of our communities .
For example ; I prefer to stay at home and surf on internet rather that to spend time in my community .

In conclusion , I think , that young people have reasons to not spend their time in communties .
I belive that young people will have more time to spend their time to helping their communities in the future .
