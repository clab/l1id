Traffic in big cities continue to increase day by day and the ammount of cars on the streets are constantly rising .
Some people think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I agree with statement because of the rapid improvements in technology and because of the decrease in petrol resources throughout the whole world .

Traffic is a major problem in metropolitans .
For example in my city there has been an incredible increase in the amount of traffic in the last years .
Roads are nearly everywhere covering nearly one third of the cities landscape .
There is nearly nowhere left where people can sit and enjoy the fresh weather , wherever people go in the city they smell the disturbing smell of petrol and chemical gases caused by cars .
I think in the coming years governments will consider this as a great problem and they will start finding solutions to this car problem .
In my opinion technology will be their biggest aid in decreasing the amount of traffic in our cities .

The increase in petrol and gas resources in earth is undeniable .
Many scientists fear that in the coming years .
there will be absolutely no resources left to use for cars or other transports .
We are living in a world that is constantly using these kind of resources without doing anything the reproduce them .
Imagine the world as a huge water wel .
We are constantly taking little gulps from it not and thinking what will happen when the water is finished .
As an addition the more we use these resources , the more expensive they get .
This is why i think that humans will be forced to create new ways of transports .
Like transports that use sunlight or hydrogene for example instead of petrol .
This way cars will no longer be apart of our lives and we will start using different kinds of vehicles that have differnet names .

As a result i think the amount of cars in the coming years will increase because of the size of te problems stated above and humans will start using alternative vehicles that wont cause the same problems and that will make life easier .
