Since beginning of my prep-school education , our teachers tried to teach every thing from different areas , for example we had math course , music course and also a drawing course .
This situation continued until the the university education begins .
For the first time , in the university we started to specialize our knowledge to specific areas .
For a person 's academic plan we can think by this way .
However , when you start your academic life you can specialize for only one subject or try to get information from different subjects .
I think specializing is more effective way for all the period of education .

The first reason is , if you specialize in one specific subject and if you accomplish this successfully , you will become an autherity for this subject and you can answer all questions about this subject .
However , if imagine the other choice , trying to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , you will never say I performed successfully , because nowadays technology is exponentially growing and the information about all the subjects are developing , I want to say that todays knowledge can be uselles for today .
Because of these reasons , folowing the technology and updated information will be impossible if you want to have knowledge from different subjects .

Another important issue for specilazing one specific subject is , the academicans ' first task is investigate new things and gather new information and then share them with the public .
Investigating is a very difficult task and if you want to find new things for a subject and also develop it , you should know everythin about the subject until now .
You must define all the details of the subject and only by this way you can make investigations .
Specializing is became very important for this approach because it is impossible for a person to know every thing about subjects from different areas .

As a conclusuon , specializing is much better than having broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Also , in my belief that , we start specilaizing from the high-schools or earlier .
We should define people 's abilities and draw a direction for their future life .
By this way we can create expert academicans for their subject
