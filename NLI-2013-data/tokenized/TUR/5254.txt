Today , we are living in an age of consumption , by consuming various products either because we vitally need them or we are conditioned to do so .
As a consequence we are destined to make continuos choices about our consumption and advertisements hold an unavoidable place in the process .
The way we determine our choices among , more or less equally qualified , products is connected to the way they are promoted to us to a great extent .

There are two ways that the advertisemets take hold of our choices , first , they associate superior qualities to a product , apart from the reality behind .
As an example to such a situation , we can look at an experiment made my Coca-Cola experts testing their new formulation of coke , in late 1980s , to reveal the reason behind the steep decrease in the sales .
When the experts made people try both Coca-Cola and Pepsi , without indicating their brands , even the Coca-Cola fans were not able to distinguish between the two brands and chose Pepsi , as being Coca-Cola .
The main outcome of the experiment was the indication that Coca-Cola fans were overall choosing the brand based upon bombardment of advertisements , instead of a distinct difference in taste .

The second role of advertisements to promote a product is to associate it with another aspect of life , generally with satisfaction of another need .
For example , in most of the advertisements of Gilette , we see a sexy guy , half-naked , shaving himself and being adorned by women .
Such advertisements give the message of : shaving with Gilette makes you attractive for women , is an important tool in increasing the sales of the product , by implicitly satisfying a subconscious desire of men .

Overall , it becomes apperant that , in a world of choices accompanied by numerous products on shelfs , advertisements manipulate our actions .
That is why big corporations invest millions of dolars in advertisement , as a sign of huge gains coming from advertisements .
At this point , it is our responsibility , to make most keen choices by comparing the quality of a product with its price .
