It is obvious that people have more energy and desire in the earlier times of their lives , however this does not indicate that young people would enjoy life more than older people do .
I think that it is possible to enjoy life at all ages , provided that we keep our spirits and minds contemporary and young .

Most people say that there are certain things that can only be done when we are young .
For instance , extreme sports , partying late hours , eating excessively or even falling in love .
I agree the fact that there are certain activities that we can not perform after a certain age , nevertheless I believe that it is not only a matter of activities that keep us young but it is the state of mind we are in .

Basically , I think that there are different joys people get from life when they are young and old .
When we are young , we search for the unconventional , unfundamental and extraordinary and we can go for it no matter what .
As we get older , we begin to think of the results , effects and evaluate situations more carefully .
These are the different levels of joy that we can get when we are young and old .

Youth brings along lots of energy , excitement and desire to reach the unknown and accomplish the undone .
This has a certain joy factor , but only as long as we are young .
Trying to act such cluelessly in older times may lead us to alienment from life and society because we have more responsibilities as we grow older .
Even though our responsibilities increase and we may be limited by the society as we get older , I do not think that we would be enjoying life less .
If we could accept getting old and adopt ourselves to the changing environment , we can always enjoy life because there is an endless energy in life , we only need to capture it and connect with it .

No matter how large the numbers get on our age , we always have the opportunity to enjoy life if we have the energy and the mentality to do so .
Being dynamic and having a loving and caring family and friends that connect us to life would always enable us to enjoy life at all ages .
