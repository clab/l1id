Ideas and facts are really different things .
Ideas explain something that can be done or couldnt .
Because it is an only idea .
But fact is different .
Facts must be done in real life .

I think it is iportant to learn facts than ideas .
Because facts are real but ideas are not .
You can learn somuch ideas about something but you ca n't apply these ideas in real life .
It is not important if you do n't apply ideas in real life .
But if you know facts you can apply immediately when you hear ideas .
But if you know only ideas you cant do anything in real life .

For example an electronic engineer can know how television works .
But he/she knows only idea that how it works .
I think this not important .
In real life people dont pay attention ideas .
People pay attetion facts .
Because fact are real and applicable .
People want to see something .
People dont want hear only ideas .
If they see facts then people pay attention ideas .
And say `` Ooo it is a good idea , congratulations '' .

It is waste of time to learn ideas .
If you learn fact you also learn ideas background of this fact .
If we learn only ideas we must spend time to learn facts about this idea .
But we learn facts directly we also learn the ideas .
So we dont lose time .

Facts is general .
So when you learn facts about something , you also learn ideas about this .
