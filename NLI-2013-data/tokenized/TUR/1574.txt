Some of the people prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject , and some not .
I think it is better to get broad knowledge from many academic subjects .
If my country allow this way , I believe I used to select this method but unfortunately I could n't .

One of the adventages of this way is that it is not easy to forecat the ability of the students in the begining of the university .
I think in my country most of the university students do not like their subjects .
Because our university selecting system does not reflect the students abilities .
All people who graduated from college should attend to an exam .
After getting the score from this exam they should fill a form about the sections and universities and they should sequenced these choices from the highest score of preview year to lower .
At the end they start one of them or try to get enough score in the following year .
If these student get any chance to select more than one university or section I think it will increase the rate of pleasure of students about their sections .

The other reason for my choice about after graduation .
During university years , students can not imagine their rest of lifes certainly .
Because in my country the relations between university and industry is very weak .
So students can not get information about their jobs during lessons .
After graduate most of the students could n't make their dream works .
This cause unsatisfied people and unhappy families .
But If they could get any second subject they can select one of them after start to work and get real information about their bussiness life .

I am an engineer and I do not like make engineering .
Fortunetly after start to job I promoted to management and I find out my dream work .
I believe I created by God for management and I like very much to manage the people .

Finally I can say that to create more happy publics ' goverments should change the rules and allow to people have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
