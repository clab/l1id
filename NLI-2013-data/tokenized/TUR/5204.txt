BIG EXPECTATIONS
I agree with the statement that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In my point of view , advertisements are the masks that products wear .
With those masks on their faces , you can not understand the products ' quality .
Because advertisements are just hiding the reality .

To start with an example to illustrate the advertisements ' show side , there was an advertisement of a chocolate and on the advertisements the whole school was eating it because the chocolate tasted very nice and it included more calcium in it than it included the chocolate .
However , when I bought and tried it , it was awful and when I read the ingredients of the product , I saw that there is very little calsium in it .
The advertisement was just a lie .
The chocolate on the advertisement was wearing the mask that I mentioned before .

Moreover , the advertisements hide the reality in the sense that they do not allow - and can not-the consumers to try the products .
Behind the scene , they just appear as they would be demanded .
May be if a consumer tries the product on television , he or she will find lots of bad sides of it .
Since it is the relationship between supply and demand , the advertisers just give what is demanded by curtailing the real ingredients of a product .

All in all , according to my opinion , advertisement business is a show business .
Show requires lies , small tricks and big and pink expectations .
Advertisement shows give these tricky things in such an intelligent way to its audiences that they want to make that audience to buy and consume that product .
Whether the product is as it is shown or not is not their primary concern .
So most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are just to attract people and make them buy that products .
