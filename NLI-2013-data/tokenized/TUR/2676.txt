I think that young people enjoy life more than old people .
There is lots of reasons for this which are genrally based on advantages of being young .
Let me explain these reasons one by one .

First of all young people not as experienced as old ones .
Because they are lack of experience , everything appears something new to them and they enjoy dicovering these new things .
For example for a young people to go to a new country can be so much enjoyable because he is doing something new .
A new experience which may create unfamilliar feelings .
But on the other hand it is not that much attractive for an old man who had this kind of experience several times .

Secondly young people have less responsibilities which give them more fredom .
A young people generally only have his or her responsibility .
So he can make his programs without depending to others .
He do n't need to take care of a baby or shedule his holiday acording to child 's school like old people .
Fredom is also one of the key words that makes life more enjoyable .

An other reason is energy of young people .
The energy of young people also an advantage which makes them enjoy life more than olders .
When people are young they have energy to do everything .
At it is not only an individual advantage .
As all young pepole have this energy they can create more positive atmosphere than older people can .
So they can also benefit from this advantage by using synergy of group .
They can make parties till late hours , dance and laugh all together .
They are capable of this activities with their long lasting energies .

As a conclusion it is obvious that young people have so much advantages to enjoy the life more than old people but there is no need to feel jelious about it .
In fact sooner or later young peop will get older .
as once older people were young .
