Generally it is argued that what student should understand .
The ideas and concepts ?
or facts ?
Even though facts are crucial for learning , the time of learning facts is not the time of being student .
During being students , ideas and concepts should be learned .

Facts comes after ideas and concepts .
if you do not understand the meaning of ideas and concepts , you can not realize the facts or you can not comprehend the facts .
For example in food engineering department when the lecture teaches students about the haccp ' facts , after graduation upon working , this teaching leads to problems such as making the products decay .
The facts always change under some circumstances .

While it is true that the facts are very important to learning , ideas and concepts are as important as facts .
They force students to think analytically .
In this way students can gain their analytical ability .
therefore they can consider problems with a different perspective when they encounter the problem .
they can find the facts with using their analy

The above said leads me to conclude that during student life understanding ideas and concepts is very important for students .
