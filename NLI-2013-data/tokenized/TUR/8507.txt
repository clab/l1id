In a general term the word of `` idea '' comes from ancient Greece and simply refers to a meaning that '' a human being can think '' .
As all being humans , our ability of thinking makes us different from other species in this planet and makes us special .
Even though we were born without knowing any answers to questions like why are we here ?
and Why do we live for ? , we made a great progress in a very large scale .
We built great civilizations and achieved wonderful systems to make our lives more and more easy .

Education is one of the systems that we created to live systematically in our communities and to gain optimum benefits from this planet .
It is so simple though we are on earth so let 's enjoy it .
Human brain never stops since the very early ages that we can talk about first human actions .
People always invent something to make our life easier .
There is different parts of making inventions , first you must have an idea , second you have to work hard on your concept of working and third you have to finish your invention with a great succes and create a new fact .
For example now we are flying on planes to any place on the earth and the world is more global now , and so that 's a fact .
Finally i want to say that if as humans beings we living here we can continue of thinking different ideas which may be going to be a fact in the future .
But the So ideas and concepts are the only thing that a student should pay attention while studying , on the other hand facts are only the facts .
