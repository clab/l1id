I am totally disagree with this idea .
There are some key reasons for the disaggrement .
In today 's world , developments continue at very high rate , so this circumstance requires dividing the subjects into some number of parts .
This is also valid for academic subjects , since academic life is directly related to development process .
You must look at the procedings , provide some new idea and make it real .
This means that you will add someting that will be work on it for the further time , maybe it will be another subject which will be considered as a new branch .
The main reasons can be listed as diversity of a subject , the new ideas on them and turning the idea to real .

First of all , we can examine the situation of expansion of the subject that is a academic one .
Today every academic person works to provide some inventions or developments about their fields .
What is the way of solving problems about a subject that is studied ?
The most effective way of this is dividing it into some reasonable number of parts .
For instance , think about the biology , it is a huge area that academic people work on it , but when you look at the academic life , you can see one important thing which is the subject has been divides into many parts such as microbiology , plant systems , genetic science etc .
We can find many other subjects that are worked on them , today .
Why did they divide the subject ?
Actually , the answer is obvious , many people work on it and the area is expanded , to solve the problems as quicky as possible you must work like a team that the members work for a specific part of it .

Secondly , we can think the situation that is alive about new ideas .
Actually , this is about the expansion process , but we must think this as separate part .
Academic people works on many subjects and they try to put some new ideas into the field .
How can affect these ideas the division process ?
The new ideas mean the new woorking areas , think the one of the most invention called computer and its acedemic side .
The computers came out from the electrical and electronical progress .
That is , the people who study for the development of electrical process thougt an idea about usage of electricity as bits ( 1 and 0 ) in the scale of current .
After this idea , the related academic filed started to thinking it and provided some other developed ideas that required to create a new branch of study .
So , they divided the electrical and electronical field into two .
This is also valid for today and we can combine this approach with the development process .
Because , these new successfull research theories .
new developments have gone out .
That is , all of them like the example make the area bigger and bigger .
As a result , this needs a division for being faster about academic improvements .

Finally , we must aware of the process that is division is neccessary for being developped at a higer rate .
This makes me being disaggre with the idea that is stated .
