My education life changes totally in the university .
At the high school , students are educated smoothly about the lessons .
Teachers ignore to provide the facts of the subjects , and teachers explain the lessons only about understanding ideas and memorizing the dates .
Especially in the history lesson that is very important to understand and learn facts .
Student should describe the history on his or her aspect .
In my opinion the most important point of education is that education is provided with its facts .

The first point i would like to make is that learning subjects with its facts is exciting .
For instance history ; in my country there was a great leader who is Mustafa Kemal Ataturk .
I heard too many things about him during all my educational life .
But at the university , students learn all facts about his life .
Therefore i wonder about him and why he dedicated his all life for turkish nation , So that i am excited and wonder , then i investigate about him .

The second point i would like to make is that learning subjects with its facts is effective way of understanding .
Without clear and real reasons any subject , especially history , could not be understandable .
It is the efficient way of education makes events clear with all its facts .

Thus I would conclude by saying that learn facts of the subject provides exciting and interesting in subject , furthermore learn facts make people understandable and more concerning to subject .
