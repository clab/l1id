Knowladge is very important issue that people should have but how to learn is most important part of the knowladge .
In some countries like Turkey , people are forced to learn to fact rather than understand the ideas and concept .
I strongly belive that understanding ideas and concepts is more important to keep your knowladge widely and long time .

Students usually have a problem with little information in one subject .
To have a large information about one specific topic , students should learn how to relate the informations about they heard and read .
For instanse , two group of students are learning something about the animal names .
In one of the these groups , students learn facts and memorise that information .
The second groups are learning where these names comes from and the main points of this topic .
Some time later , if you ask a question about unfamiliar name of animal , first group of people can not explain the topic while the others have some information about the question .

Secondly , the main problem in learning is forgeting the information that is learned before .
This big problem 's only solution is understanding the main points and ideas .
According to the my teacher the most important point in learning is forgeting the information because of not learning the ideas and concepts .
Student can easily learn and memorise the facts , but this knowladge does n't take too much time .
The major point is that if you learn how the topics are related and where that information comes from , it can make sense in your brain .
After long time passes you will still remember a little information about the subject .

As a conclusion , people 's learnning styles tale really substantinal role in keeping the information widely and long time and as I said before the best solution is understanding ideas and concept .
Time is getting knowladge and using this knowladge in your work .
At this point people may know the topic they studied on , but they drammatiacly do n't know how they use this information .
