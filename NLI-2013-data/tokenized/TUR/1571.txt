Having broad knowledge of many academic subjects rather than specializing in one specific subject seems more difficult to me due to several reasons .
Let me state my reasons .

First of all , specializing in one specific event or subject may take a lifetime .
I , for instance , want to specialize in marketing and in order to do so , I will have to have my MBA , PhD and still work on learning .
I can not say that '' OK , I have been reading and learning about marketing for 20 years and I know everything . ''
This is impossible because evey year , new books and new methods are introduced to the market .
Learning about one subject never ends up .

Secondly , it is not useful to know more than one topic or subject on the surface .
You may have knowledge about other topics but you do one thing good .
It is like playing basketball and football at the same time .
It would be impossible for you to find enough time to sacrifice yourself for the well being of any issue .

If this topic was possible , I would have one techer in my whole life , trying to teach me everything .
But I had math .
teacher , marketing teacher , finance teacher and so on .
All were specialized in their fields and had depth knowledge of their intererst .

To sum up , having broader knowledge of many academic subjects seem unuseful to me .
Specializing is much more prefered .
In USA , the biggest economy in the world today , specialization at universities is the primary method and they owe their success to this approach .
I would go for specialization .
