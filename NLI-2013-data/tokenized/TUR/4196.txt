Help of the young people to their communities have always been important for all communities .
It is also a fact that the need for their help is increasing as the sizes of the communities are also increasing .
In spite of this increasing demand , young people of our days do not give much time to helping their communities .
But we should not blame them because there are reasons for their behaviour on this issue , such as harder education system of our days , the places young persons generally live and the bad conditions of community services .

The education system of our times are much harder than the past times .
Harder topics are included in majors in order to give the students the ability to compete with other students from different schools , while trying to find a job .
Moreover , students now have to spend too much time for preparing for this hard education in order to be successful , which limits their time a lot .

Secondly , the increase in the number of young people who are attenting to the schools made the schools to build big campuses outside the cities , in order to provide more capacity .
Therefore , students started to live in these campuses as it is hard for them to go to a school which is far away everyday .
Because of the distances of these campuses to the city and the limitation of the time of the students , they cannot attend to the social events or community services which generally take place in the cities .

Moreover , it is a fact that the governments do not do anything that will attract the young people to take role in community services .
The environments of such services are really poor and also there is not enough chance for young people to have important roles in these organizations .
Governments should support the young people and provide better conditions in the community services in order to attract the attention of young people .

To conclude , it is clear that nowadays , young people are not giving much time to the benefits of their community than they were giving before .
However , it will be wrong to blame them for this as they work harder during their educations , live in places far from the cities and are not attracted by the terrible conditions that community services mostly have .
