For our grandmothers it was the flyers , for our parents it was the television and for us it is almost everywhere we exist .
Advertisements are covering more and more space in our lives ; billboards , internet , buildings or even people can be holders for advertisements .
Yet , the question is whether or not we are being treated candidly about the product the advertisement represents .

Indeed , we are often equivocated by ads in the sense that flawed or deficient qualities of a product can be well concealed whereas the supreme qualities are underscored perfectly in an ad thanks to the extreme communication skills of advertisers .
One could present a computer program which has the ability to perform a specific task , say converting one file to another , and he may never mention how slow it performs its duty .

From my experiences , i could show the test center in which i am taking TOEFL as a paradigm for this situation .
It is quite a well known and respectable company .
When one enters through its door , he is dazzled by the ads everywhere claiming how superior the company is .
Yet , their computers have shown a lot of malfunctions before the test .

Nonetheless , too much of cynicism is not correct .
One could present many situations similar to mine , but that does n't necessarily mean that we are always misled by ads .
In conclusion , i believe that ads do make products seem much better but some products can be really better .
Therefore it is better to keep a piece of optimism inside .
