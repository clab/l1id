Trust or not to the Ads

As the technology has improved so far , we have a wide range opportunities to get what we need or what we would like to buy with the help of the shopping sites in the Internet or on Tv by simply selecting the most attractive ads but are they really the same as they are shown on the screen ! ?
This is questionable .

Firstly , the main idea in advertisement world is to attract the people by putting the product 's ads to the market in an exxagrating way , and so they make profits .
To illustrate , there are ads on tv that says if you wear our new brand tights you will definitely be how you like to look .
And the ones who really need to loose weight just believe in that and pay lots of money .

Secondly , in the internet , mostly product pictures are showned and a description of it is written but when you get it you will be disappointed by the product that you encounter .
The reason why people choose the shop in net maybe they think they can find wide range price of the same stuff , but the quality of it will not be satisfiying .

I can wholly heartedly say that i agree with the statement that is the products seem much better than really are in most advertisements .
Only just to make profits .
