I agree with the statement that indicates that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
There are several reasons taken both from my life and my environment , which I will cover in the following paragraphs .

Firstly and maybe most importantly , the main affect that make people enjoy life less is the obligation of working .
People who do not work for their , say , first 21 years of their lives suddenly face with a harsh professional working environment .
It may include a low salary , hard working conditions or the lack of holidays .
Working everyday from early morning to evening ( or even night ! )
consumes all the energy of the body and leaves nothing else to do in the limited time left to live your own life .
Especially , if you do not have the job of your dreams ( much-paying and less-working ) , everyday would be a nightmare .
It is never like the good old days you had before , when only 20 hours of lecture and some studying were sufficient to pass the courses and have much time to enjoy in the university campus .

Responsibilities are another factor .
It also includes the professional life .
But there are other aspects too , like the effort needed to form and run a family .
Having children bring joy to life for sure , but greater responsibilities ; such as the education of the child , having to face almost impossible-to-handle situations , are factors that make the life taste bitter .

Finally , health-related issues are a big part of the deal .
The difficult life conditions mentioned above bring other unwanted guests which are also known as illnesses .
The mother nature also helps these guests , as we all know that the resistance to unwanted situations of a living creature decreases as the time proceeds .

There would be exceptions to what I mentioned before .
Working children , unhealthy-born babies or improving ability to taste life with the gained experiences etc ...
But still , I do not believe that they are enough to overcome the fact that being young feels great .
