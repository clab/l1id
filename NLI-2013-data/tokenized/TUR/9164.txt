It is asked whether grasping the idea and concepts are more valuable than learning and just memorizing the facts .
I hold the view that , although sometimes it is useful to learn the facts , to be able to understand the idea and the underlying reasons behind a particular topic is far more crucial .
The students should be expected more than learning the facts and ways of critisizing these facts should be taught them .

To begin with , I believe that the facts do not always remain constant .
They can change with time and old facts can be replaced with completely new facts .
Thus , the facts itself are not always reliable .
To illusrate it with an example , before Galileo and some other scientists it was believed that the world was flat .
Besides , it was a well accepted fact .
However , later the facts were questioned and replaced with newer facts .
What I can recommend here is that learning the ways which go to these facts are more important and the ideas and concepts behind these facts form a more solid understanding for the students .

Secondly , the facts are usually more difficult to keep in mind .
Since I am also a student , I know very well that the facts are easily forgotten after one year or even after the courses finish .
Thus , to understand ideas would enable the students to carry their knowledge to their later periods of life .
Besides , focusing on the concepts and general ideas would also enable them to study more effectively , since they are usually more easy to remember .

Thirdly , the facts do not prepare the students for a real life at all .
Usually at school , the students just keep the facts in mind , which are explained by the teacher .
Later on , the students just memorize the facts in order to be ready for the exams and they usually do not grasp the topic as a whole or they cannot add something from themselves .
However ; when these students will graduate afterwards and will be in the real life , they will be expected to be able to interpret , to make comments and to offer new solutions based on basic ideas and concepts .
Therefore at school , the students should be trained and encouraged to question the facts and offer alternatives to these facts .
That is often a more effective way of education than learning the facts .

In conclusion , I support the idea that to understand the ideas and concepts is more crucial than just trying to keep the facts in mind .
There is no guarantee that the facts would remain as they are and a student should learn to do more than just memorizing the facts in order to be ready for a life outside of school when they graduate .
Thus , students are better encouraged to understand the ideas and concepts and be able to critisize the facts , which I think is more important than the facts .
