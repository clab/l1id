I agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I believe that the reason behind this statement are the parents .
The child will grow up depending on how the parents raise them .
It is the parents responsibility to give their children the knowledge of the community they live in and what they have to do in order to fit in their community .

I strongly believe that the young people nowadays are very spoilt .
They are not taught the value of money .
Families give them enormous amounts of money and the freedom to spent it as they want .
As every young person they think that everything in life is money .
Because of this , young people have no morals left .
They grow up learning how to spend money .
Parents do not give as much time as before to their children .

Even the celebration of the holidays are not the same anymore .
Young ones care about their morals much less than the older generation .
For example , I live in Istanbul , and according to our religious holidays the whole family , from youngest to the oldest , comes together .
If not the young ones go to visit their elders .
But , nowadays unfortunately this is not happening .
Younger generations do not care about these things .
They prefer being with their friends .
Life to them is about drinking , driving the most expensive car , going out with the pretiest girl or wearing only brand names .

As a conclusion , I blame the parents for this situation .
Every parent is responsible for their own child and it is up to the parents how they brought up their child in to this community .
Young people either will be welcomed by their community or be rejected .
