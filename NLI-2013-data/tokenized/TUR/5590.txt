in advertisement endustry ther are sevrall things that you do to show the product different than what the way they really are or look .
but it is something that you have to do .
to be honest advertisement has nothing to do with honesty it is basicly about selling the product to the custumer and to do that you have to be creative and maybe a bit unreal .
it dosent matter that much wheather you believe everyhing you see or dont it is all about the campaine and how you brought it up .

the way it seems in real world we can say that advertising is the one of the bigest multimedia pover which can basicly control our needs .
but on the other hand the needs we need can be clasified by advertisements so we cant say that they are bad or wrong .

the main reasen why they make products seem much better is to take custemers attention .
no one seems interested whit regular stuff thats the basic of human habbits .
so they make it shine and glow so that we would want to have it .
as a resbonce to that potential custemers suchc as our neighbor or firiend saw it and atract to it then have it and afterwords we people have something to talk about such as `` have you seen what sally got ?
yes i did i saw it on tv `` than the chat goes on .
the advertisement can make people talk .

in my point of view sure they make products seem much better and sure it is the only reasen we buy them that is how it goes or how it supposed to go cause we all know that people wont concider buying anything unless they see it in somewhere else .
if advertisements can reach to them by shining and gloving the product i am afraid that as a sosiety this is who we are and how we deal whit the things by runnig to a shiny object .
we should defenitly give them a credit for what they are really doing .
to me have to show things better if they want to sell their products .
this is buisness .
