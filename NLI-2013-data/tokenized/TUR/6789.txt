Cars are the indispansible part of our life .
I ca n't imagine how life would be if there were n't any car .
They are like the member of our family .
Because people like cars even more than it used to be .
They are trying to make their car more comfortable and beautiful since they spend so many times at roads .

Some people consider that cars wo n't be the part of our life in twenty years because the oil reserve of the world is decreasing very rapidly .
So maybe only rich people will be using cars in the future .
Can you imagine this , maybe there wo n't be traffic jam .
And also this is not a real proof .

I think we wil be more dependent on car in the future because our life is changing in so many ways .
The density of population is considerably increasing .
So these people will need cars to go somewhere .
I am totally disagree about the idea that we will use less car in twenty years because people have began to use new sources instead of petrol such as biodisel and electrycity .
From my point of view that will help humanity to save the environment since that does n't give harm to environment like petrol .
And also technolgy is still trying to develope new kind of things to support cars to work .
What is more , what will the people do if there will be fever cars .
Are we going to fly or something like that .
I think what is said about this is not based on scientific evidence because we need cars and we will drive them at least a hundred years .
We can also say that the woman driver are more than in the past and they will be more in the future than now .
So the factories take these kind of things in to account .
Nevertheless they do n't seem to stop producing cars .

To sum up , I believe that cars are the part of our life and people do n't seem to leave them for a long time .
Although the bad impacts of cars to the environment we ca n't disregard how useful they are .
