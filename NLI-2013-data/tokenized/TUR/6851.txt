Traffic is a big problem in great cities like Istanbul , Paris , New York .
Because there are a lot of cars .
The number of cars are increasing because of populations increasing .
This couses more problems in traffic .
Researchers are looking for alternative approaches to solve this problem .
I think that in twenty years there will be fewer car in use than tere are today .

Firstly , researchers developing the trains .
Cars are more popular than trains in today .
On the other hand , cars popularity will decrease in future .
Because in future there will be faster and more comfortable trains than in today .
Governments will develop and build better railroads too .
As a result of these popularity of trains will increase and popularity of cars will decrease .

Morower , air travel will also be more popular in future .
The number of air travel firms is increasing everyday .
Because of the competition , the price of tickets is decreasing .
So , air travel becomes more common and popular .
People prefer going to far places by using airoplanes .
The number of helicopters is increasing too .
These are other factors that cause decrease in number of cars .

Lastly , if you think that technology is developing very fast , you will think that trains and planes will be more popular and cheaper in a short time period .
Twenty years is a short peariod of time for the developments of trains and planes .

Consequently , cars will lose their popularity in twenty years .
Because people will prefer travelling by trains and planes rather than travelling by cars .
Technology developing will result with faster and more comfortable trains and planes .
So , the number os cars will decrease in twenty years .
