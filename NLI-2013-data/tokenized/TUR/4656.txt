I totally agree that most advertisements make products seem better than they really are .
Professionals use good packaging , good image to make that product attractive to us .
Furthermore by the help of commercials we get use to them .

Good packaging makes products seem better .
We are always affected by the big , colorful , fancy and bright things when we are trying to make a choice between two different things .
We also choose what look nice as a package , but sometimes the result can suprise us .
When I was a chind I was given a chance to select the president I want from two different choices .
I chose the red one and then when we opened the boxes I realized that the light yellow ugly wrapped one was a better president .
Packaging in advertising may make you select wrong choice .

Seeing good outcomes of that product in advertisiment campains may not be correct .
We are all afected by the image of that product but infact there may be nothing to do with that image and the product .
For instance , we sometimes see an advertisement about a product and we think that if we wear that shoes we can jump as much as the basketballer .
But infact it is not true that what advertisement shows as , it show us that product is a super product and it can help you jump more ofcourse it is not true .

Professionals in advertisement business are using media to show us and remind us that product more often then we get use to that product .
As the time passes we slowly start to think that , it is shown everywhere , everybody is talking about it so it must be a good product .
I remember when I was affected by a shampoo adertisement because I was seeing it on every wall and watching its commercial each night .
When I bought that product I realized that I was not any better that the regular shampoo furthermore it was not making my hair I smooth as I used to have .

In conclusion , I believe that professionals are using advertising as a dangerous and powerfull tool to influence people 's opinion in order to make them believe that the product is better in one or other way from its competitors .
