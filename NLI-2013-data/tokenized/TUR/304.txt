Taking risk and trying the new things are the most important keys that are going to open the door of the success to us .
Success is matched with risk and the experiments .
If there is no risk , there is no success .

Success is like a fish that as long as we try hard to catch it and take a risk of dropping in the sea and to try new methods to accomplish , there is no way to miss it .
I would like to express my opinion with one proverb in Turkish that the people who are not brave enough to take a chance are going to stay the place where they are without moving on while the people who tries many new things by taking risk are going to reach the top of the success .
Without trying , there is no way to learn and it is not possible to find out If we are on the right track or not .

For example , My father likes to play safe rather than to take a risk .
He is so afraid to fail .
As a result of this , He has been standing the same place where he is .
He was going to open a restaurant couple of years ago he was almost done with the process but then he changed his mind and he did not put in a practice .
Because , he was afraid to fail and go down .
Now , He has been working for someone and he is not happy at all .
If he had opened the restaurant at the time that he got a chance , now we may have been well-off .
Additionally , Now He regrets that he did not take the chance that was offered to succeed .
There is a saying that `` use it or lose it '' and he lost it .

All in all , If there is no risk , there is no success .
If we want to be called as a successful person and not to regret and not to say `` I wish '' later on in our life , We should try new things and take risks without being afraid in order to accomplish .
