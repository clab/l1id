There are two kinds of people around us in basics , successful ones and unsuccessful ones .
There are a lot of reasons affecting the success or causing the unsuccess , we all aware of them .
But when we search the lives of successful people , we generally face with some success stories .
Nearly all of these stories starts with a risk factor .
but in my opinion I am against having too much risk in life .

At this point I want to give a saying that I heard in my school life `` more about less or less about more '' .
When I am asked to choose one of them , I chose more about less part .
Because I believe that specializing on the area you are working will be the best and guaranteed way of being successful .
When we think about our daily life we can see the examples supporting my idea .
For example , think about two restaurants one is specialized on pizza , and the other has a lot of kinds plus pizza .
And you want to eat pizza .
Most of the people around us will choose the pizza restaurant because the human logic states that `` they are experts on this job '' .

To be successfull i believe that person must be one of the bests in his/her area .
But at this point I want to clerify something .
What I mean here in text by success is not money , therefore rich people are not accepted as successful in my mind .
My successful persondefinition is that `` someone who contributes much to society '' .

In order to earn big moneys it is true that you must have risks , but successful people , in my mind , are the ones who are really knows what to do and can see far future from today .
In this way a person can react to the changes in society quickly and this can result in reactions that may make people think as if the person is taking risks .
But the person knows the reasons and the result of the reaction very well so that he can see the success that other people can not see at that point .

To sum up I want to ask a question ; Living is risk by its own why to take more risks ?
