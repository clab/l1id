There are studenst in the world .
They want to learn something from their teachers or their families to become success .
If a student want to resolve the situation to become sucess , he/she must know the idea .
Understanding ideas is more important than learning facts for students because of the features and the usages .

Students want to know the specialities of the idea and concepts .
Specialities show where the topic comes from .
For example Turks are living in a democratic city .
If they do not know their past they can not know the importance of that democracy .
For this reason people learn their past and their history .
If people can not know their past and they live in domocratic country .
they can not discuss or protest something is oppsed to their country .
They must know how they become in this situation and they can use it if it is necessary .
Knowing specialities means that knowinf ideas and concepts .

Understanding what the idea is about is necessary for learning something .
If a student start to learn something first of all she/he must know the name of the idea and than the information about the idea for using it .
If she do not know anything about that she/he can not realise the facts .
Facts can only demonstrate the results but to understanding well it is not enough .
For example there is OSS in Turkey and the students study OSS for getting a chance to pass a good university .
I studied too and I learned the idea and concepts .
If I learn only the facts I can forget the facts during the OSS .
Understanding facts means memorizing because we can not know the idea .
We can only know the fact and this is not enough .
For this reason teachers explain the topics with their concepts and ideas .
So the students can know the fact whenever they want because understanding ideas pass the people to the facts .

To summerize understanding ideas is important for remember and using ideas .
