The rapid growth in the usage of cars , especially in the last ten years , has caused lots of both social and environmental problems to increase ; however , because of the facts that there is an rapid increase in the world 's population , the people are getting involved in several issues within a same day due to the increasing challenge , and that the car is known to be a symbol of so-called ` prestige ' , I believe there wo n't be fewer cars in use ; rather an increase in the amount could be expected in twenty years .

First of all , the rapid increase in the world 's population is unfortunately can not be prevented in most of the countries .
If we just think of the case that the world economy will not undergo severe damages in twenty years ; then it is a clear fact that the more the humans born , the more the number of cars that will be used will increase .
If the newly built up , wide roads are taken into account , we may even say that the demand for cars will increase in a considerable amount .

Secondly , the life challange has accelerated for people during the last years , making them get involved in several tasks even within a single day .
For example , you could imagine a mother who has has the following tasks to do in a single day : Bringing her little son to school , then going to work , completing lots of issues even by going somewhere else to trade and finally going back to her son 's school to get him back for the guitar lesson that he will have .
Without a doubt , she will prefer to use her own car , not the public transportation in order to accomplish her targets in the fastest , most comfortable and convenient way .

Finally , in today 's world , it is unfortunately a fact that the cars are seen as prestige elements for the lives of certain people such as bussinessmen or youth .
They think themselves to have obtained a certain degree in public if they use their own , expensive , luxurious cars .
Although this is very nonsense for a lot of us , we can never skip this fact in the increase of the cars within the next tewnty years .

As a conclusion , though the use of public transportation and so the decrease in the usage of cars will solve most of the transportation , traffic-jam , sociological and environmental problems ; it comes out to be a fact for me that ; there will not be any decrease in the usage of cars within twenty years according to the problems of rapid growth in population , increase in the life challenge and the prestige that is thought to be obtained by using a car .
