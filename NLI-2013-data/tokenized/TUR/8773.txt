There is no need to know the things like concepts and ideas , which are already known by everyone .
In order to be much more creative and productive , students have to learn the facts instead of understanding the concepts and ideas .
In my opinion , there are some basic reasons for that .

First of all , internet has become an important factor in students life .
They can search the information which they have been looking for and they can learn the facts easily .

Secondly , it is much more beneficial for the students to learn the facts .
If they are forced to research the information and datas , they will probably create their own ideas about a topic instead of understanding an old one .
That will make them much more creative and prouductive .
For instance , think a teacher who gives an assignment to the students about a political issue .
If student searches the internet by using google , he or she will have some information about the issue and maybe has a little information that already exists .
But if he or she tries to understand the basics of politics and learnes the fundamental facts , he or she can create his own opinon about that issue .

To sum up , in order to be creative , students should spend their time by reading and researching the facts that they do not know .
They must learn the facts in order to have their own about topics instead of memorising the consepts and the ideas which have already been known .
