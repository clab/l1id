Science-fiction movies depict a future , where there are no cars in the streets because it is subsituted by teleportation .
Although it is mere fantasy and a funny expectation at the moment , some people think that cars will vanish or their numbers will be reduced in twenty years .
I do not agree with this statement partly because cars have become a part of our daily life .
More importantly they have become a part of our modern life .
Mobility is an important feature in today 's world since it offers escape from our daily routine , which is essential for refueling energy to ourselves to continue living .
Another reason is due to the market large corporations have at the present and they will not be willing to lose this market .

The first aspect why cars will not become unpopular in near future is due to their strong impact in our lives .
In this modern day , we do everything using cars : we drop and get our children from school using cars , we go out to entertain ourselves with our cars .
With the movement to the suburbs , we need to go to the shopping mall and get our weekly needs .
Other than that , families in suburbs are usually isolated , and their only escape is gained through going out with their cars .
In city life , we have to use cars too due to the fact that city has a fast life and we have to adapt to it .

Another point regarding cars is that they offer us an escape from the daily routine , which is something we need for continuing working .
Some might argue that we already spend time in cars in our daily routine .
However , a car and an open road is usually associated with freedom and escape .
In today 's world , leaving our daily routine for a few days is considered as a way to feel ourselves comfortable and relaxed : we go on vacations using our cars or go for a picnic at the weekends .
As in seen in the movie Thelma and Louise , where two women go away from their houses for the weekend for a change since this is neccessary to go on living .

The market car producers have at the moment is another aspect why cars will not be outnumbered by other vehicles .
Since there is a big market for producers to sell their cars to consumers , producers will find a way to keep cars popular .
To examplify , in the city - Ankara where I have been living since I was born , there have been a great increase in the number new of cars in the traffic .
This fact that I notice everydays shows that cars have not lost their popularity .
On the contrary , more cars have been sold in the last few years than in earlier times .
This is partly because car producers are conforming to today 's needs by changing the outlook of the cars .
In other words , they will not lose popularity , but the way they work will change .

Some people believe that there will be less cars than there are today in twenty years .
I do not agree with this statement because cars have become a part of our daily modern lives , and we do every little thing using them .
Additionally , cars function as an escape from the daily routine of life to the people , who are exhausted in their daily lives and in need of energy .
Moreover , car producers have a big market of consumers , which is something that producers will never want to lose .
