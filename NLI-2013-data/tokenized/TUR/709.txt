Specialization was not the beginning of Academics but after the Industrial Revolution specialization became important .
The works of each worker identified after that time and professors as university workers have to obey that process .
However , I believe that specialization in academic areas is dangerous for free thought and for the improvement of revolutionary ideas .

If we look closer to history science in 20th century , most of the scientists who bring the revolutionary ideas are out of the academy or not from the discipline .
Einstein was a mathematician even he was just working on a scientific jurnal .
There are many examples that support my proposition .
Nevertheless , if we pay close attention to philosophy of Feyaraband , we can see that how our strong beliefs prevents the revolutionary ideas in science .
He claims that our deep belief in our science discourages people out of the field .

At first glance specialization will appear even it will bring the academic person possibility to improve himself in his area .
However , this idea forgets an important point , all fields in science are connected by the core idea of science and if an academician wants to improve himself he has to learn it with the connections of the field with other fields and t is the philosophy of the current science .
Most of us begin to think that the age of philosophy is over and science will take its place .
This proposition is true in a sence .
The prevailing academic approach may want that because positivist approach of academy claims that science is developing day by day .
The arguments used to claim that are mostly related to technological fields .
However , it must be seen that technology is the appliance of science not an extra knowledge for us .
Moreover , because the arguments given are all in their terms and confirming each other , there is no way to reject the improvement in technology .
In other words , technology is in close relationship with scientific beliefs that make it possible .
Thus , such an argument is meanless to show whether we are in the right way or not .

The overwhelmed belief in prevailing science prevents us to examine it .
Even it is epistemological perspective is not strong as it appears at first glance .
Therefore , if we want to improve ourselves and begin to think freely , we should rise our heads and ask questions to endeep our knowledge on anything .
In that way we may be able to see the connections .
