Although according to some people learning facts is more important for students than understanding ideas , I believe that the latter one is the key concept in education .
Understanding ideas and concepts about lectures is very important in a student 's life because they teach the reasons why something happens in a particular way .

A person who memorizes or learns only the facts about a topic can answer many questions about it correctly but when he faces with a situation where he has to modify , repair or make comments about something he would not be very successful .
Knowing facts only is not enough for making comments on a topic or explaining the reasons for something 's happenning .
In order to successfully do these one has to know the answers for the questions like what is going on or what are the underlying principles which can be learnt by understanding the ideas and concepts about the topic .

Think of business life where people are faced with many difficult problems .
Many of those problems can not be overcame by not knowing what really is going on .
For example , in a software company which is designing and building a highly complex and huge program employers usually have to solve problems related to the algorithms used in the program or even create new algorithms to solve a problem .
Also , the solutions that are made must be not only successful but also efficient .
In order to create an algorithm which brings a successful and efficient solution to problem , the employers have to be able to understand the problem as a whole , think and comment on it and create new ideas based on the old ones or even from scratch .
This of course can not be done by just knowing facts .

As a conclusion in order for a person to be successful in his life he has to learn the ideas and concepts behind a topic because from my point of view , this is the most important thing that helps people developing new ideas or explaining current ones .
