I do agree very much that the advertisements make products seems much better than they really are .
I would say that the company that wants to sell a certain article , have to present it as something you must have .
Some times they tell you that will make you nicier , some time they tell you that it will make you smarter , but they allways try to convince the customers that if you have `` that '' product you will be better .
Companies invest a huge amount of money in the advertisemet field .
They know those maney are well spent .
This is increasingly happening since the world of the telecomunication has been globalize .
An example often mentioned is the coca cola .
In every corner of the world you go you will be able to see the advertisement of coca cola .
And it works !
There are many places in less developed countries where is easier to find a bottle of coca cola rather than wather , and some times it is also true that is safer to drink coca cola insthead of water .

Actually I believe that the companies , sometimes does not present them product better than they are , but they make the advertisement in a way you think that `` simple '' thing is now nice and usefull .

Of course behind this process there are plenty of professionist that just work on it all the time .
To make you feel , you cannot leave without that `` mobile '' phone .
I am old enough to know that the life is possible ( and may be better ) without that mobile , even if it seems to me , when I think about it , that it has allways exist .

Pruduct can be as good as they are advertised , the trick is , how to make peaople think that thay ca n't leave without it , and I am sure they will find a way to sell you anithing they want .

There is also a copmetition between them , I mean between the sellers , so that they have to show his products compare to a `` common '' one , and tell you the reasons why his product is much better compare to another , wich is usually less costly .
But this is another issue .
