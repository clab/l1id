As a matter of fact , we all can say that today there are plenty of cars all over the world , especially in big cities , but some people think that in twenty years there could be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I quite agree with these people for the reasons I am going to give following .

As a first point cars have made our lives more comfortable and nowadays moving is easier than in the past , but it is important to consider the huge quantity of pollution cars are producing .
Nowadays people take much more care of our environment than in the past , and I think that for this reason in the future different kinds of vehicles , moved by hidrogen , corn oil or electricity , will be avaible instead of cars .

Another point to consider is that in this century we have seen a rapidly increasing technological progress , that will surely lead to different kinds of transportation , like the flying vehicles we can see in so many fantascientific films , that will be of course a good alternative to cars .

Another important point to consider is that cities are getting larger and larger everyday , and every person who lives in a big city , as I do , can see how many hours we loose every day in traffic jams caused by the huge number of cars in use .
For this reason , I think that in twenty years people will probably buy more motorbikes and scooters , that are lighter and taht have better perfomances in traffic jams .

As a final point , nowadys people take a lot of care of their health and fitness and for this reason I think that they will start soon using bicicles and roller_skates to go to work or to schools , so that they could save the money of the fuel , avoid pollution and remain fit .

Concluding this short essay , I quite agree with the initial statement and I really hope that in the future we will live in a world free from cars , so that we and our children could live in a better way .
