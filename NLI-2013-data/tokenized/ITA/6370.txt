Do I think that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than nowadays ?
It will be marvellous , but it will not be happened .
There are several reasons that substain my thought .
a )
Past years ' trend .
In the period 1980 - 2000 , the number of cars bought in the industrialized countries has increased .
Every year new models are sold , cars are cheaper than in the past , new tecnologies are built inside ( airbags , ABS , an so on ) .
New laws have be iussed by goverments requiring more specific characteristics .
All these reasons have increased the number of new cars b )
New countries are becoming industrialized and rich ( see China , India ) .
Those countries have millions of habitans that in the future will require the use of new cars .
Do you immagine what does it mean a new car for each Chinese ?
How many car will be sold ?
What kind of business will be ?

c )
Oil energy is not considered to be finishing .
In the past years the issue of oil reserves was considered a world 's great problem .
But now , new drilling tecnologies have been discovered , more reserves have be found , so at the moment this issue is not considered imminent .

d )
People have to move faster than in the past .
Very often , peole find a job far form their own houses .
For that reason they have to use trains , buses , planes and cars every day .
How will they be able to get to work without their own cars ?
It 's a great deal , how can be solved if we would want to reduce the number of cars ?

On the other hand , if the number of cars will increase , enviromental issues will grew up .
Pollutions is the most important .
New forms of energies will have to be found to move the new cars .
