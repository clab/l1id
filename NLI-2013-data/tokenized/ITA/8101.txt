In my opinion , a choice between understanding ideas and concepts , instead of learning facts , cannot be made .
Both clearly appear to me to be important , for different reasons .
Understanding of ideas and concepts is the final purpose of the study , and it is what students will retain for all their lives , even if they would have forgotten facts .

Knowledge about main political ideas , or major historical processes , will always help them to understand the world they are living in , even if they could have forgotten what happened in Paris on July 4 in 1989 .
Knowing all details and dates of French Revolution is not helpful in itself .

But on the other hand , without facts , ideas and concepts are only empty boxes .
One could not understand where they come from .
E. g. in the case of French Revolution , it would be difficult to recognize contemporary French patriotism 's roots in the country 's Modern History .

Moreover , connecting concepts to reality is very helpful in memorizing .
Students can be best helped in learning if a complete frame is provided them .
The best way to teach could be to present students with facts , and then stimulate them to draw their own conclusions .
Anyway , it must also be noticed that the weight of these two skills - understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts - is different according to the matter or subject of study .

For example , in a Physics course , the most important thing is learn physic 's laws .
In this case , understanding concepts would be more useful for students than knowing how scientists formulated a certain theory .

On the contrary , without a strong knowledge of facts , many theories of Anthropology could not be fully understood .
Finally , what is the priority , must be evaluated differently case by case .
