I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
I believe that for many reasons .

One of the most important reasons I believe that is more important for students to understand concepts and ideas is that , by understanding concepts , they could develop a critical attitude to the interpretation of facts .
Students should encouraged to understand ideas that motivate people behaviours , rather than simply learning facts .
I think that should be the professor 's responsability to discuss in class concepts rather than facts , since it is much more challenging for students to understand concepts on their own .
At the same time , if students are interested in learning facts , they can do that by themselves , according to their specific interests .

The second reason I think it is more important to learn concepts rather than facts is that this way of learning lasts longer in time and it is less superficial .
For instance , I remember that when I was at school I had to learn and memorise a lot of `` facts '' that after two days from the exam I had already forgotten .
On the contrary , If you understand concepts and ideas , it is much harder to forget what you have learnt .
Students should be conscious of perpetuating a more `` durable '' way of learning and I think that learning concepts is a much more useful way to learn .

Being more motivate to learn concepts introduces the third reason why I believe it is more important for students to understand ideas .
Students are more interested in learning about abstract concepts , rather than facts because they could find that ideas and concepts are more applicable to the reality , without being compelled to a certaing period of time for instance .
If you have studied .
for example , the military techniques that have been used in a particular battle , they cannot certainly apply to the real world in which we leave .
On the contrary , if you have studied the concept of war and understand what issues it impliies , it could also be applied to the real world .
I think that students would be much more fascinated by the concept of war .

In conclusion , I believe that it should be given priority to students to understand ideas , by promoting discussions and debates .
This is a much less sterile way to learn and promoting education than learning facts .
