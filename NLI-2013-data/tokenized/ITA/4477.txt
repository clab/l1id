I do agree with the statement and I woud be even more radical : I think all the advertisements try to make the products better than what they really are .
sometimes they do not succeed but I think the intentions are always to present the products at best , no matter what the real features are .
The reasons must be searched in the aim of the advertisement itself : an advertisement is a message that must convince and persuade people to buy the product it talks about , and to buy that exact product and not some of the others on the market .
To obtain this aim the people who makes the advertisement can rarely escape the strong temptation to go beyond the line of an objective description of the product , especially if there are many similar products on the market a customer could choose from .
Therefore as the number of products on the market have increased esponentially , the advertisement had to introduced more and more sophisticated and intrusive mechanisms to get its aim of convincement .
In this way the real features of the product advertised have lost more and more attention , in favour of other messages which are indirectly and in a more subtle way connected in our mind to the product itself .
These messages make use of attractive areas like beauty , beautiful actress , actors , models are often showed connected to the product , sexual messages are also used in different ways , other messages that make use of some values and stereotypes , like brave men , happy families and so on .
Summing up I think advertisement has gone far beyond the limit of presenting a product , maybe ignoring the negative features and emphasizing the best ones ; It has become a powerful and intrusive activity that makes use of all the means it can to obtain its scope .
It not only wants to convince people to buy something instead of something else , it also tries to create the needs of new products and services .
Therefore it is not surprising that many times we are convinced to buy products by the way they are presented in their advertisements , or just because we want to feel like the handsome actor using that product , but then we have to face a strong disappointment .
