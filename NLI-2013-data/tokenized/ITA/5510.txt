I completely agree with the statement .
Nowaday advertising show you a lifestyle .
They mainly speaks about the feeling or how your life can change buying a products .
That because this is the most important way to sell products .
Playing with the feelings : a psycological approach .
The more advertisement are made the more a product became important in people identity .

Advertisements are less involved in the quality of the products .
To show the potentials of a good is less actractive .
If a product will became a trend a big amount of earns is sure .
On television the advertisement are like a short movie and the target is leave something in the people life style .

The `` slogan '' or `` jingle '' is important too .
It is part of our life .
It must be a funny statement .
Poeple must remember it easily .
But sometimes it 's not related with the quality of the product .

I my opinion showing a product at the supermarket or during an exibition is important too .
I particulary agree with `` test promotions '' .
For example , going at the supermarket and testing by yourself a new product .

In this way investiment in advertisement are more important then the work on the product .
Sometime it depends on the kind of products we are talking about .
