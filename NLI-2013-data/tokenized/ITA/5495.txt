Techniques of advertisement started to develop at the same time consumer began to spread in the world , and they improved a lot during the last century , especially as new media , like television , grow up .
As I always did jobs related with marketing and commercial activities , I am very aware of the fact that many advertisements make products seem much better that they really can be .
So , I will explain the reasons that this habit can have , and also the problems it can bring about .

Firstly , I think that a company always needs to provide consumers with an amazing image of its product .
As a result , an advertisement usually stresses on the better qualities of the product X , without naming any problem related with it .
For example , when Ferrari , an Italian sports car manufacturer , launches a new car , it most likely create an advertisement showing the new car 's great speed , but it does not really points out that this car would consistently consume lots of fuel !
This negative factor probably does not even interest Ferrari 's typical customer , and the car is presented as it really is .

On the other hand , while I think that usually advertisements present the real side of a product , I must admit that sometimes they are really excessive .
When a product is made for a specific purpose , it should not be presented as something different , just in order to create a better impression in people 's mind .
For example , many car manufacturers , like FIAT , another Italian firm , are used to create sports versions of their utility models , and they present them like sports cars .
The problem is that they really are not sports cars , but only slightly more faster models of normal cars , so the image advertisements introduce is completely wrong .

To draw a conclusion , I thinlk that it is really impossible to prevent advertisements to give the best image of products they can .
Most of companies really offer the truth of their products , just omitting some negative aspects , but sometimes they really lie to consumers , by providing false images .
However , I think that this is not such a common situations , and most of advertisements present products nearly as they are .
