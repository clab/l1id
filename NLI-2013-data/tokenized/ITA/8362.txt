yes , I agree with this statement , it is more important to understand what you are studing in spite of understand few facts , but it is also true that usually fact improve your knowledge of ideas and concepts .
I mean , if you want to understand an ideas you probably need an exemple , this exemple is the fact .
I show you a situation in which facts are extremely releated to the knowledge of a concept : we are in a history classroom , the teacher of an elementery school told his student that the second world war was a very horrorfy event .
The childrens understand the core of the statement , but they do n't know why it is so , or if they really do understand the thing .
So the teacher shows some event that occured during the war , like hitler 's policy , like olocaust , ecc ..
now children has theirown opinion and can actually say that war is bad , because thay understood the concept , that is substained by an exemple , that means , by facts .
IT can be also stated that learn facts over facts can not really help you , because if you do n't pay attenction to what you are saing you 'll never be able to have a true opinion on some topic .
You have to improve your knowledge by add ideas and concept , with an array of clear facts .
Infact it can be inferred that facts are the basis of knowledge because they prepare your mind to a concept , only in this way you can add information .
More over is true that understand ideas and concept is more useful for you than learn just facts , indeed facts can be learned with a mnemonic process , viceversa an idea have to grown up in you , it have to suggest you something .
In conclusion maybe the statement should be `` it is important for students to understand ideas and concepts , supported by an array of facts that cleary explain the content of those ideas and concepts '' , so I actually can say that I agree the statement .
