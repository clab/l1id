I ultimately agree with the fact that it is better to be specialized on a specific subject than to spread energy on different subjects .
However I say ultimately , because being and staying focused on one subject means always to discard other subjects .
I found the focus necessary and very important at a certain late stage of the personal working career or academic career .
The reason behind his you build up some `` Spikes of knowledge '' on a broad knowledge platform .
These sharp spikes of knowledge will allow you to promote yourself and to pull with you the society forward .

Having said that a deep knowledge of one subject can only be based on the focus on a certain subject and none us are born with a direction and with a goal ready to be accomplished from the day of birth .

Instead we should find our path and our focus by ourself and to do that we need a broad range of knowledge .
Think for example to the manager of a company who is very good financially , but it doesent know history , politics ...
He will always take the best financial decision and at the same time will always have a strong opposition inside his team or industry , because as he does n't know the history and the culture of the people behind the business , he will never be able to respect them .

Therefore I think in an early stage it is positive to broad our knowledge on different subjects like : history , languages , politics , arts , mathematics , Phisics , biology , economy ...
However at a middle or later stage we should focus or refocus on the subjects we love more or on the subjects which will give us more satisfactions .
As an example for this I can talk about myself .
I have received an education on differents topics from latin to mathematics , I have study engineering and I got a doctorate degree in engineering , however one day I found out that my life was in business , therefore after 12 years working in sales & marketing , I decide to build up my knoledge focused on business matters and to pursue an MBA study and I am sure that this will bring success to myself and to the people around me .
