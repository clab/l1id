My knowledge and my personal experience give me the reasons to agree with the statement .
Second my knowledge because it 's true that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities because young people do not have time to do it .

In fact , in the third millenium , the time is a very big and important source .
This concept born principally for the business world .
The famous statement `` the time it is money '' confirm my opinion .

From the business people to the young people nowadays there is a very small difference for management time .
As a very business man , the child must employ his twenty-four hours : school , sports and ...
television !
( social studies says that a child watch-in media - more of four hours of Television at day ) .
Last but not least , the friends .
Where is the time to give to helping communities ?
there is not !
Second my personal experience I agree with the statement that says that toung people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
When I was I child I like give my time to helping my community , obviously second my personal skills .
Nowadays I am twenty five years old and I have not got time for helping my communities .
First because my work do not give me more two free hours at day .
Second because I am married and I have got a son .
I must help my wife in my free time !

However I like help my community and I hope to achieve it .
In my opinion the solution og the problem is in the manage of the time in particular of th efree time .
