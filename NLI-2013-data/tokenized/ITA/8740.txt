In order to give a complete response , could be useful to distinguish between two categories of teaching : training and formation .
We can call training every kind of teaching that wants to make you learn how to do something .
Good examples of training could be the driving school .
The formation is used to provide to the students general ideas , that can influence their way of thining and approaching to a problem .
Of couse exaple of formation are in the school and in universities .

According to this distinction I think that for a student that is doing a training , is more useful to learn fact , meaning with facts previous experiences made by someonelse or a specific way to do something .

For the students that go in a school or in an universities , is more important to understand ideas , that are the basis of a coherent way of thinking .
The different importance that i give to the ideas and to the facts , in the two different kind of learning is strongly connected to the target of the learning .
Infact if we , for example , want to learn how to drive a car or a truck , and the getting of the target is obviusly shown by the the grade of ability that we get in driving , the experiences of someone or a specific series of actions is more useful than an abstract concept .
Of course the opposite appen with a subject in tha school or in the university .

Finally I could say that because of there are a lot of target in what we want to teach , is not correct to speak about one best way to teach , and what are the main concept that we have to learn , but we have to fit our personal interests to what we need from a class or a seminary .
