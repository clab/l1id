A fiftheen years old guy does n't know exactly what he want to do in his future , so I think it 's impossible for him to choose a specific academic field where concentrate all his efforts .
In my opinion , guys until 20 should investigate many academic subjects , so doing they acquire a varius cultural background that can help them to take the right decision for their future .
Later , they can specialize their knowledge in one specific subject , in order to reach an excellent standard in the cultural field they like .

I think this two step process of trasmitting culture permits to reach different target .
First of all , at the end of the university courses a man has attended , he has the possibility to discuss at the same level with the prior and brightness professors about the subjects that are linked with his studies .

Furthermore , the fact that his cultural baggage is also full of a widespread background , he can get in touch with other reality , speaking the same language and without misunderstainding .
For exemple , an engenieer is able to built a bridge or to calculate the right quantity of iron in a construction , but also he can talk with a doctor about a medical instrument .

The creation of this open mind could be not only the target of university courses , but it 's necessarily to look for it from the first years that guys spend at school .
