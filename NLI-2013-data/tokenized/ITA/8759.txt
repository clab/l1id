The choise between giving more importance to the understending of the ideas or to pay more attention in the learning of facts regarding student 's preparation is a point hightly discussed inside schools and universities by teachers and directors .

It is true that to learn facts is the basement for whatever kind of knowledge in every field .
Student need to study facts ; in this way they can face and compare the differences between the notions they learned .
This is a starting point in the building of the cultural background of each person .

Otherwise understanding ideas offers a real and a pratical way to cheack if students gets completely the concepts they are learning that is definitly important as well .
To provide a deep understanding of concepts and ideas allows student to grow up inside , to judge the world , the past events and the current affairs in a very open minded way .
It helps them to developp thei personality and their way of thinking .

My personal opinion on this topic is to do n't proivilege one system to an other .
I definitly think that they are both essential in the ppreparation of a student and that they should be used in a very balanced way .

The importance of learnig facts is something that ca n't be doubted from muy point of view but it is also true that in many case students that just lern notions without understanding the real concepts and ideas that came from these notions are not able to connect this concepts to the real world and to use them to grow up .
They remains simple machines full of important notions that are not only able to live their life in a producive way but also to use thenotions they learned to improve their life .
