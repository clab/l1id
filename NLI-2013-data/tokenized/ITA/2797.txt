This statement is not always true .
For example , if you talk with a young boy emarginated by the others or with an older man that travells a lot you revaluate the argument .
Anyway the sentence is true in the major parts of situations .

For young people is easier to enjoy life .
There are many attractions , places , events for them than for the older people .
Youngs can go to disco to dance , they have no problems of money , they can go on holiday and find new friends easier .
They have not any real problems or very difficult situations .
They do n't care about the future and so they can live the present completely .
The most important thing is that they are thoughtless and indipendent .

On the other hand older people have n't many situations to enjoy life .
People think that they fun only with cards-games or watching old movies but I disagree .
Old people have more problems than younger , most of them are healthy problems .
But I think that they love life and enjoy it .
Younger often do not care about their feelings and I think that this is the most important reason for their sadness .
I know that they like walking in the park but they will be happier if they stay with their family .
They are not completely indipendent and perhaps they need the presence of the others to enjoy .

I can find these explanation by my experience .
First , I am a young boy and I know how I feel everyday .
I think I really enjoy my life more than other people - particulary the older ones - but I know that it is not always true .
I have a friend that is often sad about life because he does n't like to do what the other guys do , he loves to study a lot and he has n't a girlfriend .
I think older people fun much more than him .

Then , I have a great grandmother .
She is the strongest I have ever known .
She loves to travell and she visits many places around the world .
When I see her I do n't find sadness , never .
I think she enjoys her life very much .

The statement is apparently true but it could be also false to a deeper analyses .
Everything is relative .
