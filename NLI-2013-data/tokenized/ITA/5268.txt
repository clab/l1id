I am agree with the statemant that most advertisements make products seem much better that they really are .
To support my opinion I have a series reasons .
I think that the presentation of a product is the most particular advertisement .
You imagine a person that go to buy a product and that at the supermarket he has in his front two products that are the same but they are different sealed .
Of course a person will chose the product with the most beautiful packet even if the qualities of the two products are the same .
This is an example to demostrate how our idea about a product can be influenced by simple factors .

I think that television is the most important advertisement that does to seem a product much better than it really is .
It is incredible how television influences the think of the people about a product .
I have many friends that stated that they purchase only products that they view at the TV .
They think that if a product is merchandised at the TV there is a good reason .
This is true in some case but it is completely false in others .
I think that it is necessary to valuate a product in all its characteristics and only after that to judge its qualities .

However people have not time and in some case the knowledge to do all this work to valuate a product .
So they buy the product that usually view at the television .

Enterprises do their interersts and out of dubts this is correct to merchandise a product .
So enterprises do their game but customers would do attention at the real qualities of a product .
