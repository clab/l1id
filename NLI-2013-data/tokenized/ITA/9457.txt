I agree the question because the student to learn facts they understand ideas and concepts .
Idea is base to learn the facts .
For example if i do n't know the concept i do n't understand the fact .
Perhaps for a limited facts i do n't know the concept but i know the facts but accoting to me this fact are very limited .
Since we study idea and the theory after we study the facts .
Another example is the gravity theory : newton since study all theory then he proposed the experiment and after he studied ena known the result of the him theory .
There are o lot of example who they suppose my agree for the question .
The concepts are very important they are interesting for the all facts .
In conclusion before to study the facts all persons undertand ideas and concepts .
