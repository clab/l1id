I agree when it is said that successful people try new things and take risks to reach theire purpose .
But I think that this is just one side of success .
In fact nobody could ever have success if he is not lucky too , neither `` successful people '' .
Obviously if you always stay attached to things that you already know , maybe you could live a normal life , but surely you will never have success and this is why I agree with part of the statement above .
Successful people always try to reach new goals and try to be involved in different situation .
This is a risk , because they leave something known for something But as I previously said , you have to be lucky .
Even in literature there is a good example of what I am saying .
If we analize the `` Malavoglia '' , book written by G. Verga , we could find exactly the explanation of my thought .
When ` Ntoni , one of the main character of the story , took the family 's boat `` La Provvidenza '' and sail to a new harbor looking for success , the fortune were not with him .
In fact he lost everything during a storm , broke the boat and that had been the beginning of a lot of problems for his family .
Maybe this could be too much strong as example , but I think that it give the idea of what I think about the statement to argue .
So , I certainly agree with the statement , but if I could , I would complete it saying that successful people are even lucky people .
