Personally , i think that it is very important for students learning ideas and concepts .
Some people think the opposite , they think that it is better and useful learning facts , they are against theory , but without theory , it is more difficult learning facts .

Learning some concepts or ideas it is necessary , it is the basis to achieve good results .
For example at university : if students do n't study some essential concepts of some subjects , they do n't understand the gist of that subject and the study should become a los of time .

Books have this purpose : telling the most important information , ideas about a specific argument .
For example : students that want to become a doctor , before working have to learn some important concepts , they must know the human body .

In every field of study , law , engeneery , science it is necessary having an abstract knowledge of the subject .
After having known all the useful concepts and ideas , you can learn facts thanks to the experiences .

Certainly , learning the facts is important too , but after a comprehension of basic concepts .
Another example : in science or biology , people it is important knowing and understanding some concepts , such us DNA and so on .
csyudents when go to school should learn basic concepts and ideas .
Facts are useful too , in this way they can do a comparision in the reality .
Pobably , learning facts is less boring than learning some concepts , that sometimes can seem not useful , but students without this knowledge would n't have a whole understanding of a subject .
