I think it is not so simple to explain about this .
Why ?
Because I ask this question to myself different times .
I am a student .
I study civil enginnering in Milan .
During my different exams I have found some important subjects : general subjects ( for example maths ) and specific subjects ( for example road construction or structural design ) .

General subjects help you to understand the specific subjects .
But the problem is this : when I will take my degree people will see me as civil enginner .
What I can do in particular is not important .
I think that university must teaches different accademic subjects , so you can have a wide vision about a work , like a civil enginner .
After a degree , every person will improve his Knoledge in one specific subject .
In my situation , for example , a civil enginner will specialize in road construction or skyscrapers or off shore structure .
It depends what part of civil enginner he like .
