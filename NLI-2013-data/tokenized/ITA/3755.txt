During my life I made many social work to support my community .
I think that I can disagree with the statement : `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' because i 'm a young person and i do its .
But I kown that this statement is truth in many communities and in many group of young people .
Infact many young people do n't make nothing to help or to support their communitie .
This situation is because they do n't feel part of their communities .
For example if a young person changes his home many times he ca n't feel a part of a community and i understand that is difficul to help some unknown thing .
also because if you do n't know a thing you ca n't imaginate of what this thing need .

Sometime young people are criticated by their communities and so it very difficult that young people want help them .
Sometime young people have really too many things to do .
For example school , sport , work ...
and they have no time for social attivities .
I think that is very important for a young person make some thing for his community because in this way he can feel able to help some one .
