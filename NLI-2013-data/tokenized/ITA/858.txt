I think that in our complex society is surely better to be specialized .
I learned it from my own experience .
At University I studied Communication .
When I applicated I thought I could really learn a lot about the specific mecanism of it .

But I was quite disappointed .
The main courses where quite confuse quite different one from the other .
I have had a very spread education , because I studied a bit of History a bit of Economy , a bit of Sociology .
But at the end I understood that there was n't anything that I really could say I knew .
I could facing lots of different situation and solve different kinds of problems .
And it could be very useful for every day situations or for a job without particular ambitions .
But we live in a very competitive world and it 's never enought to be prepared to the simplest .
The process of development we live , we can appreciate it or less , require a great specialization .

Someone who knows very well is own specific sector will have more opportunity to devolop it , to find new solution and to have good opportunities .
A person could also start from a not specific knowledge , that coul be the base for something else .
I think that should be better starting at the College with a specialization , but even after it , there is always time to try to understand the little field where someone should be brilliant and follow it .
A way to devolop this kind of specialisation could be with a Master of Science or with a PhD .
Knowledge is more spread in our generation , and it 's very good that more peple have the opportunity of a high level education .
But the drawback is that to be specialized someone should study more than the others .
And so he should go on with his own studies .
But the most important think at this step is to choose a Master that can really make the difference .
It 's better to study something so specific that just few people on the world know , than something that is common knowledge for everyone .
