This is possible .
But the problem is really searious and imminent , even if people takes no attention to this ( fortunately only a part of them ) .
All people likes beautiful cars .
The same car that is , by now , part of our life .
But today , we begin to consider problems deriving from the use of this objects , such as PM10 , emissions of CO2 , etc ..
problems that will be much more consistent if this affirmation is right .
But i think too that , to change this situation , to stop this running toward our self distruction , it 's necessary a very revolution , social revolution .
Because if only a group do this , the rest of society will continue to ignore this and to spent the same life they always spent everydays .
But i understand too that this problem is bigger than us , this is also a political problem .
If we consider that we can use alternatives energies , that we have , since some year , technologies to use it ( hydrogen motors , etc .. )
we will do a lot of thinks in favour of our life and of worl 's life .
But we ca n't !
And way ?
Because policy and money are oriented to petrol .
Petrol means richness in this contest , but at the same time means too death , if we continue to ignore the consequencies of its emissions .
So according to the affirmation of the question , i too think that in twenty years will be fewer cars in use than today , but i wish i see ecologycal and technologycally advanced
