I have ever believed that it is more important for students to understands concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
First of all , when one understands something he or she probably remeber this idea for a long time .
Instead when one just learn a fact , probably he or she soon forget it .

Next , when one understand an idea , it is possible to reuse this idea in similar contexts that simetimes have to be faced during one 's life .
As Einstein said , `` Imagination is more important than Knowledge '' , and I think that undertanding effort stimulates imagination , as well as the ability to infer .
Moreover , whenever one understand a new difficult concept , he or she feels a kind of satisfaction and become a little more confident .
I think that this is important to find out new breakthroughs and the world has ever improved thanks to new ideas and discoveries .

However , learning facts is important too .
For instance I think that studying history is helpful to avoid errors and mistakes .
In fact studying history , students learn bad consequences of wars and mistakes in general so that they can do better in the future .

In conclusion I think that that students should do their best in order to undertand the more they can from teacher 's lectures and books .
