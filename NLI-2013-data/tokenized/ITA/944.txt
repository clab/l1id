In my opinion , it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
First , I think that a general knowledge of many academic subjects is important , but then you have to decide a specific subject to study .
I think that is more interesting , because you can know this subject wery well .
For example , in italian litterature is very interesting to study the first editions of Canzoniere of Francesco Petrarca .
Of course ou have to know also the other litterature of the same period , but then you can pay your attention only on this work of Petrarca , and you can understand , for example , why Petrarca decided a particular order for all his poems .

Second , when you specialize in one specific subject , you can concentrate all your attention on this subject .
Instead , if you know many academic subjects , the risk is that you can know a little bit of every subject , but nothing very well .
It means that your study can be shallow .

In addition , I think that if you specialize in one specific subject , you love this sibject and you want to know this subject very well .
So , you can spent many time on this subject , but you will be not bored , because it is what do you want to do .

Finally , I want to repeat that also a general knowledge of many academics topics is important , but only as a support on a specific subject .
For example , if you study the history of the cinema , and you want to specialize in the french director Francois Truffaut , you have to know also the artists of the Nouvelle Vague , or the movies of Alfred Hitchcock ( remember the book written by Truffaut ) , or the classic french cinema .
But then you can pay your attention in the specific characteristics of movies of Truffaut , and it is very interesting if you like this subject .
