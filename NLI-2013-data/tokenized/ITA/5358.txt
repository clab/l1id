It is true that most advertisements make products look better than how they really are and it must be like that because , if you have to sell a product , you must overrate it a little bit , you must put in evidence the good qualities of it and you must hide its bad peculiarities .

it does n't mean lying but it means just not to tell some parts of the truth in order to convince people that your product is good to be bought .
What the Latins called `` dolus bonus '' is the usual overrating that the seller makes of his products and it is absolutely permitted .
On the other hand what is not permitted is the real lie : for example you ca n't say that you had got a prize for your product without having gotten it really ; you ca n't denigrate your competitor 's product in order to exhalt your product , in other words you ca n't do nagative publicity .

what is permitted is a comparative publicity : it consists in an objective comparison of objective datas .
I think that the Italian law , the one i have been speaking about is good and I think it should n't be changed also because it works and is respected .
What I do not like of publicity is that it creates needs .
It is very negative because , striking the emotional part of people who look at it creates in them a lot of needs that they did n't have before .

Nowadays people waste a lot of money in things that they do n't need and quite often lose sight of the most important things in life because they must have the last model of that watch , because they must have the sweater of that particular trademark , beacause they need to be trendy .

I think that this last effect of publicity is very negative and should be fought by expressing this point publicly and often .
