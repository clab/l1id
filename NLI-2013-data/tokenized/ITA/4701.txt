Nowadays we are involved in an overwhelming stream of advertisements .
There are advertisements everywhere , on TV , magazines , even on every corners in the streets and it 's impossibile not to notice them , even if you want to .
We are not only involved by advertisement , but also strongly influenced , even if sometimes we do n't admit it because we are sure that we are superior to certain things , but advertisements are more subdulous that we expect .
I agree with the statement , because we are so influenced that we arrive at the point that we buy one thing better than another only because more publicized .
And what 's the main problem ?
We trust advertisements too much !!

Advertisements manage to make things better because there are a lot of minds behind who think how to propose an article to the public , in a way that exalts its best features and hides the worst ones .
Adverstising in this way is not correct and loyal towards the public because it is n't honest about the features of the products .
How many times we have bought an article , thinking that it 's in a particular way or it does particular things while it 's actually very different !!
And what a disappointment !!
I get really angry when it happens to me .
For example , when I was a little child I saw on TV a really fantastic little robot which did ( which would have done ) a lot of things , such as bringing glasses as a waiter , going alone around the room , recording my voice and playing CDs and so on .
But as soon as I brought it to my house I cuold notice that he was able to do only half things that I expected ..
maybe because it was a really bad product ??

You can object me that this is a generalization , and maybe you 're right .
I think it too : not all the products are got better in advertisements and not all the companies make advertisements in this incorrect way .
Some people are honest and clear about their products and I really appreciate them , because I think that advertisement should be a means to get articles know to the public and to get people who watch TV or read the magazine aware that a particular thing exists , but as it is and not as it should be .
