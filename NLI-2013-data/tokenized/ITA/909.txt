I think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are many important motives to support my personal idea .

First , a broad knowledge of many academic subjesct is important to introduce a person in the work enviroment terminate the university study , because that garanted many possibility that one that have specialize in one specific subject .

Second , a knowledge of many subjects garanted to have a good culture preparation and is a satisfaction for myself and is important in everyday life .
I have allready frequented the university and I think that when I begin to work if I find a good job perhaps I have to specialize in one specific subject attend specific course after work or in the weekend , but at the moment I think that is better to have broad knowledge of more subjects as possible .
