Today cars are considered very necessary for every travels we have to do during our life , but I strongly believe that the number of cars will decrease in twenty years for several reasons .

The first reason for the decrease of cars is that as the years go on the petrolium and consequently oil reserves will dramatically decrease and this will influence the cost of carburant , which will increase a lot , and so people will be not encouraged to buy a car knowing the fact that oil is so expensive .

Secondly , there is also an ambiental reason that make me think that the number of cars will decrease , the fact that cars pollute air and so are a risk for our health : for this reason I think that governements will not encourage the bought of new cars by taxing them a lot .
In addition to this , our cities are not only polluted but also full of cars which make moving in the city low : as a result of this situation I think that the mayors of the cities will not approve an increase in the number of cars in order to avoid that towns will get full and full of cars .

I also think that in the future there will be a raise of different means of transport such as trains , bus , metro in order to decrease the pollution of the air , in fact it is demonstrated that trains and metro are more echological than cars ( and they are also more comfortable ) ; as a result of this increase of alternative means of transport the use of car will be destined to decrease since the majority of population will travel with trains or metro .

An example of this decrease of cars is provided by my own family , in fact I and my parents have decided not to buy a new car for my birthday because it costs a lot .

For all these reasons I think that the number of cars will decrease .
