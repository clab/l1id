I agree with this statement of course .
Nowadays young people are not involved in helping their own community .
For me the problem is young people education and our modern way of life .
In fact in the modern society the most important thing is succes , and the first thing that is related with this is certanly the idea of competition .
Since we are child everyone ( parents , relatives , friends , teachers ) teach us that the only thing that is important is to be the best .
A good example is a football match where for everyone the only one goal is the victory , and partecipation and meeting with other people is not important .
So we tend to see our social life in this way too .

We do n't have to help the community were we live , we have only to fight against the others and try be the best one .
And the greatest example of this concept is given by television , that nowadays is very important in young people education and so it is responsable of what they will do in their communities .

But there are also other reasons to this attitude .
For example in the modern society averyone ( also young people ) have really a little time to try to help the community .
We have always something to do , and it is alwaiys something too mutch important to spend our time helping the others .
But often it is only a simple illusion .
Young people in fact tend to give a great importance to things that are really ridiculus .
For example for a kid having time to play with videogame ( and a kid is able to play for hours and hours ) is one of the most important thing in his life .
This is a great problem .
Nowadays young people tend to misunderstand what are their real priorites .
And this mistake is helped by our modern concept of competition for success .

In the end , young people think that helping their own community is not important because for them there are many other thing to do and helping the poor and the sick is not a way to improve their status and compete for the success .
This attitude of young people is very tragic because acting like this demostrates the they are loosing the real values of human beings .
