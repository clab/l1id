My job brings me to different parts of the world all the time , and every day of my life I see young and old people enjoy their life in different ways .

Who enjoys better ?
Young or old people ?

I would start saying that young people have an advantage over older people .
They have more energy to spend and , apparently , they never get tired .
This energy makes them to do a lot of things , for example staying up late at night , going to different parties all the time , sleep as less as possible , drink and have fun constantly .

Young people , though , do not have one direction to follow ; they move in all directions .
I see them sometime rushing into things .
For example , I used to have a friend that never had a moment to spend togheter with me because he had to go to so many parties that he did not have time for me anymore : that 's something that I do not agree .

Having fun all the time seems to be the main topic for young people ; they do not have a clear goal in their minds for the future and sometime this can lead to a disaster .

Going to party , drinking and maybe smoking looks like a good deal at the beginning , but in the long term it can ruin your life .
I had another friend that unfortunately died because he was having too much fun ; he was totally drunk after a party that , unfortunately , died in a car crash while driving home .

From the other side we have old people that have different ways to have fun .
Let 's start saying that old people , usually , have less energy than young people .
They take life at a slower pace and that 's why I believe they can enjoy better what they do .
Take , for example , an old couple in an island in the Bahamas ; they can relax all day just watching the beach at the sea and that 's all .
A young couple , in the same situation , would wanted to do something : snorkeling , fishing , etc ..
They enjoy the same situation but into 2 different ways .
Still both couple have fun .

I consider myself still young but with some experience so , I start thinking to have fun like a young crazy teenager but , when I start , I slow myself down and really enjoy every moment in what I am doing .

No matter if you are young or old , I think that having fun is part of our daily routine to enjoy our life in this world .
