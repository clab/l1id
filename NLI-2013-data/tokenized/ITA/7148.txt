i 'm agree and i hope that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
today the use of car is more extended and ofthe it 's do n't have a real fundation .
In fact , even is true that the lifestyle is more different by the lifestyle in the past century , even if people have more need and more activities to do , for exemple jobs , sports activities , social events ect .. , is also tru that more people would't have problem and private themselves of own confortability .
For exemple analize a tipical family composed by five person , who are father , mather , first son of eighteen years an second soon of five years .

in a family of five person , today is n't a surprise have four car !
Why ?
One car for the father , he use own car to going job , and when he have finished to work he going at the gym .
Another car is for the mammy , who use own car to going with the second sons to the school and then she will go to work .
another car is for the first son , who have own car for own personal need , like going to the school , to the cinema or going to the gym .
All of over said is possible with One car !
Maybe is necessary get up early in the morning and spend more time across the street , or in the traffic , but in this way you will have the opportunity to spend more time with own family , you can say a fact or an experience of day .

Morover you can resolve a big problem of modern societies .
The destruction of natural sistem .
Is more important to save the development and the grow of the word , save and protect the nature by the smog and more other complex problem , suc as serra effect , sea polluted , air unbreath , ect .

Reducing the number of car for each person , or using public trasportation , such as metro , bus or a lot of services wich you can use , you will reduce the traffic and so also the smog and you will have in the future more healthy for you and your family .
