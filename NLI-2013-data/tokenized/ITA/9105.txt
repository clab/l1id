I do agree with the statement reported below for the following reasons :
1. As I personally experinced in my academic history , facts are not easy to remember for a long time .
This was expecially true when I had to study a lots of subjects at the same time for my exams , after a week or two I could no longer remember most of the facts I learned but on the over end I can still remember the ideas and concepts .
A good example is related to my history class , I cannot rember all the data or the facts that occured during the modern history , but I can still remember the ideas and the concepts that have been expressed in those time .

2. Ideas and concepts that you learn in class when you are a student are more usefull in the real life when you are not a student anymore .
You can apply them not only in the subjects in which you have learnt them , but also to different areas .
This is not possible with facts that actually can be applied only to the subject they are related to .

3. Students through the studing of ideas and concepts have also the great possibilty to improve themself by learning a new way of thinking and by having the chance to learn new concepts which have been experinced by great persons ( e.g.historical persons , scientists , etc . ) .
Expecially in this period of time in which young people follow wrong ideas expressed through the modern comunication system ( e.g. media , internet , radio , etc ) .

Finally , for the reasons expressed above I think that concepts and ideas are more important than facts , for a better future for our students .
