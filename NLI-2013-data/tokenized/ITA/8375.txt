First of all , we must consider that the two things , learning of concepts and learning of facts , are strictly connected .
I think the ideal way for a student to obtain the best result from his studies , is to learn facts and then analyze the ideas and concepts surrounding that fact .
For example .
It is very important to know the fact that there has been the first world war , but it is necessary to understand which have been the ideas and the reasons which lead to start something highly dangerous and that would have caused thousands of victims .

The real problem , I guess , is that is often confused the meaning of `` learning a fact '' .
During schools , for example , teachers require us to learn by hard dates , names , cities and so on , and this lead to forget the principal fact .
Moreover , while less important things can be forgotten ( I will not remember the exact day of the end of the frist world war ... ) , the contrary is for the fact .
( I will always know that there has been a grat war around 1915 ... )

Furthermore , ideas and concepts may be more difficult to understand , but once you do it , it 's almost impossible to forget them .
Besides , they can also change your thoughts , your way of live .
They can make you spend your politic vote for one or another party ...
they can lead you to become a politician just to try to change something you learned .

It has been the idea of freedom which took Gandhi or Martin Luther King in the political world .
It has been the concept of racism which leads me to hate Adolf Hitler , and not the fact of the second world war .
There has been the ideas of Ras Tafari to give strenght to jamaican people reaching their freedom .

In other words : some facts are important ; this is sure .
But the learning system should not be based on them !
It should be based on motivations and reasons which caused that event and on the ideas that were born by the event .

If the system was organized in this way , I think we would have less `` mechaninc '' students and more conscious future citizens and politicians .
