I disagree with the idea of a society formed by selfish young people .
It 's not completely true .
It depends on their family , their friends and their social background .
Indeed , if you lived in a family where your parents think only about themselves because they are concentrated only on their job , it would be difficult to think helping the communities .
In this case , the son or the daughter usually thinks about her or his studies , toys , things , goods and not about the others who can need their help .

If I lived in a different family where my parents have taught me to help other people and also animals , the matter would change .
We can start also from our home and our daily routine .
If I taught my son that it 's important to help me doing something , he could do the same in other occasions when he is not at home .
If my son stayed at home in front of tv all the day and I said nothing about that , it could be negative for his sense of help and responsabilities .
So all begins from the education .
The education to help someone is the basis .

It does n't depend on young people but on their education .
I have met in my life a lot of interesting young people who help every day their friends or people in need .
They always belong to a catholic society or have many strong values such as family , love , friendship , sacrifice and so on .
They always believe in something : God or politic values .
Or they believe in some utopistic theory such as communism .
I never met generous and unselfish young people without strong values .
So where young people are not interested to help their communities is where there is a lack of important values .

I believe in some strong catholic values and I try in my free time to help other people in differrent ways .
I 'm a teacher and I work in some cases without earning in order to help some poor people .

There is another important point and it always depends on education : young people sometimes have too many hobbies and appointments in a day and so there is no time left for helping people .
If a parent prohibited this kind of day routine , young people could be less busy and they could have more available time to help others in need .

In conclusion , in the souls of young people , there is the desire to help the communities and the adults have to help them to do that .
