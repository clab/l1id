I agree with the statement that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts rather than learning facts .
Learning facts is just a metter of remembering details .
When knowing a fact is required , one can always go and check himself on a book .
Lots of book have been written with that purpouse and there are a lot of written materials which can be useful in order to check a date or a name or whatever .

The hardest thing is understanding the reasons why a certain fact has occured , the ideas that have brought to a specific event , the concept that lays under a certain episode .

I think that the fondamental issue is to teach the students to become confident with this process .
For example , once that a student is tought to understand and recognize the causes that have brought to the second world war , details about when where who and what can be left to several information that can be found in books .

On papers and other materials it is possiple to find a lot of informations about the mere facts and every time it is needed , one can go and check .
Students should be rather tought how to use these informations properly .
Ideas and concepts provide a frame in which it is then possible to orientate themselves , in order to give sense to things which has happened in the past , which occur in the present time or which could happen in the future .
We have to remenber that past can explain the present and somehow foretell the future as well .

If students learn how to collect ides and concepts from facts , they are then able to give a place to mere facts .
Well , I cannot denye that knowing facts and details do make sense itself and somehow it is also important for knowledge .
However I think that is not the primary thing .

First of all ideas and concepts are worthy to be understood , then details come .
So , in conclusion , I would like to outline again that understanding ideas and concepts is more important then learning facts .
