I quite agree with the statement'intrinsic meaning .
I would personally support the idea that the kwoledge of concepts and ideas is extremely functional in order to better understand facts and phenomena .

I would like to clarify my point , stressing the important functional relation that exist between the two cognitive processes .
Actually , I would get beyond , saying that undersanding concepts and ideas is essential in order to ace real phenomena .

For instance , we know that many wall street investment banks sistematically hire Phd students from top US school , for their researche departments in order to get a better understanding of what was going on around the economic world and for bringing into their organization the great theoretical kwoledge they have .

On an overall basis , It'also real that learning facts gives an important opportunity for students in order to put on to a practical dimension what they have learned from books .

a clear example of this approach is provided by the Harward business school teaching method .
It was totally based on bringing real business cases into the class , so that the students could touch the essence of the reality , and at he same time , improving their problem solving skills .

I would better suggest to see the problem in its complementar nature , saying that the two aspect are both important and students should enrich their knowledge regarding concepts and ideas but simultaneously go in depth analisying real life facts , getting a more pragmatic view .

This approach is intended to be largely supported by stronger relationships between Academic environment and Corporations world .
