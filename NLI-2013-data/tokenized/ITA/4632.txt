We are living in a particular period ; we are hitten by advertisements : when we walking along the street we can count a big face with same product on his/her hands , or when we are listening to the radio we can listent to a particular voice that try to convince our to buy something , when we switch on the tv there is always some spot with a funny music ...
in each place , in each situation we are covered by advertisments .
It is easy to ask ourselves if the products that are presented are so brilliant .

I think that a lot of time it is so : most advertisements make products seem much better then they really are .
I can say this for different reasons , first of all because the obiective of the company is to sell their products , and so they use all the way that are necessary to convince people to buy it .

Second because a lot of time people buy a particolary products not for its quality but only for its mark .
For example we can think about food : what are the differents between one biscuit to another ?
A lot of time the difference is the price : the prodoct that is well-known is more expensive than the other , but if we taste the quality we can ' t understand the difference because they are equal .

Another example that I could consider is about clothes .
There are a lot of people that want wear only one type of , for example , trausers because there is a littel spot on it .
Probably it is only to be faschinable , but this trausers , that costs a lot , isn ' t different from another .

The last consideration that I can do is that advertisements hit our unconscious attitude and so a lot of time we choose prodoct that is pubbliced in unconsciously way .
