I definitely disagree with the statement because , if we look at the present growth rate of cars in use , I think we could realize that we will face a substantial increase in number in the future and therefore also in twenty years the number will be higher than today .

It is possible to explain my position with my following considerations .
Developed Countries like the United States , the majority of European Countries together with Japan are experiencing constant demand of cars since more and more people are becoming independent and therefore need a car for going to work , for their spare time spent in travelling , reaching other people to different places .

If we also think that Developing Countries like India , China and maybe some Eastern European Countries and some South American Countries are facing an important positive change in their growing economy , we can infer that a lot of more people will feel the necessity of a car for everyday trips .

Moreover we can consider that cars have become a symbol other than a mean of transportation in the last years , especially for some wealthy societies .
This situation can be seen at the same way for the Developing Countries in a few decades , therefore this can be a sign to support my disagree with the statement .

My thought is also supported by a holiday trip I made in April this year , when I went to California in the United States .
When I was there I realized that more than in Italy people need a car , because of the long distances and because of the fact that they live independently from their family .

Since the United States have a very advanced economy and the other Countries are going into that direction , I presume that even the Developing Countries will face that economic evolution step .

In conclusion I think that the number of cars will increase in the future due to the fact that can be related as a consequence and a step of the growing process of the economy of a Country .
