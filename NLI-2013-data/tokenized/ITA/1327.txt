The society has changed enormously in the last ten years .
Now is fondamental to have an academic instruction to work .
Some jobs are widely spread like those in economic fields .
Some others are more unusual as those in engeneering fields .
For these reasons it is worth choosing a career well based on what one wants to do .
Here in Italy also the university has been transformed .
Now you have to attend many courses and take many exams ( about thirty ) in the first level in order to be a doctor , in wide general sense .
Making this , you study a lot of different subjects that bring you on a wide knowledge .
Sometimes , unfortunately , somebody can loose hiself between too many exams , but other times one can discover what he really wants to do .

In fact you can decide if stop your studies or go on by attending courses of the second level .
The second way leads you to take other , more specialized exams , that allow you to be a magistral doctor .

Now I am studying to obtain a second degree and so I am sure about this fact : the more you study different academic subjects the more you have chance to have , and sometimes to choose , a good job .
As regards my work field , sound engeneering , it is better to choose subjects that involve computer and video , but it can also be usefull to insert in the curriculum vitae exams based on music like musical perception or psycoacustic .

After the first impact with the new subjects , you will be very satisfacted of what have you done and you will think that wide cultural human beings are more interesting than the poor one .

Companies and industries will hire you if you show that you are more capable of changing field of work and if you are more adaptable at their needs
