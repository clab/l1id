I think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The first reason is that the car is necessary to do most of tha activity that a person does .
For example , if a person wants to go to swim and the swimming pool is far from his home , he take his car to go there .
The car is very important for the family .
Infact parents need the car to bring their child to school or to go shopping .

Another reason that I think will make the number of cars increase is price of them .
Infact forty years ago , for example , cars were very expensive and so only a part of the population could buy one .
Today there are lot of different models of car and almost any family can buy a car .

I think that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in use also because they are reaching a very high comfort level .
Today a person can have a long trip without arriving tired .

Another reason is that cars are being more and more safe .
For example twenty years ago if someone have to make a long trip he probably had taken the train .
Infact if a person had an accident with an old car he probably hurt himself seriously .

For these reasons I think that in next twenty years the number of cars will encrease a lot .
