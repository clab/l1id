I think that the life is only one .
Because the live is one I want to live it very very deeply , intensly .
The life learn me that .
My mother died when I was sixtenn years .
His died learn me that the life is hard and very very short .
After his died my favourite phrase is : `` I want it all and I want it kwon '' from a Queen songs citation .

I want to write this preview to make you to know deeply my ideas .
The young people are inexpert about the life infact are more and more coragius than the older people because the older people know the dangerous and they want a relaxed life .
The young people want to discover and tryng all that in this word beacause the do n't know that .
The old people this discover hed been maked when they are young .
When the people grow up , the responsability gruow up , the mind change .
A boy have less responsability than his dad .
When with have less responsability we can ejoy the life more than that have more and more responsability .

The responsability change the mind of the people , chance his preference .
Example , than I was you my preferece are ( in order ) : first playing , second friends , third family .
Now my preference are : first my family , than studies , third the work .
I think that the my dad prefernces are more different than my , and I think that the my grandpa preferecence are more differe than my dad .

There is a think for each age .
The young enjoy the life , live life very very intense .
The dad ( or the middle age ) make , produce , work .
And the young people ( the third age ) learn to the young people the life !

Life is a circle and and it are repeating for every generation from milleniums years .
