I think that concepts are colse to the idea of model and system .
Facts are close to the idea of operations .
In this way , I think for students is more important to learn how models and system work than to have a detailed knowledge of the operations or facts .
Probably we can use an example to better explain my opinion .
For istance a student could know everything concerning art hystory : the art movements , the life of the main artists , chronological facts .
This knowlege is an important base to start a career as an artist but it is not sufficient .
I mean that to be a good artist the student should learn and understand the logic and the principles , important to produce creativity and art .
If the student 's intention si to become a painter , he need to understand the color system , the concept of composition , the rules how to evoke emotions and how to capture viewer 's attention .

I think that we can also use another example to present this point of view .
Schopenauer , the philosopher , said that it is not important to read the newspaper everyday in order to undesrtand the world , as well as it not imporatnt to read avery second on your watch to check the time .
In my opinion this is a brilliant example of the importance of synthesis and learning .
Facts are important to shape the reality , facts are also important as background for our learning .

On the other hand , ideas and concepts are important to create debates , new thoughts , new innovation and creativity .
Even if inspired by classic rules , ideas for example were at the base of the Renessaice , a movemnet wich means re-birth .

So , facts are mainly importnat to help students in finding the concepts behind them .
So fact are an iportnt sorces of information and inspiration but ideas are the key ingredients able to move the world and mankind ahed .
