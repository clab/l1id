I disagree with the statement because It is not allways true .
Infact there are many young people that do not know the real meaning of `` enjoy life '' .
They like drink alchool and smoke or take drugs .
This two things are all that they would like to enjoy their life .
But I know many old people that know what it is the felicity .
Firstly they appreciate the slowly of life , the kindness and the importance of friends .
They know the meaning of drink a tea whit friends .
Also they can dancing an walking like nobody know .
Lastly they know the meaning of life , but If it is not true anyway they will know how enjoy their life !

According to a magazines in the future there will more old people than young people .
I think that it will be good because If the old people know how enjoy life , all the world will be happy .

There are , also , a lot of cultural difference between people .
For this reason it is impossible to know how the world will be .
If you have a zero cultural backgound and you live in a country you will know the felicity , but if you have a kind knowledge that it is not complete you will unhappy .
In both of this two examples you do not know your grade of happyness
