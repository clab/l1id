Eventhough a tour guide can provide the traveller detailed and additional information about a place , I believe that the best way of travelling is in a group of people that self manage themselves .

To me , travelling represents one of the finest and happiest moment of my life .
It allows me to free my mind from the everyday routine through the discovery of a new country , different people , social customs and behaviors .
For this reason , I like to organize my journey by myself , leaving open a lot of possibilities during the travel instead of planning the package `` ex ante '' with a tour guide .

Furthermore , nowadays it is very easy to obtain relevant information about a specific journey .
Travellers guides and the incredible amount of information contained in the internet can defintely help filling the informational gap of a traveller without hiring a specific person from the place .

In my opinion travelling is a constant process of discovery the reality that sorrounds me .
This is a learning by doing process in which every mistakes leads to a potential unexpected and positive situation that otherwise would n't had occured .
On the other hand , the presence of a tour guide would inevitably make the journey very precise and strictly scheduled without allowing for the possibility of errors and unexpected situations .

This combination of failures and successes makes me feel part of the place I am visiting and , at the same time , it gives me the incredibile opportunity to get in touch and talk with many people .
The contact with locals is crucial in the discovery process of the travel and the presence of a tour guide would undermine a lot the ability to interact with other people .

For all these reasons i strongly believe that traveling alone or with a group of good friends led by themselves is the best way of enjoying and taking advantage of the full potentials of a journey .
