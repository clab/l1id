I 'm not sure that in twenty yers there will be fewer cars in use then there are today .
Probably many nations , for example China and India , will increase their number of cars because today in that states not many people have a car and many persons use the bike or go on their foot .
But these nations now is working so much that I think that probably soon more people than now will have the money to choose and to buy a car .
And we have to remember that in Asia there are more than one billion of persons ( only in China there are now 1 , 2 billions of abitants ) !

In Europe ( expecially in the west Europe ) and America ( naturally the north of America ) , instead , we are in a different situation : we have many cars and the traffic in our cities is very strong and dangerous for our life .
Many families has two or three cars and the Italians spend many time in their cars : all days there are much traffic in all the most important streets of the country .
Maybe it will be better if many Italians leave their car at home , so they would need of only a car for family , there would n't be the smog ( even if this would be a myracle ) and many people would be more happy .
Surely our nature and ambient would be more happy .

But the situation of east Europe is similar to China 's one ; that part of Europe is poor and I think that in future that states will became richer than now , so many other people will buy a new car .

So I think that this problem has n't a solution : probably in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today , but probably there wo n't .
Only the time will can solve this partcular and difficult problem .
