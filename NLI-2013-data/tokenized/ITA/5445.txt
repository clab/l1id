Everyday in our lives we can see products ' advertisements and spots almost everywhere we go .
They are specifically studied to attract us , to steal our attention , thus making us think about them even for few seconds , even if we do n't need what they are advertising .
To do so they have to be direct , colorful , funny .
Everything they are advertising must appear beautifull , amazing , of great use or even really tastefull .
So yes , I basically agree with the statement , and we can often have evidence of it .

For example - a really common one - we see on tv or on a paper something advertising something to eat , it seems wonderfull , hot , tasty and it also has a low price !
I have at least to try it .
When we go to buy it , we can see it is half the size it seemed and it is not even that tasty .
Advertisements can influence a lot your thoughts .
Not to talk about kids .
If they see a toy on tv , it 's shown colorfull and huge .
They NEED to buy it .

What I said works the best with foods , toys , something uncommon or that we do n't usually see .
Items used in our everyday life cannot be shown to much better than they are , because we know them , we know how they work and what they can and cannot do .

The base idea to advertise something is to make it appear fantastic .
If you want to sell it it MUST appear fantastic .
To do so it can seem even better than it is .
