I personally do not agree with the following statement .
Today , people are used to live using their cars and I do not belive that they can change their habits in only twenty years .
For example , I live far from the place I study and to reach the University I drive my car for 30 minutes everyday .
Expecially in Italy , where I live , trains and busses are not really efficent .
People here need the car for living , different ways of moving in Italy are really not popular .

However , I think that in countries like Japan , where trains and busses work well and are always on time , things might be really different in 20 years .
The conciousnes about the fact that pollution is destroing nature and wild-life is higher .

Anyway , I find that people are usually selfish and absolutely not able to change the world .
Only few people care about our world and think about the future humans and animals will live here .

Furthermore , I find that Governments should be more responisble when this problem is tackled .

Cars will not be fewer is the countries do not give a different way to move to people .
Tomorrow I have to go to the University and if even I love my country and this world , I will use my car because there are no other ways for me to get to the University .

Twenty years are not enough to change people 's mind .
I think that if people start now to use less their cars maybe in a century something might be seen , not earlier .

Anyway , the use of cars is still attractive because of the promotion companies like BMW , TOYOTA , AUDI do .
Cars is still a business , it is still one of the most important businesses of a country and it is absolutely not easy to change something in people 's mind when there is no interest in the society .
