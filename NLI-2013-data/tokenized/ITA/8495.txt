I think that understanding a concept about a subject gives you a better knowledge of it instead of learning the fact related to it .
A theory gives you the mental preparation to face all kinds of facts , studing only facts does n't get to anything because facts can change during time .
If you see and study a fact , you can get the highest level of preparation on that specific issue , but probably it does n't give you that standard procedure you need to deal with it .

I am an university student , my degree course in economic is primarly based on theory , while another university in my city bases its courses on practice ; people of that university always say that they 'll get the best preparation on their subjects because they are studing them from the real world ; as an example they watch the every day stocks variations and use models to describe them .
I wo n't say that this is unusefull , but I think that instead of it , it would be better to study as many models exist in order to get a complete preparation of all kind of stocks markets .

Learning a theory enables the student to understand thousands more , and , more important , could give the student the possibility to think with his own head and enterpret all kinds of events with a single way of thinking , which can adapt quickly to any situation .

Moreover , if you think about how any kind of exam it 's made , you 'll find out that what is asked is usually not what was said by the professor in the classroom , but is something related to it , something new that you must elaborate with your acquired skills , otherwise is just a memory test !

To conclued I think that as we are not like computers recording data , we should use our brain to understand facts in order to know how to deal with other different situations that we will face .
Experience can help , but is not enough .
