In my opinion people do n't have success because they had tried new things and taken more risks , but because they had done what they knew they do well .

To become successful people it 's better to focus only on what they already know and are strong in .
If you have a very good preparation either for your experience or for your academic knowledge , you will be successful without taking risks or trying to do something you are not good in .

This , because you can sell yourself in a better way , for example , if you have to find a job , specially when you are just graduated and begin to apply for a work for the first time in your life , it 's important to demonstrate what you are able to do thanks to your skills and know-how previously acquired .

In addition , if you are very strong to do something because it 's not new for you , without accepting risks you 'll show a great capacity to do it , although you 're doing that just for personal satisfaction .
In both cases the more you are sure in what you 're doing because you know how to do well , the more people can trust you and obviously they also will ask you some advices .

On the whole , being successful people because you are very expert in what you are doing , will be easier than when you are taking risks even to do something you are very weak .
In this way you can reach a personal satisfaction just doing what you are strong in and I think it will be surely a big personal satisfaction because what we know how to do well is what we like to do .
