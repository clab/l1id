Young people feel life inside , while old people loose their energy .
This is the main difference i think .
An old man has a lot of experience inside him ; he could feel tired sometimes : things are n't even more new , they do n't communicate the same sensation they were used to do in the past .
In fact a young person knows that he has a whole life to live .
He enjoy living looking at the future , while an old man lives looking at what he has lived in the past .

A young person has the enjoy to create his future catching each single sensation coming from the outside ( the world ) .
A baby is usued to enjoy everything because everything is new ; a very old person may feels like he has no more reason to live , and so his life becomes something like `` Waiting for Godot '' , waiting for something trying to find some distraction to spend life .
We have to underline that physical condiction is essential for enjoying life too : normally young people feel better so they can do a lot of things that old people ca n't , like sport , that rappresents an important way to satisfy ourselves .
The preoccupation of healty is another main attitude that contribuites to make old people to life in fear .

But this is n't always correct : it depends even on the society .
I explain : in this years i can see that many friends of mine has lost their way of enjoying life ' like they are missing something .
They are just living waiting for a better future condition .
My grandfather instead was used to have fun in each single moment of his life ' even when he was said he would have died .
It 's wired I think .

In my personal opinion I think we have to enjoy life always bacause it has given to us a great opportunity and we must not let it go away .
