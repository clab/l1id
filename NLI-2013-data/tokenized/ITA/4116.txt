Actually , i do n't think that the statement `` youg people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communties '' , is completely truth .
Personally , during the week I am always busy because of the university and the work , and during the weekend I usually enjoy with my friends and unfortunatly , this kind of life is similar to all my friends lifes and the main part of young people lifes .

But I have acquitance with some boys , who really feel the needed to help other people an the communities .
For example , one of them , who is just 23 years old , decided to give all his free time working in a hospital as volunteers .
Now they are 3 years that he enjoy working there .
He spends all the weekeds , every saturday night working for the community .

Another boy I knew last year , left as voluntear an now he has been working for 6 months in the south America .
In the village where I live , lot of people give part of their money in charity : Rotary association is very popular , and there is one minority club that it is only for young people .
But also lots of other associations are supported by everyone .
I think that this kind of actions mean that we can support an improvement not only giving our time but also giving a financial support , and that we are not indifferent about the topic .

Probably , the majority of people are not used to think very often about helping their communities , and facts refelect this ; but in this last years the government has put lots of advertisements on the radio and on television , and my view is that now people are getting more confident with the problem that we have in our own communities .

I think that we are paying more attention at this topic in this year than in the past .
So probably young people in general have n't lot of time to helping their comunity , but they are interested in doing this , and someone of them choose helping people as the main activity of their life .
