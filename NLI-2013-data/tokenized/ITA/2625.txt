I agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do .

There are at least three reasons that can help support this point of view .

First of all , young people receive enjoyement not only from the experiences they actually live but also from the hopes and dreams they can build .
Young people have a lot more to live yet so that they can indulge themselves in fancying every kind of future : this helps them being optimistic and enjoy life in a more positive way .
Older people on the other hand have already shaped their lifes : they presumably have a job and a daily family routine from which it is usually difficult to escape .
An adult cannot change his life or begin from scratch , so that they cannot enjoy dreaming of a different life .

Secondly , young people perceive every experience they live as new and fresh : this helps them live life with more excitement .
Since they have not seen a lot in life , young people live feelings and emotions ( and every kind of experience ) with a sense of excitement coming from the discovery of something new : every sentimental relationship seems to them as the first , every music or movie or book seems something never seen or heard or read before by any human beeing .
Growing up and becoming older , people seem to perceive life more as a routine : in the eyes of the older ones , anything seems to be someway already known or seen or lived .

The last reason , is that young people have more time to enjoy leisure activities .
Since they are mostly student , they do n't have to fulfill a lot of the obligations that having a job implies : hence , they have a lot more spare time , that they can use in every kind of recreational activity ( like spend time with friends , practice sports , play music ) .
Even if they have a job , they usually do n't have to take care of a family : also for this reason they have a better chance to spend time in a more entertaining way .

Older people , on the other hand , have to comply with tasks that both having a job and running a family need : considering all the time spent on the job place or dedicated to family , there is not much time left to be used for individual entertainment .

In the end , my opinion is that younger people have a more reasons than older people to enjoy their lifes : they can dream of their future lifes , they live their actual life as something new and fresh and , finally , they have more time to dedicate to more enjoyable activities
