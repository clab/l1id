It is highly probable that people who have reached success in life have taken certain risks that others were not inclined to undertake .
In my opinion this statement could have a certain credibility , even if a satisfying scientific evidence seems hard to be obtained .

On the onset , the issue is to define the term `` success '' .
There could not be clear agreement on its significance .
If for many success means the holding of personal properties or of large quanitity of material goods ( money and the like ) , for others could be exactly the opposite .
Success for them is simply the reaching of a happy life , being satisfied within the family and the close community .

It is true , however , that we could agree in general terms on its perception .
A successful person is the one who has reached a certain social prestige , who maybe has a certain public visibility or has influenced in some way the lives of other members of the community or the society .

In my opinion , it could be true for certain persons to socially succeed ( attaining a social visibility ) and become known by others .
This is so because curiousity as well as capability of taking risks are part of humanity .
Intellect makes human curious and willing to explore new territories .
The natural qualities of humans make them to aspire to reach new goals thorugh specific projects .

For sure we have examples of successful people in many fields , like the humanities the finacial and industries and similar .

We can think about Plato or Aristoteles or Enstein or great leaders , like Julius Cesar or poets like Dante .
They did something that distinguished them from the others .
They tried new things .
Einstein explored what was unthinkable before him .
Dante left us one of the most complex and inspired poem .

For many of them , however , it seems that the driving force is not the search of a personal reward for its sake , but the search of an interst in life coupled by curiosity and service to the society .
In breif , if we know today that they gained success , it would be very interesting to explore what were ( and still are in successful people today ) the motivations at the base of their projects and risks .
