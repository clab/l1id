Students usually have many kinds of different caratheristics .
Someone can memorize a poetry in few minutes and play it without failing a single word , someone else can understand very easily difficoult concepts of math or phisic .
I am one of the last cathegory and i think that understanding an ideas or a concept is more importatnt than learning facts .

First of all , whenever I have learnt a fact without understanding the logic meaning of it , I have forgotten it after some weeks because memorizing details is useless .
I think students can remember ideas and concepts longer then facts and , for this reason , they can maintain informations even after long time and this is the main porpouse of shool education .

Another important reason is that brain developes much more thinking about an ideas or a concept than memorizing something .
In fact , trying to figure out a problem , collecting thougths and making choices for reaching the best solution is more stimoulant for a student who learns to use his or her brain .
Instead , learning just fact memorizing details , brain works in other ways , developing not the most important and usefull parts of it .

Thus , I support a teaching method based on understanding concepts and ideas , much more that a method based on memorazing informations and facts which I think they cannot last long time .
