There are two types of people in the world in my opinion : who is brave and who is not brave .
The braves are that people who can look at the future and take risks , the not braves cannot take important decisions for their own future .

I believe that in his own life every person must risks and fights for the things that he or she wants to do , without thinks too much time if his or her is right or wrong .

For example , I did not want to go to university after the secondary school and I began to work immediately .
After some year , I have think that I would go to the university , but without stop working .
Since that moment , I am studying and working in the same time , without think that it is more difficult that to do only one thing , becouse it is a target whose I want to arrive .

I do not agree with the people who wants to have a quiet life without any kind of risk , becouse that people do not have the capacity to think about their own future and they are happy to remain at the same level of life for many many years .

Another example that I can give is that I would do the engineer after the university and not the employee for the rest of my life , becouse in my opinion is better the life of a free professionist , who can spend his time and his money in the way who he can think is right , than the life of the employee , who is not indipendent and has the same conditions of life for many time .

Sure , one employee do not risk to do not have his payment , but the life of a free professionist in more exciting and can gives to me many satisfactions , altought it will not gives to me the same rassicurations to have the payment every month of the year .

To finish , one life without risks is one life without target .
