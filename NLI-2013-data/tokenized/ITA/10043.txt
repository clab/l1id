This is not completely true .
Indeed , I think that the success is reacheble by the both ways .
Some people build emperors doing the same thing all life long , quite as a south-italian farmer emigrated to Canada after the World War II .
In Italy he was a well known mozzarella producer , and once he estabilished himself in Canada he began the same activity , with the same method , day after day , and now he is one of the most rich man of the country , exporting his famous mozzarella throughout North America .

Maybe nowadays in a such competitive market this kind of experience has become rare , because of the globalization involving all the 5 continents that causes the rise of new competitors everywhere and because of the growth of the multinational company with uncountible capitals .

What insetad is real , in this statement ' is that in our own life , fossilize ourselves is a practise to avoy .
A new idea , a different vision of life , market , and so on , can cause a sudden success into our work place , family , group of friend or even into our school , and is important to elevate ourselves from the regular level of people in order to hang a better position into this selective society where almost everyone has the possibility to study , to find a job , to be competitive in a single word .

A clear example of this situation is the advertising world .
How can I convince people to buy my product ?
how can i make them understand that my product is better than others ?
With ads obviously , but we are surrounded by ads !
In the streets , on television , on the radio , on newspapers , on the web , during sport events , everywhere basically , and as a consequence of this , people is no more pay attention to ads .

So an advertiser must find something new , something that attract the attention of the crowd , and so he has to take risks , to innovate his approach .
Who stands on his position too long , will fail for sure .

So in conclusion i think that the sentence of the topic fits most of the aspects of our society , but is not to take as a law .
