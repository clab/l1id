In the past there were no television , pubblicity , no advertisments and so on ..
Nowadays are changed a lot of things and the inventions in this field have producted a lot of effects : positive and negative effects .

For example ..
The invention of television has allowed the possibility to show everything , to explain , to understand and learn things of every kind .
But there are a lot of aspects that we must consider to understand clearly the situation about the advertisments that are made .
I think about these question ...
if they are effectivetly connected to reality , if is all true what we can see on the screen ..
or not ?
First I make out that the producer that has a specific farm , like food farm .
glasses farm or something else , surely wants to sell his product and so I think that he pays someone that has studied about pubblicity design to creating a sort of slogan , or to invent a way to make his product commercial and not unknow .
He have to sell and make profits so he must find the best way to do it .

Secondly I think that people are quite interesting about `` new-entry '' , so everithing that represents something of different from before is well seen .
For example new pc game that advertisment explain like a game that will change your day , or new television program , or new chocolate drink that can make you more stronger .

In a sense I try to say that I agree with the statement baceuse I think that the final work of advertisments is to convinced people about the characteristics of it , to make sure them that they will see results ( like a gym advertisment , but ..
do you remenber that you have to meke sport and no one else do it for you ???? )
they will change or they will be better .
And how the advertisment is made is not total under controll of someone : truth and false is together and often products really seem much better than they really are .

Finally we must pay attention about what they really give us .
