Young people , like me , do not give enough time to helping their communities .
i perfectly agree with this statement because i think that young people is always completely involved in their own life and in their passions .
I am not able to explain the reason that causes our distraction from our communities .
Probably our education makes us find satisfactions from other aspects of life .
The style of life is completely different from the past .
We spend all the day listening to the music , watching television , going around with our friends , studing ...
and so we have no time to think about our communities .
We know that it could be important even for our own future , but we prefer to think about the present and live the moment that is flying away ...

we try to keep every think , every occasion , every second that is going away ..
and we are not able to stop and think about so important things .
We are sure that even in this way , we are going to change the world ..
because change happens ..
but the problem is : will it be better ?
we do n't know ...
but we will think that we were happy when we were young ...
because we lived every moment with an excessive intensity !
i want to demonstrate what i meant to say ..

there are about eighty words left ..
if i had wanted to think i could have written a lot of other things ..
but now i 'm thinking that i 'm tired and my lovely friend is downstairs .
She 's waiting for me and i want to go there ..
is it a matter ?
