I 'm agree with this statement for many reasons .
In twenty year , or maybe in less year , there will be a decrease of car 's number .
First of all there are too many cars in our city and in many vehicles there is only one person , I hope that in future will be fewer cars because people will understand how use cars .
For example , I live in milan , my city is a very big city and it is very easy see how many are cars on our streets .
I think that , if people want it , it is possible that in one cars there are 2 , 3 or 4 person , in this way there will be not some traffic .

In second way there is a problem about petroleum and this element can change the approach that person have with their car , the huge cost of petroluem can limit the use and in consequence the number of cars .

Moreover there is the problem of pollution , cars came out many toxic substances and in future will be necessary change about motors and , if it will be not possible , we can obbligatory decrease number of cars .

I 'm very interesting about this argoument because I study chemical engeneer and many of my courses speak about how it is possible reduce the amount of pollution or how it is possible find a new way for move respect of the use of car .

In the end I 'm agree with the statement : in few years the number of cars will decrease even if people think that cars are necessasry .
I think so for problem correlate with use of car but also because I hope in new technology .
In fact it is possible that in future , not too far , there will be more efficace , more beautiful and user vehicles than cars .
