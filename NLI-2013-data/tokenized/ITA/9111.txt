The ability to understand ideas and concepts could be considered the base of education .
This skill is necessary to learn effectively facts and rules , but also to develope own opinions and draw consequences on what learned .

For example for schoolchildren , learning the mechanisms that are behind the basic rules of mathemetics , is the first step to be able then to solve problems and find solutions .
It 's therefore important that they understand what it means , for instance , adding numbers , before knowing the result of the operation itself .

Facts and rules learned without knowing their significance risk just confusing students , who may have a lot of information , but can not organize them into a logical framework .
The further you go with the level of education , the more important abilities , other than pure knowledge of facts , will be .
Fore instance , while writing a thesis in higher education , you start from reasearching and collecting material and information from many sources , but then what really matters , and what you will be evaluated for , is your own contribution : developing ideas from facts that are just the base of a complex study .

I would also add , that nowadays , the Internet made a lot of information easy accessible to people .
What is important then , is finding the relevant information , organizing and developing it .
Remembering facts , datas , numbers , is not anymore so important when a lot of sources are available and so easy accessible .
Unlike the oral-based cultures , where memory was essential for knowledge , today other skills are becoming more and more important .

I think that understanding ideas and concepts , means also being able to understand people , different opinions and choices : it is not just studying , it also helps to live and handle cultural conflicts that are inevitable in the multicultural society .
Therefore the capacity of understanding other points of views , is more and more important to manage the cultural difference , which is now part of our life , and which I believe , in most of the cases , represents a richness .
