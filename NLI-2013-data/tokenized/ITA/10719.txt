Basically I agree with the statement but there are also many cases that demostrates that I could possibly be wrong .
I think it ^ s true that successful people always try to do new things , but I also think that a successful man is a man who makes his thing well .
Maybe trying new things could be a reason of a success but I don ^ t think that trying new different thing causes directly a success .
Surely being able to do various thing or types of works it ^ s a great gift .
In the past many groups of people has had the need of adapting on the works they need to do to survive .
For example a man which escapes from fallen down airplane and finds himself in a desert island has the need to adapt himself to do various types of works ( like finding food or building a home to repair himself from rain ) instead of survive .
If he reaches his objectives he is surely a successful man .

A man that only does specific kind of things that he knows well could be a successful person in the same way as the one which always tryies new things .

The positive thing about making only what you already know is that maybe you could make it better .
Probably a man who tryies always different things could not execute those things very well in the first time .
A man that does what he knows well can surely offer a more quality and specified product .

For example a baker that makes bread from twenty years can surely sell me better bread than a maths teacher that does the baker from only one week .
In conclusion I think that success is not related to the risks token or the ability to try new things , but it is related to the ability on doing things well .
