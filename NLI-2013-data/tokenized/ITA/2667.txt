Yes I agree with this statement .
I think that young people have so much time to spend how they want .
Tipically young people do not work and they can do more things than older people .
They can dedicate time to their hobbies , meetting some friends , going for a walk , playing a game or going to the the cinema .

Young people have no specific time that can constrain their actions .
Unlike , older people have it .
A yuong guy can go out in the evening with his friends , going into a pub , coming back late in the night and if he doesn ` t want , the next day he can stay at home instead to go to work as older people do .

Older people , anyway , can have some advandages .
the most important is that they have a lot of money that younger people don ` t have .
with that money they can buy what they want , as : car , computers , vacations and traveler in general , house and etc ...
all things that can improve their lives .

Older people have a lot of responsabilities that young people don ' t have .
They have maybe a marrige to maitain some children to grow up .
Young people in contrast have more indipendence but is true that at least they have to respect the orders of the their parents .
In conclusion I confirm my opinion ( that is the same of the task question ) : young people enjoy life more than older people do .
