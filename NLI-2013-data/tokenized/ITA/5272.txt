Everyone knows that adverts are made on purpose to sell , it means that products shown on televivion or in magazine do always look much better than in reality .
sometimes it happens that you watch an advertisement on television , which tells you that a certain product is exactly what you need .
Basically they show you many evident qualities , like bright colors or enormous sizes , that are supposed to belong to the object , but once you arrive in the shop you get a huge disappointment : the thing you expected to be big and amazing is usually much smaller and does n't really look like the one you have dreamt about .

This point can easily be explained mentioning the psychology role in making advertisements .
In fact , what products really need for being sold , is expectation .
it means that the value of an object is determined by the psycholocical impact this object is able to have on people .

Provided that behind every advertisement there is the long and hard work of a brilliant psychologists equipe , people should always try to look at icons through an objective point of view .

For `` objective prospective '' i mean that people should try not to be influenced by external - and sometimes subliminal - messages .
messages i am talking about are generally used by brands to drive people 's mind in a certain direction .

So , according to what i have just analysed , i think that it is very important to be aware of what the bid compasnies are doing through advertisement .
In my opinion advert - mechanism is a clear example of brain washing : without even know it , in some ways we are forced to do something they want : buy their products .

I reckon that this situation is very dangerous and terrible at the same time : i mean someone is controlling us , isn ' it scary ?
