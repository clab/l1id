I agree with this statement without any doubts .
It is sure that without any advertisement a product would not probably be known , considered and , as a result , sold .
But it is always necessary to consider the limits between use and abuse and to be really careful with the public you are talking to .

Or better , I think that people working to make a product wonderful , or simply desiderable , know very well how weak we can be , depending on our age and on our emotional state .
And the problem is that they profite of this .
Here are some examples .

If you are a child why not to have the best video-game , may be the last one presented on TV by the world champion video-game player ?
And if you are a teenager , a girl looking for his prince , why not to buy the body parfum showed by a beautiful heart breakear ?
Then , if you are fatty , why not to buy the lower calories food of the most famous mark , even if it is twice more expensive than a normal one ?
And when you are getting older ...
woul not you buy the long life skin lotion ?

It is quite sad , on my opinion , that we could be so unconsciously controlled by our material needs .
Now my question is : could my life be so different if , instead of buying those products , I will have some equals but less expensive ones , which do n't include the high price of advertisements ?
I can be sure of not .

But the paradox is that me too I constantly fall down in these traps : someteimes , a pair of shoes for example , it is not so important , but I totally did wrong when I booked a holiday with a famous travel agency telling about the amazing life in Tunisia , in fact I did n't enjoy at all that holiday , and it cost me more than the same travel with an other agency , probably more sincere and less promising .

So to be careful of what is presented to us is a good start .
Then to look for essen
