I think that this is a generalization of the young word , and so I think that it is not a true statement .
Might be true the fact that a part of young people does not help the other person who need their help , or does not put their ability or competences for a ` better word` , or simply a ' better local community` , but is also true that there are so many guys that every day make their ` good action` , or work hard for a right ideal to find a sense in their life .

For example there are so many boys and girls that dedicate their free time to helping poor people , or to visit sick people , or simply help an old woman to cross the street .
Is not that also an act of civil sense ?

On the other hand I think that pheraps nowadays it is difficult to help the community , because the community makes see and think you what she wants .
To explain , if a young boy does not respect some civic rules , or he does not care the others , it is just because the community does not teachs him to give importance to this important aspect , because the community makes see a winner model that is not a good model of person .

But the young person have more than sometimes the necessary strenght to go on , indipendently by wrong schemes , to track his ideal of life , that are really good ideal of life .

I think that it is the point : a young person is more encoureged to change the society by his inexperiece , but at the end is society that changes him , and corrupts him making of him an adult person .

In fact this is the main passage from the young age So my opinion is simply that the society might change to help young to change her .
