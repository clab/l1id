That 's surely a good issue .
It is impossible to me to look deep into the future to find an answer but , for now , i would certanly hope it .
Everyone understands how it is important to limitate the pollution today , everyone knows that in some hours it 's almost impossibile to walk around .
So , from a moral and ecological point of view , we have no other choice but to reduce cars .

Does this will happen ?
That 's completly different .
We know that alternative vehicles are growing faster ( think at the ecological bus ) ..
And that 's sure a good hint on how the future may look like .
A lot of people today prefer to use tram and bus to reach offices and other work stations .
Because cars does cost too much .
And that 's another issue .
As long as oil based products will move cars , people will look to cheaper way to go around .

There are plenty of cities all of over the world saying NO to the cars , in Italy , just to give you an example , you can use your car depending on the number of you car and on the day .
That 's a good start .

Another option i have to consider is a restyling of the concept behind a car : everyone would love a car with low pollution rates , free from the oil , cheap to use and why not ...
with a new look .

We know that reaserchers are working night and day to create something that looks like that .
The issue reads `` twenty years '' , well i 'm sure that in twenty years we 'll see the birth of a new car generation and so the old cars will get fewer and fewer .
And do n't forget the development of alternative vehicles .
Mix up together the the two things and you 'll have a picture of our future and so yes , there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years .
