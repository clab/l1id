I think advertisements are soul of commerce .
No one can sells his products without advertisements .
I agree with the statement because I have found a lot of product that seemed much better than they really was .

I think the reason that could take a seller to use that kind of advertisements is that people are really impressonable .
If they see an advertisement that promise them a lot , they certainly think that the product that advertisement represent is better than another one which promise them less .
Nowadays I can say that a very large number of sellers use this kind of advertisements .

The first example I can talk about is diet products .
In the television we can see a lot of advertisements saying that using that product we could lose a lot of kylos in few weeks or days .
We immediately can understand that this it is an advertisement that makes the product seems better than it really is .
We all know that there is n't any product that permits you to lose ten or twenty kilos in two weeks , and if it exists , it will be really dangerous .
I can talk about this product also because my mother tried a lot of this products , and no one of them has given the results she wanted .

Another example I can use is banks or financial group which lend you money .
In their advertisements it seems like that you can use their money and to gave it back is really easy .
But there are a lot of clauses , generally writed small and in the end of the contract , that explain what you have to do to give their money back .
Generally here you can read about really high tax of interest and other problems you will have to confront later , and that give you more troubles .

The last example is shampoos .
In the tv advertisements sellers promise you that their product will make your hairs bright , strength , difficult to break and many other promise that generally are n't true .
I tried a lot of shampoos which have no one of the characteristics I have said before .

In conclusion I can say that advertisements generally make product seem much better than they really are .
