I disagree with the statement because I think that people can risk also when they are not sure in their experience .
In my opinion it depense , principal , for thre personal behaviour of the person .
If I was a brave man my instinct could involve me to risk , for example , in activities where I can have an elevated damage ( like economic business , private live ) .
If I was an afraid man my instinct could be involve me to put a brake in my activities and in all of aspects of my life .
Personally I was an istinctive man and usually i take decision without think the negative aspects but only the positive .
An important example in my life was the decision of live with my girlfriend .
It was a decision that i took looking only the positive aspects ...
I took my baggages and luggages and I fly with her in an other country .
After some days the situation changed ...
The risk that I had n't considered was very very high .
Maybe the logic solution cannot be an other but in my mind I know how to doing .
