I partially agree with this statement for many reasons .
Young people have less responsability , they just have to study or work , or both , but after this they usually have spare time to spend with friends , having fun .
This is a nice aspect of being young .
Young people have their things to think to , but rarely they 're responsable for someone else 's life .
Older people have more to think to .

They usually have a family which brings a lot of joy , but also a lot of stress ; financial stress for example , parent 's have to think how to earn many to go on , to make their children study and have fun .
Young people do n't have this type of problems and this makes their life more enjoyable , in a certain way .

Young people want to feel strong emotions and live new experiences .
Everything has to be intense : loud music , disco , staying out late at night .
Older people already lived these emotions , they know how it feels to be young , but they do n't need these feelings anymore .
They belong to the past .
I think that when one gets older , he finds joy and happyness in smaller things .
For example just by spending an afternoon with his family or old friends .
There 's no need to stay up until the break of dawn , but just to live life and appreciate its simple things .

This does n't means that older people cannot have fun , it 's just a different way of having fun .
A young man 's challenges are ( in my case ) : university exams , human relations , family life and a job to pay CD 's and amusements .
Growing up one needs more , or ( I think ) should need more than just having fun dancing at the disco .
After the studies one needs to find a job , someone to love and to start a new life on its own .
A marriage is a great accomplishment .
The partner and the sons become the most precious thing one could have .
This is happyness .
I do n't believe young people enjoy life more than older people .
The way of having fun changes with time , but life is always enjoyable .
