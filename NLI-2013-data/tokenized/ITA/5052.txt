I think advertisements give us a different image of a product .
This is possible because advertisements always manage to affect our mind and our imagination through television and newspaper .
They modify our perception of a product bulding an entire world around a simple object .

When we watch an add on the tv , we never pay attention to what is advertised .
We are caught by slogans and images .
Sometimes we do n't even see the product itself being showed .
So , we just remeber the name of the firm and sometimes the catchy melody that accompanied the add .
Television usually advertises brands , not products .
That 's way we may not get a proper idea of what we are going to buy .

In newspapers products are often advertised by movie or sport stars .
In that case , we stare at the picture of the star and do n't notice the product .
We associate that good to a character of the show business .
In this way we do n't care of what we intend to buy , but whom we are going to look like after we bought it .
We look at images , not goods .

Both pictures and tv commercials are now made by very famous artists .
We are attracted to the advertisements for themselves .
It seems to me that the more an advertisement is tempting and promising , the more talent is required to hide the real nature of the object .
The beauty of an add obscures our idea of the product .

Advertisements are aimed to built a web around a product .
A chain of associations that must influence our behavior as consumers .
To make us buy something that maybe we are not going to like and enjoy .
Television , internet and newspapers all offer a great and profitable way to accomplish this goal .
