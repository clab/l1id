There is some student who prefers to study without understand the principal ideas and concepts of what he is studying , because he thinks that it is unhelpfull or also a waiste of time ; other students , in the opposite way , prefer to pay more attention on the concepts rather than on the mere facts .
I am in this second group for many reasons , whose the principal ones are three .

The first reason is that I am not so able to study by heart , because of my often failing memory .
Therefore I prefer to study the logical processes , the reason and the links of different events , rather than the mere facts and information about them .
For example , studying history , I prefer to learn about the causes of a fact , while it is more difficult to me to study dates or events .

The second reason , that can be linked with the previously one , is that , when a student understands the logical bases and the reasons of various facts , it will become easier to him to learn the facts that derived from that because he make on his brain a logical map of all the arguments he is studying .
In history , for example , it is helpful to understand what event causes another one , and why ; in this way , it is easier to learn that the first one occurs before the second one , and thus it is easier to learn dates .

The last principal reason that makes me sure about my agreement with the statement is that to understand what a student is studying is more helpfull for him , not only for the graduation , but also and mostly for his life .
In fact to understand something that also is not interesting improves people 's mind , and we can become smarter .

To sum up , though somebody thinks that we can learn only the facts from what we are studying , I am sure that it is more important and productive to understand ideas and concepts , and sometime it is also necessary to me !
