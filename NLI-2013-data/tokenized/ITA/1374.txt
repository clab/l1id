In my opinion having broad knowledge of many academic is a very positive opportunity for people , than to specialize in only one specific matter .
I think that different cultures , so consequently different subject is an important way to front tha world .
On the other hand having different knowledge of different subjects is a very positive thing .
With this different subjects people could have many different experiences in their life so it represents an open mind on the all world .

In opposite to this i think that many people with close mind thik that it is better but specializing in only one specific subjects represent a bad idea .
I believe that a person who have a broad knowledge is a complete person , for example i think that people have more interesting caratheristic if they have broad matter in their mind .

In addition to this i think that people with a broad subjects are better for their life or for their personal daily issue .
In my opinion they have another position in thire life than who receive d an other learning .
studing art , math , history or science allow to people to hav many kind of subjects in thir mind so they could begin many possible works in thir life , and it is a very inportant aspect that we consider for the future .

in my personal life i received broad knowledge and i think that i have many solutions for my futute , i attend aan artistica accademy but in my future i can have an architect , an artist , a historian teacher .
People need to choose the best way that they have to make to tha future and i think that with general knowledge they have many positive possibilities .
I agree up to this sentence because i think it is the best way to find different ideas or things in the world .
I hope that i have make a clear tesk about my idea , and i agree with
