Nowadays young people have n't time to hep their communities .
I think that this statement is true .
Nowadays the interesting of young people are different to doing help for their community .
There are a lot of reasons because it happens :
1 ) young people do n't receve an aduguatly educations by own parents : i think that the parents should do an adeguatly education about helping the community , because so they do n't only play with their friends , and because it is another way to stay with other young people .

2 ) they think only for theirself , to buy new dress , to play football ,
and other activities that give more importance to own personality .

3 )
They think that other persons can help their communities , and so they ca n't do nothing for their communities .
They do their help only if someone tell they what they do .

When i was young I helped my community when I had some time : so I went to a social place where live some small children who have n't their parents and I played with they ; or with other friend and parents we cleaned my city to some rifiutes that other bad people put on the street or in the park .
This are only some example that all young peolpe can do to help the community : it does n't take a lot of time .

Only person can do a little actions to help the community , because the community is formed also by we and because the help that we do now , tomorrow someone will do it for we .
