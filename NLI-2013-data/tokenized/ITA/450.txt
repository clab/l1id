I 'm convinced that having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than to specializing in just one specific subject .
There are several reasons why I agree with this previous statement .

First of all , having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects allow us having a personal culture .
The school give to the students the capacity of studing a substantial number of subjects , so it 's important having a knowledge of them for ourself , as a culture for being well prepared in general .
Because I think that knowing differents subjects open more our mind than just focus in one specific subject .
In fact knowing just a specific subject is like a limitation .

Second , the knolwedge of many academic subjects give the chance to have more chance in our life .
Indeed , knowing a vast amount of informations show your potential with other people .
You are prepared and have what it takes to be considered as an efficient person .
Occasions in life can occur , because you are prepared in many subject so in a future you could do several works .

To sum up , I think that many reasons exist why knowing many object is better than just one
