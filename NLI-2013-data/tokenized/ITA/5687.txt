I think that fooling the consumer , who is the one that buys your products , is like auto hurting yourself as by doing this you only lose more customers every day .

If we look at modern day society we can notice how we usually get bored of something or someone very easily .
From weddings that last one day , to events that the day before are hyped and the day after they take place they are forgotten , we usually change our mind more then one time a day .
And this caused the increasing amount of mis-leading ads as the modern day society demands for high quality products at a low price .

This is why I think a product that has been launched onto the market must yes be advertised , but with a moderate dose and in a truthful and candid way .
It is in human nature in fact to want something badly but once you have it to throw it away as after one day we are bored of it and disappointed by it .
In other words : `` the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence '' .
Also its very hard to regain the confidence and trust of a person after losing it the first time .

If a product is too hyped , too publicized and too much talked about , yes it will sell good on the first day , but soon after the consumers will realize that after all what they have been waiting for a long time and thought it was perfect turns out a bad product full of flaws .
In fact we tend to be more critical and analyze a product more accuratly the more we anticipated for it to arrive .
This disappointment , that trust me , will be shared by many others will cause a series of complains on the internet or between friends , that will warn you that that certain hyped product is not as good as it is and will cause in other people a sense of afraidness of spending a fair amount of money on a product that will surely disappoint them .

This is why I think a product should be mderatly pubblicized and when it is , describe what the product CAN actually do instead of filling a commercial or an ad full of asterisks listing the exception or the particular needs that the product must match in order to operate as the ad says so .

Again by representing the average customer , in my humble opinion , I think companies should start commercializing their ads in a realistic ways and stop promising things that do not even come close to the product 's capabilities .
Thus if companies actually advertise a product correctly then they would have a bigger success than advertising it in a mis-leading way , making a fool of the customer , who at the end , is the one that buys the product .
