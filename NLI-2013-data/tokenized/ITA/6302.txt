Like we have learned from the book entitled `` The end of History '' , in wich the author held the thesis that after the fall of Berlin wall the history had come to an end , trying to make forecasts on such a long period as 20 years is very dangerous , but I feel fair comfortable with saying that such a diffused mean of transportation as the car will not disappear in two decades , and even that the number of cars will actually increase .

The car is the engine of modern economy , because it allows fast travel , which in turn means that people with the right knowledge or skill can be quickly and easily collected in the place where they are needed , thus rendering easy both to use their existing knowledge and to build new .
I am thinking about workers commuting to their job places or professors reaching universities by car .
Public transport has proved inable to be a full substitute of cars in this role , and as new economic powers like China and India emerge from poverty they will develop their car population as rich countries have already done , and this process will take more than 20 years , in my opinion , so that the number of cars will keep increasing over this period .

Of course my analisys cannot foresee an eventual tecnological revolution that could render the car useless , like the car has done with horses in the twentieth century , or a major economic breakdown which would render cars too expensive to be useful , but such trend breaking events are unpredictable .
If the actual trend of the world will hold , it can be asserted that it will take more than twenty years for the number of cars to start decreasing , if it will ever do so .
