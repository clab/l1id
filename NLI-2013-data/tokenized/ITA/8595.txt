I do agree with the statement .
Facts are important above all as example or expression of the concept wich is behind them .
Facts are for sure important because they can explain things .
They can help rememberimg a thing ; they can focused the attenction on a peculiar aspect of the subject , can be helpfull to explain or capture the ideas wich they follow .

You can remeber all the facts that you like , but if you had well understand concepts you will be able to recombine them in different and original ways .
You may be able analize even different situation following the same concept .
To explain better my point of view I 'll take some accademic subjects as examples .
For istance It is not important , to me , remembering dates and hours of every single battles as long as you can remeber how the war went , why it broke out , who were fiting and why .

In history what it is crucial is the general setting of the period .
Another good example can be even a scientific subject as the chemistry .
It is not essential to remeber wich specific salt and wich peculiar base are combined ( facts ) , as long as you rember the way the reaction goes and wich is the result ( concept ) .

Reffering to enother subject as sociology what it is important , for example , it is to remember that someone 's behaviour can be modified by the society 's response to his action .
Keep in mind every single possible society 's reaction it is not that crucial .

To resume my point of view in few world : If I can propely understand the concept and the idea of what I 'm learning I will be able even to elaborate them and to use it even in different suituation .

I can recombine concepts in different ways , I can adapt them to a variety of sistuations I might need to analize .
