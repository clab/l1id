Nowadays advertise occupies a central position in our life .
Some person belive strongly in it , instead any other are sure that it can produces negative effectives in the quality of our life .
In my opinion advertisments make products seem much better than they are in the reality , and so in the following paragraphs I try to explain my point of view .
When we watch televison or when we walk to the street , we can easy see adverstiments ; they talk about food , for instance , or clothes , cars , bank services etc ..
In all these situations the objects , or the products , appear beautiful , confortable and in same case chip , nethereless when we decide to buy one of them we have a surprise .

For example , the last year I saw a beautiful photography machine in a television advertise , it seemed very small , easy to use and with a lot of different functions .
In this way , I convinced my boyfriend to buy this model becuase I thought it was an incredible occasion , infact the price is not so high in relation wiht the quality .

The day after he decided to buy this photography machine , and unfortunately my boyfriend and I , using it , understand that it use not so good .
The same situation happens when we buy a food only for the fact that it is presented in a particular way in the advertise ; for example , the advertise uses a specif enviromental , color or situation to expain the caracteristics of the food , and as a consequence we immidiately decide to buy it .

To sum up the adertisemntent make products seem more different and much better or more cheap than they are in the reality , and so we note the differerence unfotunately only when we decide to buy it , I think it is not right !
