this is a topic that sometimes turned over in my mind and I think that is not so easy give a corret answer also because probably does n't exist a real corret answer .
I think that for the students is important understand concepts and ideas but without learn facts they do n't have a complete knowledge .
Is sure that if the students know only the facts they are like `` parrots '' so they could only repeat in a mechanic way the informations , but if they undertand the main ideas and concepts they could do an elaboration and express also their opinion about the matter .
So I think that understand the main ideas is of paramount importance and learn fact is important but not enough .

In other words I think that undertand the gist is really important also if you do n't know very well the particular facts but is not possibly the reverse , the fact without the main ideas are unusefull .

I must confess that I did n't used to study a lot in the school , so I was n't sometimes able to remember very well dates and particular facts but with a good knowledge of the concepts I could be safe .

The problem is also that many theachers think that the facts are so important and want that the students only repeat like a machine the information .
I think also that for them is easier theach facts that try to explain the main ideas but fortunatelly not all the theacher are the same .
I always really appreciated the thaechers that do n't try to give only informations but want that the students undertand the concepts and reformulate the ideas with their own opinion .

Finally I can say that is incorret say that is most important understand that learn but is sure that without the first one we have an `` robot knowledge '' .
