I have been studying hard since I was a child and now I am about to graduate in electronical engineering .
In my university path I chose the subjects I wanted to study and where I wanted to specialize in , so I surely think that it is better to acquire skills in one or few fields than to have a broad knowledge , mainly because you will never be able to have a culture so wide that covers all the subjects , and secondly since I am a pragmatic person and I would like to be expert in my field .

Human culture covers a huge variety of topics and subjects so I firmly think that no one is able to build such a vast culture .
In fact I think that even the smartest person of the world such as Einstein could not know everything .
Moreover studying many topics can create confusion or problems to remember all the things you have tried to learn .

According to my pragmatic attitude I greatly prefer to acquire skills in a peculiar topic or field in order to become an expert .
Having a deep knowledge only in one field will help me to find a job that completely fits me and where I think I can contribute actively .
In fact I think that everybody has to contribute to the benefits of society in which he/she lives and there is no better way to do that than focusing on one problem .

In conclusion I absolutely disagree with the statement since I am trying to specialize in one particular field of elecronical engineering in order to become an expert .
In fact I think that I will serve the society in which I live in a better way because focusing on one issue I will have many more possibilities to resolve it .
