In my opinion , in the first part of our academic path , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
There are many reasons which support my point of view .
First of all , people need to have a good knowledge of the most of subjects in order to understand which is the one they like most .
How can we know what we like if we do n't know the distinct possibilities ?
Otherwise , without a 360 degrees view , he would n't be able to say which is his our favourite field of interest .

The second point regards the importance of any single subject .
Each one of those transmits something unique and unsubstitutable .
As mathematics developes our right part of the brain , literature and art work on the left one .
And the same concept could be inferred to all other subject .
The study of a given subject , does n't only increase our knowledge of it , but improves also some of our personal skills and I think we need any kind of capacities in order to to be successful in life .

Another important point is about the social consequences of a high bandwidth knowledge .
Being informed on a lot of subject opens us the chance to have conversations in distinct contexts and thus the chance of knowing distinct people .
I think it is very important in a man 's life to have a large variety of knowledges because it could lead to an active social life .

However , even if it has to be most consistent part , I think a horizontal study of many academic subject has to be necessarly followed by a more vertical phase .
After we have understood what we prefer we need to get specialized in something in order to create our main interest , upon which we might build our future and our job .
