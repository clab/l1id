I believe that a student should take care of both understanding concepts and lerning facts .
Particuarly I am firmly convinced that a good education should provide enough information to be learned and enough concepts to be understood .

Depending on the class or the study sector , one of these aspects can be prevalent but I 'm sure they should be both present .
In an engineering faculty indeed a student should probably give more importance to concept understanding , while in a medicine faculty information , facts are more important .
Non the less I believe that concepts require a lot of information to be understood and aslo facts can be learned after having understood some concepts .

I can give an examples based on my personal experience .
I am a civil engineer , and of course I learned a lot of information during mu univeristy career .
These information , studied in math , physics and geometry classes , were essential for understanding how a bridge or a building react to loads or earthquakes .

Viceversa a medical doctor can make a good diagnosis , and understand what actually causes a certain deseas only if he/she did learn the related sympthoms in books .

Some students give probably more importance to understand ideas because they find understanding easier and quicker than learning .
Studying can be in fact boring when it requires too much time , but i think this is not a good approach for reaching a good culture and especially for having an effective background education .

As student and worker I am convinced that what we understand and learn in school or univerisuty i s the key factor of our future success in life .
Particularly I do n't see any chance of success for all the people that learn everything without understanding also something , because they would not be able to adapt their knowledge to the reality of their job .
Viceversa , and in conclusion , I do n't think that a person can do a good job if she/he has not a sufficient background of information learned in school or unveristy .
