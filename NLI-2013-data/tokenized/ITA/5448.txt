Modern age has a powerfull impact on a person 's life .
Tv and newspapers are the main sources of knowledge .
The knowledge that is created by media hides a secret way of capturing a readers ' attention .
The readers ' attention , most of the time , is captured by advertising spots created to sell a product using persuasive strategies .

I do agree , most Ad make products seem much better than they really are .
Ad sells product with wonderfull statements , but they omit the possible problems during the life of the product by making it look good .
Advertising is often used to make certain products look wonderfull and unbreakable .
Never do we see a spot on tv that say ; `` If you buy this videogames , your kid will suffer from eye problem '' .
In other words the truth about a product is never told .
Because of the truth is never told a costumer thinks that the product he or she is going to buy looks like the one they have seen in the ad .
Reality is not there .
The product will break after it falls on the ground , or it simply gets broken for unknown reasons .

The job of Ad is to sell a product although they know that the advertising does not correspond to the reality of facts .
They make it look good and sell it .
