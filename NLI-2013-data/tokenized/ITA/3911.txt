Nowadays young people tend to be only concerned about stupid things , like thier friends and their physical aspect , and they do not help their communities at all .
Young people do not understand that our society will only work if we take care of it , because the society is made up of people and without them it will be nothing at all .
Therefore we should start helping in our community .

During Summer i usually help the community of my town , that has the job of feeding old people in their retirement houses .
We are always looking for people that can help us , because it is a pretty hard work , but people of my age prefer to waste their Summer time sleeping or playing videogames rather than helping people that truly need some help .

I am totally disgusted in seeing how much our society has destroyed the value of generosity and unselfishness .
Money are now considered one of the most important aspect of our life and we tend to forget that there are more important moral values that we should care about .

In my opinion people should spend at least 2 months of their life doing some community service , because it is a great experience that completely changes your life and opens your mind .
Before I started my job in my community i was kind of skeptic , because I was afraid that the reality I was going to face was too hard for me , but know after three Summers I worked in the field I can say that i am changed : now , I care more about other people and I always try to see the positive side of every situations , because I understood that there will always be people with more difficulties than me .
Anyway if someone chooses to help his community , there will be tons of possibility from helping old people as i do , or working with disable people or participating in a youth group .

However convincing people to help is extremely hard if we do not change our society a little bit before .
I think television should give more relevance to community projects and volunteering services , because helping other people should one of our first values .
