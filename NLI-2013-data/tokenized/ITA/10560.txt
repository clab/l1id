There is a series of factors or considerations to take into account concerning this issue .
It is a commonplace that the risk is a foundamental and effective part of our everday life , despite this some people tend to avoid the risk in order to maintain a sort of stability .

The obvious question which arises is : `` Why some people are more inclined to risk than other people ? ''
.
In my opinion successful people are more well disposed to risk than others , because of various reasons .
In the first place people who are already successful could risk in order to improve their own conditions of life or of work or , in some cases , in order to be richer and richer .

However the tendency to risk is not only caused by something of material but also mental factors could , in part , contribute to this behaviour : who is successful is more sure of his own abilities and capacities than a dustman ( for instance ) , for this reason he believes that the risk could not affect him , or at least , it could affect him in minimal part ( naturally it is not true , but it could be his belief ) .

Certainly risk calls risk but successful men know well this theory : this is proved by the fact that often successful men are owners of big financial companies , and the financial world rapresents the most significative `` habitat '' of risk : for economists accepting what they presently have , even if it is for instance a remunerative thing , means being in a state of lack of opportunities , for them not risking is as dangerous as risking .

There is no point in considering the attitude to risk as an extremely subjective way of thinking but for men who have an important role in the society it is , I think , a kind of drug , without risk they are empty , they are always pushed by the possibility to improve their life or the life of their company .

Taking everything into account I believe that successful people tend to risk for their `` nature '' , but it can not be forgotten the the risk is something of acquiscent and unforeseable .
and we need to pay attention at it .
