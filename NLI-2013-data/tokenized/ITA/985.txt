I can answer to this statement with a sentence : it depends on the age and on the situation we are living .
I 'd like to explain my opinion showing my life and my situation .
I completely agree with the statement if we are talking about me , when I was young , during my primary school , or during secondary scholl too , when I studied general subjects and I had to learn what I prefered to continue to study .

I think it 's fundamental to see different subjects and have a general view of different areas .
The situation chances when we arrive at the university .
For example I had to choose the faculty to attend .
There was a big number of different faculty : geology , economy , law , biology , and others .
I chose law and began to study everything about italian law .
I had the opportunity to depeen some particular area of law and then I could begin to work in a legal office .

When I started to work in the office I discovered that I did n't work with a lot of subjects I studied during university .
My office needed that I had to specialized in one or two specific subjects of law .

Now this is the situation in the legal world and legal affairs .
At least ten years ago in Italy there were n't lawyers that knew only some specific subjects of law .
Thay knew the law in general .
Now it is important a specialization and if we want to have success in our profession we have to know some subjects , but in the best way .
I have to conclude may essay showig my idea : It 's important to specialize than know
