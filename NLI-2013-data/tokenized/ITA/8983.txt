According to my point of view , learning facts is important for students as well as learning concepts and ideas .
Indeed , they are the two sides of the same icon , let 's say `` the learning icon '' , because facts show that concepts and ideas are right or wrong in the real world .
In addition , they show how different ideas can be interconnected or influenced by each other and provide an effective way to make a concept understandable .

Concepts and ideas must be learnt , but how to verify them ?
Physics is a very important example .
You can learn much about physics by reading a book and solving mathematical equations .
But how to show that all the learnt knowledge is right and applicable ?
You need to know about experiments which show the constraints of your theories , therefore you need to `` learn facts '' .

Then , facts are important to teach how different concepts and ideas are related .
Think about mechanical science , for example .
There are many concepts , often coming from other different fields .
Students can learn them but how they can truly understand how a system works without studying a machine which is an application of all those ideas and therefore a fact by definition ?

Finally , let me highlight that facts have always provided an effective way to understand a concept or an idea .
Einstein was very famous for many funny examples which he used to explain his own theories .
Another example is Informatics .
If you want to learn informatics , I am sure you will be told that you can compare a processor to a brain , a folder to a desk where you store papers and documents and so on .

Summarizing , it is my firm opinion that facts are necessary for an effective learning .
You need them to verify theories , to explain how many concepts are related and to provide examples for a better understanding .
A famous statement is that history , here facts , is a great life teacher
