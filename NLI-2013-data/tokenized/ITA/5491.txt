I 'm completely agree with this sentence .
In fact I beleave that I live in the generation of advertising .
In this period what the people say is more important than the real qualities of a product .

On televisions or on the pages of newspapers there are always an infinity of sponsored products : shoes , t-shirts , caps , but also hams , biscuits or different types of cheese .
We can find all types of product .

All day my prefered football player or the champion of the world of tennis suggest me what is the product better for me and how I have spent my time .
And I do n't buy a particular object only for its qualities or its price , but also because I see it on journal .

This is the scope of marketing : `` to make products better than they really are '' .
This is an economic law and some firms know it very well .
The same product with different brands has two different values , it is caused by continous advertising .

Really this products are not better than other without a famous brand , often they are products of low quality , but only with a good testimonial or a good sponsor .
