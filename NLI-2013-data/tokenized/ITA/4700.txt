Today we are covered by a lot of pubblicity .
Infact you can find it on TV , on radio and on web .
When you watch TV there are a lot of spots and moreover during the spot automatically increase the volume of TV , so they can obtain your attention .

On the web there are a lot of `` pop up '' .
They are some advertisements of some product , and with these windows they have your attention .
The advertisements rappresent sometimes the most important activity of many factories .
Today the goal is to try to sell a lot of types of products and it 's not important if ithey are really good or bad products , but it 's important that the factories sell them .

So troghouth advertisements business peoples try to sell to the consumers our products .
Advertisements might to convince the people that this product is better then anyone and that it has a lot of qualities or optionals then anyother products have .

Moreover in advertisements are underline only the main and the best charateristics of the product to give a good impression to consumers .
But often , when some customers decide to buy a product without some other informations , they remain unhappy because the item does n't have the charatteristic that the advertisements show .
For example I have saw an advetisement of a car accessory on web and I decided to buy it .
I have asked some information about the item and they selt me some pictures of the item .
Obiviously in these pictures are presented only the best part of the item .

When I recived the item I was n't very happy of my choose because it was n't like I wanted and I saw .
Finaly I say that I 'm agree with the statment
