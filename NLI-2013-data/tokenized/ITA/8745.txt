Some might argue that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than understanding facts .
I think this statement can be true in some way , but I definitely reject it and for the following reasons .

Although it is easy to support the theory that students tend to be fascinated by and thus learn ideas better than facts and give them more importance , this can be argueable .
Literature or philosophy , which are basically based on the study of ideas , ideologies , theories , are usually easier to study and even more pleasant than , for example , solving chemical forms .
They imply less effort and abstract concepts can be seen as more essential in an education than numbers or facts .

However , subjects as literature , philosophy , history , can be on one side as difficult as scientific subjects and on the other side often have to be supported by facts .
Firstly , ideas , for the reason that their substance is based on abstraction , can be very hard to formulate , share and understand .
Many philosophies , like kantism , are based on notions of knowledge that are mainly intuitional and cannot be understood neither by an experienced and open mind , thus it can be hard to consider more solid and important than facts .
Secondly , facts are ideas and viceversa .
As Popper stated , facts do not exist before ideas because it is the idea that brings the mind to explore the fact .
Also , many ideas have to be supported by numbers to be valid and feasible , i.e. economic theories or political statements usually rely on statistical data and methods .

In conclusion , I would say that the statement is a half truth and could be completed saying that ideas and facts are essential elements in every mindset in any study area , depending on each other and sharing the same importance .
Students are usally enough flexible to appreciate both ideas and facts , as many old thinkers and philosophers , who were at the same time mathematics and philosophy scholars .
