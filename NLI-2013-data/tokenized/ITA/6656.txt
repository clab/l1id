The car is always been , since the time of its creation , an important mean of transport .
While in the past , it was a reserved mean , which was prerogative of the richest part of the population , nowadays it is used by almost the 85 % of the world population The question is : but Will it remain a successful mean among twenty years or will be replaced ?
Or even more , will it disappear ?
I think that all depends by the progress of techonology in fact the improvement of the man 's style conditions could allow a new born also in mechanic field In fact , the discovering of new electronic elements could bore to a new transportation mean and so render the car useless , but from the other hand this research ca n't never occur if there are n't fund and so money In my opinion , between twenty years , the cars in use will be more than nowadays and not fewer , but they will have almostly , new confort and qualities than the recent one .
For example they could have more sophisticated circuit that allow to the driver to orientate whatever is his destination or they would be less polluting than one , perhaps with a non polluted system which convert the carbon dioxide into oxygen preventing all the diseases that characherize the urban citizen But , on the other hand , if there will be more cars , it would create an overcrowding in the street : all the people who have the car in fact use it almost the daytime and with the crowding of the streets. , the man ' / women 's attitude could change giving origin to some unpleasant events In conclusion , I think that , if in the future , there will be an increasing of the car , which in my opinion will occur , i hope the people learn to use it in a properly way .
