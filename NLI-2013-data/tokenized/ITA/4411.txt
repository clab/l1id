I agree with this statement and I also believe that it 's an unavoidable `` side effect '' of the advertising process .
In principle the whole idea of advertising something is not only to convey information but also , and mainly , to convince an audience that a product is good .
An advertisement is not a technical report , the main purpose of which is to state the things as they actually are ...
In an advertisement every single aspect is carefully and strategically planned to attract the attention of an audiance and to convince it .

It 's not a surprise then if in an advertisement a product looks so good and when we have it in our hands it does n't meet our expectations .
I 'm not saying that advertising and cheating are the same thing !
I believe in fact that most of the people are aware of this fact , if not by intuition , by experience , so where is the cheating if the victim is aware ?

And furthermore often we do n't find in an advertisement plain lies , what we see is that the weak points are not exposed in their full extent .
If we watch for instance the advertisement of some phone company we almolst believe the everything comes for free : well , to the best of my experince the bill arrives .
Always .

Sometimes ago I had the opportunity of designing a flyier for an event , so in a sense I could see the advertising process also from a different angle .
Making that event looking very good and attractive was my goal and I did my best .
Now I 'm asking myself whether or not I described my `` product '' in such a way to make it look better than it actually was ...
The answer is `` no , I 'm not a professional , but I wish I could ... ''
.
I guess I 'm not in the right position to complain !
