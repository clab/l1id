I agree with the statement bacause , according to me , the new technologies will allow people to improve the quality of public transport .
Thanks to this travelling will be faster and will have less impact on the environment .

Nowadays cities are full with cars and this is not just an environmental problem but olso an economical one .
In my opinion tramcars and alternatives means should be preferred to couches because they need , to be supplied , energy and not with oil .
Maybe in the future people will use their bicycles to move for short distances and trains or planes if they have to cover long distances .
But it is only an idea .

If the nowadays rate of smog keeps growing , as scientist warn , people will realise that we have gone too far an then we will use our cars only when we are obliged to do it .

To make it feasible the government should give much more money to the transport sector so that people will use public transport as much as possible .
This prblem is particularly evident in Italy where the public means of transport are dirty , always late and always full of people : in addiction to that , the ticket is too high if compared to the service provided .
So I hope that in twenty time the sector of public transport will be better and that the number of cars will be reduced .

One of the big issues of these years is that of oil and its price that is growing higher and higher , that is why I prefer walking or take my bicycle to go to the city center .
This is a way to see the city from another point of view .

In the past fifty years it has skyrocketed and people cannot afford it anymore : so something must change .
Maybe that of mine is a too optimistic vision but I really hope that the most powerful men in the world will understand the gravity of the situation and react promoving alternatives means in to opposition car .
