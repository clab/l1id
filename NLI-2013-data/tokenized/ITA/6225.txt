the starting statement tells about the possibility that in the future could be less cars then today .
this point is very difficult to explain because i think that everything depends to the technology developement of today .

since ten years ago a lot of university departments have tried to create a new type of car that uses a different king of oil .
the reason is that in this moment the amount of oil is critical and there is the possibility that on the next years it will be impossible to supply the oil quantity that customers will need .

but until now it is not appeared a different kind of car that uses alternative fuel .
only a strange electric car that uses electric batteries to start motor .
For this reason , i think that if the companies which product car or the university departments of technology resource do n't look for other solutions , it will be possible that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today .
