Probably in the past there was a much greater sense of community than we have nowadays .
Everyone , since ancient times , had to do his or her part to help the community .
Childhood did not last for long , soon people had to learn to work and fight , and get married .

What is changed now ?
The time we spend to actually become `` adults '' is much longer , leading to a new stage of life , in which we are no more children , but not yet mature .
Young people , during these years have to understand what they want for their life in order to be helpful for others .
Not an easy task , but young people still do give time to helping their communities , in different ways .

In the first place , young people depend on their family for a long time from many points of view .
So their resources are limited .
The range of possible helping actvities is often reduced to volunteering .
And there are people who do that .
Many of my friends have been volunteers for at least one year .
I was part of several groups , and now I support some associations , like Unicef , for what I can .

Another problem is that nowadays you can contribute to your community by working .
This is something hard to do while young people are studing .
I have just one part time job with children , because I do not have much time left from university .
But I give my contribution anyways .
Many students do .
By helping themselves , they help society .

Finally , it is not easy to give a definition of `` community '' today .
In the age of globalism , communities tend to be more virtual than physical .
That is really common among young people .
We create and join communities on the World Wide Web , almost a second life sometimes .
Do we care less about our community ?
I do not think so .
Instead there might be a more serious problem : young people feel like they do not belong to these communties anymore .
And people should think about why this happens .
We do spend time for our community , just in a new personal way .
