The number of cars that we can see every day in the street is incredibly huge .
Cars are very usefull to move quickly from a place to another and quite every family seems to be able to afford one or even two or three of this means of transportation .
People do n't seem to be able to find another way to move so confortable like this !

Of course there are some aspects related to the use of cars that in my opinion may influence the future .
One of this is the price of oil or fuel .
This is a great proplem that nowadays all the world is facing .
Prices seem to grow more and more every day and if the situation will not change , if all the countries wo n't find a solution , people will be able to afford cars no more .

Another aspect related to this is the fact that petrol will not be available forever .
In fact this natural resorse will end , not in twenty years , but surelly in a future not so distant from our time .
So men has to think to a possible solution , for example electrical cars or other means of transport to substitute cars .

There are even negative aspects related to the use of cars .
Fuel or oil , which cars need to work , are the first causes of air pollution .
Our governamnets are tring to find a solution to this problem , introducing days during wich cars are not allowed to be used : but it may be possible that in the future only a small number of cars would be allowed to circulate in order to reduce pollution .
