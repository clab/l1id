I think that the answer to this important and debated question depends on which level of studing one is pursuing .
If a student is at an undergraduated level , he should try to wide , as much as possible , his area of interest and competence , while , if he is already at a graduated level , he should concentrate himself on a more resticted area of study .
I think that a broader knowledge of different topics and problems related to different subjects should be achieved during the years spent in the high school , so that one has the possibility to gain more consciousness of what his interests and preferences are .
At a certain point in life , one must ask himself the tedious question : `` What would I like to do in my life ? ''
That is : `` What kind of job do I want to occupy my days up to the end of my life ? ''
Facing this question , one must necessarely restrict his area of interest and study by focusing on a single area .
I say `` area '' and not `` discipline '' because an area of study like , for example , philosophy , can involve much more than one would expect at the begining .
It is now a day wide recognized how philosophy can be related to mathematic or to economics or to other very different subjects like psycology .
Anyway , in my opion , someone really knows the area of interest when he has a broader knowledge of the different topics and subjects related to it .
One should always have a wide open eye on everything that 's happening in the accademic world .
Specializing is nevertheless an obliged choice today , if one is willing to reach excellence in a specific area .
That is true in sports and music at a very early age of life ( about seven years old ) , but it 's a problem also for students at an university level .
Few are the people who can get excellence in more than one area , and most of them , I think , died many centuries ago , like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo .
I think that in our century sometimes we should be willing to accept to be mere technicians and not intellectuals in a broad sense , which is something that today only very rich people can afford to be .
