I certainly agree with that statement .
In my opinion this is due to a common sense of selfishness that is so widespread in young people .
Only a few teenagers spend their free time in rewardable activities , such as driving ambulances or helping blinds .
The others , the biggest part , think that only enjoyment has importance in thier single life .
So the key phrase is ENJOY YOURSELF AND DO N'T CARE OF ANYONE .
This is so wrong : if you always think to youself , you will never note how the world needs your help .
You can give your contribute only with a simple deed and with a simple attention towards who is suffering or is asking your help .

At this common sense contribute the bad examples that television and internet give : almost every famous person s only interested to go to the parties , to have vacations in wonderful places , ..

About my personal experience i can say i have never helped my community .
In part , this is due to my past and present involving in studies but also in sport activities .
In my normal day i have to stay up to 8 hours to the university and then i have to train myself in my favourite sport , the taekwondo .
When i come back home i neither can watch the tv without sleeping in front of it .

Honestly i also must come clean that i am really really lazy .
In fact i desrcribed above not my life in the weekend , but also during the weeek .
If i could , i would help my comunity in the weekends like some friends of mine do .
But , on fridays and saturdays evenings , i want to enjoy myself until the earlier hours in the day .
This implies that i am too tired on sundays for help my community taking , for example , dinners or lunches to old people who cannot move from their home
