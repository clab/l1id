The problem is if it is better to have a generic academic preparation or to have a specialization in one specific subject .
I am not so agree with this statement and now I will try to explane why .
The advantage to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is that you know `` something of all '' , you can spend it in many sectors of the `` world of work '' and you can do well wherever you want .

But on the other hand , you know something of all but you know it less than a person that have a specific preparation in that , so for an ipotetic work a specialized person will be prefered instead of a person with a generic preparation .

Instead a person with a specialization have some problems if he find a work that he does not know well , he can be confused on what to do .
On the other hand the advantage to have a specific preparation is to do well what we kn

Finally in my opinion we shoud have a basic knowledge , a basic preparation on many academic subject , and then we shoud have a specific area of knowledge to spend better on the `` world of work '' .
