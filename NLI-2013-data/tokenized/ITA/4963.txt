In my opinion most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , but I think it 's the marketing way .
It 's absolutely comprensible that a company wants seem an his product better than it really is ; a company , in fact , have to see multiple factors , like for example the actractivity of the market , the other concorrent companies and in this situation the impact with the customers is fundamental .
We can think , to understand the concept , how much advertisement is watched on tv ; if a message is reiceved from a lot of people , a certain product can be buyed from a large part of the population .
Probably this way is not ethically correct ; a person can be fascinated from a particular type of product , after the wiew of the advertisement , and then he can discover that this product is not what he expected .

I think the positive way of this process is that a good product can have a lot of visibility wih the advirtisement .
My mind goes , for example , to Linux , an alternative software ; most of IT 's experts say it 's better then Windows , but it does n't have the necessary visibility ( and many other factors : for example Linux is not organized as a company like his concorrent ) to fight it .

In many cases I have choosen a product for the fantastic advertisement of that product ; I like very much Coca - Cola , I ever buyed it , probably I 'd prefer Pepsi , but I have never buyed it , because I 'm a fanatic customers of Coke , in part for his beautiful advertisements , that remind me when was a chld .

In other words , a lot of advertisemnets can decide the consumation of a produc
