Specialization in my opinion is a key word that has to be taken into account .
From experiences that have occured to me in life I have forged a negative idea of the knowledge of many subjects .
I I think this is a valid explanatory element therefore I have decided to include this happening in order to give my thougts some back up .
My English teacher in the 12th Grade made a clear distinction between the Italian teaching system and the American teaching system .
The Italian system had a vast program but it did not prepare students for `` that specific sector '' in university and then work .
On the other hand he emphasized the fact that the American educational system had fewer amount of topics but the piece of information absobred by the student would have surly been stored in his long term memory becoming permanent knowledge .
Whilst depth knowledge can connect a student to `` work '' in general , the student with a vast but more superficial knowledge will probably have more difficulties in settling and finding an occupation suitable for him .
For all these reasons I think specialized knowledge has a more utlistic aspect that the knowledge of seldom subjects lacks .
It is true that knowledge of a variety of topics can be applied in other life situations but the needs people have in our society are different .
A person goes to the university as he wants to have knowlege on a certain topic , this knowledge will enable him to find a job .
Recalling on another life experience , my father that ownes a fabrique told me how he had some employees that lacked of the working skills .
All turned out to be a waste of time since he had to teach and explain the information that has not been taught previously .
If a person specializes on a single subject he will easily work effectivly therefore the results for society will be postive .
I think schools and universities should provide this system and then they should give the opportunity for students to reasearch singularly .
If a person is attracted by the vast variety of knowledege he should research and study on his own , An unclear knowlege of many topics may undermine working system in society .
