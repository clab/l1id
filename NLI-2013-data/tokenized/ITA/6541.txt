What I can say is that in twenty yaears we will probably witness the change af the whole concept of car , regarding thier number anyway , I do n't think it will lessen too much .
At least as far as our civilization will save unchanged its concept of progress and wellfare .

I believe two main choices or possibilities are open to us , talking of personal moving devices : we can keep integrating the old concept of personal car with our newest hi-tech-toys and systems ( and this is indeed happening ) , either we can use our latest tchnological achievments in order to radically change the hard problem of massive and personal transportation , and try , int his way , to cope with other big unsolved problems too : such as pollution , democratic acces to technology , urban traffic and public transportation .

It is a matter of fact that the main source of energy for our society , ( that 's oil , petroleum ) , on which is based also the whole productive chain of our new millenium culture , wo n't last for ever .
Thus answering about the population of cars within twenty years becomes quite a complex subject .
Just consider that a similar crisis , the lack of the source energy ( slaves ) which was at the base of their productive system , deeply contributed to the fall of Roman Empire ...
and yet we do not have reports about wondering whether in their future the Romans would have used slaves for their leptigae or something else .

Jokes a part everyone must consider two points : are we ready to submit our health , our money , and in times like these our peace as well , to a small group of man 's greed , who want to sqeeze the last drop of oil out of the earth and the last cent from our pockets ?

And then , would it be possible that an old device such as a car has become defintely obsolete in more than one hundred years ?
Because otherwise you see , I really cannot understand why a tool supposed to improve our speed and mobility nowdays just jam us more than else .

Concluding I suppose cars will remain as we know them untill someone will be able to earn money from them , then , after , I hope something will change at least in its same idea , transorming the car in something really useful , m ore than
