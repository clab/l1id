In the world of today a lot of companies make an often exagerated use of advertisements , throught the mass-medias or pamphlets , to sponsorize their products , in order to bring the people over to buy them .

I generally think that products we can find in advertisements are not actually much better than they really are , because the idea of the product that we have is too closed to the image of the product that the companies want to spread among the people .

From my point of view , actually the advertisemets give away an ideal image of the product that does not reflect the reality and the true essence of it .
There are a lot of example to support this my opinion .

A common example can be found in the spots on television .
There are lots of advertisement that suggest to buy a product , like gel for shaving , using a male character surrounded by very good-looking girls , about which the people think that the use of the product can change them is succesful individuals like the man in the spot .

Other example are food products that seem much better in taste than other food brands because they are represented as healty products , while in the reality they are the same of the others about the nutritional aspects .

I personally was deceived by one of this advertisements : i thought to have bought a product , like a cream for the face , that seemed to be better than the others because in the advertisements was announced to be very common , succesfull and one of a kind in his category between the people , but in the end it was the same of the other products , by the fact that was merely a cream with no special or particular ingredientes .

So i agree with the fact that most advertisements make products appear better than they really are
