It 's quite common to hear judgment about young people nowadays .
It 's even quite popular the idea that they are poor in spirit and too selfish to spend time on someone else life .

Well , I think It 's the way adults use to solve some their internal problems , completely not tied with what the reality is .
The reality is that young people nowadays spend much more time to helping their community than before , and I think this habits will increase in the future .
The modern life has brougth us to stress our time in order to do as much as we can : or better , in order to earn as much as we can .
This behaviur entay an important aspect : the rising of a new concept of common culture .
What I want to say is that now every young people is enough preperred to understand that is better to work and to make efforts for the community instead of behaving selfishly .
Any good action can only improve the common happyness , but our happyness is just inside this commonwealth .

It 's even more and more evident how young people are trying destroy old stereotypes of thinking about what is defferent .
Although until few years ago hostile behaviours among human races were deep radicated in common thinking , new social dynamics are strongly addressing young people to accept every kind of difference .
Thus making easier and faster the growing of a new common sense of belonging to a community ; and it 's this new sense of belonging to make us spend more time with this new family .

Anyway the elevate number of young people involved in volunteer group , such as medical team in poor area of the word or even very young people helping in housekeeping elders , is a confirm of what I 've stated .

In conclusion , I can even well understand why many adults think that most of young people ar poor in sprit : are not them to teach us in university classes that yhe only god we must pray is money ?
And the only way to earn money is n't time ?
