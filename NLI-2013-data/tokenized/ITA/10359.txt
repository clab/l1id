In my opinion people always should try new things and take risks to improve themselves .
If people stop themselves in front of the difficulties , they never improve .
To become successful people , we do n't must do only what we can do but , first of all in difficult situations , we must take risks even if they should be wrong at the end .

If we do n't catch risks we never obtein important results in every camp , for example For example if I want become a very important manager , in the world of work , I will have to take a lot of risks that regards my decisions .
This means that people that have important ambitions ca n't limitate themselves in which they already know but they must search to improve themselves .
At the end I want say that don ` t exist any person that became important limiting himself , but to become successful people need courage and to take difficult choise to improve more and more .
