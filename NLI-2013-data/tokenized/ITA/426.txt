I think that all people must have a broad knowledge in various academic subject , and not to specialize only in one specific subject .
This because a most restrictlivy specialization can create too much problem douring the first working period , because after finish the study the most of the people do n't know yet what kind of job they can find .
Maybe I 'm too confuse so I write an exemple : once I finish studing , I know what I want to do do but I do n't know if I can find what I 'm lookin ' for , so is better to me to be prepared on various subject .

Of course I do n't think that a specific preparation ist't correct , it can be use to have a better preparation in your kind of work and a possibility to be more essential that other people , but for some personal reason I prefere do n't have a specific preparation , but a more large vision on various argoument .
This because I think that the actual world of work need and ask for more flexibility that in the past .
In particoular often people are searcing for someone that can be easly rerplaced , and I do n't like it too much , rather than a specific tecnic , that is more difficoult to find .
Also a person with large knoledge can use this knowledge to be more competitive douring work research , or douring a bad period of a work company .
He can be adapted to do several work for company , while the bad period pass throgh .
A specific specialization is a bad choise expecially in that subjects that are too particoular or restrective , an exemple is a friend of mine that studied russian letterature , but now I do
