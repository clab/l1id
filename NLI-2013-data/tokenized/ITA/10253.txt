Most of the people who have reached success in life had to try at least new things and had to take risks rather than only doing what they alredy knew how to do well .
I do agree with this statement because it 's true and nothing is given for free in life .
If you want to improve any aspect of your life ( job , finantial situation , relationship , health , ... )
you have to suffer , more or less , and try to do your best in improving yor skills and risking also something of yourself .
If a person continues to do what he/she is used to do or what he/she already knows how to do well , he/she will never go far because he/she will remain always at the same stage without the possibility to risk to change his/her lifein a better occasion .
Of course it 's a risk and sometimes it can happen the person will simply worst the situation instead of having success .
I can make several examples taken from the common life or looking at some famous people in the contemporany world .
A simple example of successfulI in the common life is to keep forever the promise of marriage fidelity .
In this case the couple has to try every day new things to keep alive their love and they have to take their own risk to trust and to be open with eachother .
In the workplace is the same .
A worker can stay all his life doing the same kind of job in the same way without risking to change the way of work or without going to study for improving his skills .
Another common example is the risk that you have to take if you want to gain money in Wallstreet .
Most of the famous people declared when interviewed that they were able to reach success only after trying to improve themselves with a lot of risks .
In conclusion , it 's true that if someone wants to became a successful person has to try new things and to take many risks instead of remaining at the same stage doing only what he/she already know how to do well .
