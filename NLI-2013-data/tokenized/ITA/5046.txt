The advertisement announces are invading the space of city , the radio , the TV etc .
Fot this reasons some people ca n't stand them , furthermore other people consider them as a type of `` art '' .

Those are simply personal opinions , but , the real problem is when the advertisements do n't say the truth .
It 's a great problem like all lies .
Some people think that is n't a problem and thay say that the person has a skill to decide a product indipendently on basis the only functionals of the product .
But I disegree this opinion because often the advertisement do n't speak about the only functionals of the product but it promises other characteristics that do n't depend by it .
In conclusion the advertisements must be controlled and they must speak about the product only with its real characteristics .
