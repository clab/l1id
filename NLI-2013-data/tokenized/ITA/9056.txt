I do n't agree with this statement for different aspects .
First of all , the school offered me the possibility to know a lot of informations about all themes and it offered me the possibility to tell my opinion about different arguments .

All these things are very interesting and important but i often see that what we learn in abstract it often it doesn ' respect reality .
The most interesting example that i can do to explain this point is the university .
I 'm a student of the last year in management engeenering and in all these years i 've studied a lot of mathematical models and ways that explain how it 's possible to manage a company .

In these last months i went to interview different companies for my final project about performance management .
In these interviews i realized that their way to work is very different from the models that teachers explained to me in the different courses that i followed to the university .

Surely the basic informations are the same , but the real work is very different to the concepts and ideas that i studied .
For this motive i believe that ideas and concepts are very important to a student to learn and to undestand but all this is only the underground know-how that everyone must have .
That it is very important and to try to apply what we know to the reality and to try to larn especially from what happens everyday .
