The question asked is if students should focus on learning facts , or rather on understanding ideas and concepts .
This issue has a big importance because it is linked to the teaching style addopted by schools and universities , as well as , to the learning approach that students should choose .
In my opinion learning concepts and ideas is better than studying facts .

I belive it is not effective to learn facts because facts are generally linked to one particular situation or experience .
Many times this facts are from the past .
On the other hand , concepts and ideas can be applied to a bigger number of cases and during a longer time .
For exemple , what happened during the Second World War is already in the past , but the concept of war is common to many situations of this type .
Based on this idea , i am convinced that it is more effective to understand concepts and ideas .

Furthermore , it is reccommanded to study concepts because the prcess of understanding a concept stimulates and develops thinking skills .
For instance , when a student concentrates on the concept of accounting rather than on memorising the balance shit , he or she will be able to understand much more , like the idea of imput and output , in general .
Due to this fact , i think that studyig concepts is superior to learning facts by heart .

Finally , i believe that concepts are easier to memorize than particular facts .
Because concepts can be associated to so many situations and to so many mental images , they remain in our mind a very long time .
Moreover , concepts tend to become part of our mind , of our permanet way of thinking , but facts do n't .
For exemple , if we understand the concept of trade , there are so many situations we can link this to , like ancient silk trade , slave trade , modern trade , so on .
Because of this , I prefer studying concepts and ideas more thad learnig facts .

In conclusion , the facts that concepts can be applied and linked to more exemples , that they stimulate thinking and are easier to remember , demonstrates that studying concepts is a better option .
I believe that while studying a concept , a student reaches higher levels of intelligence and of efficiency .
