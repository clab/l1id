I 'm not sure that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today but I really hope that this will happen .
Today the situation is not good for the big presence of cars and science and gouvernaments must do something to solve this problem and to limit the damages that this cars 's presence gives to the environment .

Twenty years ago there were less cars : this is a sign of our economical and technological improvement but this improvement take us a lot of problems that were unthought years ago .
The biggest problem is the pollution of air that we breath because of the cars 's gases .
This problem brought to the water pollution too and provoked the birth of a lot of new illnesses that did n't exist years ago .
So I hope that in future the number of cars should decrease to have less pollution and to have a good environment .
Another solution could be found in some improvement of science to eliminate the pollution provoked by cars .

Another negative aspect of the high number of cars is that , expecially in the cities , every day , there are a lot of cars that crowd it and give problem to traffic .
So a decrease in number of cars should give more quiteness to cities and should be easier for people going from a part to another of a city .
A solution in this case must be found by gouvernaments that should decrease the cars into cities improving the public transports .
If the net of public transport is well organised , I think that people would be stimolated to use it and to leave cars at home and so would n't be so important having two or three cars per family .

So , in conclusion I think that with a small improvement of science and of gouvernament 's control will be fewer cars in use than there are now , and I hope that this will happen so we can live in healthness and in quietness as the life was twenty years ago .
