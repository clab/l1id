This statement present a difficult question : it is better to have a general type of culture or to specialize in a specific matter ?
The statement asks that the first aspect is more important than the second one , but I am not in agree with it : I think that in modern life is important having a good preparation in all the fields of culture , but also it is indispensable to have a specifical knowledge on a matter ; in fact this is the role of University , to prepare a student for the specifical job he thinks he will do in the future .

I have an example that confirms what I have said now : one of my friends , Mario , has a great passion for the study ( he has readed all the volumes of his encyclopedia ) , but he does n't have studied a specifical matter , because he has n't frequented the University , so he has n't a job yet .
On the contrary , my friend Luca has studied Mechanical Engeneering and now , only two months after finishing the studies , he works in a great society of engeenering , and he gains a lot of money !

In syntesis , I think that a general culture can help you to grow and to become more adult , but the way to obtain a job that can satisfy you ( by an economical and also professional point of view ) is to study a specifical matter .
I also think that the person who has writed this statement has a more utopistic view of life than me .
