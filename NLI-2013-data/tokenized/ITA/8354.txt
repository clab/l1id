I completely agree with the statement that it is more important to understand ideas and concepts than it is to learn facts .
The following reasons explain better my opinion .

I think that understand ideas and concepts presents some advantages .
In fact , if you learn the fact but you do not understand the concept behind the fact , probably after no many time you will not remember the fact yet .
Insteed , if you really understand the concepts , in your future probably you will not remember the specific fact but you will remember the most important ideas of the argument .
So , you have to learn facts only after you understand concept .

The fact that students do not understand concepts has two different causes First , usually in the exam student has to explain only the facts ; so learn only the facts is easier than understand the concepts .
Then , I think that to understand the basical ideas students need a really good professor , because it is difficult to understand them by textbook .

Finally , I believe that if you really understand the concepts behind the facts , you can put them in practice better .
If you learn only the facts , you can not

Therefore I think that you can understand why I believe that students first have to understand the concepts and the ideas , and then the facts .
In conclusion , I think that this statements is true not only for students , but for everyone in general .
Usually it has more value for a student , but it is a right statement for everyone because I think that it is alvways better , in every situation , understand the concepts than the details .
