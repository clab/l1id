I disagree with the sentence , because the economy of more countries dipends on cars .
There are , infact , more companies that sold cars in the world , and tecnology , often , is trained by the cars ' economy .
Than there are the oil companies that want always sold their black gold .
The industries of cars give many jobs to person and for a state this is a good reason to help that .
For example , in Italy , there is a company who name is FIAT .
Often the italian state give help to theme to have a job for many people and to govern with serenity .

The tecnology in a lot of cases is trained but the industries of cars that ask to scientist many things that are used to be more beautiful and comfortable cars .
The lights and the interiors became necessary to have a nice car .
Conseguece of this is that many other companies found their job on the car 's industries .
It 's very complicate to transform in only twenty years all the trainers in the world .

Than for the tecnology that we have today , cars are the better machine to move that we can have and the most economic .
In twenty years is impossible to discover and research a new type of machine .
Infact to design a new machine the industries have to study more than ten years .
Than starts the testing on the machine .

it 's necessary a lot of time to build a new kind of car , but in also necessary to study very quickly fot the pollution that cause many ills .
