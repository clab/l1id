I do n't agree with this statement .
Of course you need a little of broad knowledge , especially to be able to talk and understand when you speak with people that are specialized on other fields , but you need to be specialized in one specific subject to do well your work , because you need to know that really well , and it 's impossible to be specialized about everythings .
Also if you know just a specific subject there is really a lot to know .
For example , I am a psychologist and there are a lot of fields I could work , like developmental , clinical , health , evaluation and others .
But everyone of this need a lot of theory and models to know and a lot of experiences to do , that take years to be really prepared in just one of these subjects .
But after all the training if someone has a problem about what you have specialized you can be sure that you can give him the best support , that you can help him in the best way because you know what you are talking about .
Instead if you just know a little about everything you ca n't be really helpful but you can just tell to the people where going , usually a specialized centre , to have all the information they need [ that is doing counseling ] .
After my degree I worked three years in a department of neuropsychology and until now I ca n't say that I know that subject because it 's really wide , so when someone has a neuropsychological problem needs to talk with another one that did a lot of years studing and working in that field , that knows all the acquired brain pathologies and all the tests to do the right diagnosis and that knows also about the rehabilitation , and that is able to explain to the relatives what is going on .
Of course I do n't want to say that you have to know just about one subject , but that you have to be specialized about one subject and know , i.e. in a less specific way , about many .
