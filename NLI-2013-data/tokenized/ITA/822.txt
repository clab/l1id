I think that is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
My opinion is supported by our everydays ' life where the people has many suddenly problems at scholl or in work .
If I have a good knowledge in a specific subject I can well do a specific work , but it is impossible to have a work where there are n't problem with other specific work .
So this is important that the university or in general the school give a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and support in general the culture .
Because if our society is composed by person who do not want understand to much of things but want understand determinated or specifically things , this society is died .
My university is the best exaples to demonstrate that it is important studies many subjects than studies a specific subjects
