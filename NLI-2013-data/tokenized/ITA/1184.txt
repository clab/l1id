I think that , in general , we learn academic knowledges to get a good job in the future , possibly the one we prefer .
For this reason I think it 's much more better to specialize in just one specific subject beacuse in our modern life the medium knowledge is very high and there is a lot of competition so i think that having a very goog knowledge of a subject is the best way to get a good and satisfing job .
Infact almost every school system of every country is projected to give the student a knowledge starting from a basic and general teaching arriving to a high specialization ( like masters ) .

Anyway sometimes in our life it 's not bad to have a basic knowledge of many academic subjects like maths and geography , when we have to travel or shopping for example .

Another thing that requires a broad knowledge it 's a phenomenon called job 's difersification , that 's whay very often our job requires a well understanding of many different subjects .
In the end I think it 's better to know very well a subject but also to have a basic knowledge of other subjects .
