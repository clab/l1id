In my opinion the statement is partially true .
I think the success of a person depends on several factors , not only on the capacity to to take risks .
For example a really lucky man does n't need to take any risk for accomplish what he is doing .
I know a guy who just won the lottery , he is a clearly `` successful man '' , or at least he got more success then me , infact now he is having fun on his big boat , and I 'm writing an assay to pass the TOEFL test to be accepted for an internship in the other part of the world , and I will work for free .

Thus , according to the Socrates ' theory , the point is to define the definition of `` successful people '' , and I think there is n't any general definition of `` successful people '' , I think a successful guy is the one who improve the world .
According such definition one who wants to belong to the `` successful people '' group should he have to follow the way he can afford best .
If he improve the wrold he belongs to the `` successful people '' group .

To acheive that point he can both employs new things and take risks or just reuse what he already know .
The goals explain the way used to acheive them .
All the people are differents , so one can acheive the goal to improve the heart in one way , anotherone can acheive the goal in a different way .
the important thing is to make the world better .
A way could be let me passing the TOEFL .
