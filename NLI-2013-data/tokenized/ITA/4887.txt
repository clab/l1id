Today , advertisements are everywhere .
We are bombed by them in almost every part of our day : while we are reading newspapers or magazines , watching at TV , listening to radio , or just walking in cities , that are sometimes completely covered by them .
They are so spread that we often difficulty notice them , cause we consider them as a normal part of a page , or just a pause in a tv program .
So , to catch our attention , today advertisements tend to be really exagerated , sometimes even shoking .

Infact a society must to send us a message that is fondamental for its life : that his product or service is good , or however really better in comparison with the ones made by the concurrency , and that we need absolutely it .
There is no need to mention that it 's not true : mostly the products available on the market are actually on the same level , not so better or worst respect the others .
Therefore what we need in reality is just a really little part of what we think we need , even if , today , people have usually no awerness of that , and have the tendence to consider everything necessary : it is exactly the aim of the society who sold them all that products .

Thus , if a society must convince us in every way to spend our money for what they are selling to survive and develop , they wo n't consider immoral to hide some characteristics we should now , or even to state something really wrong about the products .

A customer needs not to trust advertisement almost ever , and to go beyond what we listen to or see to understand the really quality of the good or service .
And we should alway wonder if we really need a new kind of pen , if what we are using it 's perfect for itself .
