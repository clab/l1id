I do strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people can do .
First of all i think that young people have something that frequently is not possesed by elderly ; that is good health .
Good health means basically the possibility to travel all around the world and visit exciting new countries .
It means also the possibility to practice new sports in the countryside or outside in the fresh air .
For example But it is also necessary to live with dignity .
Secondly , young people do not generally have great and impellent responsabilities but they can have a lot of freedom to go out with friends , go dancing , practice known sports , stay up late without any problem .

Moreover the fact that elderly people can have some problems in concentrating and remembering the things they learn .
This problem can seriously affect their chance to learn new things reading books , which I believe it is one of the greatest things to do to enjoy .
Another really important fact is that young people have a great social life which often lacks in older people .

To end up i would like to touch a very important issue that sadly affects our developed countries .
In several important and crowded cities in the world it would be easy to find the majority of old people left alone in desolated apartments or even wostly in retirement houses .
The frenetic rythm of our society seem to emarginate the people regarded as unuseful so it is impossible for them to live in a life in wich every day is seen as a possible to enjoy life .
