In my opinion it is more important for students to uderstand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .
Although it is very important to know facts , because they are necessary to understad many of the events which are occurring in our day-life , it would be very hard to deeply understand them just learning everything by heart .

In fact , it is important to understand concepts because it 's very easy to forget facts .
For example , it would be quite impossible to study litterature or better history just trying to remember al the facts by heart .
Maybe it would be possible to learn like that for an university test but there are a lot of possibilities to fail the test because it 's very easy to forget some informations or to invert some facts .

So , it would be better just to try to undersand and to make some general schemes about a topyc in order to have some clear and general informations and in this way it would be easier to remember the facts because they would have a logical order .

For istance , once I tried to remeber all the facts which occurred during the French revolution for an high-school test .
I had little time to study so I thought that the better solution was to learn as much as possible all the facts by heart .

I did not sleep at all to be prepared for the test , but anyway , I did not pass .
The test day I was so nervous and tired that I almost forgot all the facts occurring during the French Revolution and I was not able to pass the test , that it was actually very important to me .
It would have been more usefull just trying to keep in mind all the main ideas and maybe I would have passed the test , or at least , I would have slept during the night time !
