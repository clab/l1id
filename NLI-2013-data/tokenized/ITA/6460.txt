In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today because there will be more and more other public transports , such as airplanes , trains , buses , ships and so on .
I think that if there were more and more public transports people could not use cars .

Public transports are always late so people prefer to take a car to go to work .
Every day people buy a new car instead of taking a public transport because the car can follow your time , you do not have to waste too much time to wait for .

But I think that in this period public transports are more and more necessary because cars are too much .
So it is difficult to find a car park and moreover cars pollute the air .

In my opinion in the future every state will work to find solutions to eliminate many cars .
Gouverment will try to do something to not pollute the air .
The pollution is the great problem at this time .
So we have to work hard to reduce it .
For this reason is necessary that we spend more money in public transports .

Public transport are the future because I think that if we go on in this way , so we continue to buy cars and cars , in twenty years we will have any place to move .
So we have to find a solution for this great problem .
The right solution could be in public transpors .

Moreover in this period there are a lot of cars that people have to wait so long time on roads .
I think that is more useful to take a public transport because it is cheaper than car and moreover you can spend less time on it .
As the matter of fact in this period there is a lot of traffic and you are not so sure to arrive on time to your destination .

I do not really know how the world in twenty years could be , but I know that if we do not do anything to change our position we would have serious problems .
We need to change our actually position because problems will not find a solution by themselves .
We have to stop the growth of cars to be free to make easy our movements , and also to protect us to the air pollution .
