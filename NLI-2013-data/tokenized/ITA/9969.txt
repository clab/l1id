I agree to the statement but I do n't think that this idea it 's good .
The successful people do n't try new things and do n't take risk because they do n't want to do a wrong impression to the other people .
In fact the successful of a person in many time is due to the other people idea and to the other people impression , and a person that just have the success do n't want to destroy it .

In accord to that a successful person do n't take a choice that is not sure , and do n't make an action that can to pooring his position .
That is not bad in all .
In fact in modern times is very difficult to have successful and is not easy to take a decision that can change all that you do in your life .

But on the other way if you do n't take a risks you can not to growth your success , that because when you try a new things you take same risks but on the other hand if the new things it 's good your success can became bigger than before .

At the start of a life a person have n't success yet , only during the life your action makes your success .
The successful people in the past has take risks that to have success .
In general I think that only taking a risks you can do something in your life , and if you try new things you can find a new matter that you can do very well , and this give at your success a power to large it .

It 's true that try new things is not simple but I think that a person can to search the best everytime and everywhere to enlarge his successful .
We do n't have many good things if same brave people do n't try to do that and do n't take the risks for their actions .
