My personal experience leads me to state that knowing the facts is more important than understanding ideas and concepts , mainly because I think one should try to be as indepenent as possible in life , this including the way one 's own ideas are formed after being explained from a third party in order to be understood .

I think what I am looking for is probably an impossible concept : objective information , or any facts one would like to make research on that are not pre-processed or in any way filtered .

Facts , although affacted by who they are represented and reported by , are far more objective than ideas and concepts that may be communicated by other people , simply because if one is given the idea or concept already , he or she will not be given the right to a more personal judgment .

I think this topic particularly affects me , since I have progressively become aware of how much more knowledge of facts I need in order to understand the present matters of the society I live in .
This includes the understanding of politics in my country in the first place and internationally in the second place , obviously followed by History .
Recently I finally manged to find some time out of my schedule for reading more about the histoy of the last century in Italy , while the next step will be the People 's History , a book on the American History , probably followed by some reasearch on another main topic of our recent times : wars on terror and their political as well as historical backgrounds .

I am convinced that only facts can make me have the whole picture and that only a vast eagle view on them , as a multiple-sourced investigation can offer , will eventually lead closer to a better , more solid objective idea , concept or belief to stick with when choosing in life .
