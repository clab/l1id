One of the most important technological discovery in our days is car .
When it was developed and produced by Henry Ford in the early of twenteeth century , nobody considered this means of transport essentially for his life like it is considered today and I think that it will be the same for a long time .

Cars are at the basis of modern human life and I think that nothing can substitute it because it is the best way of transport .
Each family has got about two cars and they are much used than the others way of transport because it is not only useful , but it also allow to go everywhere you like , nearer or faster .
Thus , each adult use his car to go to work or to go to a trip or someting similar .

Unfortunately , one of the worst consequenses of a massive car use is the great amount of pollution that each car gives in environment .
I 'll hope that , in twenty years , it will be possible to project cars that permit to save the beauty of our planet .
Maybe , the autovehicles fumes will be natural because of their natural source of power instead of oil .
Furthermore , cars will have a lot of optionals that will make easier to drive for example computer car navigators or a lot of characteristics that will make cars not only a simple means of transport but also a thechnology that improve human lives .

In concluson , I think that it is impossible nowadays live without cars and it will be the same in the future .
