The problem of the new trade is directly connected to the fact that we must understand which products have really true effect , and which not .
Today a lot of people go to supermarkets to buy their products , because in these places they can have a lot of chosen .
At the same time we must take attention to what we buy , because a lot of products seem much better than they really are .
Generally we buy an economic product because we think that it must have the same effect than one expensive , but I think that there is a reason if one is cheapper than another , and this reason is not only connected to the fact that one bring an important name , and another not .

Generally when we buy a product that have a maior cost , meaning that we have buy a sicure object , that we 'll can use without any problem , also if we must remember that this is n't always treu , because we always find some surprises .

At the contrary when we buy a product cheapper than another , we can find bed surprises .
For these reasons I buy always products that are n't so cheapper , but also not expansive ; however it depents to what I must buy .

When I buy a dress I want somethingh that give me a garancy of quality , and generally it 's directly connected to the cost of the object ; the same thingh happen when I must buy the meal , or somethingh for my house ...

So I prefer spend somethingh more when I buy a product that must during , and I spend less when I buy somethingh that does n't have much importance , for exemple somethingh that I 'm not sure that I will use a lot .

In conclusion I 'm agree with the fact that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , and for this reason I try to do attention to what I but , trying to buy somethingh that has a middle cost among the products that I can find .

At the same time I want remenber that it 's not always true that an expensive product is better then one that is cheap .
