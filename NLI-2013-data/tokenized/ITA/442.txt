It is generally believed that to have a broad knowlegde of various academic subjects is preferable of being specialised in a sole subject .
As far as I am concerned , I utterly agree with this statement for the following reasons .
First of all , having a broad knowledge of more that just one subjet is certainly more useful to find a job .
In today 's society , the marketplace is extremely full , as a result of which it is particularly difficult to find a job .
If we take university students as an example , the chances that all of them will find an occupation in their respective fields of study is very slim .

It is indeed extremely complicated to find the job of your dreams .
Therefore , given the current situation , it is far better to have a broad knowledge of different subjects , since this is likely to improve the chances of obtaining a temporary job of any sort .

Secondly , to my view , this first option is better for the simple fact that it more interesting and sensible , especially if you are interested in many subjects .
Should a student have as many interests as I have , he will have a lots of difficulties in trying to decide , once for all , what he will study for the rest of his life .

Personally , I like a considerable number of subjects which are extremely different from each other .
As a result , it is hard to make a choice , especially if you think that this is a decision that is bound to influence the course of your life in the future .
Cope with such pressure is very difficult .

As a third point , I would like to add that a person who is specialised in many subjects will always have the opportunity to choose a more specific field of study later on .
In this way , instead of making hurried decisions , he will be able to consider all the advantages and the disadvantages that the subject entails , and therefore be better prepared for his future working experience .
