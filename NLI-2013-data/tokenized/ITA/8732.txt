In my opinion , I think that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concept , because the student do n't forget them .
For example , I study civil engineer and for preparation my examinations , I understand more concept , scientific teory have many concepts that elaborated many ideas , instead if I learn facts , I must hope that I do n't forget them .

When I have starting the university I have find a very good professor that I teach my like understand fully ideas and concept , as to do summarize fact in few ideas and concept , for have complessive panoramics of the problem .

On first time , I worked hard to improve this method , but I have satisfactions while I was studing and during examination .
My memory is not very hard to memorize each ideas and cocept so I write each thing .
Writing help me to recognize and understand ideas and concept , another way of understand ideas and concept is that recording lessons , conversation and other that is important for my everydays 's life .

However is more important understand what there is beyond things , therefore ideas and concepts .
For example when somebody projectd an object , He uses ideas and cocepts of theories that him understand .
For other students that study in umanistic university , I think that it is more important for them learn facts .
Infact when they go to examinations , they must talk about specific facts , like for example stories as civil war , and so They studied specific fact and not only understand ideas and concept .
