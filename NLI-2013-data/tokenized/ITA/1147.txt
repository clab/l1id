In my opinion , nowadays it 's very important to study and to know a specific subject .
Because today we live in a competive world , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects means to spent a lot of time to study , in meantime a student who sutdy only a specific subject spents only some years at universities and in future , after degree , he has the opportunity to work and to continue his studies in his specific area .
This means to have a hig preparation on a specific subject .
For example in architecture area or in medicine area it 's necessary to study a lot of time to become a good doctor or a architect .
So if we imaginate to create a sutding patway that touchs medicine and architecture in the same time , I think that it 's impossible to have the same quality , about knowledge , of a specific studing adress .
It 's iportant to put in evidence the financial aspect of this model .
To study correctly needs a lot of money , in particular with scientific mattres , and to suggest a multiacademic preparation it 's really expansive for the state , and in particular for the student .
So today we live in really competitive world , every years there are new technical innovations , and it 's important to now a correct use of them .
I think with a correct and specific academic preparation it 'll be .
