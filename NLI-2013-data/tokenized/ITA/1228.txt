According my opinion are both necessary , in this century .

To answer the question is necessary , previously , to explain better the issue , because the mainly topic , according my attitude , is what you want to do in your life , what is your porpuse , who want to become .
Everything will change consequently .

Therefore , if you want an easy life , not much complicated , taking the first job that you find , you mus n't have a specific knowledge , but if you have one general , that 's right .

On the other hand , whether you want to go to the `` top '' , in this case , it 's not enought a general knowledge but is much better if you have a specialize , to have a personal specialization , to be unique , to be different to the other .
Such you will have more possibility to realize your dreams .

In conclusion , according my life porpuse I disagree with that statement but sumirize it depends by your schedule 's life , your dreams , your choice 's life .
Each person is different and it 's the beauty of the life !!!

Take your choice , take your life such you make your life .
