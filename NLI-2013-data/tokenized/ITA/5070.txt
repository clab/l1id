This is not a topic for a TOEFL test , but could be a final work of a master degree in law science .

But we can try to tell something also about this ...
In my opinion we live in a world in wich the pubblicity is too much important , comparated to wich it effectivly keep ...
In a year , in our crazy world , the big societies spend much more many for the pubblicity instead than for the safeness of their stabiliments ( and consequently of their workers ) ...
much more than for the insurances of their workers ...
much more than the development of the society in a contest of `` Social Responsability '' ...

It 's horrible !
But it 's our world .
There are many conseguences of this scandalous behavior , some of which kills a lot of persons every years , others that fired workers every day , others that make poor person to be more poor ...
etc etc etc ...

But in this tragedy , we , the person who not have a relative dead in a factory or who do n't have a friend who cannot arrive at the and of the month , we impact only on the face of the problem : the product and the pubblicity ; or better , the contrast between the product what we aspect to find : usually an abyss .

I do n't know what to say about this ...
It 's normal : propose something to the client and construct something different , is the best way ( and it 's legal !!!!!!!!! )
to reach much much much money in few time .

And we know this to be the first aim of a society .
