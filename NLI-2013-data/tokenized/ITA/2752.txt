I agree with the statement for the following three reasons :
First : being young implies still long time to live .
Young people are always full of expectations and hopes because they know there is a lot to live for them , so they can make plans for the future and hope these plans will come true .
Older people have shorter expectations of life and for this reason they are not as hopefully as young people .

Second : young people have always more energies and a better healt .
When people are young they can do a lot of things , for example playing sports , going to see new places , living far from home , going on long holidays , staying up all the night .
They can do all of that because they never get tired and their healt helps them to recovery fast .
When someone is old , for example , ca n't play sports because of his bad health and would be risky for him to go on holiday in certain places such as deserts or high mountains .
The fear of dying caused by their bad healt and their age makes them act with more care and enjoy less the life .

Third : young people has n't seen many things yet .
This give them the joy to live and to make new experiences .
If they are very young they still have to fall in love and make a family .
This two tasks make a young person more happy and full of hope .
The idea of a family is very strong for young people and make them appreciate the life .
An old person have already exerienced these things and ca n't enjoy life as a younger person would .
Furthermore it is not the same if they fall in love again , as it was the first time they did .

For the previous three reasons I think that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
