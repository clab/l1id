People are always trying to achieve success in their lives .
No everyone will be a successful person because it might involve many personal characterists .
I really agree that a successful person is someone who tries new things and takes risks .

Jason , a friend of mine , is a good example of a person who tries new things .
Jason was unhappy with what he was doing in his job , then he decided to quit it and open his own bussiness .
For many years he saved his money and after last summer he decided to run his own office .
He oppened a new kind of drug-store that I have never seen before .
His clients buy medication over the phone without having to leave their house , everything is done over the phoner or via email and all merchandise are delivered at people 's door .
Jason has been so successful with this new bussiness that he is thinking about to open another drug-store .
He made last month more than three thousand dollars .

A successful person is someone who takes risks .
Maria , my friend from my Medical School , is another good example of a successful person .
She graduated as a doctor in 1995 and since there she actuelly never worked as a doctor .
Instead , she prefered to run her own company .
She started selling medical equipments to big hospital and started importing medical supplies from United States .
She took a huge risk on her hands by leaving a career as a doctor to become a simple seller is a big risk , but she didnt care about it .
Now she manager the biggest medical supply company in South America and she became a rich and prosper bussiness woman .

To sum up , being a successful person in life requires some particular personal characteristics .
A successful person is someone who things about new ideas and makes this ideas work , but not only that , a successful person is also someone who takes risks even this can ruin his/her intire life .
