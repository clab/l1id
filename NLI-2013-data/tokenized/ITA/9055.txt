I do n't completely agree with this statement : In my opinion both the understanding of ideas and concepts and the learing of facts are important to the cultural growth of a student .
As a matter of fact , many times , ideas and concepts are consequences of facts happened in that period .
Consequently , students can understand ideas better if they know in what environment these concepts were born : the facts can describe the context in which those ideas grew up .
Following this view , we have to know the importance of the history studies : only throught the knowledge of our past we can completely understand ideas and concepts that grew up in those periods .
For example , only if we undestand what were the economic problems during the 17th-18th Century we can fully comprehend the Industrial Revolution and its new ideas of mass production .

But the opposite can also be true : some new ideas can change the behaviour of people , so resulting in new events in the human history .
For example , some new ideas in the world of the Physic were followed by the Atomic Bomb and by its use during the World War II .
In the same way we could mentione the new researches in the genetic field : surely these new ideas will change the world of tomorrow and will give the true prospective throught which read the future facts .

In these terms , it is not more important for students to understand ideas and concepts that it it for them to learn facts .
What is really important is to undestand that you cannot fully comprehend a concept without knowing the context in which this new idea was born .
