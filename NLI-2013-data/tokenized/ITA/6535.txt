It is difficult to think that in twenty years there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
First of all the car industry is strongly related to the petroleum industry , and they play such a strong role in the world 's economy ; i mean that there are too much interests of too much powerful people , so cars must be used to sell fuel that means petroleum .
It is true that the worldwide transport communications have improved in the last years , a huge `` air traffic '' has taken place especially from the ` nineties , furthermore high speed trains have been created , even here in italy the government is about to creat a high speed line .
And there are also other ways of transport , for example ships , metros and busses .

However in my opinion every man , every woman , prefer to move whenever they want and wherever they like without paying attention to reservate a ticket or arriving in time for the departure and whatever .
And i am an example : i even cannot immagine to stay without my car , i need it for my job , i need it for my holidays and i can take it whenever i want without make a reservation and i am never in late , i mean that my car is `` always waiting for me '' .
As we well know petroleum is going to the end , the reserves of these resource , called black gold , are almost to the end , i do n't know who will be playing the economic rules the next 20 years , but let 's thimk about hydrogen .

Cars working with hydrogen already exsist , but it is too much early to replace petroleum with hydrogen , for the reasons that i mentioned above .
One thing is true : petrolemu will finish and so hydrogen working cars may will take place , and if not hydrogen , another alternative type of carburant , but it is in my opnion that cars will be much more than now
