I completely agree with the statement that at present young people do not spend time to help the community they live in .

Young people at present are less curious then in the past .
This is due to the fact that it easier for them to access information , get answers and satisfy their needs : they do not make many efforts to solve problems and find answers to the question the surrounding world poses .
