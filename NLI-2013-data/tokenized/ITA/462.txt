I do not agree with the statement .
I do n't think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
I 'm not saying that it 's not important to have a rich knowledge about different subjects , but to be succesfull in today 's world , is essential to be extremely prepared about a specific subject .

An example can be a company that produces veichles .
Today in the market there are a lot of companies that make veichles , so someone who studied how to produce veichles is not so different from many others .
So that ' s why is very important for this person to came out with a new veichle that can make a difference .
And to do so he needs to focus on a specific subject .
He needs to study more about a particolar caratheristcs that other veicle do n't have to became more succesfull then the others on the market .
For example it would be a good idea for this person to focus and specialize in only one kind of veichle , maybe he can focus only in SUVs .
He can probably dedicates his studies in how to have a better gas/milage with these type of veichles .
I drive an SUV and I 'm sure that if he can do that he will be considered a god and the market of SUV will increase drastically !
Anyone who studied about making veichles can find a job in the veichle production , but only who dedicate in a specific subject can be more succesfull than the rest and be on the top of the market .

This is only one on an infinity of example to explain why I think that it ' s better to be specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
