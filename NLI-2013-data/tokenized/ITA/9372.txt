I totally agree with this statment that is , in my personal vision , the most important thing that a student should learn as soon as possible , also during the elementary classes .

To learn maths formulas , historical dates , to memorize poems ...
is important ?
Yes , but only in a short term !
For a student is mor important understant the reasons why that there are behind that has studied , overall considering his future , his professional life .

Nowadays , in fact , with the globalization , with the new tecnologies ( such as th worldwide well-know , the world wide web , internet ) and with the fast available of all the informations the real skill is not to know a fact , to be updated about the main issue all around the world ; There is a new verb in English tongue : to google , that means to find informations in a fast way : this operation is easy , is not necessary a particular knowledge .

The real skill is an other .
To apply own knowledge in a particular field , to achieve an adding value .
What I mean speaking of adding value ?
Considering , for example a marketing department for a modern enterprise , I think that the person that follow the product that will be market for the final consumer , called product manager , do not apply only the concepts learn at the university in his project works , but should create an innovative way to push the products thinking to the real necessity of the persons and finding a solution to resolve them .

In this example , there is the main consideration that a student , when was at school or at university should think : do not memorize or learn only to have a good result in the short term ( in a test , for example ) , but for a better reason , in the long term : to find more way to find a solutions or to create new projects .
