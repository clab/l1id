In my life I study at the Politecnico of Milan and I work in a small company that produced electronics components .
When I go , every day at the school , I study many subjects that has refered at the telecommunications .
In this type the University I must before do three years to learn the basic subjects and then I can specialize in one subject of my course .
I belive that there are my advantages and disadvantages to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects that to specialize in one specific subject .

The advantage is that in this way I can have a lot of oppotunity of work and I can be very competivite in my work because I have study a specific subject and I understood every part of my work .
For example in my life when I had finished my study , I known my product , that I had built , very well and I can be very competitive with the other companies that product the same components .
An other advantage is that I can have a lot of money if I have a good specialization in stead of if I have not a good knowledge I have not a lot of money .
This is the situation that there is in Italy .

The disadvantage is that to have a good specializzation in a subject I must study a lot .
If I study a lot of subject I can have broad knowledge and I can be clever in many materials that I can see every day in my life .
For example , in this moment I work in a company and I have not a specific knowledge but I have a broad knowledge of my subject and in this way I can see the vary aspect of my work an then I can deicide the subject that I prefer .

At the end I prefer to have a specific knowledge of many academic subjects because I can understand my subject very well and I can resolve other problems that are specific in my work .
