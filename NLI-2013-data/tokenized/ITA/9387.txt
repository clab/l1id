I agree with the statement , as the the most important thing for a student is to understand ideas and concepts in order to develop critical thinking and good judgement .

First , only by understanding ideas and concepts students can use what they have learned in school and apply it to real life situations .
By understanding concepts and ideas , a student can develop the so called `` critical thinking '' that is the capacity to judge a fact or an idea with maturity and good judgement .
Without critical thinking , prople woul n't be able toassess everyday life situations maturely and make the right decisions .
For instance , how good a lawyer would be if he could recall all the regulation in a certain area of law but could n't interpret the regulation itself ?
He would certainly master the facts but he would n't understand the concept .
I am sure most lawyers would agree with me that in law , more often than no , knowing how to interpret a law is more valuable than knowing the written reguataion .

Second , by learning and memorizing facts , students only develop skills that are not as necessary for business or other professions .
For instance , there is not much value in memorizing hundreds of pages of a marketing concepts if a student is not going to apply that specific knowledge in a financial analyst profession .
Much batter would be , if the student understand and master marketing ideas and concepts that can be applied to his profession as well .
The same applies for other subjects such as Math .
If a students knows only memorizes formulas but ca n't apply those , his knowledge of math will be probably usless .

Third , when students learn and memorize facts they do it only for the purpose of taking a test and not for the purpose of learning something .
The result that most of what the student learn will be lost few weeks later .
This is clearly an ineffective way of using the students time as memorizing requires a lot of time and energies that could be used to understand more ideas and concepts .

To sum up , I believe students should focus on learning concepts and general ideas instead of wating time memorizing facts .
