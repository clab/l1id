In twenty yers we will live in a different world in which we will have completly avoided pollution by wasting less natural resources as possible .
In my opinion , we have already experimented successfully the methods to reach this aim consuming everyday less oil and using more bicycles and pubblic transports .
As a matter of fact the cost of the bus ticket is going down because people is starting again to consider this way of transport as a valid alternative to his own car and as an easiest possibility to save money ( nowadays , the cost of oil is growing too much and , on average , only 2 persons per 5 are available to spend a lot of money for it ) and to avoid to be stuck in the traffic of the city center .

But refusing to drive cars and choose to go to work by foot or to reach university by bicycles is also a good motivation to keep in haelth and to do an everyday-life gym without spending any money which can help us to mantain younger and good-looking as long as possible in order to teach our children or grand children to respect nature and to improve our physical attitude simply by using an alternative transport to cars .

In fact , cars ( as we are used to think of them ) are doomed to be fewer because we will improve the prototype for different way to give locomotion to them .
Recent studies have asserted that is possible to make cars working by involving hydrogene insted of oil and it could pollute and cost ever less than a traditional car .
So , I am sure that cars in twenty years will disappear and we will be able to support the missing of alternative transports better because technology is working to give us the best of itself in order to improve the quality of our life .
