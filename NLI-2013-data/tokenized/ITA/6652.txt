i agree whit the idea thet in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
and now i go to explain may reagion about this question .
if we look the respons about pollution we can see that , for exaple , ten years old , the pollution wos les to compare !!!
if the situation remain inalterated i think that the cars will are fewer .
another point thet we can take are the news borns ..
mor peples mor cars .
another problem about is the job , one person , usually , have a job so far away .
i think thet if the pubblic transport will be mor fluently and quikly i suppose thet the cars will stay at the garage .
