In general , a person with normal mental ability ca n't know a lot of subjects with a deep knowledge of each ones .
It implies that a person must choice between a broad or a specific knowledge of the academics subjects .

In my point of view it 's better to have a huge knowledge of academic subjects .
Infact the advantages followed by it 's are much more numerous than the disadvantages .
In particoular : First of all a wide knowledge of the scholastic matters can help a person in all the aspect of the life that can include social relationship , political choiches , religious belief .
If a knowledge is complete in his widely its become an useful istruments for doing right choiches in these critical events that occur to everyone along all the lifespan .

the second reason is more pratical then the first and is about the opportunities that a huge knowledge can bring to a person in the research of an employee .
Infact an people who are in posses of vast notions have much more alternatives for finding a job then people who have a specific knoledge .

On the other side there are some disadvantages in having a broad knowledge .
In particoular they are : It 's a common opinion that people who learned a vast number of generic notions `` know everything and know nothing at the same time '' .
In other words the lack of specific notions can be seen as a total unknowledge .

the second is that the future of a person with a broad knowledge is uncertain for several years .
