I disagree with the statement : I think young people are as supportive to their communities as they have always been .
Of course `` being helpful '' has changed rapidly because of technologic and scientific progress changing very quickly , also there could be a sociological explanation to the actual changing of COMMUNITIES which is in my opinion very important to consider .

Communities have become more and more diverse , difficult to define and cosmopolitan , a good example is the notoious American melting pot , which of course means that not everyone meeting for example in a class at school or in a neighborhood or also in a political group might be participating to the same type of ethnic or economic community .

Not everyone will therefore know what type of activity a young person is actually doing to support the community he feels more integrated in , or how much time he is dedicating to it .
That does n't necessarily mean he is n't participating in community activities .

Also , our era is moving slowly towards a situation where physical work becomes more and more unimportant and replaceable with technology .
That means young people may be performing very economically sustaining tasks , for example buying community products per internet , but you still wo n't see them in the actual community supermarket or drug store performing manual tasks .

I actually think that in the situation we live in now , it is much easier to have a strong conscious community identity compared with the ignorant necessity of participation of the past , when many people probably could n't even imagine the existence other parallel communities .
In this way , young people are often MORE actively and spiritually involved in their community life than in the past , a characteristic of which for example we have proof in the still growing popularity of volounteer work , naturally influenced by the greater wealth progress in time has brought to a growing number of people .
The so-called `` death of ideals '' that probably would be related to the essay statement in the sense that participating in community life represents a form of actively expressing your ideals , is n't really happening in my opinion - it 's just that the sudden incredible communication possibilities which were given to my generation and the national boundary openness along with a situation of peace between at least western countries has thrown us into the void of thousands of contact and knowledge possibilities through other cultures and communities .

But now , when the general culture comprises more and more of a wide spectrum of cultural , religious , economic and political possibilities , I have the impression that an enormous number of people STILL feel attached to the culture they come from , their parents , their ancestors etc .

Genes and community are strong values I doubt history or time will ever distroy .
We are not in the Brave New World yet , and I do not want to believe that that indifference is the direction we 're going in .
