I think that a young person enjoy life more than an old one do .
A child have much energies to spend in play , in fact he experiences the world playing .
In contrast an old person prefers to be quiet and avoids to move if he do n't need it .

A teen first wants to discover new things , he increases interests , he falls in love , he starts the way to become an adult person .
Differently an older person remember what he did and could become a savior .

In reality I do n't think that the difference is the enjoiment of life , indeed a person can appreciate life if he wants , but the topic is the quality of life .
A young person lives better because is more sane , dynamic , courious , stronger than an older one .

I am twenty-two years old and surely I should enjoy life more than an older man , but I think that a child should be better than me in enjoying life in the same way .

Though this comparation depends from the range between the ages of the two people , I am sure that a young person enjoy life more
