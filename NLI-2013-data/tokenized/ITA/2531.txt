I personally disagree with the given statement .
In my opinion there is only a different way to enjoy the life between yougers and olders .
Young people are in the beginning of their life and they have still so much to try that they are attracted to the more exstavagant things to do .
Also substained by their young age and lower experience they can afford more risk and try situations that make their adrenalin level to the top .
But all of this is only giuded by their desire to become experienced about life , this is not a real more enjoyng way of life .

The older part of the society does not spend a sad life .
They have tried all that emotions in the past and now they can enjoy through others experiences .
With many resposabilities to take care of , they can now get their enjoyment from what they have built , their families , their social relationship lasted many years , their jobs and so on .
I do not think this is boring or less enjoying .

May be the difference that many underlines is in the impact of the two kinds of enjoyment .
It is clear that what a boy do is spectacularly enjoying , i do not want to say it is not , but also the style of living fo an adult can offer a real enjoyment , just a different kind and perhaps more deeper in the soul .

In conclusion we can not do a garduatory about what gives us more enjoyment but , in a easier way of thinking , I want to say that every age has its own enjoyment , the problem is only how to catch it .
