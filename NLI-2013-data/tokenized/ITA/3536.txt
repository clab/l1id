Every generation is criticized by the ones immediately before .
It 's natural and I 'm not surprised about that , but the fact is that I simply do n't agree with statements so general that involve such a huge category of people as `` young people nowadays '' , because it 's impossible to me to group in only one category a so large number of individuals as `` young people '' are .

Anyway , beside the fact that this sentence sounds somehow more as a common-place than as a deeply analyzed statement , I do n't agree with it in details too .
I 'm going to explain myself .

There are various ways to help one 's own community , and I know some people involved in those activities and I am too , someway .
When I was at Liceo , a lot of classmates of mine used to be a part of a catholic association whose purpose was to help elderly people .
Every sunday they used to visit some old people and play charts or other games with them , giving them joy and happines .
I think that this would be a clear example of the fact that young people usually help their communities , even if most people does n't always recognize it .

Moreover , as I 've always liked dealing with children , I spend some of my spare time helping kids who have problems in school-subjects , and that is the way I usually help my community , i.e. in the way the most fits me .

I could number and write about plenty of other young people helping their own community , but I think it would be useless : the most important thing is that I strongly believe that sentences like that are just nonsense , as you can find some young people that never help people around them but also some others deeply involved in providing various kinds of help to their community .
Nonetheless I strongly believe that it would be better if more people helped their community , but I do n't think that this is due to the fact that young people are worse than adults , but to the fact that there is always a need for help , and there will always be .

My opinion , indeed , is that young people nowadays are not so worse than young people of previous generations : the just behave in their own way .
