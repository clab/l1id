It is really good to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects , but specializing is something that is probably more useful once a person starts working .
This does n't mean that a wide knowledge of many academic subjects is n't an advantage for those who have it .

When a person ends his high school or university studies , he finds out that employers of many companies looks for people with specific abilities .
For istance it is not very common for a person who graduated in geography to work for an investiment bank because he probably does n't know enough about the financial markets and does n't have as many quantitative tools as a mathematician or as a person who graduated in economics .
Of course no economic graduates will easily find a job as a geography resercher .
In these specific cases , which are certainly not the only , it is probably better to be specialized in a single subject .

However , it is not very hard to understand that , between those who specialized in just one specific subject , not everyone will be able to have a succesful career .
When a company choses a person to advance in his position , it does n't look only at working abilities ( which are supposed to be pretty good for everyone ) , but it also looks for leadership abilities .
I think that a person that has broad knowledge of many academic subjects will be most likely to have this characteristic : thanks to the many things he knows , he can speak with many different people from the many different areas of the company which he works for .
This comunication ability will make it easier for him to be a leader inside the company .

In conclusion , I do n't really agrre to the topic statement because I would n't be able to chose between broad knowledge of many academic subjects and specialized knowledge : I would spend more time studying , so that I could have both .
