From my point of view it is real that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .

This is a strategy that is usually used in marketing to encrease the market of a particular product .
The goal of this strategy is to give the idea that a product is really useful , and so it is introduced it in the daily reality , making it a common product .

An example of it can be seen in the use of cellphones .
It is real that they are really useful : with them you can call everyone everywhere .
But in the present days they are loosing their original function of phones becoming an object of fashion among the teenagers .
So you can find everyday a cellphone that is better than another one that was selled yesterday only because it has some new unuseful functions .

Another example is that of the ritch cars .
They have some accessories that are not really necessary , whose purpose is sometimes only to transform a car in a sort of mobile house .
In this case the situation is somehow different from that of the cellphones , because the ritch cars simbolize a sort of status simbol .
So the point of the question is that the advertisements on the cars make you dream of a product that is not useful like a normal car .
In my opinion everyone would have a Ferrari , but only because it is a status symbol , and not a car that can be used in the daily life ( it is not designed to go on city streets , ot to go at the supermarket ! ) .

In my way of thinking most advertisement are usually made on products that are not really useful but that only represent a fashion ( this is to say something that will be used only for some time ) or that represent object unreacheble .
But thanks of these properties these type of products seems much better than they really are , and have a great market .
