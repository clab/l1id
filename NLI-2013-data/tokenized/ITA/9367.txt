Knowledge is made of two basic components : the facts , that we can describe as the empirical evidence that our senses , or machines , provide us about reality ; and the ability we have to extract actual information out of this unordered data , which we may refer to as `` ideas '' or better , as interpretations .
Any useful knowledge stock must be made of this two components strongly integrated .

But even if both of the components are foundamental , they have n't the same level of usufullness : while facts can be looked up in books or any other reliable source , a strong conceptual foundation on a subject , which allows for rapid and effective extraction of information , cannot be built overnight .

Specifically in technic and scientific subjects , it 's utterly stupid to try to learn by memory the huge amount of formulas , numbers , rules of thumb necessary for example in engineering .
It is far better to build up the technic and practical skills required in such a field and then go back to the details whenever they are needed , and if possible memorize them over time and exercise , so that they will be stuck in our memory for years once mastered , instead that for days or weeks .

Our memory can be easily paralleled with an archive : an empty archive with a rational structure and the right labels already in place can be filled in no time , an archive which is full of paper but where organizational mayhem reigns , is going to be almost useless , or require an excessive effort to get anything valuable out of it .

Thus students should value carefully every side of the subjects they 're studing , but put a stronger effort on building a conceptual foundation that will allow them to effectively exploit what they have learned trough the years : they should nonetheless be very careful to `` fill the archive '' to have something to exploit in future years !
