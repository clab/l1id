In my opinion ideas and facts are both importants and linked by a relationship of cause - effect .
The fact is a description of what some people thought and they have had the power to traslate an idea in an action .
When I was attending the high school , I remember I told my mother that the school gave us just some information about the facts that has happened and not the possibility to understand new ideas .

For example , in my opinion , the history has two interpretations : some people think that it is useful to learn facts , while other think that beginning from the past facts , you can understand the present history .
The history is like a circle , sometimes it repeats the same situations , the same mistakes , the same facts .

To learn facts is the better way to understand the ideas , and honestly I scared about the people who has got the ideas without knowing the facts or without giving to them the right relevance .

So the fact is important to understand the situation and to analyse which is the best idea to use in that moment .
It 's true that the analyse of facts is useful to start thinking and it permits to stimulate more the brain of the students , with discussion with the teacher .
I hope that in the school there will be during the history class ( or other subject ) , the time to discuss why some facts happened .
