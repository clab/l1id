It is difficult to become an expert in one specific subject without a good knowledge in other different subjects , but it is unproductive and unuseful towards society to have a general knowledge but not the possibility to get a specific role .

Attending the architectural university I have realised how many other disciplines this subject can refer to , history , geography , medicine , astronomy , maths , physic , chemistry ...
and many more .
So my profession will be one and well defined , but it will be the result of differents studies .

In conlusion I disagree with the statement proposed , but I disagree even with its opposite , I think the truth is to be found into the middle .
