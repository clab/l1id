The fist cars start circulate during the first worl war , but this cars were just for rich people .
After the second warld war , people feel better and had the possibility to had a job and improve their standard of life .
CArs factory understand that the car will be the symbol of wellness of the maa society , and start to project cheap and smart cars that a normal familt could bought .
Since this years , cars develope in their structure , in design , in confort , and the in number !
Today a family composed by four people has two cars , one for each parents .
In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for dirrerent reasons .

For example , when one of the sons can drive a car , usually use one of his parents 's car , but sometimes boys that can buy a car just for themselves .
This is a big problem for the health of the world .
Today we can see the big metropolis in the world .
There is too much traffic of cars !
In this enormous cities people ca n't walk in the street , there is too much smog in the air and they ca n't breathe .
Traffic is also very noisy , this is the main cause of acustic pollution .
Our cities are growing up very queekly and the situation that we can see today in the big cities will be also in the small cities and in the country .

Car factory try to design new motors and new cars to control the air and the acustic pollutions that cars caused , but if the number of the cars will grow up , this not solve the problem .

I think that every people in the world have to be something about this and can do something to stop this diredtion .
I have the possibility to buy a new car but I will use my mother 's car until I will need my own cars .
Every one can use public transport and governement have to do something to increment people to use it
