I 'm in agreement with this statement for three principal reasons .

Firstly , the cost of energy is continuing to go up and in twenty years will be much more expehensive than is today .
That is becouse the petroleum is going to be finished in 50 years and the territories with a lot of oil are instable .
In this situation there will be a lot of people who could n't effort the oil and conseguently who wo n't buy the car .

Secondly , there is the phenomen of urbanization in which people leave the countryside for the cities .
This phenomen that is has already happened in Europe and America is happening at this period in Africa e Asia .
More people will live in the cities e fewer cars in use there will be .
That is becouse the people who live in the cities couse traffic or couse public transport facilities have a less percentual of cars respect the people who live in the countryside .

And lastly , there is another problem for who has got a car : when you finish to use it you have to park it !
And in the big cities couse parking restrictions or lack of space it 's often difficult to park it .

For these three reasons , cost of energy , urbanization and problems of parking I belive that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
