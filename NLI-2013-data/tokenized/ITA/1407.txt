It is the hardest choice on everyone 's academic path .
Someone thinks it is better to specialize as soon as possible , others think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
I think children and teenagers should learn as much as possible on many different subjects and during university they should specialize in one specific subject .

When I think about great scientists in the past century I am surprised .
They all had a broad knoweldge in many different fields sometimes very different from each other .
For example Leonardo DaVinci was the greatest painter , philosopher and scientist of his time .
I thinks nowadays it is not possible to reach a deep knowledge in many different field because of the increasing complexity in every subject , furthermore I think it is better to gain a deep knowledge in something than to have broad and superficial knowledge of many different subjects .

Specializing in one field is very usefull for two different reasons .
The fisrt one is that specialized student likely will find job easier because our society is interested in woorkers with specialized and advenced skill .
The second reason is that if you specialize you bacame aware of the complexity of the subject .
Even if a person will work in a different field with respect to the field in which he has studied , he has learned to face difficult and complex problem and it is will turn to be extremely helpfull .
If one learns many different subjects he likely will know just the basic ideas and he will not develop his ability to fix complex problems .

Althought I thinks it is important to specialize in one subject I also belive students should be able to try many different subjects before choosing their field .
It is difficult to inderstand what you are really interested in .
Trying is the best way to make a good choice .
For this reason I think university should allowed first year student to change their major without any charge or penalties .
