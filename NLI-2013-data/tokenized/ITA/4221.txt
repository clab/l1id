I think that I am the kind of person who is willing to give a lot of time to helping my community , but when I get right down to it I can not find so much time .
Probably , like me , a huge amount of persons experiences the same problem .
I absolutely agree with the statement but , at the same time , I can understand why different categories of people do not spend time helping others .

First of all , young people are extremely busy with their classes and sport activities .
Writing papers , preparing seminars and doing homeworks require quite half of the day of each student .
In addition , they are usually asked to be part of a sport team and so they spend several hours a week training and improving their performances .
As a consequence , they are unable to help others , but I think that they do not feel happy about it .
Normally students are altruist and they feel like they are wasting time when they can not improve the life of the community they belong to .

Secondly , people , who have a family and children , are completely full of stress .
Sometimes , they have their own work in the morning and then once at home they have to take care about children .
I think that the real problem is that the life is too fast for them .
All day long , families are planning something or improving something different .
In this way , they can not understand the importance of taking their own time and dedicate some of it to the community .
Poor and alone people , for instance , would be enthusiastic spending a weekend with a family , but , anyway it does not happen so frequently .

Concluding , I want to say that even if I can understand different and valid reasons that lead people living apart from their communities , I hope that , tip by tip , everyone will recognize the importance of spending time within a community .
It can add value to the routine everyone experiences during the week .
Perhaps , I will start doing something for my hometown little community from tomorrow .
