I strongly believe that for students understanding ideas and concepts is much more important than it is for them to learn facts .
Unfortunately , students are often forced to study many facts and events that they will forget in a short time and wo n't be useful for their future careers .
On the other side , when they understand the main concepts and the basis of a phenomenom they 'll likely remember it for a long time .

In my opinion the goal of an effective school system is not not fill in the minds of students with many insignificant tiny details , but to teach them how to develop their own thinking and how to deal with difficult situations .

This is what I 've learned from my personal experience : when I went to secondary school , I had two different art professors ; the first one wanted us to know when and where a paint was made and the tecniques used by the painter .
I was n't interested at all in this kind of information and as a result I didn ' put a lot of effort in studying that subject and now , after a few years I do n't remember any of the painters that I studied with that teacher .

The second teacher was completely different ; she used to put a lot of emphasis not only on the single paint ; but especially on the ideas and the feelings of the author ; she wanted us to learn not the details but the most importantn characteristic of each artistical movement .

I was really fascinated by the method of teaching of the new professor and I think it was also effective because now I can still remember what I studied with her .

Therfore , from both my believes and my personal experience , I can say that it is more important for students to untderstand ideas rather than learn facts .
