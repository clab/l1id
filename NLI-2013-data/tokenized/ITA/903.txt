if someone asks me if i prefer to expect from the university a broad knwledge or a specialized one i will answer that i prefer a broad knowledge .
Obviously in five years is not possible to study all the existing subjects .
The knowledge should be devided in scientific knowledge and humanistic knowledge , so university should offer in a study course a wide knowledge in one of that categories .

These will make everithing more intersting : studing the same subjects for a long time could be boring .
Another fact that make a broad knowledge better than a specialized one is that a wide knowledge is necessary to face work problems better .
Specialised knowledge will be improved during the rest of one person 's working life .
University will never know which particular subject a company needs so it can only offer a generic knowledge , therefore the factory/society that will employ that particular person will teach him the specific knowledge necessary for his future task .

General knowledge provides more flexibility to everyone .
Flexibility is necessary to find the right solution to every kind of problems .
Infact if someone has broad knowledge could solve a problem choosing a solution that has already been used to solve a completly different problem : brainstorming requires a broad knowledge , this lets to present a most wide range of solution .

Another aspect that must me said is that in a more fexible work market people cuold change several times their work , { in America this fact is well kown } so a specific knowledge will not support this sort of evolution .
Everyone has to be ready to adapt to several kind of jobs !!!!
Thats all ..
