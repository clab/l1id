In the modern economy , characterized by the progressive saturization of the markets in each business area , it becomes more and more strategic for farms the use of advertising through the mass media ( television in particular ) .
But often , in order to stimolate consumers ' desires , advertisements seem to overextimate the real potentiality of products .
That assumption is more than that .
It 's a concrete reality .
In fact in the last decade public institutions had been created to control product advertising and to state if the picture offered by advertisements really reflects the product characteristics .

The creation of such institutions points out that in order to improve the sails of a product , it 's much more important the immage the farm gives to the market of it than its real technical characteristic .
For that reason often consumers prefere buying a well-known product than an un-known one , even if it has much more better technical qualities .

An important example of that phenomenon occured in the car builders sector few yars ago .
Two important groups , Audi on one side and Saab on the other one , decided to improve a project for a new car togheter .
I particular , in order to cut down the costs associated to its production , they shared the same motor and also the same structure of the car .
So the two cars had the same performance as reguard for speed , control and other technical parametres , but were a little bit different in the hestetic ( not too much ) .
Well , even if this two cars were so similar , Audi sold millions of unit more than saab did .
And why did it succede in doing that ?
Only because , thanks to a better comunication and advertisement to the market , it had maden people able to believe in the superiority of its product and in the reliability of Audi brand .

But lots of other examples can be shown in all the business area : products pictured as innovative , sure and unbreakle are only common products that you can buy with ease ( and sometimes at lower price ) from another farm operating in the same area .

Finally , looking at those and lots of other examples , I completely agree with the statement presented and I want you all to meditate on such a misrappresantation .
