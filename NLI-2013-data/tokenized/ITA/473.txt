As an old saying goes , in order to be a good scholar or scientist , one should know ` something about everything , and everything about something ' .
This statement obviously refers to an idealistic condition , as it would be very hard , for any real-life person , to thoroughly fulfill any of the two requirements ; it does quite effectively convey , however , the idea that a detailed specialistic preparation loses its purpose , without the background of an adequate general culture , and conversely that generic knowledge itself is futile , if one does not pick up a field of interest in which to seek excellence .

I think that broad knowledge can be useful as a support , as an exercise for the mind , as an extensive source of models and possibilities that may be applied to one 's own specialistic needs .
Specialistic knowledge , nowadays , changes by the blink of an eye : I 'm thinking for instance of medicine , which is my own field of interest .
A good general culture will help you absorb new ideas and techniques more quickly and efficiently , and will help you find new ways around problems .
In fact , gathering specialistic knowledge is all about following the steps of the great who preceded you in your own path ; but if you are looking to open a new way , you may well have to use other models and ideas that can be found in your own , peculiar culture and experience .

On the other hand , it is very difficult to actually do anything constructive , without choosing to specialize in some branch of knowledge of science .
` Knowing something anout everything ' , to get back to the old saying , can hardly take anyone to having a job , or to do it well ...

Drawing my conclusions , I would say that i mainly disagree with the statement provided , in that I think that specializing is essential to play a productive , original role in any branch of culture and , I daresay society .
General knowledge , anyway , remans a powerful tool to help you excel in your own specialization field .
I would end by suggesting that , until the age of 18 or so , education should be aimed at building up general knowledge , or , better , to formation rather than to instruction .
Then , everyone who chooses to go on studying should be encouraged to choose a fitting specialization .
I think that in my country right now , committing choices in young people 's learning paths are being way too much anticipated , and the risk is that the professionals of the future be narrow-minded super-experts .
