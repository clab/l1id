I agree with the proposed statement , because if people is successful , this is even because it has been able to take risks or to do things that are not common to other all people .
In fact if we could all able to take risks , we should be all successful people .
But it 's no so !

A reason for which a man tries new things could be that he wants to give a support to the society in which he lives , improving the lifes of other people ( but even the one 's ) .
It returns on my mind the discoveries of great medical solutions that have been useful to a lot of people all over the world .
But every new solution or discovery could bring even a great economic fortune to its inventor : according to me , another reason could be that the inventor just would like to improve his economic condition .
Perhaps , I could be the first to do so !

I would like to give an example of a successful people : he is the CEO ( i.e. Chief Economic Officier ) of an italian telecomunication industry , named 3Italia .
His name is Vincenzo Novari .
I 've had the fortune to follow him during an university lecture , in which he explained about his personal success and the success of his industry .

He said us that the biggest quality of 3 Italia is that they try new things : this to attract always new clients , but expecially because they want to have as distinguished characteristic that they do n't want to do what the other competitors ( Tim , Vodafone Italia and Wind ) do .

It seems to me a very good purpose for having success and in fact the numbers give reason to Novari : 3Italia is growing in the number of clients , and the biggest part of them is happy for having this telecom .
