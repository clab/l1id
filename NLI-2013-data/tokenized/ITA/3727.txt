I do not agree with the statement because I think that , at least in the Country I live in and for the experiences I had , young people give aid to the communities in fields where the State has not enough money to do everything it 's supposed to .
I 'm not that old , so I cannot tell exactly how it was in the past , but today I can tell that also if society is getting every day more individualistic and selfish , people take care of the persons in need and try to help them as much as they can .
Many volunteer organizations have grown up in the city I live since I came here eight yers ago , and most of the volunteers are young : they mostly act in welfare , providing food to poor people and covers during the winter time .
It 's true that it 's not the majority of the population , but I know a lot of people ( and I am one of these ) that spend part of the week trying to do something good for others in their own cities .
Many people goes far in the world , like in third world countries , to help people there , but sometimes does n't realize that just in the neighborhood next to their house there is somebody who needs the same kind of help .
But welfare is not the only field : volunteer organizations have born also to help the State preserving the huge cultural heritage of Italy , giving a fundamental help when an earthquake damaged the central part of the Country , preventing the loss of incredible art treasures .
I think that most of the things I exposed are done by young people because most of them are still dreamers and feel better acting like this .
They are usually more enthusiastic and to them it 's not enough to just give money for charity .
