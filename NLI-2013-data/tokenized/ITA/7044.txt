I disagree this statement ,
but i think that this idea is not totally incorrect .
In twenty years the things changes and i dont't know how we will travel with .
The todays cars are a very important problem because the car create a lot of air pollution .
the cars are the most pollution producers on the earth .
In this case I think that people in future wants to change theyre abituds and so travel with a different transport ( train for example ) .
But i think that in twenty years cars changes too .
I see a not pollution cars use a clean energy and the problem of pollution will be stopped .

My preoccupation is about the number of people that in twenty years can becameing too much for travel with cars .
What that i think is that in the future can persist only the taxy and the bus because the spaces will be full in the streets .
people will travel most with airplane because the journey will be longer than at present .
My wish is that we find a solution for the air pollution and not only obviusly , and I dream a modern wonderful cars go with a particular new energy discovered from a new particular planet .
I think it was possible .
The solution if the people wants is behind the corner .

I have studied for became a designer and I want to se cars forever and in my rouls i want to understand what is possible to do for resolve the cars pollution problem .

The problem of air pollution in twenty years becaming a very very serious problem .
There are now a new solution with new engines wich go with gpl or new oil
