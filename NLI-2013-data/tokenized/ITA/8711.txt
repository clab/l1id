Some students learn only facts , while others are able to understand the ideas and the concepts that derive from those facts .
According to me , that I am a student and so I 'm really concerned about this , only learning a fact without learning something from it it 's unuseful , as students are n't memory machine but they have also emotions and some facts can touch them .

For example , if I have to follow a lesson , which speaks about the progressive movement , obviously I will learn all the fact that had derived from this movement and I will be interested in learning it , but only this will not satisfy me .
In fact I think that it will be more useful and more interesting if I can go inside this movement and understand which are the reasons why this movement was created , what was the background of that period , what was the most important thing that pushed people who belonged to this movement to act in that way ...
Otherwise , I do n't learn nothing that can help me to improve myself , as I 've only learned a series of facts without having understood them .

Another reasons is that , if students are taken inside the facts , they will be more involved and so they can appasionate to it and will follow every lessons paying more attention .
For this reason , I think that seeing films which speak about a particular event , is a thing which can help students to learn this event , as films do n't describe only a fact , but allow us to share the emotions of every character who is involved in the event .

In conclusion , I think that only learning a fact is a void learning as it does n't help people to improve themselves , so I will ever try , everytime that I will approach to learn something , to understand ideas and concepts at the basis .
