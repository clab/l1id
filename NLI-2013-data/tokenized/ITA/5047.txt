According to my personal experience I can say that it is true that sometimes advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
I agree with the statement because I think that producers are interested in selling their products even If they know that products they made are not as good as they are described by the advertisement .

I think that producers spend a lot of time ( a lot of money too ) trying to create advertisements that makes products much better than they really are .
If an advertisement is well done , you will probably buy a product in order to try it , even if this product is not really necessary to you .
You simply buy the new product althought you do n't need it at all only because the advertisement impressed you .
And when you try the product you bought , or taste it , or use it , you can discover that sometimes it is quite different from how it was presented or described by the advertisement .

For instance if you are looking for something to clean away an oil 's spot from the floor and you see or read about a new product wich is the best in solving problems like this , you 'll probably buy it .
But , once at home , you 'll probably discover that the product you 've just bought is not as fantastic as the advertisement said .

Something like the situation I 've just described occured to me .
I was searching for a new type af nail and I saw on a magazine an advertisement of a new nail with a great brigthness .
For this reason I went to a shop and I boutgh one of this nail .
When I tried it I discovered that it was identic to a nail that I have before .
