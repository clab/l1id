I agree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than the older people do .
In my personal experience when I was young I enjoy myself with simple thing like play football , riding bike , go to meet all of the relatives in the christamns hollyday , and many other activity that today I consider boring .

I think that the guys enjoy life more than the older people do because is the first time .
The first time that I take the motorbike I think that one of the best days of my life .
Than today when I take the motorbike to go to the school I think `` Oh no !
What distance I must do today ?
Terrible ! ''
.

I think that the caotic and full life of the old people do n't give the possibility for enjoy from simple things like the young people do .
An old people wake up on the morning and go to work early .
At lunch hour he take an sandwitch and reuturn to work and in the evening she came to the home at seven ot eith o'clock , have dinner and the day after he restart the same life .
I believe that she less enjoy life as an younger people that after only four hours of school in the morning come to home to have lunch and have all of the afternoon to do whatever he want .
