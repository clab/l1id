in my opinion young peole do n't enjoy themselves then older people do because we speak of two distinguisced way to enjoy .

For exmple , if we keep an young and an old we can note that the older have many responsabiities than younger , for example they can have little children to regard so if they decide to go out , they prefer , i think , go to the resaurant an d came back home early .

An young if decide to go out , go out more late and back more late .

But i do n't think that the houres do the difference in enjoy life .

You cau stay well also remainded an appointament because you are tired , because you say that the morning have to work and so refer to remain whit your family .
In my opinion young people have changed the value to enjoy whit to go out .
In fact i think perhaps that my mother or my grand mother enjoy more than me or my sister .
