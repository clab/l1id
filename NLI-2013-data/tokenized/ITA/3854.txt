Nowadays , the society is changed and it 's becomed a society which primar value is time : people never have time .
This lessance of time can be read also in human relations .
This behaviour is clear in young people .
Regarding their behaviour , something is evident .

Young people opften have not respect of others and never have time to spend for the community and helping it .
Sometimes it seems thay live in a word apart .
They do n't look to the needs of people around and they even never think to make something to help them .
Many examples occurr everyday to support this idea .
The first , about the respect for other people , can be inferred , for example when youngs often smile about other people 's desease ; it happens to see an old woman in difficult to cross the street and near her a group of adolescents , looking at her ; well , it is really unusual seeing them helping her to bring the bags or simply to cross the street .

Another sign is about volontars ; many of them are old people and there 's a little quantity of young people .
For example , in my city , every sunday there 's a group of people who spend the day to make something helpful for society : sometimes we go to clean the parks , or other days we wash the walls from wrintings ; well during my experience I never met young people .

Another example can be simply inferred from school 's world : at the beginning of the year , teachers invite their students having meeting to plan activity in group : I always went and I found only the teacher .

And it is worst if we talk about meetings to help students at the first year .
Concluding , it is really difficult involving young people in useful projects ; I care this is a sign of proceeding time and of parents , not able in teaching an important life 's value , whinch is to collaborate with other people and to be ready in helping the next .
