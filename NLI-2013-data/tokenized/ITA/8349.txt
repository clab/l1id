There are a lot of things that a good student have to do ; indeed , I think that to study in the right way ia a very difficult thing to do .

It 's important for students to understand ideas and concept .
It 's important , in other word , to learn a lot of information about all the subjects that a student is studing .
For example a math student have to know , and to learn , and in particular way , to understand very well all the rules of his subject .
If I think to my personal experience , it 's very important for me to study carefully , for a lot of reasons , but two are the most important .
Fist of all for my personal knoledge , because only studying , in my opinion , I can know a lot of different things and I can open my mind .
Second , only studying carefully , I can learn different and often difficult information .

On the other hand , it 's important to learn facts too .
It 's important to verify all the topic studied , in reality .
It 's important to do practice about all the topics that a student have studied .
The math student , after have studied a rule , have to do a lot of exercises about it to understand it , and at the same time it 's important to know what mathematics have done in their life , for example what they had studied .
It 's important to read newspaper and to have information from the reality .
An economy student have to know how business are going now in the world , and have n't only study economy from books .

In conclusion I disagree with the statement because I think that both of these concepts are important .
If you study something and do n't do practice on the same topic or you have no notice about facts , you ca n't undertand in the right way this topic .
In the same way if you know facts , but you have n't study before , you are n't study in the right way .
