I do n't think it can be considered as a `` natural rule '' the fact that older people enjoy life less than young people do .
At the same time I must say that it is what generally happens , and for several reasons .
First of all , we live in a society ( I 'm specifically talking about the italian society ) in which the age a person decides to leave his family , for many reasons such as lack of job opportunity , lack of `` bravery '' and so on , is close to 30 .
This means that , until that age , young people do n't face a lot of responsabilities they 'll be obliged to face in the future .

Less responsabilities for young people means at the same time :
a ) more available time for them , who generally use it to enjoy life ;
b ) less available time , and more and more thoughts in consequence to their responsabilities , for the parents .
This is the general scheme of a normal italian family 's dynamic .
Fortunately it-s not always like that .
My personal experience support me stating hat .
In fact I left my house when I was 18 and I came to live and study here in Milan , where I found a job and have my life without any dependence from anyone .
That allowed also my parents to spend the time they `` earned '' in some other activities , like having hobbies , or developing their personal interests .
Enjoying their time .
Enjoying their life .

Even if this is the most important reasons that brings me to affirm that young people generally enjoy their life more than older ones , there 's a second that is just a physiological reason .

It is not difficult to understand that when we are young , we feel like we can climb mountains , travelling around the world without stops .
We are full of energies , our bodies are ready to face almost every kind of situation .

It is not the same thing for older people , who necessarely have to maintain a sort of proportion between their efforts and the forces they dispose of .
A lot of things become forbidden just for physical reasons .

But on the other hand , as I said before , older people can enjoy their life in a different way , proportioned to their possibilities , like travelling , or developing interests
