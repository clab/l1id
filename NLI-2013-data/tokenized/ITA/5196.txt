I surely agree ! ..
I am not happy to know this thing , but it is the truth .
Advertising is made to convince people that a product is better then all the others .
Nowdays the answer is fewer than purpose , so companies needs to advertise their products to sell them .

In this cetury , or better in the last fifty years the diffusion of mass media all over the world and the born and capillar diffusion of television are the best `` friends '' of advertising 's lies .

There are a lot of psicology studies about human behavior to constuct a perfect advertise .
There are also some ways to test if an advertise has been remembered by the pubblic or not .
Somebody makes a lot of research about behavior in the super matrkets or into the commercial centers , too .

Nowdays yoo can assert that adverisements do not sell a product but they sell a dream .
They imply ...
fulfill that dream is easy : `` you only need to buy thath product or servce ! ''

However in the real life is different becuse what television spot suggest you , it does not occur .
For example the washing products never function on their own and at the first time yuo use them ..
when you wash something , usually you need to wash it more and moer to clean if not it rest with rubbish on !

As I have arleady wrote i am not happy about this thing but i hope that people will chaege this way to sell ..
i do not know how people can change this thing but I am sure that is occur in few years .
