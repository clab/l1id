Car is the most common transportation mean for millions of people : a passion for some , a necessity for most .
Although today it does n't seem possible to eliminate the use of car , many reasons would lead to think that in the future this situation will change .
As the world population grows , as the cities get bigger and industrialization reaches the underdeveloped countries , the number of cars increases constantly bringing the pollution rate , which is already unbearable in many areas , to grow even more .

For it 's being shown how pollution is related to mortal illness , serious actions must be undertaken to bound this problem , and finding the way to reduce the number of cars , at least as we know them , is a primary objective .
Of course major infrastructural and scientific improvements have to be pursued by Governments , spending more money and efforts into public transportation systems and logistic research .

Moreover , the worldwide oil crisis ca n't be taken into account .
Oil availibility is shortening every year , and in 50 years oil extraction will cost too much to be considered as the most spread fuel source .

As of today , something is moving in the energy research field , and hydrogen fueled cars are on the agenda of many corporation .
Though I believe that conversion from oil to hydrogen is a really long task , since the lack of facilities and infrastructure needed to complete such a big transformation .

For the reasons expressed above , it is really difficult to predict the future of modern transportation , but one thing seems clear : long term , tcars as we know them , will disappear and it 's not unlikely that this process will take place in the next decades .
