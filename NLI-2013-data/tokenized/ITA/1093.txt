Some people think that it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many and different academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
Both the opinions present several strengthens and weakenesses but I 'd rather agree with the former position .

First of all , I think that broad knowledge is really important in the modern world .
In the business world for example , you have to be able to talk both about business and about products .
To talk about the former you have to know something about economics ; but if you have to talk about the latter you should probably know something about sociology and customer satisfaction .
That 's what I thought when I had to decide what to do after the High School .
On that occasion I decided to study Engineering and among the different majors I chose Civil Engineering because it did n't provide me with too much specialization .

Second , I also think that it 's very difficult to decide which particular subject to focus on .
In this sense , it 's much better to study and cover many academic subjects in order to be flexible .
In fact , flexibility makes you able to focus on different issues and on different subjects during your life .
That 's what has happened to me .
I am an Engineer but I actually work for a famous economic consulting firm .
Everyday life asks me to focus on different problems in different fields and that 's why I say that flexibility is an important value .
In that sense , having a broad knoledge of different subjects can help you to keep your mind open .

Considering all the things stated above , I think that specialization does n't consider the social evolutions of the modern era .
In fact , in today 's world , people must cover different fields in order to reach success .
