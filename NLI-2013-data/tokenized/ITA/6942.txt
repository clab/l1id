The number of cars on our planet is a very important problem but we are moving on the right direction and i think in the next twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today .

The first point to support this opinion is that the oil is going to finish in not a long time and still now there are n't other tecnology as efficent for cars .
Therefore to use cars will be more expensive and less people would pay for that .

Another point is the air pollution caused by cars .
Infact the environment is damnaged by cars and to solve this problem the solution is to reduce the number of cars on the Earth .

Finally the pubblic tranports are becoming more efficent and there are a lot of projects to construct new metropolitan line , railways station and to increase the number of buses , so iwill be more easy and fast to use pubblic transport .
Also the flights by planes are going to become more cheaper in the next twenty years and they will to cover more short distance lines , so an increasing number of people are going to use often the plane instead than cars .

To conclude I think in twenty years there will be fewer cars in cars than today
