I respectfully disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I see that many of my young friends are engaged in something that is ultimately aimed to helping their communities .
For example , some of them do social work , including helping homeless , elderly people and disables .
They want to feel socially useful and helping the others ultimately make them feel closer to the community they live in .
They are so enthusiastic about their social work that they try to make as much time as possible to dedicate to it .
I have done and continue to do social work myself .
However , time is never enough , particularly if one considers that social work is generally unpaid .
My friends and I do social work in our spare time .
In fact all of us have different main jobs , which are important to pay the bills ( but working to pay the bills is not always just enough ) .
Some other friends of mine are engaged in local politics .
They believe that they can change their society in a way that is more suitable to their values and reality .
They have therefore decided to play an active role in shaping local politics .
This is not an easy task , at least where I come from .
Existing politics belong to a different generation and generally view younger people as too unexperienced for politics .
On the contrary , I see young people 's political commitment as just another way to helping their communities .
And is n't it true that politics should be the expression of democracy and participation of all citizens ( including young people ) to our society ?

On the basis of these examples , taken out of my personal experience , I believe that young people more and more try to find time to helping their communities , because they want to change the reality they live in .
However , my experience may well be different from other realities and other parts of the world , where the participation of young people in their communities is limited .
I feel that helping their communities can be very rewarding for young people who make time for that .
At least this is what I have seen in my own experience .
