Since cars have been invented an increase in the production has raised and nowadays to use of a car it has become a priority to everyday life need .
I personally do n't agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
As a matter of fact I believe that actually it will probably be the opposite .
Infact in a world that is under continuos and enourmous progression specially in the mechanical industry , I believe that the problem in the next twenty years will be were to put the cars not their use .
Indeed the problem should be faced form another point of view which is how should we regulate the use of cars since allready the situation is terrible .

It is true that cars have become a major part of life especially for people who live outside big cities .
In many cases for example it is the only way to reach the towns in order to go shopping because the pubblic transportation are not efficient .
As a conseuqnce the more we continue developing real estate of our cities the more the use of our car will continue increasing .

Looking to the future makes me think that the situation will be even worse .
All of the interests involved with the use of cars such as gas , insurance policy ecc .
will make the production of cars increas tremendously and probably the bad aspects like pollution related to the use of cars will not be a priority .
