In today 's world advertisement has a really big impact on our lives .
In fact , we usually think of advertisement only as a boring phenomenon that interrupts our favourite tv or radio programs or pollutes our streets and underground-stations with its commercials .
But advertisment is a much deeper phenomenon that involves our lives , and many could even swear that it is a kind of art .

The importance of advertisement should not be underestimated , as it can influence even our way of living .
This happens through the needs that commercial ads can create .
For example , if we see the newest and thinnest stylish modern colourful last-generation mp3 player , we think that we need it , but we do n't buy it immediately .
In fact , most of the people , called `` followers '' by marketing people , are not those who want to possess the newest commercial success , but those who want to have it as soon as it has established itself as a fundamental gadget for the everyday life .

It follows that a succesful commercial makes the advertised product appear as something special , that makes one be distinguished among other people because of some special features , style , or sometimes just the brand that his or her objects has got .

In my opinion , this means that the product itself is much less worthy than it seems to be to the crowds that stand in long lines in order to possess it .
However , if this stuff is truly important , is up to everybody 's personal feeling .

Unfortunately , sometimes some products are even unhealthy , for instance some kind of food , for the consumers .
Those products can have a double negative impact on buyers .
First , they could be damaging , and second , they could even become addicted , as it could be in the case of alcohol , tobacco , some fast-food or sweet drinks These products are therefore not only worse , but even dangerous .

Therefore , in this time of consumism we are living in , everybody should be very careful handling with advertisements , as they can easily show us some aspects of a product and hide those that are not wanted by the masses , or even deliberately tell us a lie about its peculiarities .

In conclusion , I guess it is really difficult sometimes to resist to the power of advertisements , but everybody should try to be a mature consumer , aware of the risks of not considering all the aspects related to our consumistic behaviour , as advertisement tries to make only money ..
