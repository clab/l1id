What is better :
If i know something of all i can think a better and different solution for a problem and mix some different ones that in the most of the cases si better than using always the same solution , well is also true that if you are specialized in one tipe of subject he can make a better and more efficent solution for what is specialized but if the problem go out his knowledge you could have much problems .

Having one of some specific subject in wich you are interested and studings that also by yourself can meke a better preparetion and bring you to do a work you like to do .

In the accademic contest is also better have a broad konowledge due in the accademy you have someone who explain you the things so you colud understend things that only reading one book never explain , is also true that there are certein argoments for what every people is not predisposed , in that cases , well , i thing is better avoid these subjects , yes is not the best solution but i hate break my head over a thing that i never understend , and i prefer dedicate that time to other acticities hows give me a soddisfaction .

It also better know somthing of all in the everiday life for a better response to the problem that occurs and also for giving a better advice and answer to friend .

In conclusion i think that is better know many subjects than specialize in only but having some specific and personal knowledge can identify you from a pool of applicant for a job or in some ather palces .
