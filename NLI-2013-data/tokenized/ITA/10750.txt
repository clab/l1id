The statement that 's exposed on the left is an important point of the own life of every person .
I think the that statement rappresents the two large kind of person in the world : the successful people and the normal people .
As like as the statement , successful people try new things and take risk .
Instead normal people only doing what they already know how to do well .

I agree with the sentence .
In my opinion trying new things it 's the best way to grow your personality .
however a different point of view to the same thing can open your mind , and open to you different way to resolve any problems .

In 1492 Cristoforo Colombo went to America and come back .
He was a successful person becouse takes risks in his adventure .
Since 1492 , the conseguences of his choice during still today and past the ages .
Today his name is in the most popular history books around the world .
The different between Colombo and a normal person it 's in his choice , it 's in his point of view .

To be a successful person we have to fallow the Colombo 's choice in our own life .
If we are going to do only the things that we know how to do well we probably remain normal persons .

In my personal experience I can see the meaning of the statemet that I exposed before .
The person who free its mind going to be a successful person .
At school , but not at all , this concept is more understandably .
A large part of students study on book and do n't practice what they have learned .
The proffessor gives to students a basic formation , that they can enlarge only trying new thing and new experience out of the school buildings .
A successful student , like a successful person , has to try some different experience in his life to the complete formation of himself and to become a successfuf
