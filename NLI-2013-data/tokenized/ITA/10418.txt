in my opinion successful people try new things and take risk in only situation , when they already know how to do well and when they do n't know .
the courrage is the fondamental power to try new things and take risk independently to know how to do well .
in my opinion know how to do well help very much .
an example of successful man is my father , he invested last year much money in a new activity in china .
the china is the most place which invest money because the worker don ' cost much and the tecnology is such as the western 's but with a down cost .
this is a sort of speculation in a new economy .
my father have take many risk because he used bank 's money .
his secret is the his great passion adn ability in economy because in a magician with the contability .
he think to do well to use a company of engineering that is specialized to do cloth with the higher quality in italy .
it ' s very important not demoralize , the moral have always high .
