I think to a large degree that the fact in the future there will be fewer cars in use than today it depends strectly on technological progresses .
Having a look in to the past and comparing that situations with the one we are living today we can say that there were a lot of discovering processes that allowed the society to change its scenary .

In fact 30 years ago , referring to the modern era , the scenary was characterized by new hi/tech inventions in the field of mains of transports .
in fact the airplane transportation existed since 1950 but increased immensely 30 years ago when people could travel around the world without problems .
So , i think that if the technology continues to perform and to grows as it did in the past i can say that probably in the future we will have fewer cars than today .

So i completely agree with the statement because i think that in the future people will not use anymore cars for any kinds of transportations needs , thanks especially to modern technology .

Nowadays if we have a look to modern cities we can see that people moves from a part of the city to another using underground .
So i think that people will use fewer cars for differents reasons > First because they do not want to make the queue on the streets Second they replace cars with others mains of transports because they do not have to be concentrated in to driving .
Third because in the future we will have better mains of transport , in fact we know that researchers are projecting a new type of train project .
I am referring to the new train that will connect the Europe with America .

So this train will be positioned into a tunnel .
the tunnel will be build under the sea that permit to the train to cross the ocean in only 9 hours .

So the future humans life will be very different from now .
