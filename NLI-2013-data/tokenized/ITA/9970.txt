I partially agree with this statement ; according to my opinion people should try new things as much as possible in order to enlarge their horyzons .
That provides more experience which is a very important thing that is useful in facing new or unexpected situations .

On the other hand , taking risks could lead to the loss of success that one person has achieved before .
So I think that a reliable way to value a risk is that to think about its consequences .

For exaple we can look at economy market .
Economy market is a well known enviroment where someone can achieve success and easily lose it .
In this field you may become richer by following new ways of money investment , but if they fail , you would experience what really the word `` risk '' means .
Although continue in doing what you know to do well , would take you away from loss of success , the only way to have more is to do more .

Let 's see another example , which might sounds more familiar and could explain why I do n't fully agree with the statement .
We can easily aplly the statement to the world of working people .
In your working carreer you can follow this two main ways : aplly for different works in your life in order to get more experience or aplly for a work that you surely can do well and focusing on it .
The second way is better if you would like to achieve success because if you are sure you can do one thing very well , it might be recognized by other people and thenyour carreer may proceed on higher levels .
On the other hand if you are forced or choose to change work frequently , you wo n't get any valuable success .
Starting a new experience , in which also we 're not sure to do well , could bring a sense of frustration because the continous shifting among works leads you everytime to the starting point .

Now it might be clear what I mean when I affirm that I do not fully disagree with the statement : It 's a matter of point of view , some life experience can provide success by risk , other cannot .
