All the people have a different opinion about this statement and many times in my life I just had spoken about this with my friends or my parents .
The conclusion I can find is that young people not enjoy life more thar older people .

I say this because I think that in the course of the life every man change his opinion about enjoy the life .
So in the youngs ages the idea about enjoy life is based only in to have a good time , to enjoy with his friends and to have always more free time .
When we grow this kind of view change for many people and if change the kind of view the behaviors change too .
This new mentality of the older people is the reason of the change of `` enjoy life '' .

In fact if when we are young the most important thing is to have fun and enjoy the life ( in his classical interpretation ) , but when we are older we prefer to enjoy the life in different ways .
The older people in fact prefer to enjoy their family , their wife , their child and for this reason probably they spent different their money .

I think this because now I am 24 years old and just I saw this change in my mentality .
When I was a young student I liked always to have fun and to enjoy , and I spent all my money for this , but now I have finished the university and my kind of thinking about enjoy life is changed .
Now I thinking more to find a good job and to buy my house .
But I enjoy life too , only i do this in a different way now .
It 's sure that when I grow more and I will more older I will change this way to enjoy life , but it 's normal , I think this appen on all the people .
