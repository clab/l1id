I completely agree with the statement : even though facts are important , I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts .
In facts , sometimes ideas and concepts are behind a fact , they are the main causes of them : understanding them is the best way to have a real comprehension of the facts .

I will show two examples that can support my opinion .
In a scientific theory , for example the theory of gravity , I think that the most important thing to know is the main concept of the theory : an object is attracted by the center of the Earth , because everything in the Universe has a force of attraction because of its mass .
This is the concept , the basic idea of the theory : understanding it it 's more important than studying the formula .
Once I have understood this concept , I can study the facts : the formula of the Earth 's gravity , how scientists discovered this theory , what experiments were made in order to demonstrate it et cetera ...

In the same way , I think that is more important to understand ideas and concepts also in other subjects .
For instance , it could be really important in history .
For example , when someone has to study the period of the fascism , in Italy and in Europe in general , I think that a good comprehension of the fact should focus on the societies in these years , on the economical conditions of these countries after the I World War , on what people though after a terrible event that happened in Europe before .
Facts , dates , events , are important , but in my opinion come in a second time .
If a student does not understand that fascism can occur when a man with a big personality has the power where there is a particular , social and economical situation in a country , he will not understand the main causes of the event .
On the other hand , if he understand it , he could understand the causes of fascism and why some european countries have had a dictatorship after the World War I .

In conclusion , I think that ideas and concepts are fundamental in order to understand the causes of something , then facts derives from these causes .
