In my country I think that it is very difficult to help in communities .
The school takes away most of the freetime that a student has .
During the past year I have been an `` au pair '' in the USA .
One of the kids that I was used to take care , a 7th grader , had to help in her communities and do some volunteer work .
I know that the school organize this kind of things and I think that is really helpful for life that a kid finds time to help other people .
It gives the person time to be with other people , time to talk about the things that are happening around and see what your community needs to be taken care of .

I don-t really agree with the statement .
Because I think that there is not enough time sometimes to help in this really important service .
I can speak for myself now saying that soemtimes i cut a little time to help others but in this way I found myself in a hurry to do other important things that had a priority first .
I experienced a community service in the States and I had no problem on finding time for that .
I had to collect clothes in a tiny community center for a thrift store .
It gave me a so much that job that I would recommended to anyone that wants to do a community service .
And , there are a lot of other things that would need to take care of , also , some funny things to do with children while their parents are at work or give some help to poor families that doesn-t have somebody that can help them .

I agree that many people have time and they don-t care on helping in this kind of services or they prefere to occupy theirselves in other things .
But mostly , I think that the main problem is in how the community is organized and in how people expected it to be taken care of .
Maybe a little bit more of relation between school and services , also used for extra scholastic credits , would make a difference on having more time for students to help in communities .
