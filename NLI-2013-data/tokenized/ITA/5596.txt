For what concerns my point of view , nowadays advertisment is used to convince people buying products that are often of lower quality than they seem on the tv spots or on the advertising spaces .

I think most of the companies are only interested in earning as much money as possible .
Their policies don-t always care about ethic and moral principles .
This attitude is reflected in the way they act when advertise their products .
They want to caught the eye of the consumers with bright colors , wanderful images of idyllic places , beautiful women , music and similar things .
They work hard , thinking about what attracts the majority of the people , what are the desires and the dreams that their target customer has .
But on the other side they do not invest enaugh money and time to improve the quality of the goods .

I think every customer at least once experienced the misleading informations advertising conveys .
When I was a little child I always want my parents to buy things I saw in the television spots .
For instance , when I was six I was amazed by the spot of a doll that could speak with children .
I thought that she was able to answer every question I may ask to her .
But when I went to the toys shop and I tryed it I was really sad in understanding her abilities were only crying and saying she was hungry , thirsty and sleepy .

Now I-m no more a child but often products that attracts me with advertising don-t satisfy me at all .

I think that governments should be more severe with companies , checking if the standard of goods really meet the promises of the spots .
The companies can-t be free of telling lies to the customer , beside this he must = e protected by the law .
