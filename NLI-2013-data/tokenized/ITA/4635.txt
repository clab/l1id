I think is true that advertisements make products seem better than they really are , in fact the researched effect of advertisment is that people will buy the product .
To get this results there could be two differents ways .
The fist is based on spots : if you want to sale something it is natural that you will show its qualities even exagerating ; in commercial world there is alway a fight to get more and more buyers and it does n't have importance if the product has really the stated qualities , the only important thing is that someone buy .
On the other hand showing a product better than it really is has a negative conseguence , a person who had bought this product expecting some caracteristics will not be satisfated about that product , so it is possible that in future he or she would not buy it another time .

An other policy should be to spent less money in spots and more to make the product better , so a owner will found all the requested qualities in the product and will buy it another time .
The negative aspects is that people will probally buy often the product they have already seen even if it costs more than others .

In conclusion I think that for companies will be easier to spend money on spots because it gives immidate results while the other way semm to be more difficult .
It is on the owner to understand if the product is actually as good as the advertisement makes or if it is only a way to make people convinced to buy it .
