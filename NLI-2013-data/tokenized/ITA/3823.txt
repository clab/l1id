Nowadays is more difficult to find young people that give enought time to helping their communities because they have a lot of things to do .
For exemple , if a studend go to the university he will not have the time to spend for anything because he must study and he must do the homework and in particolary case he have to caught the train .

young people spend also a lot of time to do inusefull things like smoking and staying in a bar .
I can say with may experiences that there are a lot of young people that spend their time to helping their communities .
I usually go to hospital as volontian and I can see some gay like me .
There are different way to help the communities : it is possible to help some people that feel ill in a hospital but sometime you can not see that there are some people near you that need your help .
You can go to the church and give your contibution for the poor people and if you want you can prey for them .
Now I can say that is truth that some young people do not give their time for different motivation but I sure that also only one little help , like a sweety word is important to help someone .
You can not see a little thing but is very important .
In conclusion I hope that there are young people that help needly person in different ways .
