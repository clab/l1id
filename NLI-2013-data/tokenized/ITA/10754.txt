I think there ' re two groups of people when we speak about success : people who gains a better position using at best it 's own qualities and others that reach the goal thanks to the luck or to other people .

In the first case if we pay attention to the past story of the person who makes success we can surelly find an invenction , an idea , a kind of stroke of genius that changed his/her existence .
I do n't state that luck is unuseful in this occasion , but I can adfirm that it plays a secondary role .

When we speak about success we generally refer to the world of our job .
In my opinion it 's easy to see that often the success is related to the ability of an individual to be able to solve different tasks in diverse fields .
And these eccletticism can be formed during one 's life in many ways : the most important is trying to have interest in different directions .

Risking to do something we think we can ' t do permitts us to discover our limits and in many cases to trapass them .
For these reason I agree with the statement .

Let 's consider a high-specialized person in a job : we aspect him to defeat the oppositors thanks to his knowledge in his field ; maybe he believes it too , so he does n't look for new challenges .
But nowadays it 's difficoult to find a situation we can solve using narrow skills ; we try to cohoperact to fin a solution .
This shows how we have to depend from other people if we do n't have the braveness to risk and to aquire a broad knowledge also in fields we do n't consider exactly as `` our '' .

Can we reach the success if our destiny is so strictly related to other people ?
Moreover we have to consider that this people is often in challenge with us for a better position .

If we look for new experiences which can enrich our luggage of knowledge , we break the bridge that unites us to our mates ; so we can find an easier way to the success .
Maybe it could be dangerous because a failure can stand for the gain of a lower position .

When we have the skills and we are brave enough to risk at the right moment we can manage to surpass lying people and to obtain success .
