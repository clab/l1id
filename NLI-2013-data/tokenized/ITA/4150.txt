At a first sight , it can be inferred that young people show no interest in helping their community and that they seem to have become more ego-directed , in order to prevent themselves from the duties that a society is asking them .
A likely explanations might be that to help the community is no more seen as convenient as it used to be , as it is not rewarded enough .
Young people do n't feel this as a duty , and think that the world would probably go on without no help from them .

Furthermore , young people seem to live for the present moment and not for the future , almost as they feel that the duties toward a society will not effect their own future , or the future of next generations .

But is most of the youngers seem to share these opinion , it is absolutely not true for all .
Some of them , who are likely grown up with strong ideals and a steady sense of tradition , still continue to putting their efforts to helping their community .
It might be that people living in small towns are easily influenced and touched by community problems .
Is not unusual for them to be prepared in helping because of the surroundings where they live in .

I would n't say that youngers living in the cities are not able to do that , on he contrary , thanks to devices provided by the city , they can easily help communities if they are interested in .

Compared to few decades ago , the modern society we are living in has , with no doubt , passed through a huge number of changings .
Given that , it 's hard to say which of them has really brought an improvement or a decrease in the quality of everyday life .

What is certainly true is that young people summerize the most important and common features of a society .
