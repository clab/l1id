In my opinion both scenarios are very important .

In fact , it is true that ideas and concepts are at the base of everything .
If you have the possibility to study and understand the theory , you can have a wide vision of the concept .

It is also true that experience help you to understand what theory ca n't give you , like facts .

In order to explain my theory , try to imagine these two scenarios :

1 )
Imagine a persons that study all the theories , but he does not never apply them in the real world .
I think that in this case you have not the possibility to `` touch '' with your hands what you studied .
In this sense the risk is to have a deep knowledge of concepts without having experienced them .

Thus , is theory complete without experience ?

2 )
Imagine a person that has never studied ( independently by the reason ) and has not a deep knowledge of ideas and concepts .
The person make experiences with the world where he lives , he understand facts and concept through his behavior , but his knowledge is based on his personal experience , through his angle of view .

Thus , is experience complete without theory ?

According to me , the best way to understand everything in the world is given by a mix of both theory and experience .
Only in case of cohesistence of them it is possible to have a deep knowledge everything .
In fact , theory allows you to study ideas and concepts in all the possible ways and have a high vision of the concept .
Afterwards , experience give you the possibility to taste , to touch with your hands what you previously studied , in order to increase your knowledge
