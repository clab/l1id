I do agree with the statement , in fact the most part of the advertisements we are used to see shows only perfect products , for instance : wornderful hairs when presenting a shampoo , absolutely slim dancers when promoting a diet pill ...
This are only a couple of examples , but everyone of us have been upset at least once looking at the mirror and seeing that after one month using the ecxeptional mussels-stimulator saw at ( and bought from ) the television , he still does n't look like Jean Claude Van Damme .

This means that the examples of how different are the real products from what is presented in the advertisements , can easily be collected from everyone 's everyday life .
Nevertheless , I do n't feel the need to criticize this feature of marketing itself : obviously it might illude people about the effectiveness of a product while it may not be as effective as that , but as long as no one is phisically forced to buy the product , I do consider this one as an absolutely conventional marketing strategy .

In fact , in 2006 , nobody still pretends to believe in the reality of what is presented by television ( movies , as well as reality shows , as well as advertisements ) , and with the progresses made by the graphical arts , which are now available to the most part of the population , we are totally aware of the manipulations that are used to images ( just as pictures of products , or videos ) to reach the best result .
This is probably the most important feature of this marketing strategy .
In the past years , in fact , it was not as easy as it is now to modify the image of a specific product to make it appear more desirable : it required lot of expensive and sophisticate tecniques , which were n't available to everybody .
Nowadays the progressive informatic revolution has also improved computer 's graphical skills , which allows companies to maximize the effectiveness of the advertisement presenting a maximum grade of perfection of the product .

I finally think this is a feature of our society : to be attracted by the ( at least apparent ) perfection , which might be false , but people like to dream , even if it is just for a while .
