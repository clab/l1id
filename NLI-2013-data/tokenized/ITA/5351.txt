Advertising in modern century is widely using in all media , such as Television , Radio , Newspaper , Internet .
In some cases is the only way to make money for the owner of media .

The most time in a tv show in dedicated to advertise product than should help you in choosing among products .
But not all product we see in tv or listent to the radio seems to be what they really are .

For example , to product something you had to research the problem you want to satisfy , the way you want to proceed , make it physically and then let the people know what are you selling .

But in some cases i think that advertising show to the public what they want , not what the product do effetively .
In most of cases there are better product than this but , because less budget of advertising , they could n't be advertised .
This kind of product generally cost less than the first one , because it do n't pay advertising .
For an example , mp3 players most advertised costly effectively more than the anonymous one at even quality .
The cost is a great part in a product 's choose .

I think people ar't stupid .
If the product is n't of enougth quality , people can see at the first time , and they can do bad advertising to friend and other people .
The better way to advertise-at first time-is the opinion that people have about it .
