Today car is considered a commodity : most people have one and even in a family of three or four people we can find more than two .
Since the day it was invented , the production of car has increased in an incredible way : from a small factory with few people working in to the incredible phenomenon that we call `` mass production '' .

Nowadays , also , when we talk about car production , we must talk about mass customization : everybody can choose the car that best fits his own taste .
At the time of Ford , if one would buy a Ford T he had to take a black one , because this was the only colour available .
Today , instead , you can indicate which optionals you want in your car , such as CD player , MP3 player , air conditioned , ABS and so on .

When we think about the future we must consider different problems about using cars .
First of all , a big problem is represented by pollution , wich has raised in level in a dramatic way .
A possible solution to this problem can be using hydrogen fuel instead of oil .
In this way we can continue driving cars without polluting with smog the atmosphere .

Another problem we must think about is traffic .
Probably world population will grow in number as it has happened in the past .
This means that more people will want to drive a car and so there will be more traffic .
A solution to traffic can be building new streets or highways but time will arrive when we have to stop because we do not have space enough or because this solution is too expensive .

Thus , I think that the statement `` In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' is quiet correct .
In fact , I believe that the problems I have already described will make people think about alternative solutions .
Instead of using cars , for example , I think we are going to travel by a more developed and more efficient subway net .
Also I think that trains and airplanes will become faster and grow in number .
In Japan , for example , a magnetic train has developed that can reach incredible speed .
