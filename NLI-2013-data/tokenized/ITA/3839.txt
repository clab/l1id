I do not think young people nowadays do n't dedicate enough time to helping their communities .
If by `` communities '' other concrete , fully fledged people like them , also presumably living in the same country , are meant , this is certainly not the case .
At least , to the extent that young people fulfill their duties properly .

A typical young person is , indeed , one who has a job and spends most of his time with it .
Well , I take this to be exactly the most effective way of helping other people in a community .
By carrying out his or her work properly , as well as with all the competence required , a young person really does serve the other people at his or her best .

Many young people do not have a job , to be sure , as they are still studying and spend most of their time at the university .
Even so , I think they are of great help to their own communities .
For their studies will eventually result in some skills and qualifications .
These will hopefully enable them to serve the society as soon as they accomplish their duties as students .

There are , of course , possible objections to such a line of thought .
One could argue , for example , that a typical way of helping a community is being engaged in politics and that this is what most young people actually refuse to do .
There might be some truth in this remark .
But I think we may not legitimately expect people to exhibit what they did not receive .
As long as politics is so confused and discouraging , it is not fair to expect from young people a sort of interest they could not get from their models in society .

Let 's take a different example .
Helping a comminity is often thought of as going to hospitals and vising ill people .
These are very good deeds , of course .
But , coming back to the point I made above , these are also things that can better be done by quilified guys who have been especially trained for this purpose .

Summing up , if we assume that young people are generally good guys and that they do what they are supposed to do , I do n't think they are selfish or do not spend time for the sake of those communities where they live .
