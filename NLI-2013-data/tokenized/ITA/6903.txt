In my opinion , in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today for the following three reasons .

First , even though there will be a lot of people that will need cars to move , for example to go to work , and the population of the world will increase , peolpe will have other possibilities to move and travel .
For example , a lot of places and locations will be connected by trains , planes more than today .
So that , even if people have the possibility , even nowadays , to travel with trains or planes , in the future , they will use better services .

Second , if nowadays there is the problem of the pollution because of the traffic , the smog , I can immagine what it will be in twenty years .
The sky will be so grey that the only solution , maybe , it will be to not use cars anymore or use less cars than today .
So , people will go bike or or will use cars with no dangerous engine .

Third , maybe in twenty years new models of cars or ways to travel and move will be invented .
The air is not so clean and the streets are too full of cars that we need a solution and what it is important is that we need somebody to project and create a new way to move .
The problem is that there are too many cars that fill the streets .
To avoid this risk it is important to finds other ways .

To sum up , the presence of infinitives numbers of cars in the world , pollution , and the invention of other way for travelling are good reasons why in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use .
