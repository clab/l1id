I do n't agree with this statement because I think that having a deep knowledge in one specific subject is much better .

I think this because , even if a broad knowledge of many academic subjects could be important , in my opinion the world of our days require particular skills to the person .
If a person had a knowledge of many subjects , he would n't be able to have a deep knowledge of every these subjects , and this could mean that he could n't be able to solve determined problems which require a deep knowledge of a pattern .
For example let us think about a manager who knows all the kinds of problems which could happen in an enterprise but who who has n't a graet preparation in order to solve them because during his academic career he did n't specialized in one particular subject .
In this case I think that even if this manager has a great preparation due to his enlarged studies , he would n't be able to give his contribute to the company .

I also think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects automatically implies the fact that it ca n't be the result of a deep preparation in all these kinds of subjects .
I think that this kind of knowledge could be important to a person own satisfaction but if we assume that every subject could have been studied in deepth , it would have implied a lot of time spent ( ten years or more ) and I think that it wouldn'be of great importance becuse in my opinion the world requires our skills as soonest as we can !
Beside I also think that the world does n't have the will to expect us completing our long studies in all the subjects , but it expects that we will able to provide it a quick solution its problems .
