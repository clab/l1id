Generally speaking , i think i may agree with this statement .
That being said i also think that this is not a rule .
In business , large successes are often due to the fact that the entrepreneurs take big risks trying to break through new markets .
once you 've conquered a new market you have virtually no concurrency , and that makes you succeed in your business .
The same may happen with new ideas that improve a product already existing .

In music , trying new ways , using diverse and differt instruments may open up new worlds and new possibilities .
it may help you find unheard tunes .
Back in history there are many examples on how , people that took risk then have succeed in their professions .
every discovery mankind has done , is due to someone who took the risk .
America is this way because someone ( namely Columbus ) had the courage to sail the seas .
the same can be said for technology or medicine innovations .

in general , taking risks , experimenting , brings mankind to a new level of knowledge that can better his life .
at the beginnig of this essay i wrote that i agree with the statement but that it 's not the rule .
i mean , with that , that everything depends on what one considers as `` being successful '' . obviously if you do n't take risk is going to be hard for you to succeed but at the same time is not said that taking risks is the only way to succeed .
you can be good at what you do and have success in your life or you can have just an avarage job but a nice family with wonderful kids and consider that the biggest success ever .
