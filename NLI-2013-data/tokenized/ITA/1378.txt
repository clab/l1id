In general , I agree with the statement because I think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more precious to people when it comes to their every daily life and surrounding acquaintances .

In other words , I believe that a knowledge on several subjects gives people the possibility to better understand many matters which are facing every day like hystorical and political situations , foreign cultures and countries , scientific aspects and and physical facts .

A broad knowledge can really help all of us in better understanding the world we live in and get used to that ; this is why , in my opinion , many primary and seconday schools tach basics of several academic subjects instead of reducing the range of taught matters and specializing students on some of them only .

However , I also believe that , when it comes to work and business , this opinion is not longer applicable because specialization becomes a must .
I think infact that a specialized worker has often to focus on few matters only and can not keep pursuing a broad knowledge on different subjects .
Being focused and specialized , workers can gain advantages in their jobs , become more competitive versus peers and colleagues , get more valuable to employers and deliver stronger and higher performances .

An example is given by my personal experience .
At the primary and seconday schools I have been studying several subjects from Art to Physics , from Hystory to Maths , etc. and so I received a very broad knowledge on many matters .
After achieving my `` diploma '' af the end of the secondary school , I specialized in Mechanical Engineering and then , after graduation , I started to work as Mechanical Engineer on some very focus matters , keep developing my skills over and over and , at the same time , specializing in some very narrow subjects .
After 5 years of working experience and at the age of 30 , I can say that I chose the right way because I am very conscious of my everyday life and very rewarded and appreciated at work .
