I partially share the idea of those are thinking that young people today do not give enought time to help their communities .
First of all I would highlight that we shoud split the world in several areas as well as in differents categories of families .
In my opinion in some areas of the world like China or Countries underdevelopped young people are helping their communities due to the fact that they are part of a large community with the same problems and with the same historical links .
In that case the community can be defined every think is around the people and does not need a further of explanation .
At the contrary in Countries more developped people are living in their little ireland .
It is very hard to dentify the community .

If community means family I am assisting to a reduction of the relationship between parents and children due to the fact that the youngs , in many cases are alone during the day and they have not any guide reference for their life .

If community means religion I would like to say that most of the young people have different interests than the religion today because they preefre to spend their spare time in a different way .

If the community is the sport team in that case
