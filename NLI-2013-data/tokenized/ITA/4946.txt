Advertisements play really an important role in nowadays life .
The world of industry is affected mostly by the need of selling more and more products , to find always new markets , and to designe new kind of products able to meet people 's different needs .

This is the role of advertisement : to make a product suitable for people who are looking at the advertisement ( on the TV or on cities ' walls ) .
Therefore , aiming at creating the customer 's interest in a certain product , advertisement needs to design the product as really interesting , really useful and precious for the life of whoever uses it .

In most cases advertisement describes the product in a better way than it is in reality , both in aspect ( as more beautiful , more colorful , more tasteful and so forth ) and in effective use ( for example as absolutely necessary for a particular activity ) .

Althought this behavior is quite commonly accepted , it should be noted that it is absolutely wrong and honestless .
Actually the advertisement , that is so important in the framework of industries ' activities , results in a behavior against the customers , who are bombarded by a great number of this advertisement and who are not aware of its effects .

Many associations protecting the rights of the customers have recently pointed out that the frequently presence of the advertisement on the TV ( during movies , programs and even during the news ) provocks a sort of unconscious compulsion of buying the product advertised in the people who are watching at it .

This causes many questions on whether it is deontologic to make such a use of advertisement when the effects of this are known or whether the presence of advertisement , specially on TV ( that is the most influencial mass media ) , needs to be regulated in order to eliminate or decrease the risks .

In Italy we have a kind of regulation that demands advertisement to be as honest as possible in recdalimng the products
