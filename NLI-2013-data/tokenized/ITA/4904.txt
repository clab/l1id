I agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
One of the best examples that comes to mind from my personal experience is a McDonalds burger .
Have you ever seen a McDonalds commercial on TV or in a magazine ?
The burgers look big , juicy and fresh .
Every time I see one of their ads on TV I want to run to the nearest McDonalds to buy a Big Mac !
The problem is that when I get there and actually buy one of their burgers I am always left very disappointed .
The burger looks in no way alike to the ones you see on TV .
It 's smaller and it surely does n't look as fresh .
The taste at the end is ok but the fact remains that their ads would never show what their real burgers look like .
Otherwise nobody would ever feel the urge to go out and buy one .

Advertisements are therefore misleading .
Not always but very frequently .
Having said this , if I were to make a commercial to try to sell one of my products , I would probably do exaclty the same thing .
If everyone is doing it , I do n't want to be the only one being honest because this would negatively effect the sales of my product .

The only way to solve the problem is to help the whole advertising community to be honest .
We should always remember that consumers are not stupid .
They can be naive at first , but not stupid .
You can fool a consumer once , but the consumer will never go back to you again if he is not satisfied with your product .
At the end of the day , it probably does n't pay to delibarately fool consumers .
They will find out sooner or later and they will punish you .
This being said , everyone is always going to try make their products seem a little more appealing to the public .
This will never cease .
But the consumer knows this and is aware of this .

In conclusion , I will always go back to McDonalds not because of the commercial I see on TV but because I like the taste of their Big Macs even though they look disgusting !
