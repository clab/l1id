This issue has been discussed widely within the already established literature , and , obviously , it is a very interdisciplinary topic .
We could discuss about the relationships between reality and ideas referring to very different conceptual fields , and , hence , using very different theoretical systems .
According to my sociological preparation , I would discuss the topic considering the social implications of understand facts and ideas , within the overarching context of education .

As a first point , we should define what is an idea and what is a fact .
Defining them could be important in order to continue with the discussion .
If we conseder an idea as a totally autonomous concept within the individual process of defining reality , I will state that ideas are useless , not being based on experience .
Coherently with the Kant 's thinking , the process of construction of the world can be defined as the filling process of some categories `` boxes '' .
These boxes are defined as the basic visions of the reality [ i.e. the causal relationships between phenomena ] , and in order to be productive for the undertsanding of the world they have to be filled by specific external experiences .
Therefore , it is my opinion that ideas cannot be considered as separate and independent concepts form the reality , but rather that they are influenced , and they influence at the same time , our perception of the world , and , consequently , the way we act within it and the way we create our identities .
In order to come back to the statement you provide me , I absolutely do n't think that it could be possible to think about ideas and expertise in a separate way , and so the core and hidden question behind that sentence is : how do ideas and experiences are related within the preparation of the students .
In practise , in order to have a well-working and a long - end didactic we should provide a real experience for each concept or ideas we want to teach .
The experience I 'm talking about is not supposed to be strictly based on a practical action [ as going outdoor and see the trees after a lesson on plants ] , but it could be simply providing some practical examples about the matter of study .

On the other side , experience is always influenced by ideas embedded in our society and , of course , in our indentity [ considered as an idea of undertsand ourself and the others in relaton to us ] .
Teaching clear and coherent ideas is a starting point in order to have a complete experience of the empirical world .
In conclusion , ideas and experience are totally interlinked each other and mutually influenced , in a dialectic way .
