Fist of all I think will be useful an historic approach , let 's see how community influenced young people 's life in past times .
We can consider the first half of 20th century , we can image that the society had a solid structure that ruled the way young people should behave .
Since they were children , because of the more spreaded poverty ( especially after the war ) and because the limited open-minded of the higer classes ( that were often very influenced by old traditions ) , they were automatically scheduled in fixed school programs or they were obliged to work at early age because of the lack of money , as a result the spare time was considerably reduced .
These conditions were usual and widespread in common people and changed in some way youngs ' opinion through society .
Nowadays i think society has reached an higer level of opportunities for young people , mainly because of the growth of whealtness and the reduced power of traditions .
They most part of them can now attempt school and has also a most variety of choce .
I think it 's not true that nowadays young people do n't spent enough time to helping the society , well maybe not as much as in the past but i think that the quality of the time they spent is much higher , they are investing in themselves in order to be able to help the soviety in the future
