I think that this is a mainly key point in the new economic society ; but it 's very hard to conclude a general idea about to how to have a success .

In this case the question is very limited , and reguarded only the complete or uncomplete peoples knowleadge background for the own of success .
In my opinion is impossible that the people can arrive to success only with hits knowleadge , but in necessary a mix of the various elemaents that make it possible this ; is more possible that one people that has n't particular knowleadge , eccept the economics skills , find the success than one very knowleadge people without any skills in the economic world .
But is also true that the knowleadge consist in a principal help for the aim of the success .

For the first a successful people must be tend to the risks , because without the risk ca n't have what do you want ; the risks is proportionated to the result that can be have if the new things that finish in a good result .

Obvious this is n't mean that for have the success is sufficent take some risks , because this can have dramatically consequence complete contrary to the success , in ther word this is mean lose all thigs .

For the good final result the risks must be using with knowleadge about how and when the risks is possible to use .
Infact is necessary know when one risks can be have or no in relatioship to the thik that it is related .
In conclusion i ca n't exaplain a correct answer for the question , but only my opinion that is not determinated but is a mixing about some things ; this because the thing is very soggettive and must be analized in each cases .
