I do disagree with the idea according to which young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their own communities .
I would rather think that nowadays young people do a lot of efforts to try to help and solve social problems in order to improve and join their own communities .

Though young people are usually considered as lazy and selfish and without any particular interest towards social or cultural problems , i do not think that they actually are .
Let is consider , for instance , the case of young volounteers .
They are widespread as you can find them everywhere , in every country .
It does not matter which specific field they are interested in , it is just important that they are engaged in something they believe in .

Any little help given by young people helps the society to improve itself .
In addition , any single minute they spend for the communities is meanfull .
In my particular experience I was used to be a social volounteers for nearly ten years , first in a community of down children , and then as a phone listener in an association called ( Telefono Amico ) : it is clearly a lot of time .

Thus , in my opinion and in my experience , I think that it is not that true that young people do not give enough time to helping their own communities .
They actually can do , and they do , that .
