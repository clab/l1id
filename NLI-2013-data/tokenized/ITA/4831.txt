Today we all live in a world full of advertisements .
It is enough to walk in a street of a big city to see how many advetisements are hanged on the walls .

I agree with people who say that most advertisements make products appear much better than they raelly are for some reasons .
First it happen very often to buy a product only because you have read its advertisement and notice that the product 's qualities shown in the advertisements do not really match with the qualities that the product actually has .
I think that it is an experience common to everyone .

In addiction its is well known to everyone that the true aim of an adevertisement is to persuade the custumer to buy the probuct .
The batter way to pursue this aim is to convice the custumer that if he or she will buy the product he or she will certainly enjoy the extraordinary features that the product has .
The point of the question is that it does not metter if the product actually has these features or not .

As a consequence of this tendency we can see that a bussines is grown around the ability of producing convincing and persuadign advetisement .
In fact today there are a lot a companies that employ a consistent number of workes and pay these worker to develop advertisements .
According to these companies a good adverisement is able to convice a custumer to buy a specific product even if the product itsefl doen not worth to be bought .

I think that it is a strong suppurting topic for people like me beliving that advertisement makes products seem better then they actually are .
In conclusion I belive that this way of behave concernig products advertisements is not a honest behaviour but , on the other hand , I really convinced that this beahviour is the normal result of our society , a society based more on the apparences then on the truth .
