I believe that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning only facts .
In my opinion , there are several reasons why ideas are more important than facts .
For instance , while I was attending history course , which is often believed to be made only of facts , I realized that some events are common in different periods .
Therefore , when I was able to understand the ideas and concepts , I was also able to catalog similar events in big caterogories and this way of learnig helped me in getting a good mark in the exam .

Moreover , while I was attending the university I realized that the way of learning ideas and concepts is really imporant .
For example , a course can explain with some examples how to deal with certain issues .
However , it may occur that a different issues occurs so , I believe that only whether you understood the ideas you might solve this new issue .

An example , that confirmed that ideas and concepts are more important than facts , is what happened last year during the electronic laboratory course .
I and my friends were working on `` led '' , light emitting diode , and we were measuring the emssion of the light .
We were using a particular instrument to get the measures when it stopped to working .
We were worried because we knew that was the only instrument to do that kind of measure .
What is more we studied only how to use that kind of instrument and other types .
Our professor told us that also it was impossible to repair it .
We thought we lost all the experiment , but it was not true .
While we were reading the the manual we understood that that istrument was only the combination of two well known instrument : a '' wave generator '' and '' amperometer '' .
We got the ideas .
We were able to build our instrument and continue the experiment .
We were really happy of what we had done and we understood that the we were able to finish our experiment ony because of ablity to abstract ideas and concept that we had understood in the past .
