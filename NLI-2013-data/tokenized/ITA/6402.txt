i agree with the statement i think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than today because the scientists will discover or project new kind of tranportation way and all the countries will improve the public transportation to defend the environment against the increasing level of pollution .
have you ever seen a cartoon called `` futurama '' ? it shows the potential kind of life of the fourties century .
it shows a big half pipe that looks like a big slide with some pillows at the end and it should represent an alternative kind of tranportation that avoids the gravity force .
moreover , today a lot of scientists and experts are woorking to create more ecological and confortable bus and subways , and a lot of countries and cities are working to get people most familiar with public transport or with new kind of transporters .
so , if the public tranporters will be the future , there will be fewers cars in use and also if some lovers of them will remain , the average number of cars will decrease in a remarkable way .
if it will happen , there will be a lot of improvement in natural conditions of the hearts and our life could become better .
the decrease of car s number imply better conditions , less pollution in the air and less dangerous streets , and the parking places could become green areas .
i reckon that a lot of people would be happy if the number of cars decreased .
in fact a lot of people hate the traffic jam and the crowded streets but they have not another possibility to travel or to go to work .

as i said , a lot of countries are working and a lot of steps have been done but in my opinion there are still certain aspects that should be improved .
in our countries , for example , also if the political class promote the use of railways , a lot of people do not follow this suggestion because the train are always dirty , crowded and they smell not very good , moreover they era always late .
so , i think that to have a look at the future is a good idea but there are also a lot of things that can be done during the present .
