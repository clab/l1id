This statement raises a questions which can be applied to many aspects of life : sports , at , and in this case , academics .

On the one hand , specialize in one specific subject can give more psychological stability to someone , who can identify himself with his main activity .
The approach can also let someone to become a world class expert on its subject , with the opportnity to access to the most innovative and advanced projects in its area .

The drawback of this approach is that huge frustrations can be generated if the aimed goals are not achieved .
Moreover , a too specialized pofile could have severe difficulties to adapt to environment and technological changes , limiting in a important way its career opportunities .

On the other hand , having a broader knowledge on many subjects , even if it could be perceived as being an `` average guy '' approach , can open the door to several advantages , most of which are necessary skills for a succesfull manager .

First , a generalist approach allows to have a global and comprehensive vision of a complex problem , and gives the necessary skills to interact with people with other , and maybe more specialized , backgrounds .

Second , a richer academic knowledge give the opportunity to identify correlations between different aspects of a project , and therefore to provide original and effective solutions at a global level .

Third , a broader set of academics skills permit to adapt in a easier way to the changes of the sourrounding environment , and opens a wider range of career opportunities .

To summarize , I totally agree with the presented statement .
In a complex and global context like the one we 're experiencing in those years , a broad and complete academics background is definitely required to adapt to all the changes and the situations one has to face .
This open-minded approach is without doubts the most valuable quality to succeed .
