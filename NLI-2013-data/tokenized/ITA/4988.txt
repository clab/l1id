I deeply agree with the staments reported .
Marketing is a fundamental activity for firms , I would say , a very profitable business in which every year millions , if not billions of dollars are invested and the fact that advertisements in general are exploited to show products and product 's features different from the real way they are really , does not surprise me , even it would maybe surprise many other goods consumers .

We are used to see almost everyday very colorful and energic advertisemets through so many business channels , like televisions , newspapers or radios for instance , and we often believe that everything that we buy really makes the difference or is totally useful in our life .

Of course I 'm not saying that people should all undertake a pessimistic behaviour and think that everything in terms or products is bad , but they should probably increase their critical point of view , especially when having to purchase a certain good , point of view which could be received with a good education .

Managers just exploit this lack of criticism , as I would describe it , and , as anticipated before , invest great amounts of money in showing their products off in the society as beautiful and colorful as possible , through marketing .

Consumers are then invited to buy , so attracted by the media , they go to a store and buy everything they were just so eager to have , and , after a couple of days they have bought something , their interest for what they have bought begins to fall , until it gets replaced by a new product which firms 's manager have meanwhile developed .

This takes place of course for all of the most typical types of products , for the most expensive ones as for the other cheaper goods of mass consumption .
According to me , this behaviour will not stop , being us as humans so easily affectable and in our pretty predictable nature .
