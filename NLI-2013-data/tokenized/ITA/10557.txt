I 'm a person who like to experience new things , I change lots of sports , I play lots of instruments .
so I think is nice to try new things .
above all when you do something very well maybe you can annoy doing this more , so it appears ecxiting to do something new and why not a risk .
it 's also important to know very well how to do a precise thing , above all if it 's your work , what I have say until now is referred to hobbies and not to work .
I believe that if you have a secure work it 's better continue to do that even if it bacame boring in the time .
I think is good and beautiful to try new expierences and to take sometimes any risks because it make our life more interesting and more exiting , it 's boring to do only the same things all the days for all our life , it is n't good , we have to try new sensation and we have to feel new emotions to permit ouselfs to grown up .
personally , I think that our life is only one , you can live only once , so you have to live all the things the nature gives you in respect of the life someone gives you .
you can failed , you cannot like what you are trying , but the important is that you have tried it , you can say `` I did it '' . if you died happy , without thinking to a thing you would like to do and you did n't creat the oppurtuniy to really do this , you may spent the most beautiful life that you can hope for yourself .
to do something new in my advice is really great , it always gives you an emotions that you ca n't receive from other occasions .
you can always do the same things and do them very well or try new sensations and stay well with yourself , personally , I choose the second one opportunity .
