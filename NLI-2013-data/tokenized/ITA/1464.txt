I think that a general knowledge of many academic subject is the best way to understand which will be my future work .
I believe in this because of my last and still coming on the surface doubts about `` what I will be in the future '' .
Infact if you would be listening to my telephone calls or discussions with my mother in the last times , for estance , you would discover me speaking rightly about this .

I think in this period of the life , almost everybody has already decided what to do so this is why people decide to attend specialized courses , and to take part to lessons on specific subject .

If your interest is so specific and you are sure about what are your passions and loves , you should n't waste your time and pick up specialized subject studies .
But not for all the people , things are clear ...

This is my case , I have n't nearly a clue of I surely will be , or in which envoironment I would like to work in , maybe turism business ?
maybe in the army ?
is working in a bank the right choice ? ...

...
I really do n't think so !
An this is why I really trust in what I stated .
An other problem is that the decision , applying the question on which the essay is based , on college choosing period of our life , an other factor come inside : time goes on .

Having the possibility to have more lifes I would surely try both approaches , attending specializing courses and lessons on a subject or few of them , then trying to find my way through , also having a broad knowledge of many acadamic subjects .

My answer , so my solution to the question , could not be so clear after what I 'm going to state right now , but , reading what I have just wrote above this final lines , you will be able to understand my vision :
If we have already decided what we are going to do in the future we must `` carpediem '' ( so take time by the hair ) , and pick a specializing academic path .
But if we are not sure or we think our ideas will change , taking part to the study of many academic knowledge is the better decision .

Referring to the question `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' the first will be a more flexible choice then the second one .
