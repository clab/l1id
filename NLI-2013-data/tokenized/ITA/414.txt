I do believe that it is very important to have a wide culture in many and apparentely differents subjects .
Subject that as a fist approach can seams radically different are in the end just a different develop of the same initial path .
An example comes from the classic Greek where phylosophers were the fist astronomists and mathematicians .
I think that only having a broad knowledge of different subjects is possible to go deeper in a specific ones with later studies .
The risk to be too much specialized from the begin is to not be able to approach an eventual problem in a different way .
An example is when I was a student at the university and I was attending the mathematical classes , at that time I was really surpriced how students cominig from classical studies , after some first difficultes , became the best of the class .

They were able to use the broad knowledge of different subject and use them in a specific fild .
I am worry when I see schools becaming too specific in the early stages of students path .
I think that industries and economic world is too in hurry to have a technician , a kind of robot able to use some specific skill well and fast .
I am sure that the real progres is in the hads of people that are able to solve problems in a wide rage , because it is important that for each small change in one direction something , maybe far , will change as well .

I had a specific education and many times I suffer my lack of istruction and I use most of my free time to read classical poems .
