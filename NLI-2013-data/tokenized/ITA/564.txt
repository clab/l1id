Some old men usually say that with the daily universities guys know `` everything about nothing '' .
I think that this claim comes from this particular idea : courses at universities do not prepare people about a field of study but they want to direct students on a specific direction .
In my opinion this is not true : courses often give a general knowledge ; I suppose that the first sentence could be true some years ago , but not today .
However I agree with the statement in the above question .

From my personal experience I can say that a broad knowledge , of any subject , is more useful than a specific one .
A wide range of opinions , ideas or theories can allow a student to comprehend better a field of study .
If you own most opinions about a topic , also you can build your personal idea and maybe you can also find a more peculiar interest afterwards .
In this way , for a student it is easier to find his own goal .
In addition I think that a guy , coming out the high-school , can not decide what he would like to do five o six years later .
So the university gives him a possibility to make an idea .
I met people who decided to change faculty after few months because , thank to this wide range of subject , they understand that the particular faculty they have choosen did not fit with their interests .

Nevertheless , after the University , this broad knowledge could be a `` skill '' that factories or laboratories do not require , I am sure that they want people with experience , but here we are again , exeprience is something that you can achieve not suddenly in University , It is something that you can build working .
A job can give to a student the necessary ability about a field that , of course , it is more specific than subjects that he has studied before .

All in all , in my opinion it is right that universities provide a broad knowledge to their students and moreover I think that the specific skill must be acquired afterwards , maybe during a job experience .
