I disagree with the statement .
Travel around the world is an experience that give you the opportunity to open your mind and develop new points of view .
Travel is not always connected with as much information you can add to your knowledge , travel is more than that !
It 's connected with emotions .
A new trip is like a new person in your life .

You can imagine how could be this relationship if it 's led by someone else , a guide !
You cannot plan in advance exactly what you are going to receive from something that you do n't know yet .
Of course you have to make a plan of your trip especially according with your time and budget available , but it 's always important have the opportunity to change if you find something that you do n't enjoy .

A guide may be usefull for old people , because they have no more the energy to organize all the trip .
And travel with other people can be an opportunity to feel more security .

The sense of freedom for me is important .
It 's a waste of time waiting for other decision .
I want Travel alone is also cheeper , because you can choose your own
