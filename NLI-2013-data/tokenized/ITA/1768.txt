I think that it 's not possible to state which is , between a broader knoledge and a more specialized knowledge , the most useful and the most correct at all .
However , as a student in Business Administration I tend to believe that a wider prospective on the knowlegde issue may definitely help .
First of all let ' s consider the working environment : nowadays people tend to change more and more often their job , following the labour markets that demand flexibility and adaptation skills .
A broader prospective allows people to be faster in such an important change as a new job is , preventing them to suffer from frustration and from the sense of inadequacy towards their new employment .

This argument is by the way supported by the researches of a famous Italian professor , Gianmario Verona , senior lecturer at Bocconi School of Managment , as he claimed that innovative companies tend to employ people who show `` T '' skills : the vertical part of the `` T '' represents the knowlegde of a specific subject , but the horizontal part reminds to the need for broad skills , that the employee is supposed to spend to understand the company strategy as a whole .

Moreover , even in more simple contexts a wide knowledge is useful ; for example let 's consider interpersonal relationships , of any kind .
A broader knowledge positively affects the ability to join actively any discussion and results in a more interactive attitude of the person .
