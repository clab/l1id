I absolutely agree with the statement that , successful people try new thinghs and take risks .
I think that the most important characteristic of a successful person is the WANT TO BETTER ONESELF , and this is made by the want to learn new things .
The best way to learn new things is working whit other people .
Of these two kinds of working , either working alone or working whit other people , I prefer working in groups for the reason that i 've just mentioned above .
Working whit other people gives us competition , and I think it 's very important to increase our knowledge .
On the other hand , when I work alone , I can decide when start and finish my work .
I have more freedom than when I work in groups , but ther is much work to do .
I also think that , the word SUCCESS means Risk !
In fact , if you do the same things all day , nothing will be change !
In conclusion , the best way to try new things is to increase one 's knowledge , so , working whit other people even if you do n't like them .
