In the last years , car has became an useful means of transportation , for example in order to travel or to go at work .
Moreover , car has improved life 's people .
I and my family have only one car but this means come used several times .
For example , I use car in order to go outdoor with my friends or in order to go at supermarket for shopping .

In regard of statement that affirm that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today , I partially agree .
I think that car , even today , is one of the most means of transportation used and I think that this means will be even in the future , even if much people prefer use alternative means , like for example train or airplane in order to speed the travel .
But , in the future , can happen that , if the price of petroleum increase very much , people will not use car in order to not spend much money .

In conclusion , there are two different points of view in regard to the use of car .
There are people that affirm that in the future there will be not more cars respect to today ; instead , there are other people that think that cars will continue to be used even in the future .
As I saw earlier , I agree with the last point of view , but I think also that use of car will depend by what will be happen in the future in regard to economic elements , in particular the price of petrolium .
