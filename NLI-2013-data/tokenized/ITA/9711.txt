People react to everyday life in different ways .
There are some human beings who prefer to follow the ` known way ' in each of the activities they perform .
There are some others who always prefer to experience new things and new , probably risky , ways of reacting to problems or stimula from the outside .
I firmly believe that these are the people who often demonstrate to be the most succesful in their lives .

Taking risks and exploiting new solutions are universally recognised as the characteristics of succesful leaders .
Business world is full of examples of people who took risks and had great success .
CEOs of the most succesful companies in most of the cases are succesful themselves because they decided not to follow their sheer experience , but to take risks .
Mr Jobs from Apple Co , for example , put most of the resources of R & D department of his company to exploit a new area of business , the MP3 one , when its company was facing a serious crisis .
His decisions were the right ones .
History has proved how the perceptions he had about the potentialities of that NEW product were right .

However , the business field is not the only one where people proved to be succesful by trying new things .
When talking about Italian politics in the early eighteenth century it always appears that the most commonly cited name is the one of Marco Rossi .
This famous politician was considered a fool when he proposed , first in the country , to pass an act to consider to give also to women the right to vote .
He took the political risks of his proposal , which was totally new for that period .
After that he had worldwide approval and success , just beacuse he took the risk of a new action .

Anyway not only famous people can be taken as examples .
In everyday life there is plenty of normal people that are considered succesful by the ones who know them because they decided to experiment .
For example in a small village the first person who moves away to another area or even country is often considered as a hero for his village fellows .
As before , he took the risk and tried new things ( i .
d : moving ) .

This makes the idea of experiencing new routes and things stronger into my mind .
Being succesful is hard but it is proved that taking reasonable risks and following unexperienced territories helps .
This happens not just in famous human beings ' lives , but also to normal people .
