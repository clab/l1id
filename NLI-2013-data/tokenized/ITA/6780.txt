It is my belief that in twenty years there will not be fewer cars than there are today .
I feel this way because cars are too useful for us , in fact they support a lot of exigencies , and I do not think that they will be easily sostituted .

One reason I believe this is because , nowadays , public transport cannot realize the needs of people .
Moreover the tickets for using public transports are still expensive , and this fact does not permit to use them all times .
For example , last week-end I was in Forli , a small town near Bolonia .
My train arrived at 8 p.m. but I had to wait an hour for the bus that could bring me in the town 's centre .
And the bus ticket I paid was 13 euro !
That is a lot of money for a student like me .

Another reason I think that cars will not decrease in the next twenty years , is because cars are often considered a precious thing .
In fact they not only give the possibility to move in short time but sometimes they are also precious goods .
For example , I cannot avoid to use my car to go to the train station , because I would not have the possibility to go there in time .
In fact the train station is at 40 minutes on foot from my house , and I would never be in time for the train .
In fact I cannot get up at 6 o'clock in the morning for catch the train !
Instead , one example about the fact that sometimes cars are considered precious things could be this one .
Two years ago my father bought a blue Porsche Carrera , and for him this was the fullfillment of a dream .
He really loves it !
Every sunday he drives it , and shows it to the relatives that have not seen it yet .
For all these reasons I don ' think that people who own this kind of cars will replace them easily , because they are considered like jewels .

Finally , as this essay has demonstrated , cars are still too much important for us for being replaced , in fact even if oil 's price is higher and higher today , we cannot think to sobstitute them with other means , probably because other means are not able to realize our needs .
