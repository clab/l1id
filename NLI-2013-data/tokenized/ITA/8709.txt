I think it is a difficult question because it can have two simliar meanigns .

First if it is better for a student to know the theory rather than the practise aspect ; but it can mean also , if it is better for a student to understand a concept rather than the fact which the concept come from .

In this second meaning , for example , if it better for a student to learn principal political ideas of the French Revolution or to learn facts that brought to the revolution ; or to know causes and effects of the Second World War or to know personal Hitler history .

I think that there is not a more important thing between understanding ideas and learning facts .
In fact , education cannot be only theoryc .
So I do not agree with the statement .

For example , in chemestry , student cannot learn only formulas .
He-she has to do experiments , otherwise science cannot go on , because theories have to be proved .

Maybe only who studies philosophy can learn only ideas of ancient Greek or Roman philosophers , for instance .
That means that who works only with concepts can have an abstract way of learning .

Even though also in this field there is a sort of evolution .
For example , some branches of philosophy , of Humanities , like Antropology has to study human behaviour so it has to know facts .

In the field I study , that is law , facts are really important .
Eve though there are many rules , we cannot use only them to give a legal advise .
We need to refer to facts that really happened .
