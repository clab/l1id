According to me nowadays this is a world where nothing is really like it seems .
The most infected branch of our life is whose of the business , but this is a problem which cover more than one sides of our life .
Going back to the world of business in my opinion it is the most false of all the others and I say that because one of the main problem is that some products seem much better than they really are .
I think that it is due to those sort of rivality between the all companies with the goal of taking in as much costumers as possible .
Ofcourse the main goal of that companies is selling their products better , but it is also true that that they do that taking never care about the people healthy .
It was also happened to me that I bought something trusting in what was written on the the products label , or in what the seller used to tell me .
The surprised was that it didn t match with both of them .
I think that the advertisements used for that are also used to get the people confused .
One of the main confusing ways used for that purpouse is tv and especially the pubblicity because on the tv we usually watch products which appear much better thah they really are .
For that reasons it should happen that some pepole prefer making what they need at home in order not to be unsoddisfacted .
