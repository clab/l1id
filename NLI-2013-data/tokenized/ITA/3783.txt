As far as I am concerned , young people have not all the same behaviour with their community .
Obviously , different people have different interests and thoughts .
As a consequence , this question is extremely difficult .
However , I quite agree whit this statement .

In fact , I think that almost all young children who live in my neighbourhood do not take care our community .
Last year , for istance , I have helped the priest of my church to look after some elderly people who had some deseases .
I have to do this activity with other people of my community , but only one person was a friend of mine , I mean a person who has my age .

Another example was the little party that my community organise every summer at the end of the school .
This is an occasion for us , who live very close , to meet each other , and have fun together .
In this day a lot of children and young people participate to the event .
However , they usually do nothing to organise this party .
Only your parents either cook delicious cakes and other foods or organised games , such as volleyball or football .

According to me , there are a lot of reasons young children have in order not to help their community .
First of all , they attend school in the morning , and in the afternoom they should do their homework .
Othertime , the practice sports all the afternoon or meet same friends of their in order to relieve stress and have fun , and so on .

For example , last year I started to attend university quite far from my house , consequently I have spent less time in my community and I can understand the problem young people have to face .

Taking everything into account , it is true that nowadays only few young people do something to improve their communities .
However , I think that help our communities is both a right and a duty for everyone .
In particular young children can either improve many skills by doing this , or learn important knowledge for their future life , that are not writter in books .
