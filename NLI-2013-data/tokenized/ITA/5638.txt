I believe that the most of the advertisements make products seem much better than they really are , and this can be inferred from different reasons .
The first of these is that we are living in a very competitive world and this get the people to make bigger some detail more than what they are , to involve the clients to buy the product .
A tipically example can be found in a lot of good for children , where really little features are presented `` in scale '' , for example the ability for the toy to rise it size or the ability to make strange movements .

Another reason could be a legal process .
The productor are covering himself by legitimating something of the good .
In first this could be a bed advertisements , but could also explain the particular nature of the object , really fragile , a quality that could be research from the client .

There is also an `` internal '' reason if we want to say so .
The manager want to present is creation to the stakeholders and need to have their approvation to start the production .
In this case the interest of the productors is directed to the owner of the company , not to the client , but is important too , of course .

The last reason is similar to the first , in this case we can find person who are presenting only the positive points of the products without talking about the negative .
The mission of this manner is the same but here the people are n't creating anything , they are omissing a part of the complete reality , differently in the first case where the people could also present the negative points because there are a huge amount of positive points which cover them .
A tipically example of this manner can be found in the most of the new invention where it 's needed a positive consideration to be lunch , like the Titanic in which was n't presented the lack of ships to escape , looking only to the big fashion-style of it .
