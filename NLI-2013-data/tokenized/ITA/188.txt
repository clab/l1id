There are a lot of theories on the number of cars that are in use now and that would be in use in the next future .
Experts have different ideas on this question , and their theories are based principally on the cost of cars ( including the fuel , the insurance , etc . )
and of governments ' policies .

In my opinion , if things do not change quickly , in the next twenty years in Italy there would be fewer cars in use than today .
My first argument is that cars ' cost is increased year by year in the last times .
Even if cars ' prices are not increased , the cost of the fuel and of insuraces is now at an incredibly high level .
For example , the last government 's law , in order to solve the financial problem of our country , contains a special tax on SUVs .
Today , a tipical italian family can difficulty afford the cost of a car .

In addition , the local policies of the cities are other reasons for not buy a car .
Now in all the big cities there are traffic limitation , and , in order to try to reduce pollution , in some days cars are not allowed to move in the cities .
Furthermore , old cars cannot circulate at any time during the day .
Also , in the cities is very difficult to find a parking and , when one finds it , it costs a lot of money .
Therefore people prefers to go to the cities with scooters , that take less space , or with public transports , which are cheaper .

However , the Italian government is not giving a real alternative to the car for people that need to move for work or for other reasons .
The public transports do not cover all people 's necessities .
For instance , there are no buses during the night so , if one wants to go out at nightime , he or she has to use a private mean .

In conclusion , because most families cannot afford a car , and because cars are not useful if one cannot use them ( like it happens with cities ' limitations ) , I think that the number of cars will decrease in the next twenty years .
However , government policy is not helping to resolve the situation in favour of public transports .
