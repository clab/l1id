Genarelaising there are two different academic education approachs : one belives that is better to have a brite general knowlege in differens felds , the other thinks it is better to specialize in a specific domain .
Though both positions have good arguments I belive that it is better to specialize on one fiel .

First we have to admit that if a student is accepted to a university he or her has be tought for around 12 years .
Thus the school schould have jet given a general culture , and had to present a panorama of the differents subjects .
This is why the student how enter in the university normally has already choosen his field of interess , and applies for a specific preparation in a scientitic sector .

Secondary we schould not forget the obiective of Univesity an of a student self is to create a proffessionist who is able to manage with his subject and eventually to reserch on it .
Who could be possible to work and reserch on different not related topics in differents subjects ?
Rarely have the human being the faculty to manage on an higt level competence and knowledges of many academical sectors .

We normally citate Leonardo da Vinci as a exeptional genial inventor ...
but of course ..
he is an exeption .

To conclude we schould integrate the specialization in a well based background of genar knowledge .
But at the univerisity In my opinion is better to achive the skills and to denvelope the knowlegdes in one specific subject , than cultivate many subjects which knowledge are not deep enought .
