Since their first appearance on the market , cars had gone through an outstanding increase concerning their rate of production .
It is starting from this idea that I do not agree with the statement .
In fact , looking back at history an evident growth of cars production can be seen , together with a rapid development of competition between the cars industries that are also forced to follow people 's needs .

First of all , since their first production during the 1920's ( with Tom Ford ) , cars have gradually gained an even bigger role in society .
Their introduction into people 's lives started to completely revolutionize their everyday lives and their standards .
People obtained the possibility of moving throughout their country and to become more independent .
Since then , cars have become part of our lives , even influencing our deicisions and our plans .
It is for this reason that today 's cars production has more than doubled its sells and it is still continuing to do so .

Secondly , I do not agree with the statemetn because competition among industries producing cars is pushing their production to augment instead of decreasing it .
In today ' s society it is fundamental to invest and make money , therefore competition between industries is reaching really high levels .
It is due to this increasing competition and rivalry that cars production is not going to stop and not even to slow down .

Finally , cars producers are also following people 's need in society and , since our requests and needs are increasing and changing as time goes by , the production of cars is following our demands .
People from all over the world need such a fundamental mean of transportation in order to travel , work and fullfill their own goals .
When industries decide to sell a product , they first refer themselves to society 's and people 's needs and since cars are even more present and necessary to us , their production is continuing to proceed in a positive way .

These three points are the reason why I do not agree with the statement .
Not only I base myself on historical evidence , but I also analyse the influence people 's needs have and the companies ' interest in producing something which is worth selling .
