It is most important have the knowledge relative at the world in wich it works .

Having a broad knowledge of many academic subjects it can be to have an complite and clear point of view about this subjects .
With the broad knowledge it can have most global culture than specific knowledge .
In the academic or university universe in better to have specialize knowledge in one specific subject .
In fact in this universe is most important the reserch .
This activity in based on the specific subject and the broad knowledge can be less specific .

According with my personal opinion is better to have specialize knowledge in one specific subject , that is the subject with it works , to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects .

Many people think that it is not true .
In fact something is necessary to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects such as in the test to be admissed in a office ore other post of work .
I am a student so i prefer have specialize knowledge im my specific enginearing world .
In fact most Teacher of my University tell that during the study we should prefer the specific knowledge and often , in the working world , we can broad our knowledge .
