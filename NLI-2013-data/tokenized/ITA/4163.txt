When a young men grows helping other people , he will do the same thing during the adulthood .
It is an important thing that consent to value how a person is good or bad .

In modern society is truly difficult to find a young with a non-selfish attitude .
But the problem does not depends from the young , but depends by the way his parents have educaded him .

This is a big problem that in the future will carry us in a much more egoistic society .
If a father does n't play often with his child , if he gives only money to his boy , He does n't teach anything to his boy , and the boy will grow up without a guide .
The boy will grow only with the importance of material thing , not human values .

Instead if parents take care about her child 's education , and show him how to live with simple things , with real human values , and showing how they help their communities , probably the child will do the same thing in the future .

So we have to give a better education to our child , with more simple and human value , not material .
Only proceding in this way we will have a better society .
