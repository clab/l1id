In the world there is a great market of exange in which people have to do many choices buying a product .
So it is difficult for a single company to get a considerable part of this market to take advantage from it .
So I think that a common method used by a company to reach a wider part of the market is that to use advertisiments .

An example supporting this statement is that a company presents a product in a way thanks to which you see it better .
You know only the good qualities and not what is wrong with the product .

This is the purpose of advertisiments , to enchant yourself in a lot of different ways such as using famous actors like people who use that product .
On the other hand , a company should use an expert to present its product saying him to enphasize the new concept of the product .

I know from experience that advertisiments make products seem much better than they really are .
For example , one time I ordered a product by internet because I was very fascinated by the way in which it was described .
But when I had had that product at home I was very unhappy because the product did not function as it was described .
This was a very bad surprise for me .

Another common method used by advertisiments is that of fulling the page of a newspaper or the screen of the television with a lot of colours .
In this way , people ' s attention is focuzed not on the product but on other things .
It is a very successiful practice .

Summing up , I think that advertisimets change the real characteristics of a product in order to convince many other people to buy that object or that solution .
For me , this is a very bad way to sell and to trade a product .
Using these methods , companies make only tricks on people and before or after they will be discovered .
On the other hand , the best advertisiment for a product is its good qualities .
