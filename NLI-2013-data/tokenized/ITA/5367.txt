we are in the XXI century and now I must write about the most advertisements that make products seem much better than they rally are .
I agree whit this idea because often many products that the people watch on tv or see around them , do not appear what they really are .
In fact I thinck that the television introduces different ideas in the head of people .
For example some people buy only shoes or the dress or gadgets that are sign by important Many people do not know what is the true , because some products are good and have hight qualty .
We can value these products for the material they are build , for their aspect , for their end .

The apparence is most important but I thinck that is not the most important element of vatulation , but for many people it is the only element of confronte some objects .

This idea is rediculeus because the apparence is not all in the life of the people .
For example , I am an architect , when I make a proget for a house I thinck that this house must be confortable , beautiful , faschion , and help the people in the life .
It must be the hause of live not only a beautiful house .
By the way many people do not understand that a house or another kinds of products are good when each elements that compose the product must be in the sit good .
