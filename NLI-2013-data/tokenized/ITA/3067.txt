I do not completely agree with this statement , because young people usually do not realize what they have and how short and quickly the youth is .
Young people are continually expecting something of extarordinary happens to make them happier , but without knowing nor themselves what this extraordinary means .
Have you ever red The Colombre by Dino Buzzati ?
It is a nice metaphor of young people searchign a chemere during his youth , which never is found , so that they can not taste the flavour of happyness during his flowerishing age .

Moreover , young people spend often their time doing nothing .
I see these guys standing outiside bars , smoking , drinking , of course smiling , but without a serious purpose and so risking of getting bored .
In other words , they waste their time .
On the contrary older people , who have less life time ahead them , do not waste time , they appreciate all what they have .
They do not wait for something special happens , they do not get angry for the boyfriend or girlfriend .
Older people appreciate the time passed and most of time are satisfied of what they have done during their life .
They feel joy for the fact of having had children , who at their turn have had other children .
Older people , despite the young , have had in the most of cases a brillant job , or just a job , which has let them create a family , buy a house , go on holidays .
They are fullfilled of their reached objects .
As far as young people concerns , this is not always true .
Although young people have more life time ahead , it does not mean fewer worries .
Let us think of young people now : the problem of job , the problem of durable job , the worry of buying a their own house without a job ! ...
Concludind , enjoying life does not concern on what we are doing , but it relies on our expectations and what we managed to do before .
