In the modern world we are able to sell goods which are producted in Europe all round the world .
To let our potential customers know about our goods or services we need to ad them .
Thanks to the modern mass media : TV , Internet and the press , we can ad our products everywhere .

Ads could be pictures or tv clips or internet banners where we can explain which are the uses of our product , what customers can do by it and how their life will be improved using that product .

So we use the ads to pesuade people to buy our products for its characteristics or peculiarities .
Someone said that `` the advertisement is the soul of the commerce '' , no sentence has been so true like that .
Often , for this reason , who makes ads tries to give to the product more than it has really got .
In this sense I agree with this statement because very often this people tries to persuade us with false adjectives , false implicit meaning trying to force us to buy that product .

Producers of ads often can persuade people to buy their product , but I think that , if the product is n't like the ad on TV , people will be very disappointed with it and they will talk to other people explaining what happened .
In this situation the company which ads will lose his possibility to sell anymore his products .

Anyway I think that we need an international authority which checks all the ads trying to delete lies and what can illegally persuade people to buy that product .
We need a code of advertisement and who makes ads must respect those laws and he should be clear with the potential customers .

I know is difficult to create an international authority , especially in those countries where also the market is without specific laws that can regulate it .
But I think that if all the developed countries join the efforts , some improvements could be done .
