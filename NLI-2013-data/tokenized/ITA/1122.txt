In my opinion , is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects instead of a specialization in one of them .
I say this because I think that is the best solution in order to find a work in today 's society , where companies are continously on change and require a huge flexibility and adaptability for the new works .

According to this , school must provide to give a basical instruction , teaching many different subjects .
In this way , each student will have a quite complete background in the fileld he choose .

I think that also specialization is important for work , of course , because it implies that a person is really good on doing something specific .
But I also think that an high level of specialization could be reached only with years and years of study and work , and school ca n't give this opportunity to everybody .

An example : I study design , but lots of kind of designs .
Interior design , virtual design , graphic design and much more .
But what I really like to do is Web design .
So , school gives me first the opportunity to learn about different tipes of design and , second , to understand which is the best for me .
After the school I can specialize myself in Web design by work , because I have a basical preparation that school gave me , and , in the same time , the other students in my class could choose another specialization , according to their preferences .

This model of teaching subjects gives lots of advantages , because it is n't neither rigid nor boring .
It gives anyone the possibility to choose , without create limits .
Academic subjects are only the start up of the student 's working life , that he can and must develope in his career .
But at the same time they are very important , because allow the student the opportunity to understand what he really like to do in his future .
