This statement has been greatly discussed in many didactic environments for the simple reason that some consider the theoretical knowledge to be more important than the practical one and some consider the opposite .

I was lucky to have personally attended schools that agreed and disagreed with the statement since I attended an italian high school ( that relies mostly on ideas and concepts ) and a canadian high school ( that focuses more on real facts that occured ) .

This is why foreigners find that italians know how to talk about a certain topic but they do not know how to actually solve ( or i should say ) `` fix '' it .
My uncle , an engineer who lives in Canada , once attended a conference here in Italy and he noticed how Italians honestly might know more about the theory ( in this case physics or maths ) but need help from the more `` hands-on '' engineers from abroad who considered real cases during their education giving them a higher experience .

In my opinion learning about facts is definately more enjoyable and gains a higher interests within the students .
It also gives you a better insight of today 's world situation .
The reason why we study History is because we ought to learn about events that occured in the past and to prevent the same mistakes or find a better solution .

Once I came back from my school year abroad it was n't easy for me to get used to the old and stricter method .
I tried to make my teacher understand and realize how a fact that occured implicitely has the concept in it .

Experience also plays a key role and to discuss about real facts certainly helps a lot .
As once Oscar Wilde said `` Experience is the name we give to our mistakes '' .

This is why I believe that it is definately important to learn and understand ideas and concepts but the next fundamental step would be to consider a real fact that concerns it .

Italy has a very ancient background on its shoulders and it would be very hard to change its attitude or point of view .
