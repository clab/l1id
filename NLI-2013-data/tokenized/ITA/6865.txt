First and foremost let me try to put on the focus of the terms : in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
I do believe that will be true .
Actually , in the future , in the Earth , the level of pollution will be very great , the air will be bad and this for the car 's pollution .

Even today in the big cities there is the problem of pollution because on the streets there are a big number of cars from the morning to the evening .
The people use the cars to go to the work place , because is too far .
A small number of workers , now , can go to work by tram or bus because the lines are too short and so they ca n't arrive with the public object at the final place .
Also , only few workers can go by bycicle because the street is too long .
This only for the workers .

The students , instead , can take the train , but this is always in late .
So a boy or a girl goes by car .
Now I do an example that make my idea concrete : when I go to university , I 'm always in late because the train is in late ( everyday ) !!!

If in the future , the government will decide to increase the train 's lines , the tram 's lines and the metro 's lines , so that these will can arrive in time , more people will take these objects and not the cars .

I hope that in the future the air will be less dirty than today ; I hope this also for my future children and for all kids .
To conclude , I do believe that in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are now , or perhaps I hope this one .
