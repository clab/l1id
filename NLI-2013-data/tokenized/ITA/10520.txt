I think that being a succesful person includes the fact of being one of those peo new things and , therefore , takes the risks related .
If a person is openminded and has as much experience as possible , this person will have a lot more opportunities .

The experience offers the possibility of having new original ideas : for example in business , you will have the opportunity of starting a new market if your idea is original ; and that is what happened , for example , to the chewing gum market : the person that startes this business did not sell chewing gum at the beginning .
This product was given as a present to the people that bought soap ; this idea was original , but it worked !
So the business changed from a `` soap business '' to the chewing gum one .

Trying new things also means , in my opinion , being a competitive person .
A person that is competitive with himself , with his life , always wants new challenges .
Being a person that can afford to face a challenge with himself , he will not be scared when he has to handle with someone else , and with the related risks .
He knows his own skills and how to use them ; and he is also aware about his weaknesses already .
This self confidence rises the opportunity to be the winner of the challenge .

Last , but not least at all , people that try new things not only have to deal with risks , but sometimes with failures .
This is the other way of learning while making experience .
People know what is `` wrong '' to do in situations , and how not to fail again .

For all these reasons , I definitely think that successful people are those who try new things , learning from them how to reach success , how to implement it , and what to avoid so not to fail .
They must be a little brave and learn from their own experience .
