How can i help my communities ?
it 's a question that young people does n't have in their mind .
I 'm agree with the statement because fewer and fewer teenagers give enough time to helping their communities .
I think that it 's not correct this behaviour of young people because every citizen , especially young people , has a moral duty towards his community to do his best help .

I live in a little town near Milan and i know a lot of teenagers that are interested only in what can produce benefits to them but they do nothing for own community .

For example , my father is a voluntar and he often brings me to a voluntary circle but i notice that the number of young people in this place is so small and there is a lot of elderly people that might have the help of a person who can be stay with them listening their story .
I believe that it 's very important that a old person can have someone to speak and to give him some precious advice that surely he/she can transmit to young generation .

I also think that young people might give their contibute to a lot of activities proposed by community .
In fact in all the communities there is a great request of some works that can increase the knowledge of the young people .
This work can also be a good reference in the personal curriculm vitae , they are occasions that teenagers should n't lost in their cultural experience .
