I don-t totally agree with the statement .
My opinion is definitely different from that .
If we go to take a look at the past years we can only see a costant increase in the use of cars and I think it will constantly keep on growing up .

There are a lot of reasons supporting my opinion .
The first is the constant research for alternative energy also to be used in the cars .
In fact a wider and wider area of the planet is under the threaten of pollution caused mostly by gas emissions in the air .

Even if this bad aspect exixts from a lot of years nobody has still found a solution and the result is an always much more polluted world .
Another reason why we-ll never stop to use cars is because we are totally dipendent on them .
We can-t live without them .
For example if I have to go out for an holiday , not abroad , but in my country , I would take my car and not other transport means like train .
Why ?
Because I should stay at its hour schedule and it-s not so seldom that it comes on late .

In my personal opinion a modest advice I can give is to improve the Transportation System in the country .
As a student that has to take the train and the bus more than 5 times a week I noticed a big mess in every means .
They are not only often on late but there are also strikes that cause a lot of problems to peole who have to go to work and should arrive on time .

If we don-t try to solve these problems before , we-ll never stop to use our cars .
I think we should take a look at some other countries where these aspects function better than here .
For example I went to Helsinki two years ago and I never waited more than two minutes for a bus , a taxi or for a train .
Every means was on time and in fact there were much fewer cars in streets !
Here in Italy it-s quite impossible go around our city and don-t get trapped in the traffic !
It-s terrible and sometimes a lot of people don-t have enough patience to wait and they start to scream or do very dangerours things .

But every year nothing is done to improve the situation .
How long still do we wait ???
