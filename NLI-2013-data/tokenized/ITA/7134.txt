We live in a rapidly evolving world , so we can hardly predict the changes that will occur in the future .
The tecnologycal progress , in particular , modifies any aspect of daily life ( instruction , communication , transport , etc . ) .
At the same time , progress involves serious and unpredictable problems , such as pollution .

Some people belive that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
According to them , the rapid development of alternative kinds of transport will risult in a progressive decreasement of the use of car .
Faster , cheaper and more advanced machines will replace cars .
On the one hand , sophisticated airplanes and high-speed trains will provide a good alternative to car for a long journey .
On the other hand , efficient public transport should replace cars in the cities .

In my opinion , these prediction are quite excessive .
First of all , the entity of economic interests involved in the car market is too relevant to desappear in a few years .
In addition , even in relatively developed countries , such as Italy or Portugal , the public transport system is still obsolete and not efficient , and it could hardly replace cars .

However , although cars will remain an essential part of our daily life , it will be necessary to modify radically their production tecnology , in order to face the problem of pollution .
The more cars will be used , the more they will be echological .
