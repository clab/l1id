The landscape of our cityes has completely changed in the last 100 years .
During the last century our grandparents were used to move through the city with horses or just by walk .
But after the introduction of the car , and also the blast of economy in our country , our parents were the first to buy a car for their family , instead of a charriot .
The industrial and economical revolution is keeping to let us think that we need more technology in our daily activityes , but i 'm not so sure .
I really think that we actually cannot controll the rise of our factoryes and also the pollution that they produce .
At the same level i do n't think that we can stop the industrial revolution and the idea that `` we are reaching the perfect society '' as they would like to teach us .
This is why i really think that is quite unreal that in the next twenty years there will be fewer cars in our streets .
I concour with those who think that the numbers of cars are going to increase in number without control , especially those cars that are particularly made for specific purposes , such as the city cars .
I live in Rome , where we are actually almost 4 millions of people , and i think to be right when i say that every family owns a car , sometimes more than one .
In the last 5 years in Rome we have been witnesses in the introduction of a new type of car called `` Smart '' .
This car looks like a toy .
It ' s small , compact , coloured , and the most important fact is that it 's easy to parck , due to its small dimensions .
The fact is that in Rome we actually have almost 400.000 of these small cars in the streets .
Once i have read an article on a German newspaper that showed this phenomenon .
The fact is that all the big factoryes that produced this small cars , that by the way is designed by Mercedes , are closing worldwide .
Smart factoryes are out of business in China , Germany , France , but not in Italy .
In fact in Italy , of course mostly in the big cityes , the problem of the number of cars is huge .
Besides our governments have been so clever that in the last 10 years they have always thought that a good way to solve this problem was to economically help people in buy a new car , instead of improve the bus service or the subway lines .
Besides i really think that our economy is based on oil .
All the principal wars worldwide are based on the oil possetion : Iraq , Afganistan , Iran .
I know that almost 20 years ago someone discovered the possibility to let our engines work with water , or alternative propellers , but still our cars work with gas .
Thus as long as our economy is based on oil , the number of cars will not decreased in our cityes , but they will also increased in our small towns and countrys .
