I believe that is better to have a strong knowledge about a specific subject , rather than a superficial and wide one of lots of academics themes .
I 'm going to explain my reasons using a personal example : my academic choice .
In Italy there are two types of Universities :
- One type is for the students that have a clear idea of what they want to do in their lives .
If you study Medicine , that means that you want to become a doctor ; if you study Law , it means that you want to become a lawyer ; - The other is for the people who does n't know exactly , or at all , what to do .
For example , Science of Communication gives you broad knowledge about many subjects : literature , psychology , business , art etc ... , but does n't prepare you for anything in particular .

I chose to study Public Relations , which is very similar to Science of Communication , because I did n't know exacly what I wanted to become .
Well , at the end of my carreer , after my graduation I asked myself : '' And now ? ''
I realized that having lots of knowledge about nothing is absolutely useless .
I had many interviewed , but I did n't exacly know what I wanted from that job .
The truth is that I did n't know anything specific .

This is why I decided to force me to understand what I really wanted to do , and , once I realized that I wanted to work in Events , I applied for a Master , that would 've gave me all the knowledge and the competence I needed to face the real world .

I think that all the high schools should help more the students to understand which is the best job for them , not to make the mistake that lots of people do : attending a University random , that gives general knowledge , but nothing concrete .
