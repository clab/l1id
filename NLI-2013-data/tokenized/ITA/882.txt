I believe that someone should be prepared on many aspects and subjects .
But not everyone could have the possibility to follow this result and be very skilled on many subjects .

Sincerely I like to be prepared on many arguments , I daily read many newspaper and many books about economy , history , science , philosophy , but also thrillers and novels .
I have seen many films and visited many places and knew many cultures .
Overall for this reason and for my deep preparation on many subject I can recognize that it 's quit impossible to be skilled on each subject .

I believe that the specialization on a specific subject is the key to be successful on your own field .
Improving everyday the subject of your specialization is absolutely the way to reach many positive results and the way to be the best in your field .
For example I have took my degree in Business Administration three years ago and after one year I decided to take a master degree in Finance to be more specialized .
And after some months I obtained a Certification as financial analyst , so I think to be more specialized .
I believe that is the way to be very very skilled .
Studing , learning and improving is the right way to specialize ourselves .

For me all that you can learn more than your specialization is called personal culture .
All that I read and learn from the life of everyday is culture that can help me in many situations , during my job or also during my free time .
Knowing the different culture of the world and our history is a way to look at the future with a different view , to be global and opened to receipt other cultures can help me also in my specialization , because in this way you can change your way of thinking .

So , to conclude and to answer the question , if you think to your life as a result or a mix of your deep knowledge and specialization and of a broad knowledge of many subject , you can live very well .
It 's important to be always in the middle , the excess in everything is never considered well .
