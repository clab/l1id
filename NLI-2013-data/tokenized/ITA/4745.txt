It is a common belief that advertisments make product seem much better than they really are , and for this reason they help making them look more desiderable .
In my opinion this belief is true , and this is why a lot of investments are made on advertising .

The first fact that makes products more desiderable is the way they are presented .
If the description underlines the positive aspects of the products , and if it hides negative aspects of them , it is likely to happen that people would appreciate them .
For example a beer may be advertised describing its flavour and its colour in a very positive way .
Besides to make it desiderable it should be presented not mentioning problems of alchoolism and driving accidents .

The second think that help advertisment to make its products better is the association of them with positive aspects of life .
For example , when you advertise a kind of beer you can present it as the one drunk by very important people , or you can take a photo of a beautifull naked woman with your beer in her hands .
The positivity of the persons linked with the product is automaticaly transfered to the product itself by the receiver of the message .

Another aspect related to this subject is the absence of the product .
When you are looking at an advertising image or a TV program it is probable that you have not that product nearby .
When you see it , presented in a positive light , associated with a positive event , you want it .
The absence increases desire .
The desire of the product makes it better simply because it is not present .
For example if you see a beer on the television in a hot day , presented as a very fresh drink , by a beautifull young woman , you desire it .
The desire makes the beer much better than it really is .
