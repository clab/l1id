The conclusion that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts , sounds correct to me .
There are two arguments that are interesting to consider in evaluating the conclusion above .

First , if we assume that colleges and universities are currently using the best strategies and tools to teach students , it is clear that concepts and ideas are fundamental and more important then facts to build the basic knowledge of students .
In fact , at engineering universities all the courses in the first couple of years are about algebra , geometry and phisics .
All of those courses are about ideas and concepts ; no one of them refers to facts or applications .
By learning ideas and concepts , students can develop abilities of reasoning and thinking that in the future they will need to solve real problems and to understand facts .

Second , it is much more worthwhile studying generalitazion rather then specific applications .
In fact , in our real world it is unbelievable to know everything about facts and memorize them .
Instead , ideas and general concepts can be applied everywhere and help to understand every fact .
Moreover , our world is running so fast that scientists and researchers discovery every day new thesis and models .
If a student knows how to deal with abstract ideas and concept , he or she can easily understand every thing is new and has came up in our world .
Facts ate constrained by context and circumstances and are very useful to fix and remember ideas and concepts .

In conclusion , students must understand firstly ideas and concepts .
It is helpful for reasoning and thinking abilities as well as for understanding facts .
