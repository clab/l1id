Nowadays cars are useful , because they help people to move from one place to another .
There are also other means of transport , such as train , bus , plane , bycicle , etc .
I thinks that there are pros and contros for such a decision , as to use car instead of others means .
Cars are used mostly when you travel within your contry .
For longer distance , train or plane are preferred .
Bycicle , instead , is used for shorter shifts .
It helps somebody to keep fit and it 's good for their health .
Moreover , cars are dangerous for the environment , destroying the atmosphere .
Some people , in fact , prefer using busses , in order to avoid smog and noise .
Even if bus is more uncomfortable than car , it is wider and wider used .
Plenty of people prefer car because they can stay there on by themselves , in order to get not in touch with sombody else .
Some others , prefer public means because they are willing to speak with other people .
Advertising meke you buy carsar as cars are concerned , I think that the only opportunity to diminuish them is to invent a new moder technology , in order to replace cars .

It 's up to the government to invent something to save the environment and , above all , the life of his citizenship .
In fact more and more people have a disease , owing to the pollution and it 's difficult to heal .
Therefore , I guess that if the people know the problem , they will do something to avoid it .
The society we belong to change his habit in order to improve the world they live in .
To sum it up , I sustain that in twenty years there will be fewer cars .
