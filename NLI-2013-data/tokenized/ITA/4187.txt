Some people believe that they must not help other people if the actions do not provide any benefit to themselves .
Others , like me , believe that few hours every week must be used to help the communities .
I would support my view with a couple of reasons .

First of all , living in Italy , I know that most of the young people in my country works or studies not more than eight hours a day .
Other people , like Chinese , work for at least 12 hours a day and they have not time to do other activities after they have finished studying or working .
Conversely , italians could spend a lot of hours doing social activities that could help the community .
For example , someone studying in the university located in the centre of Rome goes back home at 5 p.m ...
Probably , he could remain in the city and dedicate his time to disabled people helping them to come back home easily , for example helping them to get into the buses or to take the subway .
Unfortunately , italian guys prefer to watch soccer matches on television or go to the restaurant with friends .

Second , in my opinion governments should think a law regarding young people activities in social communities .
My view is that few people would do helpful social activities without a strong committment from our state .
In the case of Italy , there is not a law regulating actions that young people can , or must , do in order to help the community .
Probably a good law should oblige young people that are not still working to spend on this activities at least 2 hours a week .
In this manner , the state would help both the community and the young people , taking them far from television or playstation .

In conclusion , I strongly agree with the statement .
In my opinion , every person that has some free time during the day should spend few hours in social activities in order to give benefits to his community .
