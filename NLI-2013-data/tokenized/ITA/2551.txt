I 'm disagree with the statement because all of people can enjoy their life , young people and old people .
Often young people are not near old people because they have a different outlook of life .

Young and old people can enjoy themselves but in a different ways .
If i can do an example , i want to mention a different kind of things that can enjoy old people and young people .
Young people are actracted often by sports , cinema , crowd , noise thinks , they want always smile .
Young people looking for a new hard experiences , they are dinamics and they want to do always something new .

Old people in the past like the same things , but now after twenty years they are tired and now they like the relax things , like fishing , sleeping , reading , playing cards and they enjoy themselves also more than younger people .
This can be an idea of the difference between the two different kind of people .

In a particular case the rules of the people can be the opposite .
Some young people can have the same bahaviour as old people and old people can have the same behaviour of young people .

If you are seventy years old end you are not unfit , you can do the samethings of a teenager , are n't you ?
I saw an old person playing football very well for two hours and after going to swim .
It is possible , in a few case but it is possible .
Instead recently I met a young person that prefers a sedentary life , i do n't know why but he stands for a lot of hours sitting on his harchair and he reads two books or more in one day .
It is possible ?

This are a particular situation in wich people have a strange behaviour but normally if you are a young boy you must do the young boy and if you are an old `` boy '' you must do the hold boy .
