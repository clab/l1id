A question has been raised about whether or not the young people nowadays devote their time to helping their communities .
In respons to this question , I think that there are two kind of young people nowadays : one kind is more polite , other kind is less polite .

Usually , the young peole are more polite because they have their parents more quite and more lovely .
Maybe when this young people have a problem they can ask a help from your parents without having fear to them .
So , for this kind of young people is normal to be helped and when they see other person that suffering they would help him or her .

Instead , the young people are less polite because their parents are more angry or maybe their parents pass few time with them .
So , usually when they have some problems they resolve it alone without asking a help and if they see a man who have a problem they think that he or she can resolve alone .

So , I think that it 's important that the parents pass the most of their time with their children .
My parents work every day , and they come back in my home very later .
I never asked them to help me because they are n't .
So I have difficult to ask or to give a help and I prefer stay alone rather than stay with my community .
