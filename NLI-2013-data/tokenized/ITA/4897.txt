I am agree with the statement `` Most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are '' .
Actually most advertisements can help people that have any kind of problem to see this in another way .
This can help people not also for the really means of this advertisements but also , and over it , for the reaction that they create in the mind of the people that heard their .

For this reason the advertisements make products seem better than they really are , because every person that heards advertisements thinks on this one and interpreter this one in the way that he prefer .
