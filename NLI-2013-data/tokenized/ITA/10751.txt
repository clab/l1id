Risking or hesitating ?

In my opinion taking risks is something that makes your life worth living .
Off course taking risks is not something that all the people are able to do , because you may have to put up with the eventual negative effects of having done a certain choice .

So if you have a strong personality , if you are audacius , you can go throgh the `` experience of risk '' and most of the time you will have positive feedbacks .
In my personal experience something happened that makes me strongly support this idea .
My father has been working for all his life for some technology company , but one time he had to handle with the terrible `` mobbing practices '' which are conceived to put a person under a psycological pressure .
He decided to leave the company before being fired , and so he took a great risk putting our family in a condition of economic uncertainty .
Then he took another great risk deciding to start running is own bussiness .
Right now he is really happy and satisfyed because everything is going in the right direction .

I 'm not telling that everytime you take a risk there will be something more positive waiting for you , but if you 'll never try to do that you might regret the fact of not having been enough brave .

Furthermore if you keep on doing something that is really familiar to you , something of which you have a perfect knowledge about the possible consequences , you won ' never experience excitement and your existence will be flat and annoying .
So taking the risk is something that everybody should do , in order to gain self-confidence .
Because most of the times this is a way to understand as far as you can push your limits letting you know that possibilities are infinite .
