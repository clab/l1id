I disagree with this statement because ( but I hope it will be true ) there are a huge number of interests linked with the car industry and it will be improbably that in only twenty years something will be change .
First of all , I do n't think that in a small time the tecnology devolp new kinds on movement systems and , more important that they will be secure for the humans ( like what happen in Germany with a new kind of train that was based on the magnetic forces , a disaster , many people dead ) , we must be sure ! .

Second , in my opinion , the owners of oil production had invest a lots of money in industry that produce car , so if these industries change their standard of production , probably , a lots of them would close and a lots of people will be unemployement .

Also if the oil will end , I am sure that all these rich people will find something else to mantain their control on the transport organization .
However the mainly reason , that make impossible the statement is the absence of high investiment in sector like scientific-transport research .
Altought the governement continue to says that something is going to change , I do n't trust with this sentences , for me is only a way to make people sure .
Maybe in twenty years will be more cars than now , and probably , but I hope that something will change for real , the ambiental situation will be more dangerous than now .
In conclusion the huge interests , the absence of serious investiments and the less attention that people do on this problem , makes not possible what the statement says .
I think that a solution for what I have exposed is : the governement of the most rich country ( where cars are in large number ) would invest in industries that want realize cars without the use of oil and more important , there will be industries that take an hard decision : produce in a different way .
