There 's a variety of reasons to support the idea that a specific competence in a particuar field is much better than a wide , unclear knowledge .
I want to underline the terms wide and unclear , because most of the time they match ; I want to clarify this aspect with an example ; because of my technical studies in mechanical engineering I ' ve always had contacts with pragmatic subjects such as the projection of a machine or the capability to recognize the causes in an accident ; with the preparation you aquire in a litterature university you will have for sure a wide knoledge about the facts that play a role in our society or the ability explain an autor opinion , but the lack of a specif preparation could negatevely affect the job opportunities .
Indeed without a great preparation on a specific topic , nobody will find on you a valuable reason to take you as a part of the factory .

Another plus point , is the amount of money you could earn ; I ' ve been impressed by the salary that a member of the chourus in wich I sing earn , and asking him the key of success he answered : `` nothing comes without the sacrifice and the constant will the deep your knowledge '' .
Speaking my mind , I can assure that if you acquire a position in the enviroment in wich you work , nobody will ask you to leave the desk , and that ' s because you are an essential and vital part in the production .
I can prove this with a personal experience my father had with his factory ; with the growing competivity , especially from the China an India the factory the selling were seriously affected and as a result of that some of the employers were fired , nonetheless the more able to regain a leading position in the market were preserved and after the firsts results they gain an award .

In conclusion , we can say , how important is to have a good education , especially in the nowadays life , with the hopeness that all the efforts we have made could give a great result .
