I am not completely sure about the agreement with the statement .
The ideas and the conceps are at the base of facts .
The fact begin when a man decide to put in pratic an idea or a concept , making it real .
So if you want to know something you have to ask why has he doing this , what are the causes that are been on the bottom of the decision that make real something .

On the other hand facts are necessary to know the condsequences of the action of someone who decided to follows his ideas .
Having to make a choice I think that the keyword is the verb understand .
If someone really understand a concept , he is more aknowledged , he is more capaeble to make his choices .
the other who know only the fact can say : the things went in that way , the things are there , but in reality he does n't know how and why .
I can take some example .
In history I know that in that precise moment appened a precise thing .
If I only know the fact i ca n't understand the real reason at the base .
At in the end I can learn very little and have a very minimal personal improvement .

But if I know the causes , what makes people to behave in that way , I can understand a lot ond maybe learn from their errors .
another example that it cuold be made is not quite directly rapported but is very similar .
Studying for example physics or other kind of similar matters if you know only the results you are not capaeble to understand the real meaning of the thing you are analysing .

But if you can understand what the result is made with , what are the principles that are in game , you can organize them and put them togheter being capaeble to know what could happen next .
