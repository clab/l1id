The trend of our society is to become older and older due to the fact that the number of birth is strongly decreasing years by years .
In this kind of society , according to recent statistics , old people try to continue to behave as they did when they were young some years ago , while young people tend to wait more rather than to be active .

Notwithstanding the results of this statistics , I strongly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
They have the opportunity to get in connections with more people as well to have strong motivation to do new things .

First , young people have the chance to have good physical mobility .
This allows them to profit of sport activities that can give many satisfactions .
As an example , they can profit of scuba - diving and see the beauties of the sea or they can have a wide view from the sky when they perform some parachute activities .
In addition , thanks to their mobility , they can reach different and new places and enrich their culture of precious , brilliant and peculiar images of world 's gems .

Second , young people have more satisfactions from doing things as they have probably experienced some situations only few times in their life .
As in all new activities , they have an adrenalinic peak in their body that makes them feeling happy .
That creates a virtous schema : the statisfaction implies also a strong motivation to do new things and viceversa .
Therefore we know , from a recent survey done in Italy , that more than the 50 % of young people under 35 years are eager to do at least one new activities or a travel in a not visited country per year .

In conclusion , young people enjoy life more than older peole do because they are eager to do new experiences and have the physical mobility to do that .
Becoming older , they become more experienced but lost the motivation and the commitment to exploit life .
