I agree with those who believe that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their communities , for the following reasons : in my town there a lot of helping centres , many young guys take part to activities for disadvantage people and I am an example of young boy who help someone else .

First of all , in my country there are fifty ( more or less ) associations that are pawned in social aspects , like drugs or children sick , that look for young people to learn the meaning of helping other and want to insert them in these communities .
for example the ABIO association , which deals with children with great diseases , has got a specif group of teenagers from 16 to 19 years old that three days a weeks goes to the hospital and they take care children or they organize something of amusement for them .

Furthermore in many schools of my town , guys , who help others , meet the students in a conference to tell them their experience and how helping communities his enjoyable for their soul .
I took part in one of this conference and I remembered an episod .
One of these guys showed us some photographs of children who lived in africa .
They were very ill , most of them died at the early age of 5-6 years .
during this demonstration a big silent fell in the room and everyone made a reflection about what he or she has just saw .
I was 17 years old , and from that moment I understood that in the world there are a lot of disadvantage children that should live a moment of happiness in their life .
So I made a decision and now I am one of the numerosous young people that two or three time a weeks dedicate their free time to make a smile in which children who are suffering for a terrible disease .

to sum up , I think that every guys should look in your heart and should prove to help the others .
If it is necessary I will enjoy to teach it them when I will be qualified as the boy that I met .
