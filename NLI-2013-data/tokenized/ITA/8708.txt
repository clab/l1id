I do not agree at all with the fact that is more important for students to understand concepts rather then learning facts .
Therefore my opinion is that both those goals are needed to be accomplished from a student during his or her studying period , this could be hight school or university .
Preciselly it is even more important at university because , in this period of his life , the student is suposes to learn a job .

For instance I studied Political Science in Italy , at La Sapienza University , witch is considered one of the best universyties in my country .
While i was learning all the subjects of my courses I realized that they where perfect and complete in the teoretical areas but they lacked in the practical areas .
For example in the Law course whe studied all the articles of our Civil Code , and the professor was very strict during the exam .
On the other hand nobody of the students had the chance to looked to an example of contract .
Obviously this is a really important part of the course , in fact a friend of mine who studied with me , had enourmous difficulties on working after graduating .
She went working in a very famous law farm , and she had to work four months not beeing payed because she did n't know how to write a contract .

Althought i had another fantastic experience that confirm my opinion .
A couple of years ago I went studying at The International Center of Photography in New York City .
Eventhought I was a little afraid of studying with a different system i found it much easier and much more challengin at the same time , even if it seem a contradiction it is not !

In this school I learned a lot about the theory of photography , like tecniques and history of photography .
Yet I practiced even more .
I shoot with lots of different kind of cameras , the view camera , a digital camera and the olga .
For all these reasons I think learning facts and how to practice them in the real life is very important for all students .
