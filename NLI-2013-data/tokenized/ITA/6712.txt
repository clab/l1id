In our modern society cars are used a lot and most of the people ca n't manage to live without them .
I , however , agree with the statement and believe that cars will be less used in twenty years than they are today .

On one hand it could be inferred that the number of cars will increase , because we have a very big car market nowadays .
More beautiful and technological cars are offered every day and the people are drawn to buy them .
Furthermore , also young people are encouraged to buy them because this way they can feel independent and free .

On the other hand , however , cars are beeing replaced more and more often by other means of transportation such as bycicles and motobycicles .
In my native country , Italy , cities are becoming very crowded and it is inconvinient to use a car , because of the traffic and the difficulty of finding a parking place .
Therefore people try to avoid picking up the car in the morning and prefer to use other means .
There are a lot of transport services offered for people nowadays , even for those who live or work far away .
Metros , busus and trains are often used also because it costs less than buying a car .

Even though , the market tempts us to buy cars advertising and promoting them in the most various ways , I believe that there will be fewer cars in twenty years than nowadays .
In fact , I noticed that the means of transportation and communication are getting better day by day , encouraging people not to use the car .
It would be only a waste of time and money .
Additionally , people are becoming more sensitive in what concerns our environment : driving a car pollutes the air and ruins the place we are living in .
