In this article I will discuss the advantages and the drawbacks of having broad knowledge of many academic subjects with respect to specializing in one specific subject .
I think that both of them are required today for a successeful career .
The rest of this work is organized as follows .
Firstly , I will analyse the main issues about studying many subjects .
Then I will focus on the problems related to specialization .

If you decide to study many subjects , you will be prepared for a wide range of jobs .
However there are also some drawbacks .
First of all it is hard to follow too many academic courses on completely different topics .
Moreover some jobs required an high level of specialization and in this case it is better to have little and good knowledge that many and poor skills .

Instead if you are specialized in one specific subject , you could find a well paid job because few people have a background focused on one particular field .
On the other hand , if your highly specialized skills are not needed by the market , it will be very challenging to find a new job and you will have to start studying again .
This time , however , you will probably choose something more general .
This prospective could be awful if it happens when you are too old and have a family .

In conclusion I think the best solution is something between the two choices .
One should have broad knowledge of a general field but also should be specialized in a particular subject of this field .
