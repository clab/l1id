I agree with the statement for several reasons and I will try to explain them through my personal experience .
I 'm really convinced that it is more important for students to understand ideas and concept than it is for them to learn facts .
While attending my University I had the chance to study many different matters and all of them equipped me with a multitudo of skills .
Most of the researches I carried out for my university studies were related to the International Law which I am very passionate about .
I took every single exam that could give me the chance to deepen my knowledge about international topics .
Thus , my studies included elements of International Law , Comparative Law , European Law ...

Upon obtaining my degree in law , it has been my goal to work in an internationa organisation and today I believe that those skills I learned at University will play sooner or later an important role in my working future .
To tell the truth , my hard study from university has already played an important role and this is the reason why I am positive that acquiring and understanding ides and concepts before learning facts is important for students .

If I had not studied the basics of International Law at university , I would have not been able to pass the selections for an internship at the Europea Parliament .
In fact , the students who wanted to apply for an internship whithin the European Parliament had to demonstrate to know how this international organization works in theory .
Only the students who were able to pass the test would attend the internship .

Since I studied hard before applying for that position and I knew well the structure of the most important European institutions , I managed to pass the selections .
I went to Bruxelles where I spent the most exciting time in my life thanks to my study done earlier at university .
After the internship I also acquired pratical knowledge of the European Parliament , which has added something useful to my whole preparation .

It is then important , in my opinion , for students to pay attention to ideas and concepts .
