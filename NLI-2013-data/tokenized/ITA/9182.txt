I think that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts .
In my opinion , if you understand the concept , you have always time to learn facts or dates .
In children education , for example , it 's important to give them the instruments to understand nature and society .
I think it 's not so important to fill them with dates and facts .

Morever , if a child understand a concept , he will keep it in mind for the rest of his life .
If he learn a fact without understanding it , he will forget it in a month .

For example , i can remember poems that i learned when i was 6 years old , just because my teacher explained the meaning of them .
I can remember songs and historical facts because i had an explenation of them .
If a teacher tells a fact without explaining it for the children has no sense and they do n't put attention on it .
The same is in adults education .
In the university of medicine , for example , is much more important to understand how to visit a patient , than to know exactly the name of the 56 bones of the body .
You always have time to take a book and learn it .

I have to mention that there are facts or notions that people need to know .
For example a doctor , of course has to understand how the body works and how to visit a patient , but he also has to know the dosis of the medicaments or the name of the most important parts of the body .

An antropologist has to understand the human behavior but he also has to know about history and languages and cultures .
So , even if ideas and concepts are more important in education , there are some facts and notions than students have to learn .
