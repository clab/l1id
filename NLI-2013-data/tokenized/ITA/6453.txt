I personally disagree with the provided statement because I think that the number of cars in use will remain basically constant through the years .
First of all , I believe that twenty years will not carry enough changes to produce a variation of our habits and way of living .
Even if the public transport will be presumably enhanced , most of the people will still need a car because the main commercial areas such as shopping centers , cinemas and other facilities will be located far away off the cities and they will still require a car in order to be reached .
Moreover , according to the statistics , people who live in town will move to the adjacent countrysides , owing to the high cost of living they are facing now .

Secondarily , the car industry will probably give its best in order to keep constant the annual income .
Solutions will be provided in order to let people replace their old vehicle , whithout just dismissing it .
As an example , even now new methods of payment are being introduced to allow drivers to change their cars regularly during the years .
I suppose that even the western governments will help the vehicle sector in order to inhibit the unemployment consequent to a possible crisis of the industry .

In addition , in twenty years time , the pollution will probably cease to represent a problem .
New hydrogen engines will be produced with the aim of contrasting the raise of the pollution rate in the air .
People will be more confident in buying new cars with a new environment-friendly technology .
Owning a car will therefore remain a status of economic wealth that no-one would refuse .

These reasons are in my opinion enough to justify why the number of cars will not change in twenty years .
