I 'm not sure about the real meaning of the word succesfull near the word people .
So , in order to try to answer to the question , I can try to look to my experience .

Throughout new things and take risk you can obtain more beneficts but , in the same way , you can easily go to the bankrupty .
However , actually , if you search the success you must try new ways as well as our parents do .
The standardization and the globalization made all of us at the same level and so for emerge you will find many problems because there will be always anyone that make your job better .

In the other hand I think that if you know well your job and you work with attention and expecially with passion you will recognize by others that , for example , will prefer spend more money with a quality or traditional product instead of pay the multinational that producu your product at a lower price .
We can think to the `` Made in Italy '' in opposite to `` Made in China '' .
Why the people continued to buy product with a higher price ?

In my opinion you will can be a succesfull person both trying new things and doing well what you already know .
The main feature that you should have is the passion for your job .
If you had this capacity you will be able to continuing to do what you already know how to do and to try new ways or new things with less risk .
In that way you will be a succesfull person .

The reality is that you are a succesfull person when you feel so .
