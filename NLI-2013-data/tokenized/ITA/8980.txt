I can say that I agree with the statement above .
To my mind , it is much more important to understand ideas and concepts that to learn facts .
I think that a true learning experience comes from a complete understanding of some key points .
Facts are something that can support the key concepts that you have in mind , and help you memorize them , but cannot be the principal elements of a learning experience .

I would n't call ` learning ' what is instead a simple memorization of facts .
I will take History as an example .
History is usually treated as a subject that requires students to memorize a lot of facts .
This is not completely correct .
Of course , you will need to remember some key dates to organize the information you have collected from classes and from your text book , but this will not help you understand the importance of a particular event or of a specific historical period .
You will need to understand the main ideas that are behind that event or that period .
Otherwise , you will not have learnt anything , you will just have done some memorization exercise .

Of course , you cannot study a subject without needing to memorize any fact .
I will take one more example .
A student of medicine will need to study Anatomy , which is also considered as a tough subject because there are a lot of names to memorize .
Nobody can be a good doctor without a solid knowledge of the parts of the human body and of their names .
Therefore facts are also important .
Nevertheless , if there is n't any concept that connects those facts , you will not have any knowledge .
Facts alone have no meaning if there is no supporting idea or concept behid them .
This is the reason why students of medicine will learn Anatomy in an organised way , : the parts of the body are classified in different categories , and this will help students understand how the human body works .

Finally , there is another important factor to consider : The human brain cannot retain a lot of information for a long period of time .
If you simply learn names or a series of facts without any connection , without any concept behind them , you will soon forget what you have been trying to learn .
