This is a very particoular theme .
In my opinion the thing that is better is the first affermation .
I think this becasue for a person in the world is more interesting to know something of every argoument instead that only a specific sector .
All this because a man with a little conoscence of various argouments can have a relationsheep with a lot of person in the world than a man that know only a singoular sector .
In the world of today the knowledge and the intelligence are two important elements that permite to the people to survive .

In the modern society is present the refoular of the most clever .
Usually a man with a limitated intelligence is condanned to suffer .
For me only in the case that a man lives only and makes a particoular work without to have any relationsheeps with other persons can have a specialization only in one specific subject .

But this discuss is valid for few people .
An eclectic conoscence permit , also if it 's limited , a dialogue with a lot of persons .
Sometimes a specialized conoscence is not necessary because the the majority of the discuss that people do is general .
Only in particoular situation is request a specifical conoscence of a argoument .
This is my opinion , but is not law .
Also because a limitated conoscence of a thing is better that no/knowledge .
A life of success is possible only with a particoularly intelligence .
In fact a man only with a intelligence more develop can have a lot of success in the own life and becomes a very important person .
Usually the facts go in this way .
Rarely a man becomes famous and important for a casual event .
In the story of the world these facts are very rare .

In conclusion a person should have a developed knowledge in every sectors , so that he can speak and to have a relationsheep with other persons of different social level .
In fact a intelligence person can speak with every person , intelligent or not , but a person with a limitated conoscence difficulty can have a relation with different person
