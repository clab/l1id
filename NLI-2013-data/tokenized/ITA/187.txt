Can you imagine a world without cars ?
I think that in this society we are living is very difficult thinking about it , because we have only few referements on our life , and one is the car .

We use the car for everything : going to work , to school , for making shopping , going to the supermarket , for having a trip ..
for everything .
We have lost the capacity of thinking that we can use ..
legs or bicycles .
We are becoming even more lazy that in the past , and we do n't want to spend energy on walking .

That is a pety because everyone knows the importance of the enviromental problems .
Every days we are reading on the newspaper that pollution is a real problem for the Earth and should be soved ..
but is not easy when peolple think only for themselves and not for the entire society .

It 's even true that to maintein a car , people spend a lot of money every year ..
for gazoline , and assicurances , and all papers you have to make in order to make your car able to be driven .

But in contrast , is evident that cars are very usefull , and solve communication problems : cars let to think nearby to someone that really lives far away from you , and permit to have experience of life .

For example permit you to make a cheap trip around a region , or around a continent , giving you the possibility of having a sicure place to sleep , and for young people ( who do n't have much money .. )
that is an important thing .

In conclusion , for all these reasons , I think that the use of car will not diminuish because it is a sourse of confortability , and benefits for the middle class persons .
