I think that is most important for everyone to have a broad knowledge of many arguments , at the sometime I think that is foundamental for everyone to have specific knowledge in one subject .

For some aspects I prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because in this way I can to have many possibility of choise for my future .
For other aspect I prefer to have a specialize knowledge in one specific area ; in this way I can do my work better and with most capacity .

Generally I am agree with this statement because today every studets want to go at the university and , in this way , they can choise better the course in wich they want to specialize .

I think also that the primary and the high school must to give to the student the struments and the capacity to build theire future like they want .
