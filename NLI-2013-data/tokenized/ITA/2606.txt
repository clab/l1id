I believe that young people enjoy life more than old people for several reasons .
Young people have more energy to spend becase thay are in good shape and they do n't have any physical problem .
They can practice any tipe of sport and spend hours outdoor playing with their friends .

They have a lot of free time due to the fact that they do n't work and that they do n't have to look after any kids .
During this free time they can go aut to bars , pubs or disco and meet new friends .
In addition to this they can also meet a girlfriend or a boyfriend and having romantic dinners .

Young people do n't have problems with moneys because they can always ask to their parents if they need them .
Using the parent 's money they can buy a sail boat for the summer in order to enjoy the sea during the summer or they can buy a pair of ski for the winter time .

During the summer school vacations they can also travel around the world using airplains or boats .
They can , for example , organize a tour of all the main towns of Europe .
In every town they can try different restaurant , go to see concerts and drink all night long .

When they are at home they can use internet to buy several items , meet new people and create their personal website .
Unfortunatelly they do n't spend part of their energy to help old people even if they know that in fourty years they are going to be old too .
