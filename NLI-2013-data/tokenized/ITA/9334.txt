I think that a student first must learn to judge .
What do I said ?
In the schools often the teachers do n't teach at student the difference between the concepts and facts .
This situation create a not quality and ability in the student to understand what is important for him and for them .
I agree with the statement because in my school carrier i have learned that it 's important choise and to say make a choise , sometimes facts bring you on wrong ways .

Students are put themselves every day to contact with real world and with difficolty life , opposite than the last own life , for this way at this time it 's important for students to understand ideas or concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

For to improve their capacities is well things read all day one or more journal , read book watch tv news program and discuss whit professor or parents , and with friends about a problem .

The tought of the most famous professor is that increase tha capacities of judge in future generations made decrease the problem in the world becouse tha knowledge of a problem join with the own ideas and concepts help to solve by fact .

In italy are born specific college course where the professor teach what are the rules for increase the own personality and introspection analises and during the primary school the student learn the basemant of socity 's costumes .

Another important passage is for the student , and I think is good things improve , `` the reasons meeting '' found in the wold .
In my study first and in my profession now I have researched always the ideas and concepts because without this aspect was for me impossible know and learn facts .
