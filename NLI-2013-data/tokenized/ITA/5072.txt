Obviously this is true .
Everybody knows that marketing 's importance in everyday 's life is growing faster and faster everyday ; and advertisements play a fundamental role in this `` play '' .
The impact of images and sounds during a product 's advert is more important than the quality of the product itself .
How many times do we buy a particular kind of biscuits , cake , cleaning item , tissues , shoes ( and so on ) just because the day before we saw that fantastic advert with that catchy tune ?
Well , i think that this happens very very often .

Nowadays every serious company has got some expert people thinking about marketing strategies to have their product well spread .
And the main part of these studies goes to advertisements .
This study is based upon a lot of other things : people thoughts , polls and so on .
Exploiting this informations with accuracy , companies choose a mix of sounds and images that catches our attention .
So , the point is : i agree with this statement , because it is obviously true and recognized ( who could say it isnt ? )
, but i do n't agree with the way the companies exploit this kind of thing .
I mean , yes it 's their work , but sometimes there 's so much difference between advertisements and quality that we could call it a crime !
These kind of thing happens in music too ..
When some popular music magazines like the NME wants to `` launch '' a particular band , it begins putting these band 's pictures everywhere , on the cover , on the back , in the middle etcera , so that the young kids think '' oh , the NME ca n't be wrong '' ...
the consequence is that these bands reach a level of success that is not proportional to its skill .
In the same way , companies spend LOTS of money in buying advertisement spaces in television or in the streets or in internet sites for their products and only a FEW for the product itself !
Yes , it 's nice to see some adverts on tv ( maybe featuring some nice girl hehe ) , but i do n't agree with this excess hype .
Companies should spend less money for adverts and a little more for the stuff they produce !
