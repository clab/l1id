First of all i think that is important for everybody have a good knowledge that is necessary for live , for discuss and resolve problems or situation of the normal life .

So after this , i think is better to have a knowledge composed by differents subjects than to specialize in just one specific subject .
it s important to have a mix culture for to be able to think , to discuss , and to partecipate in differents conversation .
you need an education that should involve mathematics , philosophy , music and history , ..
and many others .
you can specialize in one specific objects that you feel more able to do , or just because you really like .
but it s necessary to have a background before .
for example i am a musician .
i have studied many years music at school with other many differents subjects .
but after many years i felt able to choose one , to decide which i like more than other .
i have invested a lot of time to study music .
but i always need to read , to be with people that are studying something differents .
you don t need just to know how you read the music for to be a really good musician .
you really need to read , to go to the teather ..
everything should improve your ability , your specific subject for what you are investing a lot of your time .
it s better have both , have the possibility to be educated with a background of knowledge untill that moment where you feel able to choose one specific subject .
So i think you need to do both of this passage ..
In my opinion these two different approachs must be both present .
one follows the other .
i think it s not right to choose one of these two approach , or say that one is better than one other .
