It is commonsense to argue that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Nevertheless , in a society in which growing up adults is becoming increasingly difficult , there are many reasons to question the above view .
In other words , in todays , world , older people are well placed to enjoy life more than young people do .

To start with , young people often have to struggle to get on in their carriers .
Consequently , rather than enjoyng their free time , they are prone to use their free time to improve their working skills or to work extra hours , to demonstrate that they are good workers .
In constrast , older people , who have already achieved their professional success , may enjoy more leisure time than they did in their past .

Another reason that may explain why younger people do not enjoy life that much is that they are still in search for their sentimental equilibrium .
Young people are more vulnerable to love than older people are and this , in turn , may destabilize them .
For instance , when a young falls in love with someboody and the relationship breaks up , his/her reaction is much more magnified as compared to an old man/woman reaction .
Indeed , old people , who are are more experienced in sentimental affairs , react to sentimental failures with a touch of philosophical detachment !

The discussion led so far is not meant to imply that old people have not problems .
They face severe issues such as living alone or getting used to their retirement from previously held activities .
Despite the potential severity of these problems , however , I think that the problems that young people face are greater than the ones old people do .
Struggling to get a rewarding job or creating a family are two of the biggest challenges human beings go through their lives .
Having already passed through them , old people have a clear comparative adavantage .
