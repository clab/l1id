My university is a specific academy for design , but I think that know many subjets is very important , for allways work that I will do .
I am going to do an architect , in this work is more important known the disegn but also history , matematics and phisic , for this I study many subjects .
In the 1900 the architets designed all of the house not only structures , this competense needed of many subjects , I will became an completly architect .
If I studing only one subject I do not known if I will do well my work .
This is my opinion .
