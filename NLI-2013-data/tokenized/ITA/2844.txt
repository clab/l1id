Depending on the cirucmstances to which the question could be posed , the answers vary accordingly .
Of course , young adults have completely different sources of enjoyment to middle age people who in turn , have different enjoyment to a pensioner .
Depending on where you find place in this chain will distinguish what you consider fun .
A younger crowd will enjoy attending parties , attending night clubs , doing rather challenging and more physically tiring sports .
A middle age person might achieve enjoyment from playing a game of chess or maybe going to the opera and for that middle age person person , attending noisy parties and doing dangerous sports might not be enjoyment at all .
Therefore , depending the age that you have , whatever you do will will bring upon it the correct benefit .

There is a typically trend that young people believe that they enjoy life more than an older person because they believe that the younger you are the more fun you can have , this i believe is incorrect because , yes of course , the younger you are the more options of enjoyment you might think to have .
For example , a fatehr of a child would rather much spend time with his son or duaghter rather than attend a gathering full of 20 year olds just because he has different priorities .

A young person would not enjoy spendign tiem with relatives or older members of his fmaily simply because at that age , you tend to have different obligations , different points of interest and different type of mentality .
Younge rpeople tend to fell that as your odl you miss out on what is really fun , but we must remember that older people where young at one point and what a young person thinks an older person will never dream of doing , might just probably mean that it was already done .
Therefore , i do not believe that the younger you are the more fun you have but rather , the older you are your taste of fun change and you rpriorities differ .
Enjoyment can be derived from many aspects of life and it is not only allocated to the young adults .
