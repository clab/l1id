It is not easy to say which is the better approach , but I personally do not agree with the statement , because I think that a broad knowledge of many academic subjects is not as good as specializing in one specific subject .
I say this for two main reasons .

The first reason is that it is more practical for students .
I mean , if you can concentrate on one subject it will be easier for you to learn lots of things on that subject and you will be able to become prepared .

But when I say `` more practical '' I refer also to the fact that studing one subject instead of more than one is good for the student 's path .
I mean , once a student has entered the subject he should know what that subject requires , what the important aspects are and he would be able to organise his studies in the best way .
Maintaining your mind open to a lot of subjects is a big effort .

It is true that keep your mind open could be a good thing , giving you a wide range of knowledge , but the question is if this knowledge will be useful in your future .

This question brings me to expose the second reason that supports my opinion .
I argue that specialising will be useful for working .
Companies , or institutions , usually do not hire people who have a generalistic approach , that know a lot of things , but that remain on the surface of them .
Companies require people to be expert in something and to become an expert you have to get into things , to discover all the aspects , to prevent all the problems .

As for my personal experience I have to say that I 'm in a class with a very generalistic approach and I think it is not good .
I 'm glad that I 've got a solid basic culural background , but I am sincerely worried about my future .
You could ask me why I am in such a class and the answer would be that I do not know .
When I chose my class I thougth it was more specialistic , but I was wrong , but I think to be lucky as well because I had the opportunity to attend lots of intersting courses and to meet lots of good professors .
