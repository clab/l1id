I do agree with this statement .
People who want to be successful are usually tired of the life they are living , and this implies that they want to achieve something more , something new .
They know that in life you must work hard if you want to get something , you must be ready to challenge yourself and risk everything to reach your goal .
Of course there are also many people who get all the things they want without making any effort and without deserving those things , but a person who worked hard in order to make his or her dreams or hopes come true , is in the end the real winner , the real successful person .
Being successful is not only a matter of being able to get what you want , that is only the material result .
What makes someone really successful is the growth as a human being that took place in this person s mind and soul during the way to reach his or her goal .
Facing changes and difficoulties , as well as being able to take the risk of an insuccess , this person has not only got the thing he or she worked for , but has also learnt the real value of things , the value of work and dedication .
Putting your heart , your mind , you soul , your everything in something ..
that is what makes someone really successful .
