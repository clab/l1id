I actually disagree with this statement .
I 'm a young girl and I want to spend some words supporting boys and girls of my own age , in fact we are not so bad as people say , we spend time doing social works and helping our comunities too .

I want to give an exemple : in my own town there are almoust 3,500/4000 persons , I live in a small town , but we 've got a several number of old men and women which need help for house works , doing shopping , having friendly relationship ...
etc ...
because they are alone , maybe without wife or hausband anymore , so a group of young boys and girls , 20 years ago , made a group , the name is `` Let 's meet again '' which is made of young people , specifically nephews and nieces , that want to spend more time with their grandparents , but also they want to let them meet each other : together we can learn a lot of things .

This group was working from 1983 , and the most beautifull thing is that old men and women are very happy to meet new people , to tell stories in which they often recognize each other , to have a good time during the weekend ; on the other hand all the young people are very happy and satisfied to learn a lot of new things of their 's granparents lifes , of their jobs , of their loves ...
maybe divided by the second world war !

Sometimes grandmathers teach us little house works that nobody know anymore and grandfathers tell about how strange it was to get marriage with a woman they absolutly did n't know ...
they are very nice and this is a pretty good way for guys to learn about love relationship ...
they understand how important is to be free to meet a person and to be able to know each other as much as possible before get marriage .

I think that this is a way to help a comunity and to do the greatest school of life !
