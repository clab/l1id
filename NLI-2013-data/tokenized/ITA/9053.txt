I think that today , there are a lot of students that want to study and in this way they could have a better future .
I believe that it is easier to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
It is also true that it is very important to know facts because it could be usefull in our lives .
Therefore It is up to us to understand what we want to do .

There are differnt types of thinking about it , but I reckon that for a student to understand ideas and concepts is more and more important and simple copared to learn facts .

For instance I 'm an architect and when I was a student I discussed a lot with my teachers about this problem .
I wanted only to understand ideas because I considerded very difficult to remember facts and other things .

Today I think that to understand concepts and to learn facts should be important for all of us and each one shoud make it better .
