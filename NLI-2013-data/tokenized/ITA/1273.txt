The question if it is better to have a broad knoledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject is quite difficult .
There are three point to discuss about this question .
The first point is taht having a broad konwledge can help you in finding a job because as much as you know as vary can be the fields in with you can deal with .

Moreover you will be able to take part in a variety of subjects with people and this can help you to socialise when you are in a new environment with peolple you do n't know .

Third , you can link different informations and create a personal point of view .
On the other hand , specialize in a certain subject can help you to become a leader in your job field and an expert .
Furthermore you can speak deeply about your subject in a conversation , and you can use it for appealing people who listen to it and make a strong impression .
Finally , you can teach or give specific informations to other persons in a conversation helping them to understand new matters far away of their fields of interest .
As far as I am concerned , I agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge and I am quite sure that a broad knwledge is better that a specific one .
My experience teach me this .
I attended Social and political studies at university an this is a very broad knowledge course. : Later in life it has been reallly useful in my job , in understanding the worlds and make me flexible in learning new tasks .
For all these reasons , I think it can be helpful in daily life an for yourself as human being .

In the end , I think one mus n't stop learnig in life , I would like to continue to study the subjects i prefer and learn new ones that can be help me to be a better person .
