Although students are very different from each other - so what is true and valid for one may not be true and valid for an another - I generally agree with the statement , but I think one element cannot be separated from the other : this means that there are no ideas and concepts without facts , and there are no facts without ideas and concepts .

From my point of view facts are not so important if you don ' t have the instruments for analysing them , and the instruments are given by ideas and concepts : understanding the `` abstract '' ideas gives students the tools for facing reality and learning facts , otherwise they would not get anything of what they are reading , for examples on history books , which are the places where you can mostly find `` facts '' .

History is to me the best example of this mutual relationship between concepts and facts because it is made of facts , but the study of history cannot exist without ideas and concepts .

I can mention my personal case : when I was a student I really enjoyed studying History , but when I grew up I realized this was because I consider History more as a collection of interesting and pictoresque events than as real actions done by people who have lived before me , and whose actions has had an effect on our present ( Latins used to say `` Historia magistra vitae '' ) ; this means at the time I missed the connections , I did n't apply those marvellous stories to the present , in other words I did not understand ideas and concepts .
Now that I am more mature I see things from a different perspective , and I try to approach facts always keeping in my mind some general principles .

Thisis why I think students in schools , even if very young , should try to do the same , of course with the help and assistance of their teachers .
