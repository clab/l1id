I totally agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
They pay little attention to the needs of their communities , acting as if they were not involved .

I think there are three main reasons which explain this opportunistic behaviour .
First , the governements and the schools do not promote enough the importance of helping the community .
I know only few schools which make the social service as part of their curricula .
I think that as soon as possible people must learn that the community service is a civil duty .
We all belong to the same society , and therefore we must share the tasks .
That is why school and universities should consider the comunity service as a prerequisite to be admitted , and also should induce their students to do it during the accademic years .

The second reason why young people do not give enough time to helping their communities is that they do not have time .
The modern society is mostly based on some values which do not include the community service .
The main purpose is to make profit which means that the main value is money .
Nowadays the competition is radically increasing and therefore the efficiency is becoming crucial .
The sooner you are graduate , the sooner you start to work , the sooner you get promoted , the sooner you make more profit .

from this point view , it is obvious that young people see the community service as a waste of time .
That is why , in order to resolve the problem , the way of thinking should change .

Unfortunately I think that this will never happen .
The global economy promoted by most of the governements inevitably lead young people to act in an opportunistic way .
The only chance they have no to be left out is to be efficient .
Efficiency do not leave time for helping the communities .
