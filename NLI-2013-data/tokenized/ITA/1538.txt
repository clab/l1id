Culture has to be very important for all people , it is better thet eachone know much information about differet argoment and topic .
It is very beatiful study many academic subjects because you could discover much things that you do n't know .

At same time I think that for working is better to specialize in one specific subject .
For example before the last reform of school Italian university give you many academic subjects and less specific subject , you study in university a lot of book and after university you do n't know the way for enter in word 's job .
For a students is very difficult understanding the applications of information in a jo .

I think that the general academic subjects is important for myself and specific subject too .
The best way for me to improve your culture and found a good job is that you have to learn very well all the informations that school give you and after that , during the work , this information have to use for do a good job .

Now Italian University is building in a different way than the past .
You study for 3 years many academic subjects ( many information about a different kind of disciplins ) and the and of this 3 yeas you have a degree of first level .
After you decide if you continue your studies or not .
If you continue to study you can choose one specialization and learn one specific subject for 2 years , during this time yuo at the and you have a degree of second level .

In short I think that is better that I learn many academic subjects for improve my culture and my life at the same time I learn one specific subject for found a job that I like me .
