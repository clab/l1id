Nowadays we can often hear that young peole do not have enough time to helping their comunity .
I agree with this well known idea because I think that young people must spend a lot of time to study to be sure to have a brillant future and they use the little amount of free time that remain to help their family , to coltivate some hobies or to keep some relationship with their friends .

Young people are colled to attend a long study trail , and they have to spend a lot of their time to read book and impruve their knowledgement because of their future work .
Infact if they want a good job in a well known company they have the necessity to take high marks at school because nowadays there is a huge competition to find a job .

Moreover young people usually spend their free time to dedicate some moment to their family who , probably , needs help .
for example some family needs economic help to allows their sons to attend good school and often young people are colled to make some extrawork to pay their school .
This people do n't have enough time to helping their comunity because they have enough time only to help themself and their family .

Finally young people , unfortunatly , prefer to spend their little free time raising their reletionship with their friends .
They spend the last time that they have to save their reletion with some important frinds who they will miss if they 'd help their comunity .

In my personal experience i had tried to help my comunity before I overwhelmed with my study .
I had to make a choice and I chose to study and coltivate some friends instead to help my comunity .
Helping own comunity is very difficult , becase young people have to study , to help their family , and to coltivate their friends .
The time that remain is very short and it is n't enough .
