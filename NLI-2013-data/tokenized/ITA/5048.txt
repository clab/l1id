Today we can see on television many kinds of advertisements .
These kinds can attract our attention or not .
Many times television 's advertisements attract my attention about some products that really are not interesting for me .
But the scatch and the music are made so carefully that I ca n't refuse to watch them .
These advertisements attract so much my attention that I want immediately to buy that product also if it does n't is usefull for me really .
Only after I understand that the product is not how I imagined it watching it on television , but it 's really different .
For example when I saw a really beautiful advertisement of a watch on tv , I immediately went to buy it .
But when I took it in my hands , it looked really different from the watch I saw on television and I was not so happy to have bought it as I thought .
So I understood that what I liked was not the object watched on TV , but his advertisement .

Some other advertisements are not so good and often , when they pass on television , I do n't watch them very well .
But often these advertisements present an object that is much better than the one well presented on TV .
For example I never paid attention to a particular pair of jeans that often I watch on TV ; the advertisement was not really good and so it never took my attention .
But when I went to buy a pair of jeans , after I tried many pairs of them , I bought the pair of jeans I saw on television that never paid my attention .
It was really confortable and I liked it .

So I agree with this statement because many times what seems to be good on television is not really so , while what on TV seems not so interesting perhaps it can be good and can likes me when I see it in my hands .
