This question perfectly fits with my personal experience , in fact I had to face to this important question during my career as a student before and a worker after .
At university I have studied political science , a faculty which gave me a wide knowledge other different subjects , such as politic , history , economy , languages , sociology , philosophy , mathematic , law , etc .
During the period of my studies I have found them really usefull and not boring at all , because I could study different issues at the same time , making university a vary and always new method of learning .
The same day I had lessons of private law , mathematic and sociology , and this variety of subjects avoided the risk of getting tired of studing always the same thing .

Then I graduated , and I had to face the incredible world of job .
And only at this point I have found out that all what I had studied at university gave me on one side a wide range of knowledges , but on the other a lack in the specific knowledge of one main subject .

In all this , which knowledge is better ?
The broad knowledge of many academic subjects or the specialization in one specific subject ?
I still have to find myself the right answer , so that I have to arrange this lack giving a compromising answer : it 's better to have a specialized knowledge in one subject which we like and on which we can focus our job and career , but we should optimize this specialization by widening as much as possible our basic knowledge of different subjects .

Another important factor concerns our goals : if our goal is to find a good and well retributed job , so we have to specialize in one subject because this is what is more needed and asked in the job 's world .
Nowadays there are more graduated with a good wide knoledge than graduated with a good specialization in one field of studies .

On the other hand , if our goal is to have a general knowledge other different aspects which may help to understand one single sector of our life , such as for istance political science , we have to spend years other different academic subjects , studying a bit of everything .
