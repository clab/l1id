I disagree with the statement according to which it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than to learn facts for the following reasons :
First , a theory must always be followed by a praxis , as the Austrian philosopher Karl Popper used to state at the beginning of last century .
As an example , this makes me think of the last class on Pedagogy I attended at the University of Bologna ( Italy ) a couple of weeks ago : the Professor told us that students need to know facts , but it is also true that in my country on the whole we students are not trained so practical way Second , I believe that what makes history is praxis , facts and events , not just theory : it is the praxis that determines the changes and the development of history .
Third , a young student who is more `` theorical '' than practical ( just like me unfortunately , I should say ! ... )
can give the impression of living in another world and he sometimes can even have some difficulties in everyday life : how many times have I personally felt somehow lost and unconfident in practical situations that apparently were not so hard to face ! ...
That is due to the fact that unfortunately I am still not so experienced , I believe ... !

In conclusion , I believe that ideas and concepts should always be related and applied to facts , even though I can understand that that is not always the case .
