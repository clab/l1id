The speed and the pace by which technology proceeds is very fast :: if we look at the past , we can recognize how human progress and inventions have changed and restricted their own time of preparation and creation .

A set of materials in which man has improved his conditions of life is transport .
Nowadays it 's very common to own a car and to get a licence to drve it as soon as possible .
This means of transport has become essential to us .

This leads me to openly state thet I do n't really think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
The following are my reasons to hold my opinion .

Firstly , it 's commonly known that the number of cars owned by families has been strongly increasing in the last years : more and more cars are daily being purchased by people , and a clear proof of it is that centers that are specifically built to gather old and over used cars are overcrowded .
Besides , it 's becoming more and more difficult to find a bare parking in the neighborhood of your house , expecially if you live in a city .

Secondly , although the fuel ' and gas ' resourses are being strongly decreasing and scientific research is trying to find alternative ways to satisfy the huge supply for fuel , statisics in the market can ensure us that cars will constitute a well built buisness for still many years , no matter with what is concerning with fuel 's lack .

Thirdly , techology works very fast , but not so fast to completely revolutionate our way of move and carry within twenty years : flying cars that we often see in fantasy-scientific movies are enough far from us .

It 's true that many other ways of transport have been invented ( such as airplanes ) , but cars , buses and vans are too important to us , because they work on the ground ane we live on the ground , too .
