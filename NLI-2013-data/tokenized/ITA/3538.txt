Before responding to the question , it 's important to consider actual problems that young people have to face every day .
Nowadays it 's more difficult for young people to find a job than in the past .
They must study very much and hard to increase their chances .
Competition is a key point that stesses people who need also to be as more skilled as possible .
So they need to attend university and more time is required to end their studies .

For the same reason , their parents have less time to look after and educate them , expecially if the mother is not a housework .
In fact , the society demand is greater than in the past in all fields , and it requires more speed .
So people run from one place to another to respect their appointments .

The result is that young people are more stessed and not enough educated .
My experience suggests me that this guys will grow up with many problems than people who have parents who love them and teach them how to behave .

Generally , they are more individualist and prefer to spend their time playing videogames and not helping their relatives or the community .
This could lead to problems in the society that are difficult to resolve .

This is the common sense , but I do n't completely agree with this thesis .
There are many young people that spend their time in good activities .
For esample , when I was a teenager , I frequently helped my relatives in their jobs , or the prist in the church that I frequented .
I know many teenagers that every day spend their time in hospitals , or simply they help their grandparents at home .
