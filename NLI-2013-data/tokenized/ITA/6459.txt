Maybe , but I am not sure .
It 's true that tecnologhy are growing very rapidly , but 20 years ago we said that today we could have cars with no pullution and that we cuold fly with them .
I belive in our studies , and I am sure that something are changing .

Now we are looking at Hydrogen like only solution for a pollution dicrease , but maybe tomorrow we can find something different .
I think that the only way to have less cars in use is the introduction of a new tax to enter in the city and a good service of bus and train in the city .
Italin people are not able to reach the work place without their car and , I think a lot of people all over the world want their indipendent and to be free to go wherever they want .
Today we are about 5.000.000.000 people but in twenty years how many are we ?

How many car will be ?
If we grow up we need more transport and more car .
Now all the car are moved by gasoline , but is its price good and is its disponibility enought ?
Maybe only solution to cut the car number is the end of the gasoline or a price so high that nobody can buy it .

Some studies say that the gasoline price reach in italy on 2007 like a 1 , 80 euro for L , and if we think about mind salary it is easy to see how is difficult drive our car .
However I think that will be very strange if in twenty years will be fewer cars in use but if we learn to go in 2 or more people with one car maybe could happen .
