How many times did we buy a product after been delighted by its amazing beauty or features and then , we found out that it was really useless , with our great disappointment ?

As a matter of fact advertising does n't show the customer the downsides of its product or service , but emphasizes the essential advantages that it can bring into our lifes .
If we go deeper into the topic , analyzing how people develop commercials and advertisements , we can identify why this can happen .
First it 's analyzed the ideal customer and , according to him/her tastes and preferences , some characteristics , or even emotions , are underlined in the advertisements .
Furthermore some tecnical devices are used to create the sensation of wealth in the consumer , for instance using the image of a creamy yoghurt , surrounded by fresh fruits and pieces of chocolate , even if , in the reality - practically making the commercials - the yoghurt is just a white-coloured cream , so creamy that it 's impossible to recreate into reality .

In addition the advertisements can use the technique of the association to something else , even something that is completely different but that must share the same feeling of the advertized product .
For example Gillette , a famous brand of razors , made an advertisement for its product placing , on a page of a magazine , the shape of the razor , close to a Ferrari , a sportif and expensive car .

The two shapes had the same bright colours in order to underline their hypothetical similarity regarding the strong sensations they could offer towards the consumer .
All this arguments are presented in order to emphasize some features that we feel , watching adverisements , and make products much better than they really are .
