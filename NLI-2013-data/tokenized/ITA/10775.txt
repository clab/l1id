I agree whit the statement that successful peolple try to do new things and not only what they are already good to do .
In my opinion this is a main aspect of a successful person , indeed successful people have the ability to understand what they can try to do even if they know that they already have n't the preparation to do that .

Someone ca n't became a real successful person if he does't try to risk .
He has to have the ability to understand that he can try to do something even if he does't know how to do that .
In modern society it is more difficult to rase over other people than some years ago , so people , who want success , have to go over their own limits to try if they are really able to do some thing .

It is like when someone bet , he does n't know if he will win , but he knows that if he will win he will be happy and successful .
Nowadays there is n't so much space for weak people in the high levels of the society .
But there is a big problem about this aspect of successful people , and it is a proplem for all the society .
I think doing this , there is a low quality of activity .
In other words , if someone stop to do something when he becomes able to do that , because he wants to do something else , there wo n't be a person able to do that work and so there will be less quality .
