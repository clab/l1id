The fluently use and buy of the cars is the typical sign of a develop and rich state .
Infact the more concentration of cars is in the western state .
There are many reasons to condivide this opinion .
The terrible increasing of pollution is the most important aspects to take in consideration .
Infact , by this dipend other factors .
The problem of pollution we will hold with a production of less dangerosu cars for the envaironment , but the best solution is that increase the pubblic transport like metropolitan , bus , train .
If the pubblic transport will be more capillar and efficent , the use of cars can be reduce seriously !

One more important reason is justified by the traffic .
A lot of cars has been invasion the street : the result is the most dilatation of the time to travel .
This problem make more in evidence the problems of pollution and pubblics transport .

But I think it 's true the opinion of the decreasing of the number of cars , but not in the middle period .
Infact I think are more less twenty years for change the most complicated abitude of the man .
The solution about the some problems already write , can be the use of another type of material different the oil : for example the hydrogen , or sun energy .

It 's possible that we will have a less percentual of buying cars , but not fewer cars .
Cities like Los Angeles are the clear exemple of thousands of people every day victims of the traffic .
