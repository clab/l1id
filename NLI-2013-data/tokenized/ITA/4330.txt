If we had the possibility to go to live for a short period in the past , but not too far , maybe just sixty or seventy years ago , we would have been shocked to see how many things have changed .
If we speak to an elderly person , about 80 years old , surely he/she will say that he/she does n't recognise this world anymore .
The behaviour of the people has changed , the way they consider and judge things which surround their town , they community , or their city is completely and totally different .

As far as I am concerned , I partially agree with this statement .
It is certainly true that the young generation does not give the right importance to helping the community they live in .
Infortunately , nowadays they are just interested in building up their careers , in climbing the career ladder , in going to parties , in getting drunk , and other millions of similar thing .
I my opinion , however , in not good blame just young people , and the reason I am saying this is that we must not forget that is the society or , better said , the entirely world which pushes in this way .
Everyone must be rich , must have a fats and expensive car , everyone must have a huge and impressive house , etc ...
I am not surprised that young people are becomig more and more selfish and money-oriented .
In these day we do n't have any more the positive values and the moral and ethical rules that our grandfathers had in the past century !

Moreover , my personal opinion is that this change in the behaviour and in the concern in the community problems is not just related to the new or young generation .
In fact , also adults or `` old and mature '' people are affected by this new disease : we can call it `` money-desire '' .
More and more grandpas or grandmas are left alone and without a real love and care by their relatives , because their children or their grandchildren are too busy too think about their lives .

In conclusion , personally , I think that we should change the mind of the people who live in the entire world to assure a little more help to our communities and to our beloved grandfathers .
