I agree with the following statement .
The young people can have more situation for enjoy thieir life then the older person .
First of all , to school the young people can meet their friends on day and can play and study with them , two things more funny than work .
The older poeple probably they must work in a day and do n't have the same situation for enjoy thierself .
Second , the young person has more time to spend in a play then the older person .
In my opinion an older person do n't want play with his friends because does n't have any time .
Third , the young person is free to do all thing that he want .
He is free to jump , is free to smile and is free to follow all of his behavior .
The older person ca n't do it because in a particula work situation he must have a particolar behavior .
For example in office , the worker ca n't speak free , ca n't sing .
That all , by .
