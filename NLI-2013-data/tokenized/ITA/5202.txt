Today for the succesfull of a product to make advertisements it is necessarily .
Becouse a lot of products are same for caractheristics and price and will become the best that with the better advertisements .
For this reason in a big company but even in a small company there is a group of people that they study the way to obtain the best advertisement .
Some time there are even advertisements no true .
In particular on the tv there are a lot of advertisements to make products seem much better then thay really are .
Using the tv it is more easy for a company to show a product very nice .
For example if you put a car in an advertisement with a nice girl , it is more easy that people want to buy the car .
As far as i am concerned it is no correct to make products seem much better than they really are , but this is the law of the busuness .

In this way a company can have some advantages and some disadvantages .
With this kind of advertisement a factory can send more products , but after the first time the custumers understand that the quality of the product is not so nice and thay will not buy the product another time .

I think the best way it is to make a correct advertisement without to tell something no true .
It is important compair ours product with the product of an other company and to tell becouse ours product it is better .
For example Infostrada and other pnone company use this kind of advertisements and they have a lot of succesful .
