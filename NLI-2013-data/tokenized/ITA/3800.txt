The statment is really general and I disagree with that .
I think the category of young people should be divided in different groups .
Surely the first division should be of two big groups : teens and young people from 20 to 26 .

Teens should go on studying becouse , as we now , their help to their communitie will be bigger if they can do some usefull work .
But at the same time I think , in that period , a teen must hold a part of the day for his couriosity .

People from 20 to 26 , that is the category in which I am , could yet be a worker on could still be a student .
And I think in both of the situations they are helping their communitie .
Obviously there could be some exceptions of people that , for different reasons , do n't found their own way .
But they are exeptions .

Than , In Italy , we can decide to give social services to society , also stopping to study for a year , and work in hospitals or old people 's houses or something similar .

But I always think the better way to help your communities it is to find your own position as worker inside the system .
And to do that young people must do what they do .

What sould they be supposed to do more ?
I really would like to understand becouse I read statements like this from when I was child .
I think that the past world wars did private young people of their youth .
And I think that 's not right .
So when I realize that I 'm living in a really beatiful time and in a really comfortable place I think that is a must of mine going on to study , improve my work and enjoy my self .
And when I do all of this things I think I 'm helping my communitie .
