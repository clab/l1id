I am 25 years old , so my personal experience only covers half of the statement , the part regarding young people ; however i can look at my relatives or at other elder people to infer something about how do thay enjoy life .

In a first appoximation , I think that each one enjoy his \ her life in a different way , so it is not easy to generalize this evaluation distinguishing between younger and older people .

However , I have to point out that a necessary ( even not sufficient ) condition for a person to enjoy his \ her life is to have a good health ; and it is statistically true that older people have more chances to have a bad health Apart from this first consideration , there are some other matter of facts about how youngers and olders conduct their lifes .
In fact , a very important consideration has to be done about work .
Younger people have to work harder than the olders that often are on retirement , so the younger have less time to spend for their own enjoyment ( and , depending on the retirement system , they can also have less money ! ) .

Nonetheless , young people have more opportunities to have fun because most of enterteinments better fits to them ( such as discos , some kinds of sport activities , some kinds of concerts or travels , etc . ) .
The negative aspect connected with this wider range of opportunities is that sometimes young people suffer of a kind of `` anxiety '' of having fun and doing lots of things , which ends to make them always unhappy with what they are doing .

In fact , it is true that maybe older people have a different way of approaching to life that allows them to get the best from every situation and to enjoy more of simple things .
This different `` way of appreciating '' things perhaps derives from their maturity , their whole experience and make their lifes more relaxed and sometimes more serene .

In conclusion , I think that it is not possible to completely agree or disagree with the statement because it depends on individual attitudes and external conditions how a person can enjoy his \ her life during different periods .

Once more I see that life is more complicated and people are more different one to another than it can be described in a short phrase .
