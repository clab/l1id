As I 'm Italian , I can maintain that this statement is probabilly wrong : actually , my personal experience shows that the trend is the opposite .
When I was a child , there were only one car per family and you could have seen the same situation when my parents were young .
If you have lived in the early-Fourties of the last century , probabilly you could n't afford a car : only rich people had one .

Now , let 's take a look at today situation , cars are everywhere !
I do n't want to condemn this trend - I own a car too - but that 's a matter of fact and , I think , in the future it will be one of the main issue in every politician 's agenda .

You can find many reasons to explain why everyone wants a car , nevertheless I 'm virtually sure that it is due to the difficult to travel around with trains , buses and taxis - and the latter are very expensive here in Italy .
If you have a date , surely you do n't wish to be late , but if you take a train , you could never know when you arrive nor if you arrive in the right place .
I think it 's time to introduce an example .
Today there is my TOEFL test , nonetheless public drivers have made up their minds to strike .
Unless I would come here by feet , I was obliged to drive my car .
You have to consider that such a situation happens about twice a month for buses , twice a month for trains , twice a month for planes ; surely it 's not surprising the fact that people prefer to go to work with thair own cars .
Even if your family is small , as my family is , you need at least two cars , because your father has to go to work in time and you do n't want to be late for your university course .

To summarize , I do n't think that cars will be fewer in the next years and surely we will have to cope with pollution .
If politicians want to stop this trend , they are requested to improve public transports , as buse , for example .
But I-m sure that this will not happen in a few years .
