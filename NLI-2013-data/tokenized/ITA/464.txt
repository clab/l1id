I think that is better before to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects because in this way i can enlarge my knowledge and learn all that is possible .
but then it is important to specialize in one specific subject , because in this way i can deepen my knowledge on a particular argument that i prefer and that is more interesting for me , for satisfy my curiosity .

for example i have study in scientific school for five years where i must study all the academic subjects ( for example : biology , filosofy , history , english , mathematic , latin ... )
so i have learn much academic subjects .

now instead i am study at the university architecture subject , because i love this job and i have ever loved all that is art or design ( modern art in particular ) , so now i prefer specialize in this specific subject to became an architect and to make what i love and i prefer in my future life .

instead if a person whant to specialize only in one specific subject he unknown all that the normal people known , and so this person can only speak and work in
