This is the first time in the history of the humanity that the man is in a not-return point : the environmental condition of the our planet are very difficult because we are abused too much of the resources that the Earth can give us .

We cannot mantain anymore our life condition because of the price to pay is too hight .
Is a reality that the environment and our way to manage it need a change .

The huge presence of the cars in all cities of the world is maybe the principal cause of the world pollution .
Unfortunelly our economic system is based on resource that add pollution to the already present pollution .
The main example is the oil .
Search , found , and utilise the oil comport a lot of danmage in the environment .
Before to have to choise an hursch and improvise change we can try to find different solution to change deeply our economic system .
The alternative resource present in the environment need more financial aids and more attencion by the big economic companies .
These alternative resources are the energy of the wind , the sun and the warmness of the earth .
It 's very impotant to give attencion to these differents solutions , because one day , and mostly my generation , we will have the dury to change our point of view .
