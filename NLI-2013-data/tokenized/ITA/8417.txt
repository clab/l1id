I completly agree with the sentence .
I 'm a student and I think that is more important to understand all the concepts and all ideas .
Basing on my experience I think that is more important understand all the ideas and all the concepts of a topic or of a lecture .
In my opinion if something is over your head it is important ask a questions , to understand anything .

A mounth ago , i was in an antropology class and my professor was discuss a topic .
This topic was over my head and i did n't understand nothing .
At home I studied my notes and at the next lessons I asked to my professor to explain me the point that i was n't understand .

I think that , in the university world , there are a different way to ask something to a professor .
In my university all students can contact their professor by e-mail , by phone or apply for an appointment .

Another thing that is very important for my experince is understand the reason of wich i study something .
In all the lectures of the university professors these professor must explain all the reason of wich the students study the topics of the lectures .

In a Human factor Design course my professor say that we wil study antrophometry , human behaviour , human computer interaction and human machine interaction .
So we will be able to use the information of these sciences to design a good object , good space and good buildings .

I think that is more important study anithigs .
I think that is more important ask if we do n't understand something .
We can use e-mail , phone and all the tecnology that we know .
Also I think that is more important understand why we are going to study something .
