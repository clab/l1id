In my opinion in twenty years a lot of things may change .
As regards the cars I think that since one of the major problem today is the pollution produced by cars maybe in the futureb cars will be fewer .
there has been a lot of conferences about this probem , in these years .
I do not believe that in twenty years there will be cars with a different kind of carburant , able to respect the nature , because maybe that special cars will go too slow and the people would not buy them .
In my personal opi that is more probable a solution could be cars that does not destroy the natural ambient it will not happen and it would bo too expensive .
but I think that in 20 years I think also that in the future , for the increasingly amount of the population the traffic will be a real obstacle for workers , it will become easiers for everybody to take a plane .
The planes will be less expensive and they will go more and more fasters .
Thanks to technology a lot of new future machines , a part from the plane , will be discovers , so the cars will be abandoned .
since the life in the 2006 is caracterized by the fact that nobady has time enough , oll the everyday situations are becoming faster and faster so people in 20 years will `` run '' for all the day .
for this reason a car is not sufficent .
If i think about the world in the 2026 I can see a sky full of planes and air structures , and no cars at all .
maybe everyman will have his own personal plane and the cars will be considers as an old nice object for aa art collection for exemple ..
