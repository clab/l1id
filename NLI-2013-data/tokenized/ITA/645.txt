i disagree with the following statement because i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject .
in my opinion there is a lot of advantages because you can do some jobs better than other and also you can know all about a specific subject .
the first point that i 'd like to make is that if you are specialized in one specific subject , you could work better than other , who has broad knowledge of a lot of things .

it is important because you could find work easier than other .
also you could solve a lot of problems for examples in your office or in the factory where you work .
another fundamental aspects is that you can know all about it , i think that in this way you can achive high results and you can answer all questions about it .

on the other hand you do n't have knowledge of all other academic subjects , but it does n't matter because i think i will do only a specific work during my life .

i know people who get good grades in only one subjects and they know a lot of details about it , so in my opinion they can do all about it without problems .

this is simply fantastic .
in fact some artists , for example musicians , have skills only in what they do and it allows to achieve success and to improve themself better than other .
