Is not easy in this case to completely agree or disagree with this statement .
Reason being that ideas and concept cannot prescind from understanding of facts .
A fact is something that is happened , while a concept is the reason why it happened .
These two things have to go together for an individual to be able to catch the complete essence of things .

For me , what this statement says , is that what happened in the past can easily be ignored , that facts , what truly happened before , play little or no importance in a student 's learning experience .

Every History teacher will scream when hearing such an opinion .
In many cases , facts can teach a lot more than concepts .
Just think about our whole story , the story of mankind , and the big crime we would commit when ignoring what man did before us .
You can study about culture and philosophy , about religion and mathematics , but you will never completely understand about yourself and the others until you 've learned about what has already happened and what has already been done .

The concept of genocyde can be explained with hundreds of words , but will never be fully understood until what happened has been studied and observed through documents and videos .
So the concept of , to give a contrasting example , driving a car can be explained with loads of words and ideas .
But only when it comes to actually show what happens if you take a certain action you can fully understand about driving .

At the other side , I must say that without a complete understanding of basic concepts , it is impossible to study proficiently any subject .
Whatewer will be shown to you , always needed will be a clear concept that explains the meaning of what you see .

A major difference between an Italian University and an American one is in the different learning method : while in the Italian institution fundamental is the necessity of remembering word by word what is explained in the books , without any practical application , in the American method this study is accompanied by an active class discussion and group participation .
The first method will obviously bring every student to memorize the concepts studied , but sometimes without even understanding them , while with application and confrontation in the class , basic understanding of the concepts is needed to constructively participate and learn .

Without concepts , there is no understanding of facts ; without facts there is no `` real '' understanding of concepts .
The two things must go together .
