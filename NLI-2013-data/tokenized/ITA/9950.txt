Success is a very common word that people use very frequently to express their ambitions .
It is probably the best goal someone may have and it can be reached in every field , but how ?

The main element needed to have success is studying .
Studying will always bring somewhere better than where you are now and this is another great goal to which you should always aim at in your life .

Another fundamental factor is risk .
Risk is not a very common word , because when it is used , it usually represents a very difficult and intense situation .
Apart from businessmen , people do n't like very much to pronounce this word .
As a matter of fact , it is mainly used in business discussions .

In economics , risk is what leads to success .
For instance in stock exchanges , no one who has n't ever risked is successful , and never will be .
In business , you are compelled to gamble on tons and tons of factors that will determine the way through of your day and consequently of your life earnings .

There is a great motto that states the importance of this curious behaviuour : `` No risks , no earns ! ''
It is a hundred percent correct and it illustrates very exaustively what people 's behaviour should be like .
Yes , because risks are not to take only in business fields .

Risks are at the basis of worhty living , morally and economically speaking .
If this behaviour occurs , people would not do what they already do well , but they would improve .
Improving implies some risks initially , but paradoxally in the end , it always brings you to riduce risks and gables on your life .

So in conclusion a key advice to be given is : `` Always improve , because in life there is always more to learn about and more to risk on . ''
