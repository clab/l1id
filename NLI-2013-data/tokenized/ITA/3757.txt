In these years there are less partecipation from the young people to help their communities .
I am one of the young people nowadays and I agree that young people take care a very short time to helping their communities , but I understand also the reasons because they do it .

The first reason is that with this new global world with a lot of videogames , football or music programs , bring the young people to spent a very long time to play videogames , or to play some sport , instead of to help their communities .

A second reason is that the information about communities in all town is very small and much of young people do n't know what is it a communitie .
Therefore , young people do n't give time to helping communities because they do n't know the existence of these communities .

A last reason is that in these years life is very fast and if young people study sever hours every day for the school and in free time they play a sport to relax them , they have no time to help their communities .

From these reasons is clear my opinion .
I agree that young people spent no time to help their communities and spent a lot of time in different and useles things .
But I am also a young people and I understand their behaviour , because they live in a very fast world with many television and videogames and if they study much of their free time , like me , they ca n't give enough time to helping their communities .
However , if they have a lot of free time they should to help their communities because is a very good way to spent their time .
