A broad knowledge is very important in human being because it permits to have a general background off many things that involve our life .
In my opinion a broad knowledge should be the first thing that we have to reach .
After this , we can specialize in the specific subjet that we prefer .
I also think that we ca n't choose our way without knowing several subjects , because it is very difficult to know what we like whitout trying it .

This is also the way that the school is organized .
During our first years of school we study general themes such as history , literature , mathematics etc. that give us a wide formation .
When we continue our studies we more and more specialize in a subject .
In fact at university there are a lot of specific subjects and lack of general ones .

I think that this is well done because today the jobs are very specialized and industry for example need specialized people to reach some important projects .
I can give an example of my university : I study engineering and in I saw that a project always involves a lot of aspects of studying , so it 's very important Another important point is that today 's work is often organized in teams composed by various specialized people .
These teams can surely do something more because anyone gives his better qualitys .

But we can forget that the general things learnt in first years of school form us like men outside the job .
A general known is important in everyday life .
In conclusion I think that is very important have a broad knowledge of many acadenic subjects but this have to be the start point for specialize in what we love .
And first of all we always have to remember that we will never finish to learn !
