For my personal experience , I do n't agree with the statement : I think that understand ideas and learn facts have the same importance .
I study engeneering at the university and in this environment I have learned that understand concepts make you able to apply their one to different problems ; nevertheless if you practise what have you learned , you may fix in your mind the true mean of you have only read in a book : the two things have to go with the same step .

In life , in general , I have the same point of view : I think experience is all , thereby concepts and practise imply one inside the other one .
I want say that someone may learn ideas by facts , or facts by ideas , but it is most important make experiences , so one person have to improve his/her couriosity toward life at the same way with the two instruments ( ideas and facts ) .
