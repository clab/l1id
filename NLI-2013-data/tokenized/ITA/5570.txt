Most advertisements make products better than they really are is a strong statement that gives quite a pessimistic view on marketing in general .
Different companies uses advertise products in different ways some of which may seem illecit , subliminal messages , but the purpose of advertisements is not always to illustrate the quality of a product , but it 's importance in our daily life .

It is in the companies greatest interest to glorify their products , but it is also in their interest to make sure that the product actually works .
It is obvious that an advertised product will work better then the actual product because there are factors affecting the product that may cause malfunctionings .
The way an advertise is made , the components of the product and the users cautiond about the product will give different results on the functioning of the product .

Advertisements are done in many ways : writing , visually , subcontiously , and on a auditory level .
Visual advertisements are presented to us by video and fotografical commercials in which the product is in its best conditions , it is new and a times is presented as a digital object something unreal , basically a drawing .
Advertising through wtiring may be risky in that the opinions may differ .
On a subconsciouse level we will accept the commercial itself and find it great so it is us that find advertisements better than the product .

Again the conditions of a product on an advertisement are perfect while one might find malfunctions in the product as it may have been dameged by time , transport and our misuse of it .
All components of the product are key factors in the functioning of the product a new product will always be better than an old one .

Man error is a major cause in one agreement in the statement .
What our brain makes us believe may differ what we experience and believe .
Concluding , it is not the advertisement that makes product look better but it our way of thinking that prevents us from seeing the true reasons why advertised products are better than owned products .
