I do n't think that learning facts is less important than understanding ideas or concepts : both are demanding skills of our society and are useful in different situations .
There are situations that require the ability of understanding ideas like those in which a student is asked to solve a new problem .
But there are also situations like a scientist in a laboratory where either he knows how the chemical reaction is being evolving or he risks serious damages .
In other words , sometimes it is essential to know facts .

We can capture another aspect If when comparing this two activities we argue that learning is not so expensive like understanding .
I do n't believe that .
For some people it is very difficult to keep in mind even a telephone number , so I think that the cost of learning may vary from one individual to another .

In conclusion it depends from the situation .
Mathematicians are notably asked to understanding ideas , but are we sure that they also do n't learn facts ?
No .
