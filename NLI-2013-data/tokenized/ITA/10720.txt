I am agree with this statement because the successful people try new things and take risks than only doing what they already know how to do well .
To support this idea i will use some simple examples and other simple reasons .

For example i think that every professor of the most important universities in Europe and United States are good ( it is a reasonable assumption for me !!! ) , clever and are able to do well their job , but only few of these can become famous in the world winning the Nobel !
Who wins this , wins because his study or his research is revolutionary and very important .
To be revolutionary you have to study something new and you have to take risks .

Another example is that many persons can play a musical instrument , but only very few people become famous and remembered in the history of music , thanks to their innovative style of their music .

From this two simple examples it is easy to see that a lot of persons are able to do well something , but the successful persons study or create something innovative and just for this they take risks .
Many times the research of succes does not go well and you can lose time and other things , but for me , taking the risks , it is the price that you have to pay if you want to try to have succes .
