I agree with this sentence , because if I do only the things that I know to do well , i do n't understand nothing of new , and I never grow up .
In my personal experience , I took a very hard carreer for me .
In fact , study is not my passion , but I think that today , in the world , and in particular in Italy , the success of a person begin with a high level carreer of study .
In this way I began seven years ago a university 's course of mechanical engineering .
I found very much difficult during these years , but searching to pass these problems I become stronger than when I began the university .

But the risk in the life is to be too happy for the things obtained , and to think `` to be arrived '' , and conseguently do n't see the world around us .
I think that is important to never `` seat down '' , and continue to do things that we do not well , in the way to understand alwais new thing and to make a better person to themselves .
