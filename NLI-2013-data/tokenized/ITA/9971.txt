I think that succesfull people always try new things and take risks .
As a matter of fact everybody can do what he already knows .
It is very easy repeating something many times , it is like to copy ; but every man is able to copy .
And how can something that everybody can do getting you to be a succesfull people ?
I think the answer is that it ca n't .

Moreover nothing can be done radically better whitout making a change .
Without changement there could not be innovation and improvement .
I think it is the same in the human condition : a person will always remain in the same condition without trying new things .
That is not a characteristic of sussesfull people that , instead , always try to improve their condition .

Naturally taking risks is not a synonimous of having succex .
Someone succed in improve his condition , on the other hand another man fail .
But to become a succesfull man it is necessary to try .
However this imprevedibily is another point in favour of my theory .

If try new things would get automatically to a succex condition , why some man do not try them ?
The answer is simple : there is the risk to fail .
Fail means get you in a worse condition .
And only a few man can risk to become in a worse condition .
So only few man become succefull people .

In conclusion only try new things can change man condition .
It could become better or not .
Changing it in a better way means improve your condition and improve your condition makes you a succefull man .
