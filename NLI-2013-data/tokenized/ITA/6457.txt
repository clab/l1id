This problem is wider than it appears .
In fact , it has to do with a very complex reality , in which several aspects convey .
Surely , and I strongly believe in this : in future there will be fewer cars than there are today , and I am sure of this for several reasons .
During these years , energetic problems are growing more and more .
Fuel is becoming , every day , a treasure .
Surely , this problem has to do with other parts of our reality , but it 's evident that energetic problems are on the base of using a car .

Another aspect , for which I am sure cars will disappear , can be sumed with one only word : `` pollution '' .
Cars produce very dangerous solutions of gas and vapour , that can strongly damage the health of men and animals .
It is demonstrated the the pollution in a town is produced in great part by cars , and it is the first reason for cancers and other type of illness .
The last reasons , that I use to demonstrate my thesis , have to do with the spirit of the people , and with what I see every day .
People have understood that , sometimes , if we take a car to go to do something ...
well we are very stupid , because we can do it going by bicycle or on foot , and using a car is not the best because , in any case , you have to park it .

When I told `` what I see every day '' I was intending this : I go to Milano every single day of my life , I take a train , a metro , and a bus ; I live far from my university .
I see lots of people who do not use the car because they cannot for money , or simply because they 've understood that it 's not the best to drive in a city .

Ending my work , I sume everything , simply , saying that not only cars will be fewer and fewer , but they will disappear , because polluition , economic conditions and social reasons are doing it .
