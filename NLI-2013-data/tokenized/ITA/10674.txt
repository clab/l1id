I agree with the statement that says : `` succesfull peaple try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' for more different things :
At first , if you do n't try to do something different from what you already know how to do you are not able to change you 're condition of life .
For exemple , if the men never try do somethin new or better than before , the civilitation never go on or change .
We ca n't image how could be our life if peaple like Leonardo da Vinci , Volta , Newton , Einstain and a lot of other peaple like them never tryed to find something differt from what they already knew .

All the scientific resource are based on this way of think , try to find something better from what still exist .
for exemple we need to find new medicine for make the life better .
In 2020 we hope that the expectation of life become higher , and it will be only for medicine and doctors who are searching new medicines .

Also in the personal financial meaning take risks is very important , because if you do what you already know how to do , probably like other peaple , you can earn enouth money for live , but you will never be rich .
for exemple , if Bill Gates never tryed find a new way for use the computer , now he could n't be who he is , and also all the peaple who use the computer have to say thanks to him .

Another important point is that a men , for live an happy life , have to change something sometimes , if he does n't do that , his life will be so boring .
