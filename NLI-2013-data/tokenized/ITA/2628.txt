There are some reasons to believe that yuong people enjoy life more than older people do but , personally , i think that nowadays it is n't so .
In my opinion yuong people want to enjoy their life but they want a lot of things and resoult is that they do n't fell happy never .
On the other hand old people , actually not very older , have a good experience to enjoy their life whit a lot of things .
I believe this because they have a lot of possibility , such as more free time than yuong people and more money .
I think that in this society money is very important for everythings because this helps yuo to enjoy yuor life .
For example yuo can go on holiday where yuo want .
Instead young people ca n't because they need an allow of parents and they must go to scholl .
So they ca n't go on holiday where they want .

Also this topic depend on the bheviour of people because there are a lot of different character .
In my experience i 'm sure that my life is more interesting today than when i was very yuong .
I feel this because i have a life experience that helps me to grow up better .
When i was teenagers i had problems that now i fell stupid .
For this reason i could n't enjoy my life in the past , but now it is all different .
I enjoy my life whit my friends , for example to go dinner togheter or to go dancing .
I prefer simple situation because to enjoy my life i don-t need a lot but only my friends .

uin conclusion , i think that it is important for the life that everybody fells well and consequently yuo can enyoj your life every day better .
