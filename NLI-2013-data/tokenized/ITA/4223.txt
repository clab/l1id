In this period a lot of young people have n't a lot of time for help his communities ; if every person go out for walk can see that the new generation do n't have an intresting to the comunity .

I think we can help the comunity with a very simple action every day when we make a foot over our house .
I can divided the category express in the question into two another part : the young people tha go to a primary school , and the people that go to the university .

I do this division because the person that are insert in this two categorys have only a little different of age but have a bigger different of think .

The young person who frequented the university have a responsability of all the elements that are situated aroun you but the another division hav n't any type of respect in reguard of the person and the object .

This young peolpe have little time for helping the comunity because they spend a lot of time for themselfe , for buy a lot of object that can make better his aspect an his realtion with the member of the group in wich pass a lot of time during the day .

I do n't say that in every moment every peolple must do something for the comunity but I think that is most important have a respect of all the elements that are located around us .

It 's strange look in my town a lot of old person that do a lot of activity for make better the comunity or the town .
For me is better see the young peolpe do that , because certanly they can make it more fast .

I think that the young peoplehave the necessary time for helping their comunity but they prefer spend it for another activity tha make better themself .
In conclusion say that it 's most important help the comunity because the old person have create the comunity were we live , and us must do the same for created a better comunity for the future were our children can live .
