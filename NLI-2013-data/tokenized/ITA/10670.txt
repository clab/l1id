Successful people try new things because they have the preparations and the intelligences for create a new project .
Without the culture is impossible to create a new things .
I study design , my job will be create a new things or object or forniture , i want to became a designer .
But is't too difficult starting job because is a new profession and the knoledge do n't prepare to the world of job .
There are many designer that have create a new project really interested and innovative , but it ' s very difficult .
For example Philippe Stark is one of the great designer in the world , his project are different and comprendono all of things , a theetbrush , a chair , a light ...
I study him project and other project for understand the idea that have genereted the final object .
To understand the process it 's for me a important passage to make a designer .
I go in university and i study for many lessons how to project but only the experience can make able to create a new object .
I have made a project for a new table , or a kitchen .
I have started to a problem or da un bisogno , the goal is to create a project that answre the question .
i think that the culture and the university it 's a good started and important way to approch at the world of succses , but only the experiences and the job wants to make a designer .
I hope that my way to appoch at the problem became a good way to arrive at the succes .
