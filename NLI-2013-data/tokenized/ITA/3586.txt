Although it must be said that there are young people who do n't care about their community , I think that , in general , new generations are keen on helping their towns and do it in a variety of ways .

There are many young boys and girls who spend a lot of their time working for the poor and the disadvantaged .
For example , in my country there are several associations that recruit personnel to drive ambulances and one of my best friends , who has a very demanding and time-consuming job , works there without compensation at least once a week .

Another friend of mine spends every Sunday serving meals to poor people in a church , and he often tells me that performing this service for the benefit of his community is very rewarding for him .

But there are also other ways to help people ; skilled professionals can be of great help in certain areas .
A classmate of mine , who graduated from a medical school , is now part of an association called `` Doctors without boundaries '' that sends doctors around the world to help poor communities in less developed countries .

She was sent to Africa and provided medical assistance to many people .
I think that a person like her is a clear sign that young people are willing to help the others and therefore can be relied upon to become active members of our communities .

In fact , if a young doctor is willing to help people in a remote country , one can be sure that she will be much more keen on contributing to the well being of her community .

As for myself , I try to get involved in pro bono activities , too .
Since I am a lawyer , I was able to spend the past two years assisting poor clients who were involved in various kinds of litigations without charging them .
So , the examples I see around me are , in my opinion , eloquent signs that younger generations are not less willing to help others in their communities than older ones .
