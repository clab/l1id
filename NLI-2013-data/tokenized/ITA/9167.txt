I agree with this statement , because the main point of a student perspective is to get the principals how things works , so that the student is able to understand the ideas behind the concept , and can explanation why .
That will encourage them to continue developing on that matter .
To understand the concepts also plays an particular role .

If you want to analyse somethink you need a concept , a kind of roadmap to do it , if you want to create or develop innovative products you also have to follow a determined concept .

From my point of view , this are the keyfactors in getting better and creating safety and better product and that is exactly what you future imployer require afterwards from you .

In comparison with the thesis that it is more important to learn facts , if you learn facts , you can mention thinks related to a specific topic , but you are not able to explain them .
In different cases it can be helpfull to know facts , but the more impotant is to know how you can find the information , we have a very good posibility to do that about the greatest information source , the Internet .

So i come to the conclusion that the more important tool is to understand ideas and concepts , this can be a great help for further investigations and the first step to be innovative to create something new , if you need facts to that issue , you will be able to read it in a book
