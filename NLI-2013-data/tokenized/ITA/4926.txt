Buying or being sure of a product has become a very hard `` homework '' , in fact it offen appens that the pruducts that we choose are not so thrustable as they are supposed to be .
The problem , in my opinion , is the large role of money in our society , there are few very power companies that own the pruducts'mark .
Their strongness reflects itsself on all the means used to promote more a product than another .
They produce a lot of publicity and convincing tattics throght newspapers , televion , stands and so on ; that , in any way , influences the taste of the listeners .
`` Normal '' people think to feel surer on a product according to how much this product is known or broadcasted .

There are so many examples to say that this topic is complitely wrong , we have too many times heard about big companies scandales and sometimes about the collapse of one of them , but thought that , people seem not to change their ideas .
We are too involved in the society , where we live , not to can make good distinctions on what this society offers to us .

I could suggest the people , that are going to buying something , to be able to decide without outher conditionments , they must prove a product and decide if it 's a good product .

This choise is difficult to make because of our unawareness of being influenced by everything around us .
People are offen afraid if a product is not very common , they compare themselves to the other and that , I think , it 's the main mistake , we have to decide for ourselves , we have to listen to what the other say with an accurate distancy , that let us to take our own decisions .
I think , that 's one good solution not to fall into missunderstandings that everyday are around u
