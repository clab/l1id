First of all we have to define what a successful person is .
In my opinion a successful person is a person who is able to find his perfect role in the society within he lives .
That is , his work and his family According to this definition , it sounds quite logical that a person has to try different roles before settle down and stop searching .
Infact successful people are usually open minded and ready to try different experiences , because the convinction that who dares , wins is really strong , although you should always think about what you 're getting involved in .
If a person is not satisfied of his job , he can carry it on without any satisfaction or try another one .
Sure it sounds like a bet , but the choice of change can radically modify his life , and above all at the and he could say : I 've tried it .

A clear example of this theory can be found in a Casino .
Infact a player must always bet great amounts of money to win a lot .
That 's the risk .
But if the most important target of the player is to get rich , than he has no choice : he 's to bet , and if he wins he 's a successfull person because he has reached his purpose .

Nowadays our society is printed with this convinction because after second world war people didnt'have anything , and so they had to bet on something to get rich .
Here in Italy this convinction is really strong .

The self made man is always admired and respected everywhere .
For example the rapper 50 cent gave the title `` Get rich or die tryin ''' to his first record .
He made a bet , investing all his money on himself and his voice .
No doubt that it has been a won bet .

Sure the other side of the coin is really strong , because if you fail , noone will admire you : on the contrary , you 'll be judged as a failure .
But if someone wants to success , he 's to dare .
The much you dare , the much you 'll success .
