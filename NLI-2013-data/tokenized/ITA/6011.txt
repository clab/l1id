For me the problem is not the title of this question but the problem is because in the future there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ?
for me for answering at this question we looked at the past infact for a lot of years we produced pollution and now the enviroment is destruction .
The water is polluted , the woods are destroyed , in the atmosfphere there are a lot of type of chemical elements and there are n't a lot of ice on the mountain .
the temperature on earth is increased a very spped and if we will to left on this planet for a lot of years now we starts to controlled and save the enviroment for example making a lot of natural reserved on the land an under the see because if the healt of uor planet is n't good we will not life amoung on this Earth .
For this question now we think at the metod for save our future life .
For example when we watching TV or listening the radio or writing at the PC we use the electryc current but for produce this we fire the petroil or fire the gas or oil or we break the natural skyline of the mountain with electryc central .
And when we actuatted that procediment we produce polluted and we break the natural ecosystem and we increase the anidride ccarbonica in the atmosphere and the consequence is very dangerous for our life and for animals life .
For eliminated this problem we can produce current to another method for example with sun-panel or with system to convert strong of wind in current .
That methods are n't produce pollution and are n't destroyed the enviroment but they are more expensive and in this world for the politician the money are the first interesting .
I'will not made in the future and I do n't know if in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today but I know if we do n't today at the future for our the future will'not be good .
