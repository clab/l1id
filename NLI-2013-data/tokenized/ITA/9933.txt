The issue at hand is whether or not is necessary to take risks to succeed in life .
I think this is a very important issue because it has to do with our personal behaviour and most of all with the way everybody looks at life in general .
I am convinced that the only way to have success is to take risks and to try to walk roads that nobody walked before .

My first reason to support my thought is my own experience .
When I finished the University in Florence , I decided to come to Mexico because I was convinced that I would have greater opportunities to realize my dreams than if I had remained in Italy .
I took the risk to go to a new country but today I can say that it worths .

Another reason why I think risk is strictly correlated to success is because I am convinced that all the ways that take you to success must be difficult .
As much your dream is bigger as much it will be more difficult to realize .
But difficulty naturally implies risk , because without taking any risk things are much easier to realize , but also they give you less success .

Of course not everybody likes to take risks .
As I mentioned before it depends on our personal behaviour .
On one hand there are some people that enjoy life without taking any risks , following a routine that they already know very well .
On the other hand there are some people that look at life as a continous change , as taking risks all the time .
I think I belong to the second group of people as I get bored very easy when I am doing the same things .

For all these reasons I conclude that people who think of success as the main goal of their lifes , must take risks and trying new things as many times as they can .
The bigger the risk , the greater the success .
