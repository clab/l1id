In today 's world , a successful individual is someone that has achieved a goal in his life , who 's happy with what he has accomplished , with what he owns and has reached a high level of well-being .
Everything seams perfect , but this also raises a question : Can a successful person desire more to what he already has ?
Will he try to have new experiences and take risks ?
I believe there can be two answers to this question .

First of all I must agree with the statement that a successful man is going to search for new accomplishments and experiences because otherwise his existence becomes meaningless , and his journey through life would become repetitive and boring .
A person eventually adapts to what he owns and to the situation that he lives in and is suddenly going to expect new things to occur , and wish for new events .
I believe it 's in the nature of man to desire new things , a man is always trying to satisfy his desires and when they are indeed satisfied , he 'll have new desires .
It 's a cycle .

However I can also disagree with the previous statement because trying new things and taking risks depends also a lot on the individual 's character .
I believe a man has to be confident with himself and his abilities if he wants to try new adventures .
He has to be courageous and responsible to take risks .

In conclusion i both agree and disagree with the idea that successful people try new things and take risks .
