Everyone during his lifetime has to `` face youth '' .
Many people thinks that during this life period one lives the best moments ever .
It is difficult to give an opinion , but I think that in most cases it is true : young people enjoy life more than older people do .

First of all one has to think about the great freedom that a young person has .
When you are young ( I am thinking about teenagers and people around 20 years old ) you often have `` many rights '' and not so many obligations .
Let 's think about the freetime and the money : a young person can spend his freetime and his money how he wants to .
He does n't have to mantain a family or pay for the house 's rental .
So he can spend his money to get the more fun he can .
An older person , instead , has to take care of his family , spend money for the house , the car and many other stuffs that are necessary .

Second : to work is often more boring than to study .
When one goes to school or to the university he learns everyday something new : this is funny .
Instead a worker in his job often has to `` repeat '' the same actions .

There is also another important thing to be considered .
A young person usually looks with more happiness to his life than an older one .
A young person has much more time to live than an older one : a young person is able to make projects for his future and he is able to change them very often .
This is not easily possible for and old person .

For last .
A young person lives many of his everyday experiences as `` first time experiences '' .
The first time one lives a situation usually is the one which gives him more feelings , sensations .
Something that for an older person could be `` usual '' ; maybe for a young person is not .
Let 's think about the first love , for example .

Of course there are many benefits of being old ( you have experience , you know `` how to live '' ) but I think that the most beautiful part of our lifetime is youth .
