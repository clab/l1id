Unfortunately i agree with the statement because young people are not effectively so much helpful with their communities .
Actually the most of young people think that if you do something in order to help your community , such as going for a walk with elder people , you are not considered normal .

The conception of normality is not useful in this case .
In fact while it should be considered normal if you give an hand to person who need it , you are defined as normal only if you show that your not interested in actions like these which are more significant than doing only the things that you want to do for yourself .
The problem is that most of young people have an individualistic way to live their life .

They do not think that it is possible to share time between fun and helpful actions .
Personally i have not met many helpful people so far but one of this is my girlfriend .
She decided to work as a volunteer in order to help people that cannot do every day actions because of their age or their disabilities .
She goes each day to the same person .
For this reason she has also built up good relationships with them and she assured me that it is an experience that she never felt in her life and it is not boring as most of the people think .
They can transmit to you their volunty to live as they did when they were young .

In the past i also thought to wirk as a volunteer during a few hours per week , but now i am attending the second year at Bocconi University and i faced some difficulties to share my time between the school and this possibility .

For this reason i hope i will be more helpful for my community in the future than i am now .
