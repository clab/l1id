Travelling in a group rather than alone is most of the time a difficult decision to take and it involves many personal and external factors : the place you intend to visit , your social preferences , your tolerance for being with other people for long lapses of time , the type of people that will come along for this long trip ...
and many others .

I do agree that travelling in a group led by a guide is a good experience in most circumstances .
When I intend to visit a large city , an historical site or a country of which I do not speak the language , being led by an experienced guide and togheter with some travelling friends is essential for me .

I have the opportunity to learn more about the culture of the city or the country that I am visiting , while discovering pleasures ( i.e. nice restaurants or nice locations ) that I probably could not find with my little written guide .
For example , when I was in Montreal with my husband we dragged our friends to a `` not pricy and excellent : '' restaurant following directions of our useful little guide .
Surely the food was good , but the not pricy part needed to be discussed ( and our friends offered to pay prior to seing the bill ) .

In visiting historical places the role of a guide is even more important .
Living in Venice for many years , I have always been impressed by the amount of information I did n't know about the local churches , and , despite being a local , I enjoyed to join guided groups while walking through the churches .

Even when travelling in remote places , being in a `` protected '' group with a guide that is able to help you with the essential needs is wise .
My aunt was in Mongolia for 3 weeks , living with nomades in a tent and drinking acidic milk with all her travelling companions , and , once back , she assured me that she would not repeat the same trip without a guide .

Sometimes however travelling in a group may be frustrating .
It requires conciliating needs and desires of different people , while tolerating organizational and travelling issues .
Probably a good travelling `` social '' attitude is the best way to face any trip and to enjoy a good guided trip .
And , as a last point , having a good guide makes all the difference !
