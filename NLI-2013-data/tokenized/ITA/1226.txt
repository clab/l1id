I 've lived all my life in a scholar system that gave students a broad knowledge of many academic subjects only in elementary and medium school .
Then , when students are 13 years old , they have to choose a quite specific area that interest them .

So I can believe that this is the best way of learning , and so this system , ho give people a perfect mix of general knoledge , and specific knoledge is very useful for future life and work .

In fact , in this set of scholar system , all students have a basic knowledge of every subjects , and then they can choose the most interesting subjects to specialize themselves .
When students finish the basic courses , they have to make a first step for their career : choosing their superior school .
Superior school are different in their main area of interest .
This area make students free to choose the subjects that they prefere , however going on depeening the basic subjects studied in the past schools .
This areas are very useful for university , because if you think you will be an architect , you choose a school that have as most importants subjects design , and math .
So with the superiors schools , and then with university , knoledge could be specializated in one specific subject .
I think that this is the right way to learn , because for having a good career , you need to be very prepared in your own subject , but it is also quite important to show that you have also a general culture of other subjects .

In conclusion I think that it 's very important to have a general knowledge about many subjects , that composes the general culture of a person .
But I think also that is very important to have a specific knowledge on the subject needed by future work .
This is because a deep knowledge is usefull for succeding in a good career and to demonstrate being able to do your own work .
