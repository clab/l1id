nowadays people have to struggle to become someone , there is competition since the first years of school .
if you want to become an important person you have always to take risks : if you have a good idea , that you think will be a succesful one , you have to develop it and to accept the probability to loose everithing .

the greatest sportsmen ca n't do only what they already know but have to constantly improve their skills : for example a motogp rider during the weekend before the grand prix tries to develop his bike testing different solutions but he hasto choose only one .
This is a risk : if he has taken the best decision he could win , othrwise he will loose .

Also at school if you have no time to study everithing for an exam you have to risk choosing the principal information that will be problably asked .
Everithing depends on the questions : the exam will be a success or a failure , but it 's far better try the exam .
