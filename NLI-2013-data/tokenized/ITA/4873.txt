We live in an era where money is the most important thing for many people .
The sellers of the products and the industries do n't care about the quality of the products , they only want to make a lot of money fast .
A good way to make a lot of money fast are good advertisements .
They show pics of products or say things about the product that are not real .
But often this advertisements make seem products much better than they really are .
A lot of food industries show pics of products that are complitely different from the real products .
McDonalds for example shows on their advertisements not the products how they really are .
You can see on their advertisements very big hamburgers with fresh bread and lot of ketchup .
But in real they are different , they are not so big and the bread is not so fresh .
On the pictures they are showing other hamburgers that you become in the fast food .
It 's only a fake .

An other example are the cigarettes advertisements .
For example the Marlboro advertisements .
You can see a sane , handsome cowboy on a horse .
It seems that Marlboro cigarettes are a good thing , but in reality they are leading to a lot of diseas .

If think it should be a regolamentation about the advertisements .
That you can not say things about your product that do n't correspond to the reality , and that you can not show pictures that make appear the product better than it is .
If somebody shows fake pictures of the products they should pay a fee .
I think the industries should better concentrate on the quality of the products .
They should better use the money for increase the quality of the food and to make food that is better for our health .
