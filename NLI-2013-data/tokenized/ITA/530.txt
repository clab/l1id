First of all , it should be made clear what we intend with broad knowledge and specific knowledge of subjects .
If for broad knowledge we imagine the situation of a student that attends spare courses on random subjects like in Sociolgy and Mathematics or in Anatomy and Mass Communicationb whilst for specific knowledge a student that takes courses focused in Social studies , limiting the extension of his study only to courses that are strictly related like Sociology and Antropology , i think i would prefer to have a specific knowledge .
The reason is that a superficial overview on different subjects can result extremely fragmented and scattered and it can bring the person to be unsure and uncomfortable with all the topics .
Moreover , without following any structure , the student can be lost in the vagueness and wide-spread extension of knowledge , he could wander from one field to another without catching a concrete point .
Therefore , i would rather agree more to a specific approach on learning knowledge .
A specific approach focuses the attention of the student only to some aspects of knowledge .
This gives to the student confidence with the topic and the skill to treat and work out news insights .

Nevertheless , if for `` broad knowledge '' we intend a structure of courses that follows a project that goes in and out from different sciences , i think i will prefer better a broad knowledge .
I would explain this idea with an example of a field that is highly related and interconnected with different branches of knoweldge : cognitive science .
The aim of cognitive science is to discover the functioning of the brain .
In order to do this the only knowledge brought by Neuroscience will not be enough .
It needs supports from many other disciplines very different in respect with each others .

Thus , sometime broad knowledge is necessary to have a better glance over topics that are too much complex and that cannot be treated with a specific and focused background .
