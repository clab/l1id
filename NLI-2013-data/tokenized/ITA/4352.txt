Nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities because they are more thing to do .

I think that young people likely would help their communities but they have not the time for do it .
An example I go at university everyday when to back go at home I study , eat , sleep and i have not the time to talk with my friends .
I have not time to talk with my friend and I do n't help the people more near to me for this reason I can not help my communities .

I think that many people like me have same problem because nowadays in the life there are more stress than in the past .
I do n't think that one person do n't help her-his communities If he/she can do it .
Today we think only at to work because in this society is the best opportunity for to have much money and to have in this way a good life .
In the past , pheraps , there is not the stress that there is nowadays .
I know that this a incorrect behavior but I want to think about me before of to think to helping my communities .

However when I can give enough to helping my communities I do n't have problem do it .
Infact in my life I helped many people also because I work without to earn money in the hospital however when I had more free time while now with the university I have not time .

In my opinion this problem is only problem about the time , the fast to live and other problem of this type but no for choise .
