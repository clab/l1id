I believe that young people have the possibility to enjoy life much more than older ones .
Youngs usually have few phisycal constraints and see death and diseases much further than they actually are .
Old people additionally have the disadvantages of living in a world that has changed much since their time .

One reason I think that people have higher opportunities of enjoying their lives when they are younger is that they are healthy and strong .
They can live freely without worries for the future : they can try exciting sports like bunjee jumping or rock climbing .
Instead old men and women have to spend much of their time ( and money ) in visits at the doctor 's .
Many diseases related to elderly requires the use of drugs and medicines they would not be able to live without .
While youngs have no time to spend thinking about risks , the old men and women are often not even independent : they need somebody 's assistance .

Secondly the old people are living in an environment they are not even able to recognize !
The world changes so fast that grandfathers and grandmothers are unable to understand the social behaviours of their grandchildren .
I 've often tried to explain my grandmother the reason I do n't want to get married , but she just ca n't understand it !
Another aspect of this can be observed when comparing the number of old people who are able to use a computer with the number of electronic games sold to even some very young children .

Morever I truly believe that the most stimulating part of one 's life is the university time .
It is the period of my lifetime where I 'm increasing mostly the size of my knowledge and experience .
Everyday I meet new persons and I have the possibility to find many very interesting .
For example some professors are so wise that just the possibility to talk with them five minutes is a great chance .
Not many places are as precious as universities .

Thus I am sure that people can enjoy life more and better when they are young than when they are old .
I do n't think having a longer life is a good bargain : there is no point in leaving 100 years if the second half of it has to be passed on a bed or a chair dreaming about the past time or asking somebody to turn on the television .
