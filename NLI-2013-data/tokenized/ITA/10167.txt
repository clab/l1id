The statement declare that successful people take risks instead of only doing what they know to do well .
I partly agree with the statement above .
I believe , in fact , that to define a person as successful is a difficult purpose .
Apart from this personal belief , success can be defined as a situation where a person reaches a wealthy way of life .
In this case , I believe the statement present some weaknesses .
To reach success people needs to take risks although there are some other qualities and factors that needs to be mentioned .
A person to be successful needs to be lucky in life and healthy .

People that take risks are usually brave and curious , I strongly believe this two qualities are fondamental to reach a successful situation in the professional life as well as in the private life .

On the other side , there are many other factors and components that interfer in life .
For example people need to be helped by the fortune .
I strongly believe that , in most of the cases , taking risks is not the only component that define a successful situation .

A second factor that needs to be mention is the factor of health .
A successful profile , usually , is based on a stable personal situation .
For this reason , I believe someone that have an healty life have a big chance to reach a high level of success .

In conclusion , I do not agree with the statement above .
Eventhough I consider taking risks an advantage for people to be successful , I trust that a stable profile has , in the same way , a full range of possibilities to reach happyness in life .

To sum up , there are too many components that one person needs to take into consideration while defining a profile of a successful persons therefore the statement can be consider too semplicistic and not true .
