The programs of study courses require a thorough preparation and in order to make the best choices in this preparation you should keep in accountvarious factors , for instance what is most important for a student to learn and here comes our question : is it more important for a student to understand ideas and concepts or to learn facts ?

I do n't completely agree with the statement that understanding ideas and concepts is more important than learning facts because I think that both things are important : understandig ideas and concepts is necessary because theory is the basis of any subject and you must know it , on the other hand , if you only know theoretical ideas and concepts you wo n't be in touch with the reality and , as a consequence , you probably wo n't be able to use your theoretical knowledge in practice .
Furthermore you should n't forget that theory comes from experince and the object of experience are facts so , in order to have a complete view of things , a student should both understand concepts and ideas and learn about facts .

Concepts do n't come out of nowhere , for instance , a lot of scientific discoveries aroused from noticing some unusual facts that were analysed and led to some theories that were demonstrated .
Therefore , if we only understand and memorise concepts and ideas we miss a lot of elements that helps us to understand things more in depth .

A good example of how learning facts is as important as understanding concepts and ideas can be given by the study of history : if we study a political theory , we understand it in depth but we do n't have any idea of how it was actually implemented we will have just a partial view of this idea , based only on theoretical elements and we wo n't be able to figure out wether it is good or not wether it is realistic or not wether the man who elaborated was right or not in his view .

In conclusion a must say that , in my opinion students should both understand concepts and ideas and learn facts .
