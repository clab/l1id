As we move further in the new era of technology , the world of advertisment is crutial in proposing new products to the masses so as to increase their demand on the market .
However , as time has gone on the world of advertising has stopped being a method to promote and has developed as a commercial industry ready to do anything in order to make a product more appealing .

A possible justification to this phenomena is the `` fashion '' behind each advertisment .
Often do we buy a product because of its appealing advertisment rather than its content .
This is due to the popular fame that some products achieve through their advertisment , especially within the teenage population .
As a young adult , I can see the onspread of this tendency when speaking with fellow friends and affronting the argument of wether a type of clothing is fancy or not just because of the advertisment behind it .

I also think that advertisment has taken on this role because of the advancing of technology , such as Television or On line pop ups , which effectivly keep on promoting products .
It is because of this increased supply in ways to advertise that advertisment has taken on another role and does not limit itself to selling a product but tries to make it seem much better than it truly is .

This ties in with the next concept : better technologies , such as TV animations , have induced companies in portraying products such as food as more tasty just through their advertisment .
How often have we seen a pizza look more tasty on TV than on our real life kitchen table ?

Why not consider the increase in advertisments as more appealing than the actual product as a result of the same availability of a particular product ?
For example , an expnential increase in cellular phones has requested companies to portray each cell phone as more useful , technological and handy then it actually is because of the competition that can be found in the mobile sector .

Thus , when we look at a newspaper ad or watch a TV commercial , I think we must take concius action to question the actual product that is trying to be sold to us at all costs , and refer to the item itself before purchasing it .
