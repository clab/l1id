A studend must be continuosly feeded with learnings and theory principally , then of course there is good time also for practicing his studies but first theory must come .
Since the definition of student is coming fro the verb '' to study '' i think it wo n't be a great deal to make them learn the practice before they know how to apply the practice itself , it could result a mere misuse and no more .

Theory must be the basis first , especially for students that are supposed not having any experience in real life yet , an engineer must to know how to design and project a bridge before buid it otherwise many people will be in danger .

For sure what it makes the differences today is not '' to do '' but '' how to do '' and you will learn how only by studying different projects and comparing them with other people who gained such a good preparation like you .

I not saying that learning facts are not important in students careers infact once they will understand the ideas then they will start to apply those concepts but since the beginning of student career they really need to assimilate more ideas that they can even support , as much as possible i mean .

These issue of course could vary depending on which faculty the student applys for .
Obviously , Math or phsicology faculties teach more about ideas than facts while in engineering or economics the students will study more practical cases but the main idea remains the same and is that students are made first to learn theory in order to apply it succesfully in a more profitable way .
