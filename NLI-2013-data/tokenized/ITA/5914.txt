The number of cars has been continuously increasing in the last fifty years .
This brought to the result that cities are getting more and more crowed every year , especially big cities in which it is becoming almost impossible to go around by car .

A great solution to this problem is to improve public transportations and I believe in the last years we have been trying to do so .
Using buses , subways and any other kind of public transportation will give a chance to our cities to be less crowed by cars .

Plus in twenty years our public transportation will improve with no doubt , the service will be more efficient giving less chances to be late for the people who use it .
Thus owning a car wo n't be convinient anymore .

Even today people tend to choose to go around without cars because using your own car takes much more time and brings a lot of more stress in your day .
Simply finding a place to park most of the times takes lot of efford and often it will not be near the place we need to go .

I believe in twenty years prices of transportations will decrease as well .
Starting from planes , their prices will be cheaper and long trip wo n't be done by cars anymore , too long and unconfortable compared to cheap plain tickets .

We also have to consider the increasing growth of population .
Cities are already crowded with cars nowadays , if we do n't find a way to reduce them , we really will not be able to live in a city any more .
Finding a way to make people use other transportations will be necessary and inevitable .

About searching new ways I completely believe technology is the best answer we can find .
I 'm positive that in twenty years technology will step forward many times giving us new imputs and solutions to deal with the problem of cars , and all this new improvements will definitely make people own fewer cars then today .
