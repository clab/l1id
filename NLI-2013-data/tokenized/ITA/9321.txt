In my opinion the most important thing for a student is not to learn facts , even though it should be useful , but to understand ideas and concepts .
When somebody try to learn a fact he can do a lot of things in a wrong way : for instance he can forget it after few years , or he can also alter some essential parts of it .
The result is to change the fact and alter completely the meaning of the information received .
This can led to problems of understanding and , in the worsen cases , to bigger crisis .

This is the nature of the fact , somethink closely linked to our memory and therefore on something we can not completely rely .
Facts could also change as new facts come out or new proof are considered .
What we should never avoid is the understanding of concepts and ideas .
Everybody can forget something that has previously learned but nobody can forget his own ideas .
While facts are not part of our brain or of our spirit , ideas are the most secret part of us .
Students should be educated to understand the ideas of philosophers , politicians , poets , writers etc. because in this way they can catch the real spirit of men .
To make an example everybody can learn a poem but after few years a lot of people can start to forget it , but the idea hidden in the poem it will never be forgot .
On one hand facts can change or can be altered by the time or by new discoverings they are the material part of the world , on the other hand ideas are the spiritual part of our world , the part which will live forever .
Students should learn this main point : the real image of a person can not be understand by facts but only by his ideas .
