Like many others statements , there is n't an universal true .
It depends on many different things .
A person who has broad knowledge of a precific subject can became very good in this subjects and dedicates all his life to it .
But to know many subjects is more pratical .
For examples , I 'm very good in maths and in scientific subjects till I was very young and every professor said `` David is so good in maths : he must do scientific liceo `` and so I focused all my attention on this subject to increase my ability and I did also the national math olimpic with good results .
But now I have to pass this Toefl test and I understand that in the past i 'd study English better because now I 'm very good in scientific subjects , but if I do n't pass this exam , how can I finish University ?
It 's a big problem ...
