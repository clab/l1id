I think that there is a difference between how young and old people express the way they enjoy life .
Not everyone expresses this kind of emotion by accompanying it with the stereotypical connotation of `` enjoying life '' such as carefree days , endless laughs and no responsabilities .
For this reason I do not agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people .

As a matter of fact , I think older people can develop subtler , more refined and , why not , more precious ways of appreciating life .
Young people , most of the time , are bound to a definition of fun that is imposed by the media , which involves concerts , all-night partying , strenuous lifestyles and the idea that `` someone , somewhere , is having more fun than I am '' .
This makes most young people feel compelled to do more and more in order to show others that they are enjoying themselves rather then actually cherish their experiences .

Older people learn in time that enjoying life can be associated with more relaxed and `` tailored '' activities , such as hobbies or brief holidays .
I think that it might be even easier for some older people to enjoy life firstly because they can count on more financial stability and secondly because they have a lot less time to dedicate to themselves , which makes this time a lot more valuable .

Hobbies are activites people cultivate over long periods of time , and the passion with which they nurture them is a very good example of how much a person can enjoy him or herself .

I consider holidays as another good example .
When young people go on holiday , they tend to lead a lifestyle very similar to that that awaits them at home - if not more stressful ; going out every night , staying up very late , `` trying a bit of everything '' .
Older people have less time to travel but more money to spend on their trips , which enables them to choose destinations and vacation types that will make them get the most out of that limited time and , at the end of the day , `` enjoy life '' more .
