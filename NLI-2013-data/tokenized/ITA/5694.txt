Sometimes the economic business doesn t tell the true , in particular with advertisements .
Every day I can see a lot of products that the enterprises describe us very good , but when you buy those you can have a bad products .

I complitely agree with that statement and for me the best exampl is with the food advertisement .
When you can see that kind of advertisement it seem to be the best food , very delicious and attractive , and you are involved to buy this food , but when you eat this , it is very bad .
I think it with the example of the food , because you can t taste , and only if you try you will know if the food is good or no , you can not make the same statement with clothes or tecnological things because you can see those on the advertisement and when you will go to the shops you can read , see , touch and ask informations .

I mean also with these kinds of products happened to buy bad things .
So I think that the enterprises take advantages under this profile , but if I see the situation under their view I can understand them because they need to sell the product and they have to involve people to buy their product .

Actually I think that this way to sell the product is wrong not only because the enterprise sell a bad thing to the public but it will lost a clients in the future , because the consumer will not buy other thing of that brand .
