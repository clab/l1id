I agree it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects for many and different reasons .
In the first i have many possibilities to speak with the other persons because the knowledge many subjects will do of me an intresting person .
Moreover to study many subjects permits to me to know different persons and different things .
This is very important for my future because i have many possibilities for my life , for my job , for my hobbies , etc .

For my job , for example , to know different subjects is very important because ti is an intellectual job and if i will specialize in one specific subject i will not become a good architect .
To specialize in one specific subject means that i am a limited person .

The knowledge of many subjects is the most important thing for the growth of an individual , the intelletual 's growth , because a person can to become a bad person , while he is an intelligent person he will has n't the difficult with the social relationship .

To understand my topic i have an example : my father started to work when he was a child , but when he became a man for his culture and to create the future he started to study and now he is a manager of heating sistem .

Now the younger have many possibilities for to study immediately with the school , with numerous books , with the TV and with the newspapers and therefore because it do n't do it .

In the end , it is very bored to study only one subject because the time do n't never walk !
