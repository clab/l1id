I think the human beings ' life is bound to the risk factor .
It has always been so since the primitives were chasing animals with bare hands .
At the time the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful person was to live or die .
Our society inheritated the risk factor from our ancestor .

In the actual society , made of people doing the same task everyday , taking risk is the key to success in the evryday 's life .
I think that taking risks and try new things is very important for everybody , not only for people who want to succeed .
I can not imagine that we would have reached our actual wellness society if somebody had n't taken any risk .
For example if the Wright brothers had n't tried to make their aeroplane fly , we would still be travelling land and sea but not in the sky ; by contrast many people died because of flights .
Maybe if the Wrights did n't try we would have saved many lives , but we would n't be able to travel around the world so quickly .
One more example would be the longest jump made by a famous dirt bike rider .
Riding his motorbike he jumped 60 meters long and estabilished a new world record .
If he hesitated before jumping he would n't have taken any risk but he would be just a regular rider , not the world record holder .
By the same token he could have unfortunately died , but it 's the price sometimes people have to pay to succeed .

I think we should manage the risk in the everyday life , but it depends on situatons and mainly on the limit .
The difference between taking a risk considered fool and succeeding is so slight , but I think it 's exactly what make us different from each other .
We can manage the risk and reach higher levels in the university , careers and society .
Of course the everyday work helps us improve ourselves , but in the end it 's up to us to take a risk and try new things or not .
