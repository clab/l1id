In my student experiences , I often used the memory to learn the fact , in the case of the lesson with a lot of dates , names or formulas but I 've always had the fundamental idea that studying without understanding principles , concepts that are at the basis of the facts could be an unuseful work .

In fact , knowing the Einstein 's formula , but then not understanding the principle of the gravity energy is not intellingent , beacuse even if you worked only with your memory .
My Ph.D. advisor , a professor in coastal engineering , does't usually remember all of the drag coefficient values that appears in the Darcy formula but he reflects about its significance and , using the knowledge of the pricipal laws and the practical sense , is always able to give me the more realistic value for all of types of surfaces .

I often loose this practical ability to understand the real problems and the ideas that is hidden by the formula .
For a student , it 's simpler to learn facts , even if often the professors asked them to refer themselves to a specific number , or a particula paragraph of the book .
The student , also for this reason , is used to prefer to learn facts , without really comphend the general topics .

Now I 'm not a student and I know that only the really understood concepts are placed in my mind while all the formulas and numbers that filled my memory in thelast year , are now vanished .

So , I usually suggest to my student to understand the concept that are below a formula or a mathematical law and to not learn only with the memory !!
