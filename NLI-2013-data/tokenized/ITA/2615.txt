Today people , especially young people , enjoy more then older people .
I think it is a very true statement !
For example in my family i often go out at the saturday night , i usually go to the movies , to pubs or to the restaurant !
Instead my parents never go to the restaurant or to the movies !

I think it happens for several possible reasons .
One possible reason is that the life today is earier than before .
Today we often have a lot of money .
My mother usually tell me that when she was young she has only two or three dress .
I think it is incredible !
I have a huge amount of dress !

A second possible reason is that in a city now there is an incredible amount of cinemas , pubs , restaurants .
There are several opportunities to enjoying .
Furthermore each family has a car .
A car allow to move people easier than before .
Thus actual young people can enjoy themself more than previous young people .
In fact the actual economy is better .
There are more money , so there are several possibilities to enjoing .
