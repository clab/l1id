If I had to refer only to my personal experience I would have to completely agree with the statement .
Fortunately not every youngster is like me .

I must confess that I have never taken part to community service , which in my home country , Italy , young men could choose as an alternative to military service .
A bill has been passed that frees my generation from military service and thus also from `` compulsory '' community service .
I might have justfied my behavior by saying that nowadays the sense of community that used to animate the life of suburbia and countryside villages has been lost ; that work conditions and habits have changed and all in all people are less and less tied to their own communities .
They think and act global .

But the fact that I am selfish does not imply that so are my fellow citizens of the same age .
I have many friends devoted to at least one community service activity .
My best female friend has been active in the emergency transport service , that brings patients to emergency rooms and hospitals for the past five years and she is still on duty once a week every thursday night .
It is worth to mention that in Italy this service is run on a voluntary basis .

Finally one can extend what I have mentioned about the fading of local communities and claim that the young should take care of the global communtiy and especially its poorest members .
More and more young women and men are now spending their holidays in non governmental organizations active in the poorest part of the world .
As far as I am concerned I have never joined these programs , but my sister and some frinds of mine did last year .
They were helping in a small hospital in satellite town of Kolkata , India .

So , hopefully , the picture is not so bleak , at least as long as my friends persist in their altruism .
