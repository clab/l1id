I am 24 years old and I have been studying Electronic Engineering for five years .
During my studies I have often asked to myse lf it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
From my experience I realized that the best way to attain good results is to specialize in one specific subject .
In particoular thare was an event that convinced me of that .

In fact there was a semster in wich I had four courses at the same time plus the development of my bachelor ' s degree thesis .
I was going to begin my Master 's studies and in the same period I even had to present my bachelor 's degree thesis work in a conference .
I was very busy with my thesis however I decided to register for four classes .
It was a big mistake .
In fact I could not attend all the lessons and when I had the exames I did not took good grades .
Moreover I did not have a broad knowledge but just a superficial one .
This was an important experience for my future choiches .

In fact I realized that a broad knowledge is something that comes with time .
In the next semesters I chose to register for two or maximum three classes .
I could attend all the lessons and when I studied at home I had enough time to go depper in the topic that I have had listened in class .
In this way I took very good grades that now permit me to apply as Ph.D. at the M.I.T ..


From my experience during my Master 's studies I realized that it is quite difficult to have a broad and deep knowledge at the same time .
Therefore I think that it is better to specialize in one or few subjects .
In this way it is possible to have a deeper knowledge and after few time even a broad knowledge .
With this porpouse in my mind I am going to apply for my Ph.D. and I am sure that in this way I will able to have other success .
