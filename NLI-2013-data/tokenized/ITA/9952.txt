I 'm agree with the statement .
Succesfull people risks , in their life , rather than the other people .
Normal people have n't risk in their life and they do n't like to try new things .
To be a succesfull person , instead , you ca n't stop yourself to do what you already know , you have to be ambicious and you have to be ready to take some risk .
The persons , that live their life like a movie , do n't do anything for change it .
But the persons that know what they want and fight to obtein it , they have to take some risks .
The strong of the life is in the risks and in the new things .
We 've to try all the new thing but never forgot the old things .
If you are a champion in a particulary sport you have to continue the practice everyday , but that do n't means that you have to do only your sport .
The mind and the thought that the sky gave us are the most important weapon for the war of life .
The ambicious person and the person that does n't stop himself is the person that will win in the future .

The influence of television should be used to talk with the persons about this topic .
The movies , the songs , even the literature should be used to teach at the children the importance of being ambicious and the importance of tring new things .

The fear of the common person is the reaction of the other people ( friends or even parents ) if they fail their new experience .
But it is n't a problem .
If you do n't do anything , you ca n't fail .
Only who does something can fail .
And the sad of a failure is like the kiss of a wife .
So when you 're sad for a filure in a new thing , you hold the hand of your wife a your smile will stais on .
