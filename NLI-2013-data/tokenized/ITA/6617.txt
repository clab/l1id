I live in a city and I can see everyday so many cars moving in the streets and a lot of traffic .
People are stressed and they are fed up of queues and skip in their timetables .
This incredible amount of cars moving does n't have positive effects of course !

I think that pollution is the first consequence of the increasing number of cars .
That-s why I would prefear a cars reduction in the future .
At the same time I recognize the importance in having your own vehicle , you can go wherever you want , with no barriers and constrictions in timetables , like for busses or trains .

Anyway I think that there are several ways to avoid pollution without reducing the number of vehicles .
First of all , I think that in the future there will be dicovered the existence of particular kinds of fuels to prevent pollution , there are already some of them in use .

The second solution I would suggest , is the increment in electric vehicles business .
Today there are some of them in use , but they are not so common maybe because they are too expensive .
Any way I think that if everybody start to buy this kind of vehicle , its price will be reduced .

Furthermore , pollution does't seem to be the only consequence of increasing in cars , but there is also a lot of traffic , as i mensioned before talking about my city .
Traffic makes a city unliveable !

First of all traffic has an effect on a person well being I think , it 's stressful , and then I think that it always makes you change your programs and your timetable , that 's why I think that in a future people will change vehicle anyway .

For me , a solution to cars increasing could be the emprovement of public vehicles > undergrounds , trains , busses everyday more efficient and faster .
In such a way the pollution will be reduced but at the same time there will be less traffic in return of your own well being .
