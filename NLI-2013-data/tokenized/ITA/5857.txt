I agree with the statement that `` in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' .
As we can see in the everyday life there is a decresing amount of space to get around with cars .
Parking it is becaming a real challenge , and the frustration that builds everyday is assuming very big proportions .
The statistics showed that in twenty years the population of the world will be at about six billions .
Right now we are only four billions .
What that means is that the level of pollution of the air it will be unlivible for any human kind .
The space available per person will decrease and the drivers will have an increase in anger .
Unfortunately we are able to see that in Indonesia right now .
Their problem is that everybody uses a car .
Therefore , living in a confined country , with an increasing population does n't allow a sanitary and better life .
So , to avoid this problem , we should decrease the number of cars by simply applying to few rules .
First of all , we should make a law that forbids people to drive by themselfes .
What i mean is that cars should be considered for a minimum of four people .
If that does n't happen the owner of the car should n't be allowed to drive , penalty a tiket or worse .
Then the community should make available more community rides like buses or any other vehicle that hold more people than a car .
Doing so , we should be able to decrease the number of cars , the pollution of the air , the gas consumption , that nowdays is reaching incredible prices and we should be able to decrease the frustration and anger of everybody .

In the meanwhile , another good thing that could be done is allow the circulation only to the vehicles that have a gpl or a methane implant .
That does n't decrease the number of cars in circulation , but at least decrease the air pollution .
