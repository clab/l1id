That successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is a quite intersing question , in fact it is related to intrinsic human attitude .
All the humans wants to be successful people , but really it is always necessary to innovate things of to risks the life or something to have success in life ?
Why I can not be simple myself doing the things that I know to do , ever in the same way , and become a successful people as well ?
Probably some example could help us in aswering to this questions .
In human history there are many example of people who become successful only because they tried new things and took risks .

Think about Cristoforo Colombo , he was the first sailor to have the idea to go to India by the sea insted that by land .
He decided to try a new thing and he become very successful , in fact he discovered America .
Naturally he takes a lot of risks for his own life in doing that .

In the very recent history we have the example of Bill Gates who become a successful people , the richest man of the world , doing something that no man have never do before .
He invents computers and he invested all his life and all the money that he had at that time in founding his company , Microsoft .
So he decided to take the economical risks .

However we have also to consider that not alla the people who try new things and take risks are successful people , in fact in choosing this way it is common to fail .
For example many people died in the tentative of beeing the first man who fly from America to Europe .

In my opinion , as the above exemples shows , you cannot be a successful people just doing what you already know how to do well , without taking any risk .
In this way you probably can become a respectable worker or perhaps an affidable person , by I think this is not the definition of `` successful people '' in which most people are interest .
