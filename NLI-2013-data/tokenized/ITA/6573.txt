I agree with the statement that

Now the world is full of cars , and probably in the future we will have more .
So I agree with the statement that in twenty years there will be more cars in use than today .

I agree with this statement for two fondamental reasons .
The first is that the tecnology today is growing up very quickly , and so it is more easy to built cars faster and better than yesterday .
In addiction to this fact the fabrics of cars spend less money to do them , and so they produce a huge number of them .
Probably in the future , by the fact that is so easy and so economic to buy a car , every people will have one .

Secondly I think that people really like to drive and to have car , and this is an other reason why the commerce of them will be increase in the future .
Today , in our society , the car represent one of the status simbol of the person who own that object .
that is a very big problem becose it could generate differenses and gelosies between people .
In conclusion I think that in the future people will buy more cars than today , and so in twenty years a person could have more than one car than today .
