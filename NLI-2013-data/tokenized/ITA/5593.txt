I agree with this statement .
In fact a lot of products are quite different from the examples given in their own advertisements .

I mean that people , who study the way to present an article or a product and finnally to prepare an advertisment , wants to attract the attention of the costumer , instead of describes the qualities of the product .
Using this kind of technique , the advertiser risk to have a product different in quality respect to the one , the customer have in mind .

For example , I have buied a toothpasta that say to radically transorm my smile in a whiter smile , but after the four weeks that the advertisment suggest to use this product my smile was not so different .

In my opinion the advertiser want to demontsrate that his product is the best , or is better than others .
In some cases , to do this , he decide to say something not complitely true or not at all possible in order to attract the attention of the people .
He lies a little , but he may pose his attention on the indefinite line , that divide people who believe in his advertisment and people who do n't .
In particular people who believe in the advertisement do n't accept to discover that the product is very different from his idea .

In conclusion in my opinion is not always a good idea to lie or to present products better then they are , because the custumer want what the advertisement says and do n't want a bad surprise .
