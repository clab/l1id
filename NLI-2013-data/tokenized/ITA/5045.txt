All days we take car to go at work , take train to transfer from a city to another , buy various type of electronic machine , on all of this actions we can watch a million of danger situations !

On the train we can read uppon the window that is very danderous put out the head or put out bottles , during drive car we can watch many traffic signals that remember the maximum speed permitted , or finally when we buy a washing-machine we can read the book where are write all instruction to what do and what do not .

This are the advertisements that daily we can find in the life .
Just when we are child , parents show what is dangerous for us , `` do not touch this '' is the mainly phrase that it is said .
During the grow each child decide what is right for him and , sometime to follow the fashion , make bad decision for himself like smoching cigarettes and joints , or go around with not very good people .

Sometimes an advertisement could seem very eccessive , like how do not put a cat in the microwaves , but not all people are able to think what is right and what is not .

I think that it is impossible know whether a person is able to choose the true way to make somethingh , and so it is better if other write sample instructions for him \ her .

Finally I definitely disagree the statement because we cannot know when and what is really dangerous for us , and so I think that is better follow the instruction .
