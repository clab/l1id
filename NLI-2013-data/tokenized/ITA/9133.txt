Learning facts can be useful for a student , but this cannot be sufficient for them .
Understanding ideas or concepts contribute to develop opinions and a critical point of view about reality .
In short , understanding ideas and concepts you can obtain a `` key of reading '' of the world .
You can begin to think with your own mind .

First , students need to grow not only phisically but also spiritually and intellectually .
Learning facts by hearth it is not useful for them .
Sometimes hystory teachers force students to learn dates and hystorical events by hearth .
Then , after one or two months , students have already forgotten all dates and all related hystorical events .
It is important , in my humble opinion , to understant the background of every event , and , at the same time , have the ability to collocate it in the line of the time .
Once you have recorded a date , you can rebuilt in your memory the hystorical background .
This is the function of a ` by hearth learning ' .

Secondly , developing a critical point of view and a vaste range of opinions is fundamental for a student , because it is the moment when he is building his personality .
Thinking with your own mind is fundamental to living in our society , where everyone acts only in function of their own interests .
In a nutshell , to live choosing your partner , or which cloath you like , or where to go when you want , it is the secret of freedom .
However , a freedom that respects and that take into account the freedom of everyone , as said the French philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau .

Thirdly and finally , this is why I think it is important for young people having their own ideas .
