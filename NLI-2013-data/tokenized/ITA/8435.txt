I do n't completely agree with the statement for different reasons .
Of course it is important for students to understand concepts , and not only to understand them , but also to keep them clearly in mind and make them be a huge part of their knowledge .
But on the other hand , I also think that learning fact has its importance : in fact , most of the times a student is not even able to understand a concept throughfully if he doesn ' t know anything real related to that idea .
I mean , it is important to have a knowledge of what had happened in history , it is part of one 's culture and will be useful in one 's private and working life , I think .
Knowing ideas and concepts in astract has its relevance , of course , but is not enough : usually you ca n't understand the thinkings of important people and philosophers of the past , if you do n't have any idea about the period they lived in or the facts that occurred in their lives .
I reckon that students have to learn facts , even if it is boring : most of the times teachers are aware that students are not really interested in them , and that they would rather being thaught something more exciting .
Nevertheless , students understand how important it is for them to learn facts when they grow up , because they will know what to say in every situation and to every kind of people they will speak to .

With my statements , I 'm not trying to say that understand ideas and concepts is n't important : not at all !
I am only saying that both ways should be used with students because they have quite the same importance , in different ways .
It also depends on the kind of student a teacher is teaching to : maybe someone prefers one way while another prefers the other one : they are both good ways of learning , I guess , and should both be used to build one 's mind .
