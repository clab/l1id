The statement in the title points out an important issue in education : is it more urgent to memorize information or to develop transversal capabilities ?

Of course students need to learn facts .
How could I understand the history of my country without knowing what has happened in the last centuries ?
Further , if we did n't study the biographic facts of an author , then we would lose important information that might have been useful in order to get the meaning of his poetry .
In my experience , it is useful to know and display some knowledge also when I have to support an opinion , since my ideas become more concrete and persuasive .

Considering these advantages , traditional school used to stress the mnemonic side of learning , creating well prepared students .
On the other hand , these students could be a bit rigid .
For instance , my Italian teacher at highschool did n't accept any alternative way of presenting the contents and she expected us to memorize pages and pages , without asking for any critical development .
The result is that I forgot the most part of the literature I studied in those year , which is a real shame !

While traditional school used to put too much emphasis on learning facts , modern teachers , on the contrary , try to focus on concepts rather than on mere facts .
A deep understanding of the key ideas of an author , for instance , implies a double advantage .
On one hand it is easier to remember something that you have thought about : my English teacher , for instance , used to ask for our opinions regarding an author 's ideas and she even tried to make sense of phrasal verbs , in order to let us memorize them !
On the other hand , when you become familiar with ideas and concepts , you are likely to improve your capability of thinking with your mind .

Since in my opinion this is the first aim of school , far beyond a mere transmission of contents that could be forgotten very easily , I agree with the statement in the title .
