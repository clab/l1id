In my opinion it is very important to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects and , in the mean time be specialized in one specific subect .
I believe that there are a lot of things that must be known by everybody .

I think that what we learn at school must be the most diversified as possible .
We need to study a lot of subjects and read many different critics to be able to better understand the people and the society we live in .
Only by having a very wide knowledge we can understand what we really like and consequentally began to study a specific subject which can help us to work in the right way everyday .
I belive that a lot of subjects are linked together and required the study of other subjects to develop a complet and good idea on a topic .
For example while studying a foreign language I think it is important to study the culture , the geography , the literature and the economy of all the countriesa where that language is spoken .
In this case it would be important to study sociolagy , geography and economics in addition to that foreign language grammar .
Only by having such a developed knowledge we would really be able to say that we know a foreign language otherwise everytime we go to that specific country we would not know anything about it and we would feel unusefull and ignorante .

I also belive that a broad knowledge is important in everyday life .
For example how could we be able to read an economic article on a newspaper without knowing the basics of economics ?

According to all that I said I believe that a broad knowledge is a need that each person feels inside and it is something that needs to be develloped and extended everyday by readings books or articles as well as by watching documentaries on television .
