When we know a specific topic or we discuss an argument , and we are well aware of what we write or speak about , most of the times we bring ideas , concepts and facts .

The idea and concept are necessary to be able to define and describe a general concept .
If we start any description , it is necessary that first we have a clear and defined general information about it and that we can put it above all the necessary explanations we have to give in support of it .
Many times we have to use many ideas or concepts to describe a specific argument , but it would never be clear to describe any topic , without the use of more detailed and clear explanation of the elements , that can only be brought with facts .

Let 's think about history and let 's try to rely only on general concepts about the history of Romans : it is certainly very important to know that the Romans have been conquerors , but it would n't be useful if we do n't support the information with more specific information , such as the time they passes teh Alps or went to the sea and had the Punic wars .

In order to be clear , it is necessary to have a wide and clear vision of the elements of the discussion and that would be certainly represented by ideas and concepts , but in order to go deeper in the description , it is necessary to bring specific examples of what we are speaking about .
In a literature class , it is necessary to know the main elements of the Romanticism period in terms of concepts and ideas , but it would be impossible to understand the meanings of the genre if we do n't bring specific facts to surround the ideas , like who was the main representative of the period or what was written .

Students actually would use many of the facts to remember and support general ideas and concepts , that otherwise might be difficult to remember .
I think that a stuudent should be able to understand facts and concepts , but it is necessary that he supports those general elements with specific facts .
