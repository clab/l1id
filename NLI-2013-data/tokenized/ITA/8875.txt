Ideas consist of facts , and the relation between the two concepts is of a complicated kind .
Indeed , when we read the statement , it seems natural to argue that understanding ideas is of a better use that to merely learn facts .
The first is considered as such a noble and deep endeavor whereas the second is depicted as a narrow minded attitude .
Though we shall not come to conclusion of this kind in such a precaucious manner , and we will strive to analyse the question in a more thoughtfull way .

Since we would all , i presume , agree that understanding ideas is more important than learning facts , we should then rather that argueing in this sense , try to explain why this answer seems so obvious and natural .
Why then , would we all , certainly , tend to value the firts idea and not the second one .
This a priori , that we all share derives from the fact that we strongly believe that the activity of learning facts requires less of an effort than the one of understanding .
This belief is widely spread , and it is shared for many good reasons .
Understanding undoubtadly requires more time and concentration that the learning of facts .
Yet , most professions , now days , give more importance to acts then they do to thoughts and deepness .
To pass this test , we are not asked to truely understand the questions that we are asked but simply to answer them in a superficial way .
Most of us have little or no knoledge of biology or of social science and yet , are goal is to sound like excperts and to bring exact answers .
Again , we are not asked to think neither about the question nor about the reason why we are here to pass the test , wich behavior would result in an immediate failure .

But is society mistaken when it askes us to come to this center and pass the test ?
No .
Because we should understand the importance of leraning facts .
The two concepts meet when the understanding serves our goal .
