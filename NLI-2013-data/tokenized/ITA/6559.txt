I do not agree with this statement even fi I would like this forcasting was true .
In the next years our cities will be crowded with much more cars that today .
Firs of all people really need their cars in everything they do especially if they work far form their homes .
Public trasportations are not good enough to make people change their habits .
They are always late and dirty , this is because the state does not invest enough in improving public services .
if it takes 30 minutes to go from home to my office by car and it takes 50 minutes by train because it is always late i will never change my routines and i will always keep using my car every morning .

Secondly the increasing number of cars in use is also due to the widespread wealth that there is in our cities .
For instance in Italian families there is a mean of 3 cars every 2 persons .
Many people buy cars not because they need them but because they have a lot of money to spend and so they buy stuff they do not really need .
Since in many cities the wealth is increasing if think that in 20 years we will have much more cars than today in our cities .

This will be a huge problem for the environmental stanpoint , I think that there are two possible solution , the first one is an agressive solution while the second one is a proactive solution aimed at making people collaborate .

A first potential solution is to forbid the use of cars in downtown during working days so that people would be forced to use public trasportation .
A second potential solution could be about investing some money , raised with taxes , in improving the efficiency of public trasportations .
I think that in this way poeple would decide voluntarly to use subways and trains instead of their own cars .

Instead I think that there is no solution concerning the habits of buying too many cars compared with needs .
In conclusion I think that even if some actions will be undetaken to reduce the number of cars in use , the results will be anyway an increase cars in the next years .
