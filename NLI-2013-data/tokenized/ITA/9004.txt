Understanding ideas and concepts and learning facts are both very important for students .
Ideas and concept derive often form facts and facts are always influenced and produced by ideas , so I think these two elements are closed correlated .
For example , students can learn a lot by studing history , which is a complex mix of facts , ideas and concepts .
They should learn what happened in the past , the facts , the wars , the movings of people , but they should also know why these facts happened and possibly try to connect causes and effects .

If you just learn abstract concepts and ideas it is not easy to put them in the concrete life .
Ideas and concept have their origin in facts that have happened .
So it would be insufficient to learn them and not to learn the facts that originated them .

For the same reason I think it is very important to learn the fatct together with concept and ideas that help to understan why facts happened .
I think that if you sudy just a list of facts without to try to find the reasons and the consequences of these facts you can understand properly the importance of facts you study .

I think that also in scientific fields facts and ideas should be learnt together .
If students learn just theory they miss the real importance of ideas and findings .
They should understand what the ideas and concepts they study mean in the practice , how they can be used and have already been used .

So I think it is very important to consider both points and that students should learn ideas , concepts and fact together
