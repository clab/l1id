Personally , I strongly believe that an academic education which spans over a number of subjects is to be preferred to highly specialised knowledge of one single topic .

The first reason for this is that , according to my experience , extremely specialised academic profiles can bear to selfish and barely interactive personalities .
This is the case , for instance , of highly technical degrees such as engineering or physics , which in a number of cases bring , along with a remarkable level of technical preparation in their respective fields of interest , the development of a very specialised and unflexible mindset which is ideal for solving problems in that particular area of activity , but can prove to be rather inefficient when issues outside that particular field of specialization arise .

However - this being the second point in support of my opinion - situations in life are more often multi-faceted than single-faceted , and this is even more true as long as one 's activities and responsibilities grow in importance - which is exactly the case where academic education should play a key role .
Just think about the issues which managers of corporations and institutions are called to face every day : most of them do not refer back to one single topic or field of knowledge , but require a mixture of skills and qualifications spanning across a wide spectrum of subjects .
The more one 's education has been varied , the more he will feel confident in such a situation .

Last - but not least - I see a point of personal opportunity in supporting my opinion stated above .
Life is so interesting , and the fields of knowledge are so varied to be virtually unlimited : therefore , why should one restrict himself to a very small portion of such a treasure ?

I would therefore conclude with a statement which I recurrently hear from the General Manager of my company when he is discussing about the ideal profile for an executive , and which sounds like `` Specialization belongs to insects : why should we stick to it ? ''
The field of human knowledge is fortunately so large , and its boundaries are so rapidly broadening , that it would be a real pity to voluntariliy limit ourselves to know and appreciate only a small part of it .
