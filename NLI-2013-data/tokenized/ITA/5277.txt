In our world , advertisements are maybe everywhere , and therefore our lives are strongly influenced by this form of communication .
I think that very often advertisements try to present a product in such a way that it seems better than it really is .
This can be done in many ways .

For example , last year I had to change my car and I saw the commercial of a very cheap and beautiful car at the TV : I suddenly falled in love with it .
When I saw this car in my city , I discovered that the appealing of the real car was very different from the appealing of the car in the commercials , and obiously I changed my opinion about this product .
The * real * car was tiny , and not very pretty .

Sometimes , commercials triy to ameliorate a product by other methods : for example , the advertisement of an expensive product could not speak about the price of this product .
Or the commercial of an experimental product , could not metion that ( important ! )
fact : in my Country , a few years ago , it has been a case of this type , concerning the sell of a diet drink which were not completely tested .

I guess that the strategy of commercials that try to ameliorate a product is logical , in a strictly economical sense .
In fact , the purpose of the advertisements is to push a person to buy some product .
But , since I am a person , I think that this strategy is cynical and sometimes sordid .

I guess that if commericials were made honestly and carefully , then they could become a very useful and quick way to learn about new products .
Advertisements could be , in this case , a source of informations for every person , because they 're everywhere and they 're easy to understand .

But if a person knows that very often advertisements make a product much better than it really is , then this person could not consider commercials as a source of nice and simple informations .
This person will be diffident , and - as an intelligent person - he/she will not be too much influenced by commercials .
