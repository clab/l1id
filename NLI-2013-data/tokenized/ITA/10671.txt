I absolutely agree with this statement , I think that everybody that wants to be a successful person at work but also in his private life needs to try always something new and take some risks .
I also think that to reach some success in life somebody has to take his responsibilities , for what he thinks or does , and must have the very difficult ability to learn from other people and from himself .

Trying new things , means for me a need of changing , a sensation that what 's surrounding is not big enough , but I also think that the first step for trying new things starts from the inside of everybody , such as trying new feelings .

Taking the risks is also very important because if anybody arrives to the success without any risk or stop it 's success does n't mean anything .
The responsibilities are one of the most important part of the success , because when you take some decisions for your future you must be able to face the problem that this decisions will cause you , and if you can manage well your decisions and your responsibilities you can also fail but with a smile on your face .

To reach the success I think it 's important also the ability to learn , and I do n't mean only from other people but also to learn from ourselves and from our mistakes , and not to think that we already know what to do and nobody else does because there will always be someone else that that already committed the same mistake and that can teach us something to find our solution .

If we only do what we can do well we 'll never be able to follow our path but we 'll only walk around in circle .
