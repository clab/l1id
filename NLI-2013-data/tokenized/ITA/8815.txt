In this essay I will shed light on the statment , that it is more imoportant for students to unterstand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .

It is important , that students learn general facts for their cultural understanding , but mainly this dates and names can be researched in a book , or on the internet at almost any time .
Although , some very important key facts must be memorized .
When I was in a conversation with an American visitor in Genova , standing in front of the Columbus museum , I could not remember , when America was discovered .
A such an important date is known by any second grade child , however I could not remember the year .
He reminded me , that America was discovered in 1492 .
I felt very bad at that time that I never forget this important fact in my life .

However , I am convinced , that ideas and concepts are much more imporant than learn facts .
Concepts are more likely to be necessary in the daily life , than are facts .
What I mean is , if there were two or more contries combating each other , it would be war .
From school we learned a lot about wars in ancient and as well recent times , that in all wars many people were killed , and in most of those land and people changed nationality once the war was over .
During the war many people were killed and tortured .
From the concept of war we know , that it is a very bad situation for all involved and that there are many loosers and few winners .
This concept is known by everybody .

In an nutshell it is important to know impotant facts , such as the discovery of the American continent , but it is far more important to understand ideas and concepts , in order to draw conclusions of a possible outcome .
