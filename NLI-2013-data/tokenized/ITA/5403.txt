For me the advertisements now are part of our life in a wrong way .
We are submitted from this .
Sometimes the advertisements are very important , we can see new things , new ideas , comparising different opinion about different product .

But it could be a disaster if we trust everything these advertisements say and we no more think with our knowledge .
The terrible thing is that sometimes they really seem much better than they really are !!
For me is a problem about our world , about the industry .
Some pleople for money , for the power can do everything .
I really like graphic designer but sometimes it became dangerus to do everything they told use to do , becuase olso sometimes the television make the thing much better than it really is .
