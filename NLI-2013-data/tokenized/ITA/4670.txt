I think it is true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
In my opinion it happens particularly during spots on television : in fact each of us can remember that he brought something because it was introduced very well , or because the spot was really nice or interesting .
It happens because the power of tv is too much strong , in fact each of us has a tv and watches it every day .

All the reasons that cause this phenomenum concerne business , in fact industries use spots to convince people that their products are very useful and they always insist about the good quality of them .

In my opinion sometimes producers lie because they want to be richer and richer , but sometimes they lie because they live in a critical economic period , even if I do n't want to justify them .

In fact we must consider that in the period of globalisation a lot of products have generated a real invasion of market all over the world , and it is very difficult for industries to defend their products because the competition with other products is hard .
About this aspect we can remember the most important new element of global economic , that is represented by the Chinese market .
This market through its low prices causes a real crisis of modern economy and forces a lot of European or American industries to be more competitive .

As a result a lot of this industries try to send their products by doing false advertisements about their qualities .
I think it is completely wrong because the customers always want to buy faithful products , characterised by a real good quality ; so if they are not satisfied by things they buy , they will change products immediately , particularly in the period of globalisation , during which you can find a big variety of products .
