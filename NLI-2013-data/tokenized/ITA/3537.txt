It is true that nowdays young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I think that this is an effect of a lot changings of the World .
In fact in the past young people helped their family in some works , such as to clean their room , to do their bed and so on .
In this way a young boy could develop your sense of responsability and so he also learned to helping their communities .
Perhaps this is impossible today , because young people have many things to do and they are involved in many activities .
If we think that today young people spend the major part of their time at school or that they spend their time playing videogames or watching TV , it is simple to understand this changing .
I think that for young people is not important playing or studying only .
They should learn to love the nature and should spend more time out .
In this way they could help their community cleaning the woods or organizing some events to involve the children or old peolpe of their communities for example .
To do this , it is important that the governments give the structures to create and to develop this type of society .
For me this aspect of society is very important because if we want a society in that all people can be to help for another people , it is important to develop this sense of responsability in all young people .
In fact for me it is not nice a society in that everyone thinks only himself .
