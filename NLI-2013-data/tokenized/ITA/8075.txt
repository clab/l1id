Since I 've been student for a long time , I can say that at the age when we are young students ( for example High school age ) , we normally tend to care more to understand ideas and concepts than it is for us to learn facts .

Anyhow , I have to say that , at least as far as my experience is concerned , along the student age we change our learing process , passing from giving more importance on theory to linking theory to facts .

For example when we talk about students untill high school , I believe that up to that age we already had a lot of concepts from schools , family and social enviroment .
At this age we do n't care , for example , about political events or international affairs .
This is due to the fact that certainly we are too young , we are more focused on other things such as having fun , going out , doing some sports .
What is more , we 're completely unable to link all the concepts we received to real facts .

On the other hand , when we go to the university , and this is another step of being students , I think the things change .
It happens because we 're getting in another enviroment in which we weant to be well considered , we 're meeting other people with who we 're going to share more adult experince and last but not least we 're getting more mature .
As a result we can link in a more efficient way what we studied ( aslo during the high school ) to the real facts .
For example it happens to me when I studied the concept of inflaction .
When I was watching the TV news , I was really surprised to finally understand what inflation is and what are its effects .
And this is not all .
We 're also becoming able to link some concepts that we 've learnt in the past to the real facts , and at that time you finally realize how was usefull to study that concept ( that at the beginning it has been considered stupid ) .

So , I agree partially that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts that it is to learn facts , because it could depends if we 're considering high school student ( who are more focused in concept and ideas ) and university students ( who are beginning to link the concepts to facts ) .
