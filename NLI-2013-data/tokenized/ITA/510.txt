First of all , we have to determine whether we are supposing to be in a high school or in a college situation .
That definition makes a great difference on my opinion .

In fact , if we are in the high school case , I think it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
The reason is that high school students have to primarily go over as many subjects as they can to realize which are the ones they are most interested in .
Second , a wide knowledge of subjects gives the students a wider view , it `` opens '' their mind , and get them the opportunity to increase their culture level .
However , this is not valid for senior high school students because once they reach the last school year before college , they should now focus on what they would like to study in the future .
For instance , if a student wants to study Advertising at the university , he should start taking Art classes , or Economics lessons , so that to receive an introduction , a perspective of what he will study the following years .

On the other hand , talking about college situation , I disagree with the statement since I believe that , once you graduate from high school and you get prepared for the university , you should concentrate yourself on a specific subject .
That does not mean , by the way , that you do not have to study other subjects .
It simply mean that you have to channel your studies on the subject you will need in your future job .
Taking the previous example , if I want to become an art director in an advertising agency , I will not continue studying languages , maths , physical education , and the other subjects I was used to study at the high school .
Instead of them , I will choose subjects that directly concern with advertising , such as the history of advertising , the economic method of advertising , and other subjects that best fit whit my future job .

In conclusion , I believe that having a broad , wide knowledge of many academic subjects is very important for it let us make up our minds about our future , but once realized our primarily interests , we should focus on that ones and start becoming who we want to become .
