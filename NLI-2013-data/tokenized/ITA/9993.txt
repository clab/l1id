I think that to be a successuf people the people can try new things and take risks much than doing only what they already know how to do well , but when became succesful they often do only one thing .

In fact often the person , who becames succesful , does one thig very very well : he knows how to do something and he does it .
For example an succesful artist does his work very well .
But for some other people that do n't have particular abilities , a good way to bacame successful is to try new things and take risk .
But when they know how do well something , often they only do this thing .
This is a pity because this beahviour makes their work so boring and i think that there is n't something that a person can know completely .
In every materias there is new knowledge , for example in biology the scientists discover a lot of new things every years .

Another serious problem is the `` knowledge division '' : for example an expert in lecterature can do n't know the common problem of pictures .
For the cultures of people is a damage : every person has to be a bit interested in a lot of things .

I think that real succesful people is people who have a great knowledge in a lot of thing .
