Everybody is asking to himself : will the number of cars reduce in the next twenty years ?
Nobody can know and forecast how life in general will be in the next 20 years , but all of us can and must hope that it will happen .
The use of cars create a lot of problems like pollution , traffic jam , but on the aother side using cars allows economy to run .

The biggest problem the use of cars creates is pollution , pollution that is produced by the smoke , the oil , and the gases that come out from our cars .
Everyday our cities are becoming more and more grey and black , dirty and not healthy at all to live in .

A direct cause of pollution is traffic jam .
Traffic is getting more and more terribly because everybody need and use cars not only to work but to live in general .
Why does this happen ?

This happens because there a lot of cities nowadays that have n't provided yet to improve with efficient systems of transportation like undergroung that covers not only the space under the city , but longer distances .

Actually the bus system it 's not really developed and it cant be efficiently developed because there are too many cars around the cities , and anyway everybody prefer to use their own cars than going with buses .

On the other side we know that cars make the economy run , actually to move cars need gasoline , and gasoline derivate from petroleum , thus there is a long wire that connects societies that live on cars .

Another example are the industries that produce cars , if we do not use cars anymore there would be an economic crisis and may be a period of grate depression , because not thousand but million of workers would lose their jobs .

Probably if we are able in the next future to understand that we are destroying our planet not only polluting but also sucking all the sources , and that we will reach a term in which it will not be possible anymore to go on with this situation , the number of cars will reduce , A solution will certainly come from technology research : we could use means of tranportation that do not pollute { like sun , wind , or hydrogen } but at the same time allowing the economy to run .
