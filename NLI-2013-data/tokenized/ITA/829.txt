I think it 's better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects .
Today we find a job world that does n't wait our studies , our trainings .
Graduates are much more than in the ` 90 , and afterall they are more younger , the challenge in these terms are very strong .
The industry , the company , ...
the job world marks point on these : your skills have to be more stronger than a while .

We study to find a good job , remunerative and , anyway , that turns back awards .
Because of this , if all of we have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ( who better of others , that 's clarify ) , we certainly have more problem to find the dreams ' job .

In spite of this , if somebody has a specialistic skill , maybe he 'll find less work announces that respond to his qualifing , but surely he wo n't challenge , such as others with a widespread standard knowledge , too hard to obtain that work .

I 'm an `` almost engineer '' , I see every day on the newspapers , on TV , at my university how hard is today find worthy people : too many people have to broad knowledge of many academic subjects , too many people have to challenge on the same jobs .

This is my personal opinion on this stateme
