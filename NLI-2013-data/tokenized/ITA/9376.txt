I think that it is more important for students to learn facts than it is for them to undestand ideas and concepts .
My choice is based on two reasons .

The first reasons is that , if you learns facts , you have a direct contact with the reality .
For example , in the university , you can learn more skills if you follow a laboratory than you follow a lesson of theory .
This is a good way not only for a student , but also for a worker .
In fact , if a worker has worked all of the day , he or she learn more things than he or she follows a lesson of theory .
I know my uncle 's experience that can be taken as an example .
In fact , he has followed a course to work in a chemistry industry , but he has learn the real way of working only when he has started to work in the chemistry industry .

The second reason is that learning facts helps a student to understand in a better way the contest in which he or she is studying .
For example , I remember that , when I follow the course in the `` Way of Transport '' , the professor helped me to build a naval motor not spoken me of how a naval motor is composed but he did to see me the naval motor and we built togheter .

To conclude , I do n't agree with the sentence because it is not true that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than for them to learn facts .
