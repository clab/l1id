I think that the stament present two very different point of view and both of them have advantages and drawbacks .
If you have a broad knowledge in many areas you can make a lot of connections from a topic to another and you can speaks with a lot of people about a lot of subjects .
You can have a general visions of the world and of the life but on the other hand you do n't have specialization in one of this topic .

You only know the first floor of the things not others floor .
In some cases you should request an help from an expert in order to resolve a problem in the best way .
If you specialized in one specific subject you can know all about this in other words you are an `` expert '' in your field .
I think that in this specialization there are two drawbacks : the first should be that you can not see the relathionship between this object and the rest of the world and the second that you know anything about the other academic subjects .

I think that it is very difficult say what it is right and what It is wrong , every people should understand what is better for him and for his specific case .

I think that it depends also from the job of anyone .
I make an example in order to clarify my statement : a scientist that works in a laboratory must have a specific preparation on his work and on the other hand a politic or a general manager should have a general vision of the world or the company .

So I know that in my essay I do n't answer to the question if I agree or not with the statement but for me It is very hard make a conclusion and say what it is the best one .
