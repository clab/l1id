Some people think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
According to me this statement is true but not all young people do not give a help to the their communities .
I live in an university college .
My friends and me are very busy with exams , classes and laboratories .
For example we are in the university from 8.00 am to 6.00 pm all the days !
So we return to the college very , very tired !
However , when we go back to the college we find time to help our community .
For examples some student work in the college 's garden , others help our secretary in the office , others help in the kitchen and so on .
I think that if you believe in something you will find time to do it .
I know , other student in my college do not help the community because they are out for all the day and go back to the college only for the dinner .
They tell us that they have not time because they study all the day .
But this is not a good reason , according to me .
I have to study too !
I want to pass all the exams and degree soon but I am in a college with other people and so I want to help my community because I think it is a right thing .
Today young people are busy in not important activities and so they have not time for important things , such as helping the community .
In the feature I hope my sons understand this because helping community is one of the best thing we can do in our lives .
