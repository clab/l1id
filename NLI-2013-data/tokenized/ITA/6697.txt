Since I was a child I thought that car was the most important way to transport in the world .
Now I think that there are too much car on the street in the most of industrialized country .
Big number of car in Europe , USA , Japan ...
is the most human problem in twentyone centuries .

More people thinks that in future we will drive future cars with Hydrogen alimentation , because this elements cannot produce any pollution .
But I do n't think so .
I 'm a student of Engineering Logistic and Transport and I know what I saying .
Big Study about this hydrogen cars shew how hidrogen alimentation is more expensive than oil or natural gas alimentation .
I 'm so disagree with the phrase that i can read on my left .
In Twenty years I think will be more cars than there are today .
I 'm so sure of that because there are much statistics that shew that salary people will grow up , so they can buy a car easier .
I think also that anyone likes travel in comfortable way .
About this I can say for myself experience that it 's so bettre travel by own car than trains for example ...
If you have a trip with your car you do n't have any time to respect and you feel more free and indipendent than any others way to move .

Finally I think that this affermation wo n't true , but I think cars pollution is a great problem in our society .
