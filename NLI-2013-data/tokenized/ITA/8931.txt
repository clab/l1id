Learning facts has no meaning if it is not supported by the capabilities of understandings ideas and concepts .
Therefore I would say that I agree with the statement .
Whenever you are learning a `` fact '' , you are learning something which has already been stated .
What is most important about facts are the ideas and the concepts that brought to that fact .

For example , talking about history , it is easy to learn so many facts about the French Revolution that whenever someone will question you , you will be able to answer with dates , bottles , names etc but if you do not understand the historical background you wo n't be able to understand how much the ideas and concepts developing at that time influenced the beginning of the French Revolution .

Another example could be better set by phylosophy , phylosophy is such a complex matter that just knowing the facts means nothing .
What makes philosophy so interesting is the flow of ideas and concepts that we are still using everyday .
We are not using facts .

Even when talking about political problems , for example , we can not only report the facts we have to support the facts with the ideas and concepts that created those facts .

It does not matter the course someone is attending , the key point is to understand the ideas and concepts and then it will be easier to remember and talking about facts .
