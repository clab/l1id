Students are too often required , by unskilled teachers , to learn pure and simple data instead of developing the ability to understand wider concept and ideas .
Before going on , I 'd like here to make a distinction between `` data '' and `` concepts '' .
A data is something we could learn by heart , that could be simply memorized , for example by reading and often easy to forget .
A concept , instead , is something complex and something that usually , once acquired , is almost impossible to abandon .
With concepts it works more or less in the same way than with experiences : usually , old people state that `` life is the best teacher '' and sometimes they 're right .
Life , with all its amount of experiences , teaches us how to react , how to behave and sometimes the direct experiences we make will be recorded in our minds forever , certainily in a more unforgettable way that the information we received at school .

In my opinion , so , concepts and experiences have the same value , or better , experiences can help in understanding wider concepts and viceversa .
The study of concepts , if done in a certain way , could help students in building a system of ideas of their own : it 's realy important , infact , to be able to start independently from one subject and to arrive to another , showing a flexible mind and the capability to develop an autonomous way of thinking ; simple data alone , instead , are not sufficient in order to learn how to link the information students get and how to build an integrated information system .

To conclude , it would be very useful for schools to develop an integrated educative system , expecially in Italy that normally lacks of practical aspects , which could coniugate practical experiences with the study of concepts .
The idea of a common core curricula and of different subject ( for istance literature in a scence faculty ) which could enrich one 's general knwledge , would be a good method to be implemented ..
