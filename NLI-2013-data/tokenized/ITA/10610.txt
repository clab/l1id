On the one hand , risk is something unknown so you can never bet if it 'll turn well or not , but on the other hand , I 'm sure if you do n't take any risk you 'll never be successful .

Although some people think that success is not about risk but just a result of their personal ability , I agree with the statement because different experiences convinced me to that .

First of all , I think about history and all the mathematicians , philosophers , writers ( let 's think about Galileo , Giordano Bruno , Newton and so on ) who often challenged the way of thinking of their age and because of that they almost died poor and alone .
But what 're we still studying in high school or even in a Ph .
D ?
Eventually they were able to carry their ideas through centuries and we would n't ever have their thoughts and teachings if they did n't risk during their life .
They contributed to create our way of thinking so they 're really are among the most successful people ever existed .

Another experience convinces me that risk is an inner quality in successful people .
I 'm talking about all the stories we read on the Internet or books about poor people who decide to change their lifes drastically , maybe starting a new business , or `` playing '' at the Stock Exchange market , and suddendly create an empire ( did n't Bill Gates start in a garage , did he ? )
If there were no risk , nothing would ever been created .
Now thousands of people work thanks to the risk taken by someone in the past , is n't that successful ?

From my point of view , nowadays many people could get wrong on the concept of successful , it 's not just about business and creating money and that 's why I consider successful all the international organization 's members ( and every peace \ maker there ) who everyday challenge incredibly dangerous situations risking their lives in war countries or simply helping children with mortal diseases in Africa .
That 's what really makes a better world .

In conclusion I think that everyone should take his or her own risks , maybe in what they do the best , in order to become successful considering that not any risk is worthy to take
