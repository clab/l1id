thinking that the students of today will be the people that will rule the world tomorrow makes me agree partially with the statement .
Infact , what would happend if two leaders of two different countries had to solve a problem concerning international relations .
If they only based their decision on facts that happened in the past , instead of analyzing and understanding the problem , they would probably take the wrong decision .
Nevertheless the same thing would probably happend if they did not consider or know any solution to past problems similar to the one they are facing now .

If a student is capable of understanding ideas and concepts he will be able to manage any situation regarding those ideas and concepts .
He will be able to analyze and study the problem in depth and , at the end , come out with a `` tailor made '' solution .
This is important because if you only learn facts you treat every similar situation in the same way , with the same solution , wich will probably be the wrong one .
This is because every situation is peculiar , it has millions of different variables , and , to solve a problem concerning that situation you have to know most of them , and that happens only if you understand the concepts that are behind that precise situation .

However , learning facts is important because if you do not rely on past experiences as a pattern for future decisions it is likely to take the wrong decision anyway .
What I would like to point out is the fact that both of these approach on how students should study are necessary because they compensate each other .
If you combine the them you increase drastically the possibility of finding a solution to problems concerning a topic because you understood the concepts and ideas that are behind it and you can compare a possible solution with the solutions that somebody else took for a similar problem .
In my opinion , a balanced mixture of both the two methods would be the best solution , that is why I only partially agree with the statement .
