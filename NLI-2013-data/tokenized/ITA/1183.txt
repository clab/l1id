Firstly , In my personal opinion is better to know few things about all of the general knowledge instead that know a very lot of things but about just a little field .

But for this reason the person should be ready for say something about all field of the talking arguments .
Secondly , i think that one person choses to start the universitary studies that person have done the choice of indicate in which specialization it wanna work and for this reasons i recon a people decided to begin its walk inside one academic program that person should be ready for take a study path for its future job .

Basicly , i wanna say that during the secondary school a person should have a general preparation about the jobs and during the academic life that person choses its specialization .
For these reasons i thing that to study many subjects are very important but not when a person is 20 years old but when a person is in the secondary school while during the academic life a person that chooses its path should study only what that person wanna study .

Basicly i recon is better to have a punctually selection of courses inside the academic program and i hope that the university in the future will start to recon a person must study only what it want .

For example i have to study a lot of different subjects in my university because my engeniring program is very huge and for become automation engeniring i have to study subjects that are very different but the problem is that when the academic program jumps from a thing to another and when these two things are very different a student could lost his target and if an academic program wanna construct with a lot a no connected pieces it is very difficult to understand where that program bring ...

I do not want to explain how the university should work but just that if an university control if its program connected each subjects is the better thing for the students but also an academic program must provides to understand to final target of the course that a student has taked .

Finally , the academic subjects must be thinked of the student 's path and they do not thinked over the single subjects and there is also important to understand that the student normally not have clear ideas about his target and the orientation studies are also important for decide where a student wanna arrive at the last of his studies .
