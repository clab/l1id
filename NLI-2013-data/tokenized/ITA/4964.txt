I 'm agree whit this statement .
For example , thinking to the i-pod , a new type of mp3 music , the advertisement that the productors do , is too unreal .
They say that if you have this mp3 , you have more opportunities to be considered by your friends , or by other people , that you have something more that give you what other have n't , give you celebrity or more opportunity with the girls or the boys .

But this is only an object that beetwen a few months you will change because is out of mode .
Is nothing special , it ca n't give you everything that they said .
The producers use the pubblicity to bring the people , to influenced their choices and for doing it they must invent , they must associate to their object the figure of geat , wonderfull , special even if is a common object .

Another examples could be rappresent by the use of yogurts for the regularity .
In Italy there are more societies tha make yogurt to help the people to go to the bathroom , and they say that if you took one of this every day you can get it .

But if you try , the quality that them could apport to you is not real how they said .
It 's dipend from people to people .
So we do n't believe in everything that they tell , because there is always someone that tends to tell a lay for having we to his part .
