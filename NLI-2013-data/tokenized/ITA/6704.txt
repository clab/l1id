The use of the car has an hisorical process that involve f , economical interests and habits that make us now to have , in the developed countries , almost one car each .
If we have a look on the recent statistics about the use of the cars and we look at the trend it `` s very difficult to prospect a diiferent situation in the next twenty years .
I am almost sure that the number of the cars in use in the 2006 will be more than the one we have today .
As I was sayng above there are too many things related with the use of the car such as economical interests and human habits .
The huge amount of money connected with the cars field is in the main part related at the petroil world and at the petroil companies that have too many interest in increase the production and the sell of the cars that are one of the main petroil user because of fuel used by theyr engines .

An other important reason that , for me , will rise the number of the cars in the next twenty years is linked to our habits .
It is shown in many sociology studies how is difficult to change our feelings , our thinkings connected with our background , our habits .
Well , the car is one of the thing we use more often during our lifetime even if we do not drive it and we are just passanger .
Since we are child we consider the car as a part of our life and I think will be very diffult for people to reduce the use of the car .
Finally , to evaluate I think that both economical interests and our habits according with the statistical trend of the use of the car wiil take us in the future to face more cars and , thus , likely an even more polluted world , at least for the next twenty years .
I hope that later people will start to change theyr habits and money will be not the main target of our life in order to use mor pubblic transportation or different kind of energies .
