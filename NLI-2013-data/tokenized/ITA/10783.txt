I 'm completly in accord with the statement .
I think that a big part of successful it 's the capacity of to take risk and explore new frontiers .

At this time , the world change very fast , I think that if you do only wath you know without to try to emprouve yourself you can never reach success .

For example Heinstein it was yes very well prepared but also he had the capacity of risk to provide at the humanity something radical new for that time .
Just thinking about the Theory of Relativity was something extraordinary fore the 1930s and to be able to publish someting like that with the warry of to be under attack for the puplic Scientific World It 's demostrate courage .

Ther are a lot of examples in according with the statment , Steve Jobs with the Apple Computers and the I-Pod , or Bill Gates with Microsoft , they are people leaving every day with the risk .

I really admire that kind of people because I 'm really do n't know if I will be able to adopt one behavior so `` risking addict '' .
Not only in the businnes world but also in the ONG world the risk it 's a big component of the day .
For me that kind of people are really exceptionnal , I would like to be able to live like them .
I try every day to improve myself to take risk and to not be so conservative .

In this period I am under application for bisinnes school and every time that I think about the school where to apply I try to say : `` go for it ...
and try ! '' even if I know that this school it 's a `` top ten school '' and the admission it 's very hard I try to not be afraid about this and I go to take my risk .

In conclusuion , this is the way that I decided to live , because if you stop to thinking too much , the majority of time you are lost !
