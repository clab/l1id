I really hope that in few years the number of cars go down !
Today the cars in our cities are too much : our air is drammatically polluted and this is because of the cars ; there is also a lot of traffic and sometimes you take one hour to go only on the other side of your city .
I think that today all of people and governments have understand that the problem is big and important : probably in the next years they are going to approve some politics in order to reduce the number of cars and to offer some substitutive service or to improve the ones that exist .
I 'm speaking about bus , for short or medium travels , and trains .

I think that the govern and the citizen af all the word have to cry to obtain this .
I think that petrol companies and car industries that probably wants the number of cars increas in the next day ; ca n't be heard by the government because the most important things are our wealth and quality of life .

For a family of four persons is today quite normal to have two or three cars .
I think this is very dangerous for our society .
If there are a lot of cars the problem is first of all the pollution , that i think is drammatically important and is necessary a solution very soon .

Other problems are the traffic and the parking .
For all these reason i think that there will not be fewer cars in use in the next years because is really dangerous for the population .
If the number of cars increas i would be very warried and i think we will have a lot of problems for our wealth .
So i hope that the umanity is not so stupid to loke more at the possesions , likes cars , than at the wealth .
