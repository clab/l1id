I have sadly to disagree with the statement , althought this prospective would be a good thing for the Earth 's wealfare .
Confronting the nowadays situation of cars with tha increasingly growth of the world population , the prevision , also for such a far future is not good .

Every family , today , have at least two cars and every year there is a new request of new models that could be adapted to the incoming different aspects of life .

The main fuel we use is the oil and although it is not a renewable source , and scientists said that in about forty years it will ended , we are already experimenting new ways to make our cars running as well .

The pollution producted by cars circulation , because of the `` black gold '' are one of the main causes of hole in the ozon .
However , we have more echological consciousness now and , a lot of new cars prototypes are made to respect the Nature where the human being lives .

We are addicted to the use of cars and others locomotions vehicles , and I thing we are not going to renounce to them .
The car is also a staus symbol of wellness , and that is another reason why growing population such as China or Asian populations in general , are going to buy cars for the next 20 years
