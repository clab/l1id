I personally think that young people give a lot of time helping their communities , but we must specify the age of these young people because when I think about young people I include people from 18 to 30 years old .
Lets think about all the volounters in their contry or in Africa , I really think that 's huge .

In fact , if we see more closer all the association or organosation we would find a lot of young people helping the next , trying to give to the people who have very little the help they need .
As well all the soldiers that go and beat to defend their contry are really honorable .
I think that you really must have something in you that push you hardly to do those things because it is really difficult .
We should be very altruist to go and fight with people who needs support .
I 'd say that one of the beautiest quality for a person is the altruism , it is something really good for a men to have and use it .

Moreover , we can think about all the great fight led by thew young people during the history and now , for examples the pacific fight of Martin Luther King or all the parade made by young people to stop the war in world .

Eventhough not only young people helps the todays society Finally , even if a lot of young people are not helpful as other we should respect everyone for his business , because not everybody has the same quality .
