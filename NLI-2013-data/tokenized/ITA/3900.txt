I think the community has to help itself , it is not only a moral obligation of young people !
What do you mean for young people ?
Teenagers ?
A 30 years old man is still young , but he is not a young man for the community !
All the people have to give time to helping the community !
All the people do not care about the others , only a few people , like the men who go to Africa to helping the poor populations !
They give all their life to helping the community .
As you can see they are not young people , so all the people do not give time to helping , above all the youngs .
But now the society is different , it is not like 50 years ago , there 's been a lot of changes , the people need different things , nowadays a young man need to study , to realise himself !
How can I help a person if I do not feel well ?
I have to realise myself , I have to study , sometimes I have to relax , sometimes I need to have fun .
Young people are a particular kind of people , but I think they are the most important part , they are the future , so they have to realise themselves and a day they will be able to help other people , but not today , it is not the most important thing now ; the old men can help the others , because they do not have other things to do , now they can use what they learn in the past !
May be in the past the young people had more responsabilities , I do not know , and I cannot , but as I said before , the time has changed , the time is a circle , today it is your turn , tomorrow it will be mine .
I 'm young and I 'll have time to help the others , I wish , now I have to care about myself .
