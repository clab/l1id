I am absolutely convinced that it is much more important to specialize ourselves in one specified topic if we are strongly interested in it .
This idea is deep rooted in me , because I am sure that a person will be able to achieve higher aims if that individual decide to focus his studies on few specific topics .
Nowadays there is a strong competition running both in professional fields and in academic fields .
That is why I am convinced that only if you are able to perfectly manage a topic you can succed in your field of interest .

Moreover it is necessary to consider that , if you have a broad knowledge of a lot of different subjects , you can not have a deep knowledge of anyone of them .
You probably will be able to talk about a lot of different things , but You will not be able to deeply analyse anyone of these .

However , it is just a matter of how deep is our need to command and masterise a specific topic .
Our society is a very superficial society , with the massive use of the Internet we have been teaching to surf on information and just to obtain what we need from these information , without analysing the different item stending behind a subject .

Otherwise it is very important for a student who want to achieve high aims , to analyse many different aspects of their field of interest .
I am convinced that it is charming to analyse a problem and to study it from many different points of view .
This will give people a strong opportunity of improvement and of growth , both as an student and as a future worker .

Specializing in one topic , and leaving all the other subjects , is a very strong challenge , and actually it is a risk because you have to take a decision about the main field of knowledge you are going to develop probably during you whole life .
But , if you like challenges , probably you will obtain higher aims .

Life is full of choices , and this is a very difficult choice for you career , and for you life .
But I think that challenges and choises make life colourfull and funny .
