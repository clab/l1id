Is that possible determine a period of life for enjoying life ?
Do young people enjoy life more than the older ones ?
I bilieve enjoying life is a metter of state of mind .
why ?

I met a lot of young people who were only concerned about the future without living the present , in other words young people not applying the `` carpe diem '' philosophy , and I know what I 'm stating because I 'm one of them .
We carry about the future problems that may cannot even occur , we do n't have time for nothing that 's not correlated to study achieving good marks and working .
And as I stated , from my experince these behaviours are incriseangly commons .

Now , what can be said about mature and more savy people ?
They are often not so young and the have learned a lot from the difficulties of life .
From that , these `` lighting minds '' can really understand what is really important in life and what worths to be worryed about .
As a result , by using this knowledge and life experience this people can allocate energy and time to readily come up with good solution for the problems the encounter .
For example , an experienced manager seeing his stocks going down does n't get too much worryed because he knows that 's part of the game and he will be likely to wait for better to times to sell his stocks .
Probably he will play golf and enjoy his time while the youngers are desperate thinking about how they 'll manage to get rid of imminent losses .

In sum , in my opinion enjoying life it is for sure not a matter of age but a matter of state of mind , and it depends on maturity and having a good vision of life .
Please be optimistic !
Please enjoy !
