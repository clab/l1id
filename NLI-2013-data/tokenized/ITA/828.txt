I do n't support the idea that is better to have broad knowledge than to specialize in a specific subject .
Therefore I think that beeing professional means that a person has to acquire many theorical concepts at the beginning of his carrier , but he has to grow his specific skills in his major during the job-s life .

During my life I found many reasons that bring me on this idea .

First of all , a person who chooses his specific subject can be focused on his personal goals .
Infact , when someone does n't care about nothing in particular , he is usual to find a job just to earn money and take more time to think about his intersets .
The time is very precious for personal knowledge and for the life in general .

Second , be focused in a specific knowledge 's area does n't enhance more problems , otherwise more alternatives .
I really believe that there are many aspects in every subjects and everyday we have to make your best choice .
For instance , when a student is improving his skills on many matters it is more possible that he will fail in one of those , than onether guy who is learning about only one subject .
Flexibility is n't a synonim of the dispersion of personal ideas .

Personally , when I graduated two years ago I chose where I would like to work , in which sector and what will be my goals .
I really appreciated the advices of my parents whose suggested me to find a general job to be able to change it in the future .
Anyway , I preferred to be focused on my major .
Now I am gratifyied by my decision and I will suggest the same to my friends that are still studying .

For those reasons I discourage everyone to have broad knowledge .
