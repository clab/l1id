I completely agree with the statement .
I really think that something has to change .

I mean , there are a lot of cars on the streets every day and people is always buying new cars .
Somethimg has to change otherwise there will not be enought space for people !

Having cars has its problems .
Pollution firs of all .
All the cities has to fight against the smog and the gases that damage the enviroment .
They are trying to encourage citizens not to use their cars .
And what about the petrol ?
The petrol nowadays is quite expensive and the resouses are not endless .
Talking about driving a car , we can understand easily that too many vehicles make long queues and a lot of traffic on the streets .
This means a considerable waste of time .

Cars also need places to be parked , thus a lot of space is reqiured .

That is why I think that something has to change , and that in the future people will prefer to use public transports in order to avoid all these proplems .

But I also think that people are becoming more and more aware of all the services that the internet can offer .
I mean that a lot a person now prefers to work at home using the computer and communicate by e mails rather than driving to the office .
And this way of working is becoming always more common .

The possibility of buying good on internet has the same effect .
People can do shopping staying at home .
They do not have to go out , stay in lines , drive to the shops or to the markets .

Those are all the reasons that make me belive that in the next century we will have less cars than today .
I can not stand the traffic anymore .
I hope I will get a job that allows me to stay at home .
I will buy foods on the internet and I will move from a place to another by buses , that in my town are very numerous .

I do not need a car !
And I think that lots of people will follow my example , also because is a good way to safe money and time .
