in my opinion would be great to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects but to be more realistic i think that is better to specialize in one or a very narrow range of specific subjects .

First of all i guess that it would be very difficult to learn about many subjects and that who wants to follow this way have to spend so many effort on it .
I totally disagree with the statement and the reason , which i mentioned previously , is because i prefer to be more realistic , in fact i think that if you are specialize in a specific subject you can improve your skill about it and you can get a job or be hired from someone more likely than if you have few notions about many things .
Another important point is that if you are spacializing in a particular thing you are supposed to be very interested in it and you can really enjoy to study it and go more in depth .
with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can probably just have a shallow knowledge of them instead of study them deeply .
at last i think that is pretty wrong to have a wide knowledge spread among a lot of subjects even because i think that without specialist , the world , would n't be as it is know , i guess that it would be still as it was in the past , without all the new inventions that changed history society and our way of live .
i know that probably i did n't argument my ideas in depth and i am probably too confused but that is because i was trying to disguise that i do n't agree with the statement because i do n't believe to be able to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects and i am disappointed about it .
lol .
