I completely agree with the statement that it is more important for a student to understand the concept , the idea behind what he is reading , than it is for him to learn facts .

I state that on the basis of two reasons :
1 ) understanding the concepts is the only way a student , and a person in general , has to help his mind not to forget .
2 ) it is implied that an idea , a concept , can be adapted to several other situations .
Concerning the first argument , there is no doubt that a lot of students today , maybe stressed by the exams and by the fixation to obtain the best grades , tend to learn a subject even without understanding it untill the end , I mean , without going behind the words and the mere facts .
It is not difficult to affirm that this is not the best approach to the studies , because it generally lead to forget in a short period of time whatever that person have learned .
On the contrary , according to me , only when a student manages to have clear , to catch the concept of the subject , of the different arguments , has reached his goal as a student and satisfied alle the efforts the teacher has made .
Everything that is well understand is unforgettable , and it is confirmed by my personal experience , considered that I was not a good student , in the sense I 'm supporting , until the beginning of the secondary school .
In fact , whatever I learned during these years is still present and clear on my mind .

Understanding the idea that is behind the mere facts has also a second advantage : the concept can be easily adapted , and in this sense we can say that it has a wider `` field of validity '' .
In fact , it results almost natural to think that a concept can be used even when the facts at its basis are completely changed .
And this is what all the students in theory should do : learning something already known , abstracting the concept that it contains and adapting it to facts and evidence that are still unknown !
