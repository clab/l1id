The mindful body : a peculiar paradigm

I think that specialize in one specific subjcet is better .
Specialising you can give to your reserch a peculiar prospective and than increase your field of study .
Let give us some example based on my experience as anthropologist .
I think they could clearly illusterate what I mean .
During my anthropological field work in Cameoon , West Africa , I argued that there were lots of intresting aspects of this african society ( for example kinship , economical or religious sistems etc . ) .
However I Decided to foucus my reserch on witchcraft and sorcery .
Observing life in a small village I saw that I colud note phenomena of witchcraf in all social fabric .
The occult power was used a socilal and economical levellhood .

Moreover when I wrote my BA 's thesis I used a specifical prospective and a peculiar method of analysis .
I used the post-modern prospective on hidden cults of japanese chirstians and i demostrated how these hidden cults influenced the modern japanese chistians and others religious movements .

I tried to anlize just one aspect of the African or Japanese society and I tried to explain how these particular aspects reflected on whole society in different levels .
I think that have a broad knowledge of may academic subjects is not good or usefull .
A man could not be omniscent - as god - so is uneuseful try to accumulate many many notions about different arguments and topics .
Thus men , students , professors and so on need to recognize their limits and to work - as better as possible - on within their field of study .

This are the reasons why I think that specialize in one specific subject is the only way that men could adopt to costruct a brand new paradigm about knowledge .
