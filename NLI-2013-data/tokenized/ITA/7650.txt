I agree partially with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
I think that joining a group led by a tour guide is the best way to visit a place for the first time .
I also belive that visiting the same place on my own for the second time is a good way to discover more informations .

I usually prefer to take part in a tour guided group when I visit a place for the first time .
It gives me the opportunity to meet new people from different cultures and learn more detailed information abuot the history and the secrets of the place .

However , I also like to visit places on my own after I was there with a group led by a tour guide .
Two years ago I went to Rome and I decided to join a group of people that had a tour guide , it was amazing and the guide was really knowledgeable .
He gave us a lot of artistic and historical informations about the famous Roman ruins but at the end of the tour the guide said that because of the short time available , we could n't visit all the important attractions .
I was really curious to see what we missed so I decided to go back in such a marvellous City full of imponent structures of the past .
Last year , I returned in Rome and I really enjoyed my time discovering all of the particular things that were not mentioned in the previous tour .
I also experienced the famous italian food in such nice restaurants that are spread out all around the historical area .
I could feel the real essence of a city where the ancient ruins are mixed with things of everyday life .

That was defenetly the best experience of my life and I could n't have the possibility to enjoy it , neither going there on my own for the first time , nor just going there with a group led by a tour guide .
