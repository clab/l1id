It is an old statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .
In my opinion this is true for all the new old generations .
Always will be an old lady that looking at some guys going to disco will be agree with this statement .
But , at the same time , I am totally sure that , when she was an athletic never-stopping girl , there was an old man telling the same to her .
So things are !
In my opinion , for the old generation , is a sort of criticism to the running time .
It is quite understandable that an old person feel a little envy of the freedom and enjoyfull life 's style of younger people .
Of course they have forgotten how amazing and enjoyfull was their life when they were twenty !
On the other hand , we , the last young 's generation , can not denay that times are changed and that our parents , or granparents , had much more resposabilities and no so many ways for enjoing their time .
Above all , nowadays the time to enjoy never stops : everyone of evry age can have a lot of funny .
It does n't matter how old are you , if you are twenty or sixty .
It is suitable for everyone travel all around the world , gain , or lost , in to the casino , do bujing-jumping , make news friends , go dancing , go to concerts or do all the crazy things you want .
The age is no more a problem .
So the statement , now , should be rewrite as : `` Old people enjoy life more than younger people do '' .
Supporting it , there are a lot of statistics afferming that old people are enjoyng a lot their retirement .
