Personally , I totally agree with this statement and strongly believe that people 's succcess is mostly based on their experience .
Perhaps , point of view would be easier to explain with some examples .
Just look at the past .
Most of the scientists reached their goals because they always tried to try something new .

Reamain focusing in just what ones know , it 's clearly a sign of the fear of trying something new and difference , and of course that kind of people is scared by not being enough or able to manage the new situation .

If you have never tasted a new food , how could you know if you like it or not ?
Just with the knowlegment , it is possible to make clear decision , to have a complete view of the situation and to choose in a more liberal way .
Let 's take for example the role of a judge .
How can a judge express his verdict without knowing what really happen ?
It is not possible at all .
The same rule is applicable to the ordinary life , where nowadays we are always tempting by something new - sometimes good , sometimes not .
To make a sucessfull decision , in my opinion , the best way to act is to try and know everythings related with the topic , and then - just after this - to take a final decision .

Being an expertise in something , it 's absolutely a good value , but it is not enogh to be sucessfull .
