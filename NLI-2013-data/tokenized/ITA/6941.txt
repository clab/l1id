I do n't know if be agree with this idea or not .
I would like it .
I hope is the result of a scienific research so to be suppored by statistic , sociology , psicology and university professors .

The only idea I can use to approach this thing in a scientific way is to think abouth the forces around this topic .
There are 2 things who confirme my hope : the traffic and the cost of petrol .
From the other side ther are other 2 things that destroy my hope , they are : the number of people how live in good economic conditions , the economic car business thet in more than one country is supported by the central governament .

Starting from the traffic , in the biggest cities in the world , from Milano and Roma to Tokyo , London or New York the traffic problem is very very big .
A possible solution is the growt of public transport .
For example the underground ( or tube like in London is colled ) is prefered by a great number of people respect the car to move in the city .
For the petrol cost , I think that is to long and to complicate for me to approach a solution .

From the other side lukely ( with economic growt ) today more people can buy a car then 30 years ago , so is possible that more people buy the car .
More than this , the car in some places ( in rapid growt in the last years ) are considered like a status simbol , a way to confirm the economic power of the family

NOTE : our focus abouth the use of the cars and not abouth how many cars will be buy .
