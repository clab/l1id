It 's actually hard for me to take a firm position about this topic , as often happens to me when I am in front of this type of absolute statements ; I will therefore try to explain why for me the statement is true AND false at the same time .

Considering first the physical aspect , it cannot be denied that a lot of energy runs through young and healthy subjects veins and just for this simple reason they enjoy the things of life more , literally .
Moreover we have to consider that young people vision of life is unlimited , meaning with this that they look at life as something that is not going to end ; at least not soon .
The latter provides them with more reasons and energies to enjoy their existence .
My young brother , aged 7 , for example is able to play all day long without rest enjoying every single moment and feeling very intense emotions and , importantly , with not many worries and responsabilities .
I envy him .

On the other hand , while the quality of life is underestimated by youngsters , while elder people know ( or should know ) what is the value of life , because they are not left with much of it .

They appriciate more consciously the gift of life .
They can use their wisdom to make better choices .
They do n't feel things with the same intensity of the time when they were young , which even mean that they do n't feel sufferings so intensively .
The know exactely what they want , and they feel less lost in any kind of situation .

My grandmother for example is 97 and now she is in a facility hospital .
She does not move around so much as she 's on a wheel chair but ...
Well , the way she smiles when my mother or I go visit her , you can really tell that she is valuating that little episode in a way that a young and in a good shape person would n't be able to do , because he | she would likely be very worried about the future , the job , and many other things .

In the end it depends on the personal attitude , as always .
