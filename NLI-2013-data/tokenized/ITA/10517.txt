I disagree with the statement , because for me is ever necessary to take some risks and try new things to have succes and not only when you know how to do well .
In fact for me , if you dont't try one thing , you do n't try another things because you do n't have the experience that the precedent thing can give to you .
For example , if you do n't try to use a bycicle , you do n't learn to go whit it , and after you do n't learn to use a scooter , becaus is more difficult than use a bycicle .
But if you learn to go whit a bycicle , after you can use also the scooter ; so you can use both of them .
The Experiences that you try to do , help you for enthire your life .
This is the main reason because i say that is important to take risks and try new things and new adventures .
And for me also the worst experiences are important because also this experiences help you not to commit the same errors another times .
In fact , for example , if you drik mich alchool befor drive , and after you make ani incident , you learn that you do n't drink any alchool befor you drive for the next time .
So , in the end , to take succes , for me is important find to try the Higest numbers of thing you can do
