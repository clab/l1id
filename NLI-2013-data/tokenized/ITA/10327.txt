I completely agree with the statement .
I think that the only way to be successful is to fix a target and , once it has been achieved , to move it forward and try to get it again , even if there are a lot of possibilities to drop .

Many people think that the fortune has a big role to the way of success and I agree with them but I also think that fortune kisses just few people .

I also think that success has not to be , always , linked to the money : there are a lot of good examples of doctors who are , of course , success person , but they are not rich as a big manager or owner of a multinational company .

I also do n't think that success people are better than not-success people : there are people that naturally tend to the success and others that judge their life good enough without any kind of success .
It happens that not-success people are happier than the others .

I think I 'm a person who is forced to tend to the success : I do n't want a normal life as a lot of my friends have .
I 'm fighting every day , fixing targets , sometimes impossible to get , in order to be able one day to say : `` OK , that ' s enough for me '' .
I absolutely do n't think to be better than the others , as I said before , but I feel inside something that pushes me forward every single day : it 's not a good sensation because there 's always something I have to do or to run for .
After the University , I moved to China for work : it has been a big chance for meut a lot of my friends disagreed with my choise because China was too far and I did n't need to go there to have a job .
The problem was that I did n't want a normal job and it 's exacty what success people want : they want to do something that is not common to other people in order to build a good career .
