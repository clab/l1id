how many cars there will be in the future ?
it 's impossible to know , but we could think about different ipotetic solutions .
for example if the petroil will be less in the future probably an effective reduction of cars could be there in the next twenty years .
but maybe a new scientific solutions will be find , and a new engine like oxigen or hydrogen could be emply for replace the petroil .

in my opinion i think cars will not decrease in the future .
why ?
it is very simple , every year there is an esponential growth of people in the world .
what does this means ?
only one thing , more people more cars .
i think at this time , every family has one cars for each familiy 's members more or less .

for example my family is composed by 4 person , me , my brother and my parents .
me with my mother drive the same car , my father has two cars , my father 's company gives him one , the second car he buys for sparetime .
my brother has a car and also a motocycle .
at the end there are 4 cars in my family how we are .

how i could think that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use there are today ?
it 's impossible .

the only solution , it is enlarge the public communication system , for example put in the city 's roads more bus or tram than now , or increase the railways services , built underground system in the big city .

to support this solution is necessary also an other factors : make cheaper than now the public services .
until now if i use my car is cheaper than buy a railway ticket .
every year the ticket is more expensive .
why does it happens ?
the governement shoul make easier to use public service not harder , also for a different reason : decrease the pollution of environement , use in the best way the nature 's energies and does n't waste them because very soon can be ended .

for all of these reasons , i think is necessary a large dose of good intention to make possible the statement : fewer cars in the future .
everyone must to do something to built this dream !
