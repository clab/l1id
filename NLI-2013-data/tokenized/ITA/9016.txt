Yes , I agree with the statement wich says the it is more important for a student to understand ideas and concept .
I think thet it is right because I have never had so much memory for name , dates and fact , but I had more memory for concept and ideas .
I think olso thet if one person can understand the concept of a problem will be able to describe the fact .
Dates , names and fact can be remembred reading many times the tex , but the concepts no .
Concepts must be expleined very well by a teacer , and it is important thet students can ask him some question if the concept is not so much clear .
Another very important thing is thet the teacher must be very able to explein the conjcept : he must speak slow and he must be shure thet all the students have understood whot he wonts to say .

To be shure he should ask his students if the concept is clear every time before go on with his explenation .
The fact thet it si more important for students to understand ideas is more valid for logical and scientifical disciplines , were the most important thing is to understand the method .

Disciplines like story and geography need thet students can remember facts and name , but olso in this case it is very impotant thet students understand the concept as , for exemple , the ways for an historical fact has happened , wich are the motives thet makes it to happens .

For the study of geographie it si not important to know just where a place is situeted , but it is impostant to understand the culture of thet town .
