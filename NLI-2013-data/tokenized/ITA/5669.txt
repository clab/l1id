I think that the greatest part of advertisements give an idea of the product that is not true .
Industries are only focused on their business , on money and for this reason they are able to do anything .
In addition I would like to put in evidence the fact that sometimes annuncements are realized in a particular way aimed to provide not real characteristics or trying to hide other ones .

Clearly I belive that statments are developed only after a deep and long period of studying and reflection about which can be the better advertisement , the proper way of underlying something .

Moreover i belive that sometimes theese kind of statements do n't make sense .
For example , some years ago my family decided to buy a new bike and we considered differents opportunities .
After a few , we thought to have the just product for our needs .
We watched that bike during a programme on tv .
It was fantastic all of my family desired to have one of that incredible bicycle with that cool color .
Suddenly we decided to phone and we had to wait for two weeks .
We were waiting anxiously , imagining what we could do with the new bike , when it arrived .
Immediately we tried it .
I cannot explain how much astoniced and alo worried we began we at the first curve my father broken the wheel .
It was incredible but it happened .
In that moment all of us realized why that bike was so cheap .
From that moment I do n't belive in any kind of advertise since I ca n't see and test a product by my self .
Concluding I would like to suggest to every one to follow my advertisement , in this way we can oblige industries to realize true annuncement .
