I disagree with the statement that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than tere are today .
Today the employes , management men or more generally the workers go to the office by the car .
The roads , day after day , are full of the cars .
Less persons take , the bus or the train to go at office or stabliment .

Besides in these years family go on holiday in week/end , and so every week they prefer to take the car for to reach the holiday city that they take bus , train ...

Besides the modern people is less active that the past people .
In the past the people go to the office or stabliment walking for three or four miles , instaend today the boys take the car for to accross the street !!

Another reason because it is impossible that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today is the price that the cars sell to public .
In the past the price of the cars is more expensive than today , and so less persons can to buy the cars .

Today the boys of 19/20 years old buy the cars , because the price of the cars must share in several parts distribuited on plus years and so the young boys can buy the cars .
