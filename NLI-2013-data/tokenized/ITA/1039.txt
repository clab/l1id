I totally agree with this statement .
I 'm really convinced that having a widespread knowledge of many different subjects is better than specializing on just one of them because of several reasons .

First of all , since I 'm not sure of where I 'm going to be or what I 'm going to do in the near future I 'd rather prefer to have many choices in front of me , many paths to run instead of focusing on just one way that maybe could even be the wrong one .
Acting like this I will get ready and prepared to take any valuable opportunity aroused along my personal scholastic journey .

In addition to this , I think that specializing on only one topic would be more boring and annoying than approaching different types of subjects .
In spite of opening and studying every day the same books and the same lectures I believe that daily shifts from one subject to another could make your life more appealing , still keeping the chance to drop the courses which do n't match your initial expectations .

Finally the most important reason , my personal thirst of knowledge .
Since I was a child I used to read any kind of book , to watch any type of program and to observe everything that could strike my attention so I would really love having at my disposal a broad experience and knowledge in order to say my opinion in each context .
I want to be a person ready to explain my beliefs wherever I am , whatever I `` m talking about without feeling uncomfortable or inappropriate .
Hope to be like this ...
