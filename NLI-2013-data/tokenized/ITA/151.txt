The massive development of advertisement strategies represents one of the most relevant characteristics of the `` consumption society '' we live in .
The goal of the marketing is not necessarily to make the product seem much better than it really is , but rather to attract the consumer 's attention on the product .

First , in many cases , emphasis is put on one special feature of a certain product , rather than on overall quality .
We will illustrate such claim with an example .
Advertisements of soap to clean the kitchen board have been some of the most common commercials on TV at least for the last twenty years .
Producers know that , in spite of minor differences , all the competing products are very similar .
Market targets are likely to be aware of this , too .
Therefore , these commercials usually do not try to convey the message that product A is better than B , C , D , but rather they aim to stress a particular feature .
For example , one advertisment might put the emphasis on the nice smell produced by the soap , another on how fast it is to use .
In this way , each producer aims to differentiate her product from the other along a particular dimension and to become attractive for a particular target of consumers , thus creating a special market niche .

Second , advertisements usually rely on a specific eye-catching image that stays impressed in the consumer 's mind .
Referrign again to the example illustrated in the previous paragraph , companies often hire a movie or tv star who acts as housekeeper in the commercial .
Such tactic has nothing to do with emphasizing how good the product is .
However , it creates a reference point for the housekeeper who is about to go to do the grocery .
It is a somewhat subliminal message that conveys the message : `` if I use this product , I coudl be like her one day ! ''
.
Another good example refers to the commercials for cars .
Most of them show the car crossing deserts or magnificient coast roads in exotic places .
There is probably no consumer who really cares about whether or not the car can really cross a desert .
Yet , such image stays impressed , and the consumer will inadvertently associate that model of car with an idea of freedom , long travels , adventure .

In addition , there are some commercials that are just deliberately stupid .
They rely on some joke or message that provokes the same reaction in everybody : `` who the hell created such a stupid commercial ! ? ''
.
Well , if potential consumers wonder about this , the goal has been achieved .
The product has a place in the consumer 's mind .
And maybe that brand name will come out when he or she goes to the commercial center the day after .

In conclusion we want to stress how it is of course important that consumers perceive the product as a good one , not as a `` lemon '' .
However , this is probably a secondary point in the mind of a creator of advertisements : the emphasis is not on the exaggeration of the quality of the product , but rather on the way it is possible to attract consumers ' attention on the promoted product , through the usage of particular creative messagges .
