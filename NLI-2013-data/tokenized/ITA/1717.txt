In my opinion is impossible to theoretically define whether it is better to manage several academic subjects or to go more in depth with just one subject .
Indeed , it really depends on the field you will apply this academic knowledge to .

I think I 'm in an ideal position to give some examples of different situations to which the two different approaches apply .
So far , in fact , I had two very different working experiences , the first one as a Controller in a multinational company and the second ( and current ) one as a Management Consultant .

On the one hand , during my first work experience as a Controller I had to get a deep understanding of all the accounting principles that regulated the activities of the Finance department of my company .
It was a really tough experience because I had to get familiar with a lot of very specific and technical subjects since otherwise the quality of my work might have been affected .
I had to develop a very good memory to remember all the details typical of this kind of field .

On the other hand , during my current work experience as a Management Consultant I need to be more flexible than spcialized , so that now I 'm familiar with a huge variety of subjects .
I work , in fact , in several different industries - such as automotive , consumer goods and banking - and in very different companies ' functions - like for instance marketing , human resources and finance .
Given that I usually work on very short projects , I always need to get familiar with the context of a project in a short period of time , which means that I need to have at least a generic background on that particular field .
This usually allows me to work on the project without necessarly getting a very deep understanding of how the related inustry/functions works .

To conclude , i would say that I generally prefer dealing with many different subjects rather than specializing myself .
Nevertheless I think , as my working experience shows , that there always could be situations where you also need to get a specialistic knowledge .
