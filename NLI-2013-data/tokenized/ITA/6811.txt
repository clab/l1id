I agree with this statement .
In fact , I 'm sure that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
Everyone knows about the catastrophic consequences deriving from pollution .
For example , our planet is becoming warmer and warmer and the sea level increased rapidly in the last few years .
I think that pollution is a great problem , but I believe that we can do something in order to save the earth .

What can we do ?
We can prefer public transport , such as buses or metros , to cars .
For instance , every day I go to university on foot .
It 's a good attitude , because I can have some phisical movement , I can meet friends on my way , I can stop for a while to buy a newspaper and , most of all , I can enjoy my city .
I relax when I go out for a walk and I suggest that you try to do the same thing .
So , I suggest that you prefer ecological means of transport in order to respect our planet and to defend it from pollution .

Public transport is less expensive than cars , so that you can spend that money in other ways .
Moreover , through buses you can socialize , you can share the travel with others or , if you are lucky , you can meet interesting people on your path .
For example , last week , while I was coming back home , I met Giovanni Sartori , an Italian writer .
I was very surprised !
I asked him some question about his latest work , called `` La mala costituzione '' .
He told me that he prefers taking the bus because it helps him to feel close to common people .
I agree with this idea , because I think that through public transport you can share , not only a travel , but also feelings and emotions .

In conclusion , I suggest that you abandon you cars and you start taking buses for three simple reasons : first of all , you can contribute to save the planet from pollution ; secondly , buses are cheaper than cars ; finally doing so , you can enjoy the atmosphere of your city .
