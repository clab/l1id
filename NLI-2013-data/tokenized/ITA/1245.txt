I totally agree with the belief that to have a broad knowledge in many different academic subjects is more valuable than to narrow down in a single subject that you could totally master .

There are undoubtedly many advantages to be very focused on a specific subject ; for example many scientific discoveries would not have been found unless there were some people that studied a lot a precise and narrow domain , such as sub-nuclear physics or organic chemistry .

Nevertheless I think that nowadays a broader culture and education are much more valuable , in order to be a successful in both your career and personal life .
A broadly educated person could also contribute much more to the wellness and prosperity of society .

An example that comes to my mind is the current debate about bioethics : for the society as a whole it is much more important that we have wellrounded people capable of understanding and debating about the social consequences of human clonation , rather than some scientists that develope the technical method to make it possible .

In general I see that the world is becoming really complex and all the jobs require a set of different skills that you can have only with a broad education .

That 's also why universities all over the world have already begun to offer joint-programs or even truly multi-discliplinary degrees .
One example could be bio-engineering , which is the combination of a medical degree and an engineering degree .
Another example could be the introduction in some MBA program of ethics classes : they not only want to educate people to become successful leaders but also want to teach them the consequences of their act in the society , and how to act correctly and by the rules .

I think that this focus toward broadness and roundness is part of mankind progress .
Two centuries ago to be succesfull and happy you only had to learn your job and stick to it for your whole life .
Nowadays every four years you change job , you maybe move in another country , and you face always new experiences and challenges .
In such an enviroment and dinamic situation you are surely better off with a broad knowledge than a deep a specific one on a single domain .
