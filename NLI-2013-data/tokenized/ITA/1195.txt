I 've always been interested in all the environment arund me and every unknown thing it would be a subject to be discovered .
If you are intrested in only one subject you could have a great improve of the knowledge of it , but it 's a problem for everything else .
I think that bigger is your knowledge as better it is .
In fact , if you have some trouble of any kind you can know what you are in front of and you could study and solve it .
Then , if you know more than one subject , you can discuss or argue them with other people and you could improve your self knowledge .

Many academic subjects are also linked , than it 's easier comprend them if you know all a bit of all of them .
An example of my istitute ( and many others ) are historical art , modern art , antropology and product design .
Another example , in the music , all the styles are linked and many styles born by the knowledge of other styles .
Also , in order to have a nice life , you are advantaged becouse you have a big range where you could find a job that you can enjoy .
And in this society the our job is the basement of our life .

I have no others opinion for the discuss , but I hope that I 've explained all you need for the comprenction of my ideas .
