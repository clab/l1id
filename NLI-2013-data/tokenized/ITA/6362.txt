First of all I 'm not totaly disagree with this statement .
I think that the number of cars in use in the next twenty years will be the same that there are today .

I hope that the number of cars decrease , but I 'm not sure that it happen .
In Italy , the country where I live , the situation is very difficult .
Everyday in the street there are a lot of cars , so there are also a lot of pollution and also a lot of incidents .

Today the cost of life is very high , so for many people is difficult to buy a car and they use the public transport like bus , taxi , train or underground ( metro ) .

In Italy , in my opinion , the public transport is not very development and I think that instead is important to increase this type of service .
For example there are a lot of people , that live far away the place where they work , that everyday go to work by car , in spite of there are orher possibility to go like train as I have just said before .

But in Italy I know because the people prefer to use car instead of train or other public transport , because they are always in late and they are not efficent .

I hope that in the next years the thing could be better than now .
