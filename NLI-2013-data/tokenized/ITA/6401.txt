I-m agree with the statement and I really hope so .
I think that in twenty years a lot of thinghs must change and the use of cars is obsolutely one of these .
Considering first the main problem > the price and the disponibility of petrol .
In twenty years maybe some giaciments will be empty and the new one more and more unusefull becouse of the revalities between the east and the west of the world .

SO if the price of petrol is too hight we can-t use the car , is too expensive for a family have two or three cars ...
so become only one .
Another important reason to get fewer the number of cars is the pollution !
if the number of cars continue to encrase we will be summersed by smog , smokes and poisons !
isn-t possible to live in a world more sick than this .

I think also that inthe 2026 all towns will have new kind of busses and trains more conforteble , cheaper and faster than the actual one .
So to go to the work , to go out for a pizza or to do anithing else you will take the underground not like now .

Infect a lot of towns don-t have underground an the most of people don-t fell safeful taking it !
For example i-ve been in japan , to Kyoto and i can surely say you that there wasn-t traffic !!
all by bicycle or by train !
So you can go aroud and not hear the noise of the cars and without sniff their smells !
I rally hope that in all the world people can enjoi their country , can live in town without problem and expecially that all economical and en problems close to petrol will desappear !
I give you 20 years of time
