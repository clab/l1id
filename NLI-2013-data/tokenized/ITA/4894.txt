I agree with this sentence , especially after the increasing of different ways to sell a product .
In fact , at the beginning there were shops and his owners , so the main work was to convince a client to choose my shop and not another .
The focus was on the relationship between the singular shop and each singular client .
The rule of owners as vendors was critical for shops ' sellings and also for products ' line success .
Then arrives supermarkets and stores with publicity , which develop a mass production in order to sell high quantity of products .
Publicity made with flyers and big images in the main streets of big towns ' made the success of a kind of product in contrast with the falling of another .
Nowadays the increasing of technologies , such as TV and Internet , and better conditions in people 's life make the focus on advertisements .
It 's not important what you said or who 's your message for , the important is how practical , how significant , how brilliant your message to clients is .
A spot on TV , created as a `` short story '' or a sort of `` soap opera '' , can convince million of person to buy your product .
Also using a famous testimonial for your spot , like an actor or a sports ' man , is very creative and successfull .
The globalization made by Internet allowed a product from Japan to be bought in Italy in large quantity and news about innovative products created in different countries are communicate in real time all over the world .

In conclusion , well-done advertisements not only make products seem much better than they really are , but also make these successfull and be able to begin a trend , too .
