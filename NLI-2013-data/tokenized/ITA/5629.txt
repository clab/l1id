The impact and influence of TV on people is so strong that some advertisements take advantage of this by hiding important details to the customers in order to sell their product .

A first example that can express this increasing habit is about food adverstisements .
Obesity is becoming a really common problem all over the well-developed countries .
Although the awareness of this problems , some advertisements sell a product , such as chocolate , by saying that it does n't contain fat and , as a consequence , it does n't make you get fatter so you can eat it whenever you want .

Connected to the food problem , another example of this tendence to sell a product by trying to make it better than it is , can be reflected by this big increase of number of pills that make you get thiner .
Adverstisements describe these pills as the best way to lose weight , since , without any efforts and without following an equilibrated alimentation , it 's possible to lose weight .

A third example that represents this attitude regards hair products .
Some television advertisements show beautiful women with fabulous hair , soft and really styled , by making people believe that a shampoo or a conditioner can do better thana hair-styler .
Others try to convince people that the coulour of somewhat brand can give to your hair a perfect solution , without losing all the money that a hair-styler could ask .

In conclusion , the big faith that people have towards TV is used by advertisements to sell products that could n't have all of the positive features they pretend they have .
The field of adverstisements is to sell products , telling no all the truth is a part of this work , but sometimes some advertisements can seem exagerated .
Another part of this work should be the awareness of the responsability that people really believe them .
