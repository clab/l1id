As my boss used to say me at the beginning of my career : < Do not be afraid about the sperimentation of new things , do more than others do : no one has never been punished for doing more > .

According to this phrase , I think that people who try to do new thinks normally have more chances to be successful during their own life than someone who silmpy do his/her usual job .

What makes a man successful is the plus-value that he can give to the society .
A lot of men could do things well , but only men who do things better than others could reach an higer level in social life .

Taking risk is part of a successful person .
Someone who do not try to take risks could be seen as a coward by the society .
For exemple , in cartoons , a superhero is someone who normally takes risk to do something more dangerous than others normal people do .
In the same way , this attitude , could be postponed in different realistic situations .
In a business environement , for instance , a successful manager is in general someone who is able to `` manage '' riskfull situations ( like , for example , take strategic deciosion that could hugely impact company 's business ) .

I think that taking a `` safe '' risk is something that everyone should do in order to make people more confident and more appreciated by society .
This will certainly create more successful people .
