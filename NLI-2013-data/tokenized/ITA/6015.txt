The problem to discuss in this essay is if in the next future the number of cars will raise or not .
I think it will be .
To explain my opinion about this argoument I will consider two facts .
First the number of cars , all others equal , is related to the growth of world population .
While population is raising in the majority of the countries it 's very probable that the supply of cars will increase .

It 's also important to consider the fact that many countries are leaving their status of poorty .
Well this can lead to a better situation for all people who first lived with only elementary goods .
This means a high probability of raising the number of cars sold .

A second reason .
that at a first view can fight the idea of an increase in the number of cars in the future , is the negative trend in the production of oil .
It 's well known that in the next decades the oil will finish but there is a real possibility that through hydrogen we will continue to drive our cars !!

Let 's view at the problems that the car 's industry will look at .
At sure there is an increasing trend of governaments of many countries to support the use of public transport and to fight the use of cars .
Otherway I think this is a very slow process tha will give good results in more than twenty or thirty years .

A second problem is the fight supported by world organizations like ONU or Greenpeace .
It 's important to point to the different problems these organizations have to face , like obstacles introduced by the most advanced countries who support industrialization .

At the end I think the problems that the car industry will fight are very weak so the number of cars will rise in the future .
