In part I agree the statement , couse i think human progress , from the begin of human 's history , is possible only taking risks , exploring the unknow , tring new way , ...
I think in the world 's history there are some famous people who changed the way to do something and made innovation ( as Leonardo Da Vinci with mecanic 's research or Giulio Natta with chemical research ... )
and i think they are succesful people who tried new thing taking a lot of risks .

I think the real question is : what is a successful person ?
Is it a famous person ?
Is it a rich person ?
Is it an historic legend ?
There are a lot of successfull people who reach the success only doing what thay already know how to do well , without doing innovation or taking risk : they are common people who do very well their job making a lot of money .

There are a lot of people famous as cinema 's VIP but they never taked particular risks ...
If success is make money , we do n't need to take risks to reach the purpose ...
In the end i think the secret to have success in life is belive in myself
