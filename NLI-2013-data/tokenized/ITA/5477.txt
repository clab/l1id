I absolutely agree that the image of the product given by the communication ad is , in most of the cases , much better than how the product is in reality .
For example let 's take a campaign about pre-cooked food as roasted chicken : in the ad the chicken is always so beautiful , crispy and tasty .
But once the product is in on your table ...
well the colour is maybe the same but the chicken is not tasty at all .
Actually it taste as plastic .

Another interesting example is a new mobile .
The advertising states that the battery will last for several hundreds hours and the software will do incredible things for you .
But in reality the battery charge will last for few hours only , two days maximum .
The software will take ages to get ready and from time to time it will just be stucked for quite a long time .
That is what happened to me with my new mobile .

I guess if a product has to penetrate the market is has be shown as extremely appealing and absolutely new and fantastic .
To convince someone to buy the product the commercial has to be very efficient , catch the attention and make grat , and fake , promises about quality and customer 's satisfaction .
So approaching the product customers will not only buy the product itself buth all the valuable things the commercial attached to it .

I think there are so many me-too products , all looking more or less alike , that the marketing people are forced to rely on this kind of adverstising to make the people notice their product .

For example computers from different firms all have the same features , someone has a bigger memory or screen or viceversa but none is really different .

The real problem is that there are not enough differentiating values in products .
Even quality and the fact that they are really useful products is not enough anymore .
