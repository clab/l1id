I think that the car has changed the life of the last century and it is an impotant mean for our life still today .
However I think also that the cars bring with them same ambiental and social problem .
First of all , the cars make too pollution , also new cars that they have so many reststriction but again today is not enough .
Furthermore , the cars have destroed all kind of human ralationshipm whit nature and otherelf .
For example , for getting some at market the people get their car also to do few meters , because , so they do less work .
The people do n't want to walk or ride a bike anymore because they are to lazie to do that and they think that the car can solve their problems of moving .

This abuse of the car is allowed becouse not only for the laize of the people but also for the bad condition of pubblic traspot .
Indeed , in some part of the world , it is always late , durty , and sometimes very expencive , and above all confortless .
In other words , these are situations that force people to take the car .
Indeed , it has all confort that we want : air conditioned , music , space ...

I do n't belive that among twenty years the car will be fewer , instead I think that the number will grow up more and more .
This will be possible because a wrong political way hes been gotten ( I am talking about my particular country situation ) .
Nothing is doing to change direction .
On the other hand , somebody thinks that the end of petroil will decrese the number of car , but for my it is not true , for to topic : the oil is still too much to finish suddenly and the cars ' factory never will allwe the the car wil lose importance in our life .

IIn conclusion I think that the solution are two or the goverment of all wor
