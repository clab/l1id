At certain points of our lives , everyone has to make essential decisions that will have consequences for the rest of our lives .
One of this decision is education , the path of studying we want to follow ; then the following crucial question will arise : it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject ?

The answer is not so straightforward , it is not possible to rank broad knowledge versus specialization , we have to find a deeper response .
A broad knowledge is essential because a variety of different situations will show in front of us along all our life and to deal with them , we need a basic knowledge .

For example , we are not required to know how to make a surgery , but we are better off if we know that if we have the flu , it is better if we stay at home and not stay outside at the cold .

On the other hand , since it is not possible to have an extensive knowledge on every possible subject , we need to specialize in something to find a job , from the most humble to the most powerful .

The level of specialization will depend on the job we would like to do or that is offered to us ; thinking again about the previous example , if you are a chirurgian , you have to reach a very high level of specializiation , while if you are a waiter you do n't need a very sophisticated knowledge .

Besides , a first broad knowledge is useful to understand which are your preferences and what you would like to do in your life .
If you don ' t learn the first basic concepts or notions of astronomy , you will never know if you prefer this subject than studying chemistry .

At the end , the bottom line is that a broad knowledge is essential for everyday life and this broad knowledge doesn ' t need to be too sophisticated , but if you want to make career or if you have certain aspirations , surely you will need to specialize in something .
