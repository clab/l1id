When I went to university I had to decid if attend a general major or a specilistic one and I have chossen the second one .
I think it 's an important decision for life of peolple .

In fact if you decide to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can have a big knowledge about a lot of things .
You can deal with a lot of things in very different situation and also you can do the rigth thing in different situations .
In example you can talk with people that do n't attend your same class and have a general discussion of every subject .
However this kind of knowledge ca n't be very specific .
Therefore you can do a job that needs general knowledge but not a specialistic job .

Instead if you decide to specialize in a specific subject you do n't have any problem .
In fact you can study one subject and know almost everything about it .
I think this is the best way to find a good job , beacause you know something that other people not specialized do n't know and there is always someone that pay you for this specialistic knowledge .
Therefore I choose a specialistic major and I disagree with the given stament .
In addition if you specialize in one specific subject you can reach the best results in what you study .
In example I like to study the chemical compositions of the materials and I can specialize in what I like instead of studing a lot of subjects that I do n't like .
According to this , the best thing of specializing in one specific subject is that you can concentrate your efforts in just one thing and you have not to diverge your attenctions in differents subjects .

Therefore this is why I think it 's better for someone that wants to do good things in his life to specialize in one specific subject and not in many of them .
