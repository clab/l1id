The issue if it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than fot them to learn facts is commonly discussed in our society .
In my opinion the students knowledge is improved when thaey undestand not only the facts but the underlying ideas and concepts .
In this essay i will support my answer with specific reasons and examples .

Facts are definetly the students knowledge base .
Before any consideration the students need to know what happend .
So teachers need to explain the fact without any comment or personal opinion .

In a second moment facts are trasposed into ideas and concepts .
Teachers should help students to understand what drove the fact and what conseguence it had .
In our society is really important not only to know what happen but also undestand the ideas and motivation .
A great example is 11/09 .
Everybody see what happend on the twin towers .
The real knowledge come from the undestanding of the nature and the couse of the terroristic attack .
Only in this way students can go deply in the problem and try to find a solution .

In conclussion i'am completely agree that students should analyse problems leaning the fact and undertand ideas and concepts that are behind the fact .
Only in this way students will be able to find correct solutions to the problems that they will occur into .
