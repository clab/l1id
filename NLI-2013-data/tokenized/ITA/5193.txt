the product of coars need to be advetise .
the genuinety of the product is one of the nost important things that a prudoct may have .
the pubblicity is a soul of tradind and obviously made a product better that in realy is .
if we take for example about a shoes , in nike spots we can easy see the people that run faster than thi wind , or jump higher than the sky , but in really this concepts are unbeliveble .

All of us kwon that nike shoes is like an other common shoes , but the advertisement make products much better yhan they really are .
an other example are sky , the satellite tv company , that in the advertise show that yuo can take home the famous movies , in really sky offer the same things that an other tv company offer .

pubblicity aim is only to encurage the people to buy this product instead the other one .
an other example will be the advertisement of a car , the pubblicity tell that one car is `` like no one '' , but it is icredible , all of the car hav e got 4 wheels , an engine ...
it 's incredible that cars are so differet to justify `` one like no one '' !!!

In my opinion advertisements make product much better than they really are ; so i like this advetisements but i kown that the truth is not what i see , i think that other people on the earth are enjoy with me , but i also know that the largest population of the world may not enjoy with me , is for they that the advertisements is referd to .
