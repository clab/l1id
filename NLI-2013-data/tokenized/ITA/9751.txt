There are two type of successful people I think :
the first one is the person , who reached the success with the own forces .
This kind of successfully person is intelligent , quick , knows the meaning of the word ` work '' , all that he/she has it have been earned from him/her , so he/she knows exactely how to do the job or how to behave in varies occasions .

For this reason I do n't agree with the statement because I think this kind of person will surely try new things or take some risks to reach what he/she wants to or to improve in his/her job , because he/she is sure , competent and respectable .

However in my mind ther 's another kind of succesful people , those who reached the success because this success has been gifted to they .
In this case the person has not the quality to be a successful person because he/she did n't work hard to reach his/her life 's purpose , he/she does n't konw how to work well or how to behave in some kind of circumstances and first of all ther 's the risk that the success can have a too big weight for he/she and this kind of people could crash down .

I think they would never take into account to take a risk or triyng new things , because they know that in case of a big problem they would n't know how to solve it .
They would of course look for the help of other people .

Because of those reason I agree and disagree with the statement in the same time .
All that concern the choices of a person depend on so many things like character , ability , past and also a little bit of luck .
