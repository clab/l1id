The issue stated by the topic is wheter or not in twenty years there will be fewer cars than today .
I believe that it is impossible to have less cars that today .
One reason i believe that will not be fewer cars is because to have a car means to be indipendent , and who want not be indipendent ?
i mean that in a normal family evreyone want to have a car , for instance a car is necessary fot the husband to go to work , another car is necessary to the wife to go either to work and make shopping , and we cannot forget sons or daughters .

So the situation is very prevedible , if everyone want a car , the number of these cars wiill increase in the future .
Another reason i think there will be more cars in the future because a car is looked like a stutus symbol .
For example who has a expensive and sportive car , like Ferrari , wants to show to other people that he or she is a rich man or woman .
another reason i think that there will be more cars is that today as in the future there is the opportunity to chose your favourite car , i mean that there are a lot of kind of cars and a lot of brands .

Automotive factory are trying to satisfy customers needs with specific kind of cars and give to them the possibility to chose almost everything in a car , for example the colour and the material of the seats , the colour of the whole car , and also the model of the engine : diesel or not .

As we can see people can obtain its whises realized and often without paying a lot for a car .
In conclusion in the future the number of cars wiil be higher than now , because peole need to be indipendent and choosing a customized car is not anymore difficult .
