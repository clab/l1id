I think that it 's better to have a preparation in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic , because the work 's of world research students specialized .
For example in my experience of student at the politecnico of Milan , the are two main streets for to follow .
You can to do three years or five years ; the main difference is that at the third year of engineering you must to decide your address of study .
for example veicles , turbomachines , industrials fields , materials ...
at the end you must to do an work 's experience in a factory .
This permit to know the new work 's world early and more fastely , while if you choose five years have more broad knowledge of more subject but less specialized .
