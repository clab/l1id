Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
As far as I am concerned , I 'm agree with this statement for three main reasons :
Firstly , I think that a person is successful because he or she takes risks .
In fact in the business world if you do something you would obtain a good result to be a successful person .
So you can obtain a good result only if you take one or some risks .
For example in a company you are an important manager and your work is always perfect .
But you want to take a promotion and so you take a risk : you change your type of work and so your results become different .
If your leader appreciate your new work you will take a promotion but if your work is n't good you wo n't take a promotion .

Secondly , risks are beautiful because a static work is not as nice as a very active work with a lot of risks and changes .
In fact I think that you will become a successful person only if you do a very active work .
For example Bill Gates is a very successful person but he is successful only because years ago he took a big risk : in fact he created a computer company and he spent a lot of money in this work .
So he took a risk and now he is a very successful and rich person .

Finally I think that the succesfful people are people who manage our world while the other people wait and see .
In fact our world is so beautiful because some successful people have created a lot of things for our life .
For example some successful people have created cars and airplanes to make our life more confortable .

In conclusion my opinion is that try new things and take risks are very important because if you do this you will become a very successful person .
Otherwise you are a normal , static person .
