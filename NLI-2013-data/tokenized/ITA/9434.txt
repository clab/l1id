I think it is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts .
In fact if a person knows concepts that are on the basis of every facts or situations , he can solve all these problems that are connected with those ideas , on the other hand , if he knows only the fact without havig the concepts and the ideas on the basis , he can solve only that problem and situations which are similar to that .

All this is very important in many aspects or situation in our lives because everyday we have in front of us some different problems that we can solve only if we know the concepts and the ideas .

Especially we find these problems in our works , in our offices , in our classrooms , in our homeworks , so in the our environmental work .
For example one person can solve a problem easier and faster than other people because he has the concepts and the ideas on the basis of that work while other people know only the facts and , if a situation introduce a new solution or a new details , they do n't arrive to solve the problem , they do n't understand the new situation and so they ca n't arrive to the solution and to the implementation of the situation .

A person who knows concepts and ideas can solve all the problems that a situation or a detail can introduce and he can develop new solution and new implementation about the problem .

Finally I think that a person who knows only facts he knows only a little part of his work because he can solve only a schematical problemsv while a person that has many ideas and concepts he knows more things of his work and so he can solve all situation of a problem with new details and aspects and he can also find new and better solutions .
