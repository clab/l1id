I personally agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I may say that this aspect of our contemporary society is not due to the selfish behaviour of new generations ; there is something deeper that can explain this situation .

We belong to the internet era ; everything is flowing , everything is moving very quickly .
The society and its way of living have changed a lot from the 20th century : nowadays people have less time for themselves and so for the others .

Although helping poor and needy people and other remarkable activities are still commom in our communities , very few young people do that , just because they are not educated to ; the will to help their own communities is something that young people have to find inside themselves and only their parents can help them in this .

To sum up I might say that every era in history has its own children .
The globalisation era has been making the world like a big total town ; everything is near or it seems to .
In this situation we can understand why a little community may not catch the attention of young people ; they are sons of the world and they might find difficult to look at it from the perspective of a little town .
