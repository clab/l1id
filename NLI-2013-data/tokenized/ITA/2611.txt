I disagree whit the concept that young people enjoy life more than older people .
I think that young people have a different way to live , to consider their own life than older people , but this way not necessarly is better .
This depends particularly by the responsability of a person , the minds , and so by the style of life .
Generally young people , boys or girls , live in a particular way , doing differents actions , having differents interests , so live in movement without long moments of pause .
For example , I wake up the morning and I go to university where I study , in the afternoon I use my free time reading , listening music , visiting new places , and visiting art gallery .

While in the evening I go with my friends to theater , cinema , pubs , or concerts .
The old people , instead , live in a different way , because they pass their free time at home , in fact they don-t work , watching for example television , so they use their time in a slow way .

For example I have a grand mother who stays at home during the day , she meets her friends at home and watchs television in the evening .
In conclusion young people don-t enjoy life more than older people , but boys and girls have other ways to live .
