Advertising is the art of encourage a customer to buy a product instead of another one having the same qualities .
Therefore , it should not be surprising at all that , sometimes , advertisements can make a product seems much better than it really is .
Toys , snacks and mobile phone services are three kind of products that are not usually as good as you may think after having seen their advertisements .

Last year , I decided to buy a new mobile phone , and so I also had to change my service provider .
Since I did n't have enough time to compare all the offers available on the market , I decided to make my decision just looking at the advertisements .
I choosed a provider that offered one hundred minutes of free calls every month .
One month later , when the first bill arrived , I discovered that this offer was valid for international calls only , and not for national ones .
For sure , I did n't get what I paid for .

When I was a kid , I once asked my parents to buy for me a new bike .
I did n't want a traditional bike , but a BMX , which was the most popular model at that time , mainly due to a big advertising campain on TV and newspaper .
The result ?
My parents bought that bike , which , by the way , was also really expensive , and it got broken after just three weeks .
It seemed literally unbreakable on TV ...

There is not a big difference from one snack to another .
If someone gives you an hamburger , I bet that you wo n't be able to tell in which fast food it has been purchased .
Indeed , advertisements can make a snack seems better than another one .
For example , you may think that , since a beverage has been promoted by a celebrity , it is better than a less famous one .
The truth , however , is that they are practically equal , and that , if a difference exists , it is almost unnoticeable .

Products are not always as good as advertisements may suggest .
I had bad experiences in my life when I had to purchase a product , and now I do n't trust in advertisements anymore .
When I need to buy a new object , I ask for suggestions to someone who has already bought it , or I just wait for a few months .
Time only will tell me if a certain product worths its price or not .
