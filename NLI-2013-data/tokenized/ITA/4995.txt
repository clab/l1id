With the introduction of mass medias into modern societies , advertisement has developed a new , important role in modern life .
As it became important , it also had to develop new ways of attracting people , becoming more and more similar to a work of art than to a businnes-related expedient .
One of these new ways was to present the product in the best possible way , in order to attract more people to it .
Some companies during this process have also made the decision to lie about the real characteristics of their product .
Personally I do n't consider this part of the game , eventhough sometimes it can be really annoying .
Advertisements are supposed to show a product in the best way , and I can understand if a company decides to hide the bad characteristic of the product in order to make it more attractive .

But I really ca n't accept when advertisements boast about something that is not true .
I 'm not talking about children 's toy advertisements , where products are shown in a `` fantastic '' way in order to attract the children .
I can understand that in this case we are talking about a product that is in some ways related to the child 's fantasy , and the adults who are supposed to buy it are well aware of the fact that the toy will not , for example , fly , as it is shown in the ad .

I 'm talking about advertisements that are directed to an adult audience and lie about the real characteristics and possibilities of the product .
This is in my opinion a real fraud and these ads should n't be allowed to be broadcasted or printed .

Fortunately in these days , new laws about this problem have been created and hopefully advertisement companies will not make a fool of us anymore .
