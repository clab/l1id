I am agree with the statement that affirm that in twenty years will be fewer cars in use than there are today because I think that in the future there will be a lot of different way of move .
In others words I hope that someone will invent a new product or a new idea for moving on air .

The first reason is because today we have a lot of problems of traffic and is also impossible basically in the big cities to move for work , for plasure , for everything .

There are too many cars today and always we are in line for hours and hours waiting to arrive .
The second reason because I am agree with the statement is a problem related at the enviroment and not only also at the person .
There are a lot of gas on the air that are dangerous for us and for all our enviroment .
For this reason I think that is absolutly necessary to do something for the future , for the utility of the car .
For example it will be important create a new product for the future market that can be solve this kind of problem .
The third reason is that in twenty years will be boring of this problems and maybe it will be possible that instead use the car we will use another kind of trasport .
For insance I think that a good solution could be that a governament forbidden more than one car for family .

I know that is not so easy but I think that is for ourselves , for the enviroment .
It ' s impossible to immagine a future like a present .
Finally i want to underline that It will be more confortable live in a `` clean city '' without all this chemical gas that every day are around us .
