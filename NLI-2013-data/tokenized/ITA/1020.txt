Some peple think that is better to have broad knowing of many academic subjection , while others think is better specialize in one specific subject .
I will describe both point of views and espress my own opinion .

On the one hand , some people believe it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic sucjects for some reasons .
They think it because they consider having many knowing is helpful for our life .
For example , you will be able to have more possibility to resolve a problem if you have a board knowledge of many subjects .

Also

O the other hand , there are some people that believe it is better to specialize in one specific subject instead have broad knowledge of many academic sucjects .
They think in this way because they think that in our society is better to specilize in one subject so you can contrast the development of the disemployment in these years .
For example you will have more pssibility to found a work if you specialize in one specific subject .

Finally , I think that it is better in our world to specialize in one particular subject because in my opinion this is the only method for having a sure job in the modern world .

Nowadays I think having a good job is one the most important thing , therefore if you have n't one you will always have big problem .
For this reasons I hope in my future to be able to degree in mechanical engeneering .
