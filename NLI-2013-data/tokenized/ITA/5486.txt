I am agree that most advertisement make products seem much better than they are .
I think that it is normal because the attendence of the people are always big .
A good advertisement must make a product seem much better than it is for a commercial law .
In fact in the commercial law the product must be presented like a better .
If the advertisement give some positive sensation to the people , it is just a little step for make a good product .
It is not important if in the advertisement there is a good or bad product .
but it is important like the product is seemed .
For example I want to buy a new car .
I see an advertisement that make a car like a good product and I want to buy that car because I believe that it is a godd car .

This is a little example but for everything we can make an advertisement make a product much better than it really is .
The consumist world in that we live impose us this new ways of thinking .
The people are joked to the adverstisement and then they are unbeliveable if the product is not like they think .
When I was a child I wanted a little toys because in the advertisement was a new fantastic robots and all the child wanted it .
But only with the passage of the age I learnt that not all advertisements tells a trouth .
