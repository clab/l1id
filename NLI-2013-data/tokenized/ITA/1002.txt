I think that is better to specialize in one specific subject , becouse today a lot of works are done by teams of people , and any person has a specific function .

This is valid for teams of doctors , for teams of arquitects , for team of engineers : to realize a big project is not useful to have ten people who are quite good in doing the same kinds of works , but it 'd be really useful that each of these ten people would be specialized in a specific part of the work needed .

In this way it 'd be faster to realize anything without the interferences of differents people on the same problem , and the quality of the intervents can grow .

To improve our business , technology , medicine and all the others fields of the society , we need specialized people , to be able in solving any kind of problems by asking to the ` right man` !

I think that to have a broad knowledge could be a good thing , also on academic subjects , but at the end you need to specialize .
It 's fair to know , for example projecting a new hostipal , what kind of things need to be done before and which after , and how they have to be done , but just for general knowledge , as global cultural luggage that every people can build by his own .

To specialize our knowledge in a specific academic subject , will be good to find a job that we like .
However , with a more general preparation you can succed in finding a job , it could be a boring job , linked with a part of your studies that you did n't enjoy so much , and you will be unhappy for the rest of your life , becouse all the companies seek specialized people , and you have just a general knowledge of some subjects .

Your job can be more flexible , but you will repalce other people for the rest of your life , without the possibility to succed in a specific field .
Is for these reasons that i prefer to specialize .
