Yes , I agree with the statement repsreesnted by this short phrase .
This statement cites two important aspects of the learning phase that a student faces when studying : first of all memorizing facts , and last but not latter , extract from facts the concepts and the ideas behind them .

Both are important in the learnig process , that cannot be accomplished fully withount each of them : they are like two sides of the same coin .
Although that , one of them is more imprtant than the other .
The statement means that students must not stop working and thinking when they have acquired the information presented by books or lectures , but they must go over , and gain a deeper comprehension on what they have memorized .

I think that , when we start learning something new , its useful to begin from facts , that may be easy to remember and useful for fixing important data .
So , we gain a fist impression , or a whole image of the topic , useful for further analysis .

Next , we must go on , because learning is n't only that : the student must pay attention on the concept behind the facts and data he has learned .
That data give us a background that must be used for building a deeper knowledge , that require each of us a harder personal work .
Only in that way we can obtain a more abstract idea of the field of human knowledge he is studing , and obtain a general view on the topic , broader than the one depicted by the facts he meet in the beginning .

Attendig a reading in a class , adn interact with professors and other students can stimulate thi process , and I think that after this work has been ruled out , it becames easier to remember the concepts : basing our knowledge only on facts , readings , and so on that where memorized can be an error , because in the long term our memory might not be good as in youth , and the hard work we have done can became
