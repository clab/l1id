A lot of Greek lyrical poets wrote odes to the beauty of youth , and elogiated it as the highest , most rewarding stage in life .
When the time came for them to deal with the old age , all their words assumed negative and dark implications , their rhythm slowed down , their optimism faded away , as if the wonderful joys that they had collected during their youth had completely disappeared , leaving no good memories , no sign at all .

In my opinion , this is the best feature of the years that I am living : the great sense of expectation that I feel every day .
When you are young , everything seems easy to reach , possible .
It is as if you are given all the opportunities you want , and you can even dare to refuse some of them , to pick the ones you prefer .
And then , you are still at school .

Studying definitely brings along a big amount of new , different and stimulating experiences that hit , strike and confuse the students with fantastic , oniric ideas of what the world could be .
This is the period in which they - we - inhalate the greatest part of images , sounds , colors and words , our own heritage for the rest of our life .
This is the time when our minds are completely open .

On a more pragmatical side , youngsters ' physical constitution allows them to do more activities than the elders can do .
Young people can run , dance , play every sport they want without having to worry for their backache or their ostheoporosis .
What is more , they can travel , see the world and all the beauty in it .
In his novel `` On The Road , '' Joseph Conrad writes that everyone who has the courage to wake up one day and leave to no definite destination is `` crazy , crazy of life . ''
I do not think that there is a better way to say why youth is such an amazing , satisfacting and breath-taking period .
Maybe , as I said , the most important reason lies in the fact that young people can still dream .
And it is when you stop dreaming that your old age begins .
