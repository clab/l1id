I absolutely agree with that statement .
And I do agree because I think that only by taking some risks in life you can make yourself different from other people .
I think this for several reasons .
Fist of all , everyone can do the same things well all life long .
But just a few can distinguish themselves .
For example , many people in life are happy by doing the same things , all days , all years , all life .
But for other people this is a limit .
Some people in fact ca n't do the same things all life long just because that ' s not in their nature .
They feel not satisfied by doing a repetitive life .
They must change their position .
I believe that succesful people are successful because they ca n't do same things all life long .
But not only .
I believe that successful people love the challenge .
Challenge is in their nature , and they just can not ignore it .
They do n't like to feel like other people so they take risks and try new things .
They do these things to prove the world that they are better than other people , that they are special persons .

Challenge is their life and without challenge theiy are not stimulated and so they feel depressed .
So another reason why I believe that successful people take risks is that because they are ambitious .
That 's not all .
There is something more , I belive .
And this is the feelig that a person feels when he reaches an high level , for example in work , or anywhere .
For example : a man with a normal job in normal city , in a normal and boring coutry , decides to invest his money in a new activity .
The activity works good , and the man feels like he is God in person .
He changed his life !

The feeling is the one that says to them : I made it ! .
The adrenaline that you feel is such a good feeling .
You feel like you could do everything , if you just wanted .
So ambitious people also love that adrenaline shock and the feeling that they prove when they made something important .
But taking risk is not always an open highway .
Tat-s a difficult path to walk on , but if you have got the ability , the intelligence and a little luck it will problably wok .

To sum up I think that succesful people love the challenge , love to feel good with themselves and love to say : I made it !
