Helping communities is a great thing to do and there are many people involved in this `` job '' with the aim of substaining and helping as much as they can .
Usually this help comes from the curches and from the charity associations as a volunteers ' occupation and it 's very useful and gratefying .
But if we look with more accurancy we can see that the people that works there , are usually middle age - old people that thing that spending more time there is better than wating time .
So it 's true that the young people do n't do enough for their communieties .

Instead of staying hours in front of the computers waiting for something more interesting they should go out and do something useful and important for their communietes .
It is n't an hard work .

For example , it means going to the church 's playfield and help the mothers to control their children , help an old woman to buy her dinner at the supermarket or help an old man to take his dog out .
Frankly it 's nothing so difficult to do .

Personally I think that working in charity shops or helping people in difficult it 's more gratefying than how they think .
These stuations should help them to be more sensitive in front of these people but especially to understand the importance of their occupation .
This way a young boy/girl is going to face the real problems and the real situations that could happen during their lives .
And I think that there is nothing better to be prepared about what could happen in the future .
