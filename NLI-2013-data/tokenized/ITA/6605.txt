Nowadays seem that in our society the most important thing is the process of modernization .
This run to modernzation make a lot of problem to the enviroment where we live infact with the past of the years the the pollution has growed enormously and we have problems such as the hole of the ozone .
We are in a situations that we ca n't go on if we do n't want destroy our planet .
Therefore I think that since now and people are repairing to this situations for example with laws that forbidden the use of determinate inquinant materials or cutiing three in specific areas .
However their are only some ways to limite the problem .
In order to resolve the problem people in the future should evoid to use their car to go out but use a bicicles ore it migh be better create a new model of transport that does n't make problem to the enviroment .
Even using the public trasports instead of own cars could be a futuristic hypothesys .
in this way we could gain time and avoid the stress of the traffic jam especially in the rush hours .
I think it is the best solution especially in those big cities or those developing country such as cina or india were the utilization of the cars it could be a real problem , = This is the reason because of I think that in the future there will be fewer cars than there are today .
