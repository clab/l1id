The world we live in is getting more and more an egoistic , self-focused world .
It is true , at least in my opinion , that people are more reluctant nowadays to give their time to helping their communities .
However , I do not think this to be a characteristic of young peolple only .

Actually , I believe adults are the first ones to give us this bad example .
Pursuing always more their careers and always spending more time for themselves rather than for building up families or caring for their old relatives , the adults of this new millenium seems to prefer living by and for themselves rather than placing themselves inside communities .
This is at least the picture that the television and movie industry show us ..
just looking at worldwide famous sit-coms like `` Friends '' and `` Sex and the City '' , it is imposssible to find there portrayts of adults interested in something different than their jobs , their friends , basically their lives .

Younger people , instead , are becoming more and more sensible to their communities , probably because that feeling of `` enlarged family '' that in the past was typical of small cities has disappeared during the last years .
European Community launched many programs of national and international Volounteer Jobs in order to make youngsters understand how important is to be part of a larger community and share experiences with other , offering what you have and getting back what you lack .
An already ten year-old association active in the city I live in , called `` Time Bank '' , aims right at this purpose : you give others your time and help when you can , and in return they give you a `` time check '' by which you can ask back the time you donated to others when you will be in need of it !

It is therefore generally true that people have become more selfish and not always willing to help other members of their communities , but I also think that this will all change soon - mainly thanks to young people - because we have all understood that it is not easy nor good to live like floating islands on the same ocean , but is way better to start living as a real , strong community .
