I have worked for a long time as a researcher in my University 's laboratory .
What I have learnt during that and other experiences is that only people taking risk and trying new things are successfull .
Threfore there are at least a couple of reasons according to which I agree with the statement .

The first one is that people trying to explore new things most of the time give a different point of view to all the other .
For example , when Einstein has introduced his theory of relativity he has become one of the most appreciated scientists of the world .
His theory has opened new research fields and it has been the result of a deep research conducted making new assumptions , trying new things and taking the risk of being criticized .

The second reason is that who tries new things is in general a very particular person and in many occasions I feel like them .
During my experience in the laboratory , for instance , I was used to get in a deep state of concentration , eliminating all the external stimulus I could have .
Few months after I have finished my experience in the laboratory , I have read some biographies of famous and successfull people and I have understood that they all have this attitude to isolate themselves from the outside .

Concluding I can say that I agree with the statement because I think that people trying new things give ever a new point of view to mankind and because sometimes I feel like one of them .
I hope that in the future I will do something by which I will remembered as a successfull person .
