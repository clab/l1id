I disagree with this statement because in my opinion for the new work 's world is more important be specialized in one specific subject than in many academic subjects .
I think that because in my school I have studied a lot of subjects but I admit saying many things but these subjects are n't studied in a specific way .
In fact I have found a lot of problems when I came in my university , where is important only one specific subject .

The new world of the work , in my opinion , requests a specific kind of worker .
In fact now there are many type of works and the number of people who have broad knowledge of many academic subjects are not increasing .

I try to use an example .
An architect that creates all of the parts of his project is rare .
We can find a lot of architects or designers that are specialized only in one specific subject .
It is so because is changed the university and the new work 's world searches different kind of workers .

So , I think that is important study one specific subject and do the best work that I could make .
