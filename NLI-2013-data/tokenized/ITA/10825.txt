it is a matter of fact that doing only what you already know how to do it 's a safe ground to moove on .
Most people prefer to live a quiet life , without risks , and troubles , while trying new things implies a certain degree of uncertainty .
At the same time it is true that the contemporary world is extremely competitive and being a successfull person is everything but easy .
To be successfull you need someone who notices you , and gives you the opportunity to show what you can do .
Specially at the very beginning , it is hard to be noticed among all the others .
Trying new things is a good way to avoid easy comparisons .
How can someone judge you on something which is completely new ?
On the basis of which criteria you can be considered either better or worse han someone else ?
Sometimes competing on a complitely new groud has a lot of adavnatges .

I am deeply convinced that being successfull everyday means basically being able to be different , without fear of being far away from the avarage .
A successfull person needs to be brave , in order to dare more than the rest of his competitors .
You need to have a great self confidence in order to take the risk to fail .
I think someone reaches the real success when he has no more fear to make mistakes .
Everyone learns from mistakes , it is a kind of natural rule .
Most mistakes provide you with the right answer to another question , and this is the way life goes on .

In addition , I think doing only things that you already know how to do is an acceptable way of living for oldish people .
Sometimes , when you get old , you are scared by all the new challenges of the world around you .
Old peole most times are weak .
Illness can affect the general mental condition of people , pushing them to be scared by everything around them .
The problem is that the same attitude is generally widespread among young people as well .
It is probably coming from modern culture , and the contemporary view of waht life is .
The main issue shoul be what life could be , instead .
I do n't understand why most young people living in big towns always seem to be so bored of living .
Thet do n't even try to be successfull people .
They simply accept to live an ordinary life , avoiding the risk to fail .
