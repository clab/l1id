I think that both of these options are very important for a student .
Of course , it depends on what is your field of study .
For this reson I would say that I desagree with this statement .

For example if you are studing history , is much more important to learn the facts and the dates of the history passages , than you have to understand ideas and concepts , but of shure this is also a very important knowledge that is required you , as historical , to have .

Is really very important , infact a student is studing for this reason , to understand ideas and concepts of what are you studing but I ca n't say that this is more important than learn facts , because without the knowledge of the facts you ca n't say that you have studied something .

I 'm thinking about when I was studing mathematik : for me and also for the teacher was very important that we , as student , had understud the ideas and concepts behind an algebric formulation , but of shure you need to know very well also the formulation itself .

An other reson why I disagree with the statement is that if you are a student you have to learn everything that they are explaining in the lecture or that you read in the text books , you ca n't say at any time that you have studied this or that fact but you do n't remeber the facts : I 'm thinking at some friends of me that they study something and after a few hours you can ask them somethink and they do not remember anythink , exept the main ideas .

To the other side I think that is important in the future , I mean after 10 or more yars after your studies , to remeber the main ideas and concepts ; and is quite impossible to remember all the learned facts .

At the and I wont to say that I desagree with this statement but depends a lot on wich is your field of study and in wich time proyection ar you looking for .
