When young people have to decide between doing something for their own benefit , or something that could benefit the whole community , they would mostly likely chose to benefit themselves , unless the action for the community would give them something in exchange .
I agree with the statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities '' , and I also belive that they should understand why helping the community is important .

Nowadays young people are much more selfish and dedcate less time to help others unless they are forced to do so .
Schools most of the time need to force students to complete hours of community service .
This is a right decision that the schools take as the students have to learn that sometimes it is best to sacrifice some of their time to give it to the community that they live in .
In addition , helping the community does not necesserly take a great amount of work , time or dedication .
Even small actions done frequently are a great input for the society .

Young people need to understand that they cannot only take from the community but they need to give something back to it , not necesserly because they have to do it , but because they should want to do it .
When completing an actoin for the good of the community , one should get back the satisfacion of being able to give something to the community that one is part of , the satisfacion of doing something good , and the satisfaction of being unseful to a great number of people rather than only yourself .

To conclude , I personally agree with the statement and belive in a need for change in respect of the attitude of these young peopole who do not dedicate enough time to the community they live in , and do not understand the importance of giving in something for the good of a group of individuals rather than only one .
