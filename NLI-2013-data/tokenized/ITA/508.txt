I do n't absolutely agree with the statement .
I study at university since I was 19 years old and in these three years I 've understood how has been important to have choosen one specific subject to study .
Usually the most important universities offer a lot of courses : each one belongs to a specific subject .
For instance , I study `` transport and logistics engineering '' , that is a particular aspect of the world of engineering .
This does n't mean that I do n't study the basic subjects of engineering ( as mathematic analysis , phisics , statystics etc . )
: I study these subjects the same , but perhaps I study only their basic aspects .
If i had to study all the aspects of all the subjects , I think I would n't have the time to do anything else , because it would require me too much time .
Consider that now I study 8 hours a day at university and 6 hours a day at home .
Moreover I spend 2 hours to go to university from home : how could I find the time to study every particular aspect of every subject ?
I think I would become mad ! .
So , I think that knowing a lot of things is beautiful , but at the end it is impossible .
This is also because the university try to prepare students for the job they will do in the future .
This job usually belongs to ONE or few subjects studied at university .
So why do I have to study more and more subjects ?
I talk you about my experience .
The aim of my course is to prepare students to solve transport and logistics problems within a few time .
This is very important for us , because in this way we avoid to study some subject and instead we can concentrate on the most important ones , in other words the most `` operative '' ones , that comprehend the knowledge that actually we must have when we 'll do our job .

For all these reasons , I confirm that I completely disagree with the statement .
