On yesterday newspaper i read about an article that talked about the knowledge in academic subjects .
That article contained an interview made to some people of my town ; lots of them believed that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects ; however some people thought that is better to specialize in a specific subject .

The first ones said that knowing things from different field gives you more chances to get a job .
For example , in a company you would be able to cover various parts and so you would become very important for your boss because he could use you for everything he needs .

In addition , in daily life you could be helpful to the others and sometimes you would n't need to call a specialized person to solve a matter because you are able to do it .

The last thing , knowing a lot of different thinks makes your brain use to work in different ways .
Like i said before , a second group of people is not still convinced about this theory .
At the interview time , they said that is better to specialize in a specific subject because this will bring you to know things better than others .
For example , you will be more competitive with your job , and you will be more sure to keep your work place because nobody will know the subject like you .
Moreover , we can say that some of very important jobs ( like the medical or the engineer ) require you to specialize just in that field to learn your job well , because that ones are so difficult fields .

I 've read the article with interest but i have n't changed my idea about this topic .
In my life i have always tried to go inside subjects that belonged to different fields ; however i know that somebody would n't be agree with me because thinks that i will never arrive anywhere with this mentality .

I still think that it 's better to have knowledge of many academics topics because i believe that this street will bring me to be successful .
Behaving like this i 'm sure that i will not have regrets in future .
