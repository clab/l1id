We live in a Era in wich every product has an advertisement .
For example when i watch Tv , or i listen to the radio , or i walk on the street i can see , and listen a lot of advertisements .

Usually the Media describe the products like they are the best but , unfortunately , in a lot of cases this is not true .
For example i 've just bought a new television .
i saw on the tv the advertisement and it described this television like a really beaufiful product with a lot of new technologies details and , for this reason i decided to buy it .
when i arrived at home and i decided to use it a realized that all i heard , unfortunalety , is not true .
I 'm very sad for this choise because i spent a lot of money for a bad product and i think that i 'm really stupid girl .

On the other hand , there are also advertisement that explain only true advantages and tell true information , in order to garantee the quality and the good name and reputation of the brand .
For example my brother bought a car last year and nowadays he 's really happy for this choise .
I think he 's a really fortunate boy !

I think that the advertisement shall say only the true and in this way people can choose the different products whitout the fear to buy a bad items .
The rights of the consumers are not respected by the Media and i belive that this problem can be risolved soon as possible .
People spend a lot of time to study the product , because they do n't want to spend a lot of money for items that are not like they want .
At the moment , i think that is really dangerous buy something without a corret information about it .
I trust , that in the future , the Law can change this situation that not advantage the citizens .
