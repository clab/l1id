The goal of advertisement is to attract people to buy a product , and therefore they make look the products better than they are .
I agree with that , and I will explain with some pratical examples this theory .
Most commercials are these days shown on tv , the biggest mass media that we know .
Specified products are sponsorized between certain hours , for example , during a cartoon show generally are sponsored products for kids .

At night , depending on the movie playing , the commercials change too .
If it 's a romantic movie , we are most likely to see commercials for products that are used by women , or if it 's an action movie the target is the male gender .

Some products , such as lingerie , tend to show perfect female bodies in order to attract both sexes .
Women will be incentivated to buy it because they will find themselves attractive as the models , and men will connect that image to a sexual pleasure .

Sex is , in fact , part of our instinct , and that 's where the advertisement are made to hit .
Another area where we are more sensible is food , but it 's a more delicate subject , because women want to lose weight in a healthy way , while men focus more on the taste .
This way , it 's very important to advertise a food that both men and women like , not considerating the children .

Since we have been bombarded of images of perfect bodies , houses , family , lives ...
the new commercials are trying to give more of a realistic image ( without losing that aura of magic ) , therefore we still will see beautiful women , but maybe in company of not as that attractive men , making feel the buyers at the same level as them , and not anymore looking at these `` gods '' as inaccesible .

But the new target of advertisement are the children , since they are left more and more in front of the television , and also because generally in the families they have the control of the remote .
Anyway , I think that a more specified type of advertising , focused on a restrained target , is yet more effective , but it 's more dangerous because it 's reaching some levels never seen before .
We are always looking for the latest status symbol , which is normally a very fancy and useless gadget , but I 'm afraid that is too late to go back .
The only thing that I suggest is to reduce the amount of commercials , because honestly , I think that all of us are sick of them .
