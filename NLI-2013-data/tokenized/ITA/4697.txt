What a personal statement for an advertising man as me !
I absolutely agree with the initial statement , especially for two practical reasons .
The first one is that advertising is a marketing arm , and we know that principal marketing mission is to place the products in the market , giving the consumers the most wicked details to buy them , which means a right price and many other benefits .
The second one si techincal .
Today , photos , TV commercials , web sites and promotional activities are delivered by very high digital techiniques , and almost perfect resolutions .
Actually , we use the most effective computer programs , our sofisticated machines and media opportunities .
We are also professsionals , so we use words and body copy in order to attract the client .
Finally , it is obvious that any product is presented in a better way .
We can work on a simple still life photo for long time , reaching the best image with perfect lights and colours .
And again , we post-produce each film we realize , setting the most emotional point of view , the right song : you will experience few fantastic seconds thinking to ...
an insurance company !

I mean , we represent the `` dream machine '' , an industry that helps firms to convey their own products in the better way .
We are making this since one hundred twenty years , and day by day we improve ourselves .
But in my opinion , the real important task is to be always honest , communicate with a cute , catching method with ethical sense .
We are just giving a special make up to chocolates , cars or beverages .
When we will do this , we will aim all our missions : make the company client happy because of selling and say the consumer the truth , with fantastic words , far beautiful landscapes , fast images on the screen , incredible solutions through the net !
