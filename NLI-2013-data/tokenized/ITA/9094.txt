I disagree with the statement and it is what I do n't like of the intruction system of my country .
I 'm studing engeneering and I have to study a lot of things , a lot of ideas and concepts of difficult subjects .
My professors only explain concepts difficult to understand and , important too , to remember for the exam .
I see that there is something wrong because if I study very much for the exam and I barely remember a concept , two weeks before I ca n't remember that concept because I do n't undertand it or because I have n't a fact that can conduce me to remember the concept .
I think if a professor tell a fact or a story to support a main concept or idea I can using that fact or story to remember and , most important , to understand it .
I can say this because I had a professor of ecology and he was very different from others professors .
He only spoke about facts of little animals to reach the main concept of their reasons to leave a place .
Or for example he explained a chinese problem with the women population .
He told that a chinese man can be considered a man only when his son put him in the ground for his death .
For this reason when a chinese man had a doughter he kills her because chinese government do n't want families of more than five persons , so the women decreased .
With these examples I understand and I remember ecology things after three or four years .
I think that is the best metod to explain complicated concepts too , and it is a funny and not hard way to understand and remember things of different subjects .
