Nowadays we see many advertisements everywhere , on television or in newspapers , on radio or in all streets of our cities ; furthermore the advertisements business is always bigger and this is the reason for the importance of spot .

I think that a lot of products shown in advertisements are worse than they appear .
In my opinion there is one mainly reason for this situation .
First of all the purpose of advertisments is to get people to buy the product , so producters try to show us that their things are the better on trade .
There are many ways to make products much better than they really are .
Thanks to tecnhology we can make many changes on a photo or on a imagine in order to show it better , and all of advertisements are made in this way .

In addiction we see many advertisements in which the products are n't in their natual `` habitat '' ; we must think about water spot : the bottle is always near a river or at the top of an high mountain to make water seems pure and genuine .
I remember a motorcycle spot in which a man with his scooter followed a militar airplane in order to convey much power to the motorcycle ...
have you never seen a scooter that can follow an airplane ?

In our society we give much importance to movement ; according to this situation many advertisements are much movimented ; i think about a machine that trasforms himself in a monster and dance exactly like humans .

In conclusion i think that most advertisements are worse than they appear because of business scope .
