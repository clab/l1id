In my opinion it is important for student to understand ideas and concepts beacause without them they will never understand the facts .
I can expalin it much more better with an esample : if you understand the concept of gravity you can understand why we can ' t fly , but if you only know the fact that we ca n't fly you do n't know the concept of gravity .
You can understand that there is something more but without some further facts you can ' t find the concept .

But at the same time facts are very important for a student .
We live in a socety that it forgets the past in a very easy way , the more we go on the more we forget and school are not good in giving us the information .

I also konw it is difficult to give us all the information because there is so few time but the few arguments that they had chosen for us are not enought .

In Italian schools , for esample , we study for many years the Preistoric period , tha Acient , tha Middle age ...
The Story !
But when we finally arrive to study , at latest year of school , recent story of the world and of our country we run and at least we arrive at the first period after the II Warld War ; now we are in 2007 and there are fifty year of facts that we don ' t know well and for this we have a not culturate class of people that it will govern us ...

This is only an esample to show how facts , in my idea are much more important to understand than ideas and concepts also because if you learn much more better the facts , from them , you will reiceive also the ideas and concepts that are unified to them .
