When we turn on the TV , or the radio , or when we read a newspaper we can see or listen to or read a lot of advertisement .
The advertisement is the process that show a product and try to convince people to buy it .
Mass media are full of advertisement , sometimes we can say that mass-media are maintained by advertisement ( a factory can spend a lot of money to buy spaces on tv , newspaper etc . ) .
Expecially from the 80's / 90's spot 's campaign became very very important to promote products ...
there are factories that spend a lot of money to study how a spot can influence the mind of the people , and how the spot can be an advantage for the selling of the specific product .
The phrase that i 've red is about that most advertisement make products seem much better than tey really are .
I completely agree with this statement .
As i said before , in these last years the promotion of the products became obsessive .
A lot of products , in tv for examples , are shown like the `` PERFECT PRODUCT '' : they are clean , positive , beautiful and expecially VERY VERY attractive .
When i was a little child i remember that i 've seen a spot about a game , i do n't remember the name , but this is not important .
The game was a plastic man with a lot of blades , cars , guns , enemies ...
When i saw this spot i praid my mother for a lot of time to buy me this game , and when she bought it i was really impressed .
The man was smaller , poorer ...
there was only 1 blade and not all the guns that were shown in the spot .
The problem of the spots is not about childs ' games , but is about the lies that are inside of it .
You can lie about a game it does n't matter , but you cannot lie for example about a food , about something that can cause dangers to a person ( like mcdonald 's for example , if you have seen the film `` Supersize Me '' you 'll understand this ) ...
Now i do n't pay attention to the spots , ` cause i know that they lie a lot ...
but all people do this ?
Or i take part to a minimum percentage of people that does n't seem to pay attention to the advertisement ?
As i said before advertisement are really strong and can conditionate the decision of the people ...
and this is a factor that ca n't be left behind .
