I disagree with the statement , according to which there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years .
It is true that the use of cars increase the problem of pollution , especially in big cities , where lives thousands of people .
In this cities often people have traffic problems .
You are not able to go because of the excess of circulating cars .
And when you reach the place you were going to , it is always hard to find parking .
Another thing is the raise of the cost of oil .
Some scientist says that oil on Earth is going to finish .

But it 's also true that cars producers spend a lot of money in order to find new fuels , less expensive and cheaper .
Then I think that many people consider car the most comfortable way to move from one place to another , and they wo n't adapt themself by taking the bus or the train , even if it would be cheaper .
Another thing is that trains , buses and airplanes does n't cover all the goals that a person might have , and have precise time , which they have to respect .
With the car you can go where you want and when you want , and for this reason many people prefer take the car , like I do .
Then there are also the emerging countries , like China .
Cars sold in this countries has increased also by two-three hundred per cent , because of the industrialization .
I think that twenty year is too little to see a decrease in the use of cars .
Maybe it will happen , but it will take much more time than twenty years , also because of the interest of big industries , which influence most of the decisions taken by each government .
