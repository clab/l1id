I agree with the statement that products look much better when you see them during advertisements .
First of all , I believe that in the society of today televisions and newspapers exercise a great impact on the common understanding of the concept of beauty and effectiveness .
This is particollary true when you talk about advertisements .
People believe that some products are better than others just because a certain movie star says it !

Furthermore , considering that most advertisements are proposed by the television , I think that such a tecnology affects the real feeling on the quality of the product .
Secondly , I have to admit that products seen during advertisements look much better than they really are .
They have more colours and they look more appealling than ever , expecially if compared to the ones you receive !

Finally , I believe that the industry of advertisement reached a very high and professional level .
In particular , the advertisement highlits only the good things about a certain product while the negative parts remain hidden and you discover them only when you effectively have the chanche to use the product in your house .

Even if I strongly believe in what I have written above , last week I was simply too influenced by an advertisement seen on a TV and I bought the product advised therein .

Such product was a knife supposed to cut any kind of meat and , believe me or not , the advertisement was really convincing , showing a guy who was cutting any kind of beef .

Unfortunately I received the package yestarday and I found that the knife was just simple as all other knifes that I currently have in my house !
This is just an example of how much publicity can influence people .
We should try to keep in our mind the principles described above in order to avoid any risk , but sometimes it is simply too hard !
