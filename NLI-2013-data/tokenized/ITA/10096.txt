I think that a successful person is more focused on trying new things rather than doing what he or she already knows well .
Infact a successful person is a person who wants to make the difference .
Let me explain .
A successful person is a person who wants to be different from other people ; he / she wants to have some characteristics that can make him/her special in front of all other normal people .
To do that , a succesful person has to try new things and not only to do what other people do every day .
The history shows us many examples of men a women that have changed the world by trying new things .
I 'm talking about inventors that , by doing new things , has introduced some important innovations .
These men and women had taken a lot of risks by doing that .
The inventor that I admire most is Marie Curie , who developed the x rays technology .
X rays technology is very important today .
However , Marie Curie died because of intoxication caused by the big amount of X rays that she absorbed .
Without her sacriface , today we would't have one of the most important instruments to diagnose deseases and illness .

However , I have to say that a successful person is a person that is able to take some risks only when risks are proportionated to the benefits carried by doing new things .
Only a stupid person can take some big risks without the possibility to get some bigs benefits .

For example , managers and brockers , who are the main actors of the financial world , try new things ; for example they try to invest money and time in new areas of the world or in new technologies .
They do thatt only when the risk connecetd to the financial operation is as big as the return of money waited .
