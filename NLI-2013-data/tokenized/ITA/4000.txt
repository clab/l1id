I think that young people today have a lot of time for all .
Today generally a child has a good family , a good clean house with a beautiful garden , he has money and much time , generally a good situation around himself .
The tipical day of the young people is more or less this :
First , the young people today go to school in the first part of the day , they stay in classroom for 4/5/6 hours and then they are freedom .
Second , in the first part of the aftenoon they make a homework for a small time and then ?
They play football or go out for a shopping time or play with a bad machine that they call play station for all time and they do n't observe the world around us .

And so in this days the youth lives and the time pass .
In the world , a lot of countries are in difficolt .
Only the 8 % of the global people live like a normal people but the most part of the global people died for no food or no water .
This is a great vision of the world situation but in every city there are some problem that young people could to see and help .

Every communities organize the groups to bring food to the people without home or a poor people in general in the street or for organizes the local events to stay together for few good moments .

But the young people have a better thing to do .
In my personal experience I think that help my comunity is good , some people are in difficolt for eat or sleep and with my group of friends we helping this people .
When ?
When we are free , after school or after homework .
I do n't spent my time in a bad way I want to help someone .

Finnally I hope that in the world much more people helping their society with their time with their money and with their love .
