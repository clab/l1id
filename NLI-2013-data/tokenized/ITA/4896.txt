Yes , I agree with the sentence because the most of advertisments are false and they induce people to buy them when their quality is very low .
The producers should think less to the sales than to the wealth of the people that will buy the product for example , if the product is food .
The advertisement ought to be more strictly to the reality to show to the watchers the real characteristics of the each product .
In this way a citizen can choose the best .

In my opinion , all the producters will make their thinks better and all the words said in an adverstising space will be perceived and listened better .
By the way I considered the advertising spaces a lost of time and I do n't listen them because , according to me , they are all make to seem what they are n't .

Unfortunately , in my life , I have bought a lot of products that seemed much better than they really were , but after one purchase I did n't bought them another time .
Instead , if the advertisments were real and described exactly what they show , people would believed in them yet .

So , in conclusion , all of us have to try to show the truth of every thing because it is the best way to make the other trust us .
