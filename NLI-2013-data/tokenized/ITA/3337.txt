Nowadays young generations are involved in a lot of activities , which absorb all their energy .
These activities can range from something related to their studies , to something completely different as sports .
All of them , however , are really demanding , and , therefore , they have to choose what to do .
Besides that , nowadays all young people like me are more interested in themselves , and in what they have to do in order to increase the number of skills they have , rather than in what other people are doing .
This is also related to our society which is becoming more and more individualistic .
All these things lead the young generations not to take care of the needs of other people , and , therefore , not to help them .

This is what I experienced few days ago .
I was walking with some friends of mine in one of the main streets in the city center of Frankfurt , and , all of a sudden , a poor joung guy came to us asking for money .
He stated he was very poor as his father lost his job , and , therefore , his family did not even have the money to buy some food .
I felt very sad and I tried to give him some money .
I am not rich , but when it comes to help someone , who is less lucky than me , I usually try to do it .
On the contrary , the other young people who were with me did not even look at him and just passed by .
They did not even took care .
It was unbeliavable .
They told me that , as they are working hard every day and have to face a lot of problems at work , they do not see the point in helping someone who is not trying , as they do , to work hard and improve their life .
This is only a small example , but I personally believe that nowadays we have no time and aver all we are not anymore , as in the past , willing to help one another .
This can also be seen in the decreasing number of young people who do not anymore take part in social activities within their community .
