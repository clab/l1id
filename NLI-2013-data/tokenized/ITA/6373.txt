What road for cars

Is it possible to predict the future ?
To some extent , of course , no is a definitive answer ; yet , if there is a way to do that , it is by looking back at the past , and infer from it the trends that are likely to continue and those that are likely to stop .
So , in order to try to give an answer to the much-discussed question concerning the future of cars , we must refer to history .

After their invention at the beginning of last century , cars have mad a long road ( pun intended ) : although considered for a while a futureless object ( as it happened for most of other inventions ) , or even a terribly dangerous monster , they became more and more common , and by the half of the 20th century ( in the western world ) had started to became a popular way of transportation .
So , should we look only to this phase of cars ' history , we would probably be lead to think that they are bound to grow in number more and more with the expansion of richness from industrialized , western countrie , to the rest of the world .

Yet , somehow surprisingy , the last decades of the 20th century have witnessed the increase in the number of circulating cars getting slower and slower in the industrialized world , and especially in the so-called third-sector based societies .
In other terms , it seems that , if the number of cars gets higher proportionally to the welfare of a people , it also reaches a certain level when it stops growing , or even starts getting smaller .
This phoenomenon accounts for the fact that apart for the micro-states , the highest ratio of cars to inhabitants can today be found not in the richest countries such as the U.S. or Canada or the U.K , but in countries that have started to develop a little later ( such as Italy , or Ireland ) , and where the inversion of the process has not still occurred .

But how can we explain such a trend ?
The answer is quite easy : when a people starts to get richer it can afford cars and so buys them ; but connected with wealthy often comes the realization of the importance of such ends as clean air or comfortable , pleasant cities , which leads more and more people to prefer public transportation ( the use of which has increased drammatically in the industrialized world over the years ) .
Also , other easier and more practical means of transportation become accessible to the masses ( let just think of low-cost air companies ) .

All this considered , the only way to decide whether cars will become more in the next twenty years is state which will be the level of wealthy and its distribution around the world at that time .
If it s in fact fair to say that the number of cars in developed countries will have decreased , it is much more difficult to consider teh case of developing countries .
In twenty years , in fact , they will hopefully have began a process that will make them richer , which will increase the number of cars worldwide ; yet , if some of them at least will have done so much faster than we can now predict , by that time they will probably also start to show the signs of the opposite trend .
