I absolutely agree with the fact that many advertisements make products seem special , even though , maybe , they are not .
I understand that the purpose of an advertisement is to actually show the product with its best qualities , but I think that many times this is n't really what is done .

First of all , it is frequent that the advertisement presents the product as the best one on the market , comparing it with other similar types in commerce .
For example , there are dish washing soaps that are presented as miracolous , but I do n't think that they would actually be able to dissolve all the grease and dirt on a frying pan , after the preparation of a bacon and eggs breakfast .

In addition , behind the preparation of an advertisement there are many people , such as designers for graphics , music experts for the sound and so on .
All these persons work to make the advertisement as appealing as possible .
They know the target of people who to direct , and who will probably be the future buyers , and consequently study a way to show the product that will be specially interesting for those .

The third reason why I think that advertisements are not always straightforward is that many companies decide to pay a famous person , such as an actor or a singer , to make their product more popular .
In this way all the fans of this person would be encouraged to buy what he or she is presenting .
I think that no woman on earth could resist from buying a jewel presented next to Brad Pitt 's face .

In conclusion , I think that people should be aware of these strategies and decide wether to buy the product or not just thinking by themselves , ignoring the sometime `` false '' advertisements .
