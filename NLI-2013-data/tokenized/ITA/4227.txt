I think that 's right .
Young people do n't give much time for their communities .
I think this is mainly because of the todays ' life style .
We think very often in an egoistic manner , looking only at ourselves , without thinking of other 's that might need our help .
I think it depends mainly on parents and society education that is given to youg people .
Today , we live in a fast and crazy world and there is not a lot of time for educational purposes .
All the time is spent at work , or watching TV , or going around pubs and so on and we forget the most important things of life , like having respect of it or being happy for things that life gives us every day .

For example , there are few people that would n't do a work for their community without being payed .
An example may be the beach cleaning activity of some organizations like wwf or greenpeace .
that spend their time to clean our fun places ...
But there are very few young people that do that .

An other example may be spend time for people that need help , like older people or that affected by a handicap .
Those people feel often alone and a little help would be surely appreciated .
Young poeple are n't interested in politics either , but politics is important because it has much influence on our life .
Future society will consist of people who are young now , and because of this it is important to now things enrolled in politics or in other points of view of our society
