the cars today are very spread around the world like the most common way to move people from one point to another .
I think and I hope that between twenty years the way to move evolving toward intelligent solution such as rinnovable energy .
The cars generate pollution overall with consquence on the environment and the rosource are less than some yers ago the usefull of train , metro , tram could represent a solution to the problem of pollution and congestion but this type of vehicle must be more efficient than today .

Morover if people use the private vehicle only for themselves one person the traffic became very congestioned while a better use of car for example go to work o to school with one car for many people can improve ours life .

The rennovable energy such as sun and wind for cars reduced pollution or generate electricity .
there is less air and sound pollution , I have a car but i use it if necessary i prefer do moving with my legs to little distances .
The constuctor of cars work on new type of engine and space because the people understand this problems and try to buy car with this features .
The resource is good to future for me .
