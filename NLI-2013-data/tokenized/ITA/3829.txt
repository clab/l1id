The topic of how many time young people must give to the communities has constantly been debated in my Neighborhood .
This theme originated at the time of first communities .
In fact , for example , Socrates was tryng to estabilish the best balance between the time that people must spend on their community an the time they can spend for themselves .

Upon this theme there are two schools of thought .

The first one says that giving the time to the communities is not only a way to iprove the community too but also a way to improve the level of knowledge of young people .
In fact , they say , a young people nowadays do n't needs only to be learned by a teacher , but also to have a pratical feedback against to his work .
For example a young person that have studied the painting methods is not really able to paint a ceiling , or a wall , because it needs the experience to do it .

The second one , on the contrary says that , for young peoples , giving time for the communities in which they live in , it is not a good idea .
These because young person might be more interested from these activities than their own studies .
A team of American Psychologists has been observing the way to give time for the community of about two-hundred of young people for two years and they have developped a theory that is in according with this second school of thought .

On balance than , I agree with the first opinion because I think that a young person would became a better person only if he shares his time with the community in which he is living .
