I agree with this statement .
I think this phenomenon is much more frequent in advertisements of foods , but it is also widespread for other products .
We have a lot of examples in the allday life : when we go to a supermarket we see lots of products that seems very prelibate , quite appetible , that really seems to be perfect .
In my personal experience , I often know that when I 'll be back home and I will be able to see how really the product is , my delusion will be clear .
But this not avoid me buying that product , and obeying to the law of consume : consumers must be stimulated to buy a product , in every possible way .

So the message of some advertisements for example emphasizes some qualities of the product that are not so important , or that the product does n't have !
This is a tipical aspect of the modern society , which is totally focused on the appearance and very often seems to forget that sometimes it is more important the substance than the form .

But I think also that this trend in modern consumistic society is due to an intrinsec characteristic of the products in commerce .
We can see that the products in a certain field are quit similar : for exampe every car well does its function , to carry a people from one place to another .
There are very few differences between one car and another one : one car may be less expensive , the other may have less consume , another one may be more fascinating , but really all cars are very efficient if we think that they only have to permit us covering big distances in short periods of time .
Sometimes one company is able to project a car which is a bit different from the others , for example because it has a new technological device , but this improvement is not so determinant , and other car does not become obsolete in an istant of time .

So why a consumer should choose a product instead of another ?
At this time is very important the aspect of this product , and it becomes so important that in some cases it brings to a systematic lay , by making products much better than they are .
