Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
Maybe .
It 's also true that nowadays communities that need to be helped are lots more than in the past .
I think the main question is too big for being resumed in these two lines .
Young People , right now , is more dedicated in avoiding its own big problems such drugs , aids , racism and so on .
Describing the help a person can give to his community begins from the little .
I can talk about my personal impressions and actions .
In the city i live , Milano , the helping attitude in general is so low , and people basically go on their own business .
They do n't understand that giving help to someone may cost time , energy and can go over the rules .
Personally , i 'm training kids living in the suburbs doing graffiti , an art that know how to create without loosing the feeling of the street .
Sometimes what we do could seem wrong to someone else , but i know i 'm taking with me those kids and keeping them away from really wrong habits they could begin to have .
What me and few friends do is not helped by no church , organization or organized groups : is something we do because we feel we can do something with those skills god gave us .
Is an action that goes little , dedicated , moving in the shadow : we just know that those kids will have something right , colourful and creative to do in their streets instead of beginning something wrong .
Beside that , every day is plenty of little but not less important occasions to helping people : giving your seat to someone more needful , bringing your old clothes to the local church , help someone crossing the streets .
Little by little .
Sometimes a smile can last for days , even if it 's a glimpse .
