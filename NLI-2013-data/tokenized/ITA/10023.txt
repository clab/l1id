In life we see and fall down in al lot situations that show us that the world is moving and changing .
This is because of people that can feel when is the moment to do or to try to do something new and unknown .
There are n't a lot of corageous people but we can see and we have to admit that these people exist and improve our society taking risk .
If they had n't been existed , we probably would n't have had what we have right now so , I think that a good example might be Leonardo DaVinci .
He lived a long time ago and he was considered a mad man with a lot of strange ideas .
Nowadays we have the possibility of using his ideas and to adfirm that he was and he continues to be a genious .
He continues to be a genious because we are already following his knowledge to do usefull and important things , but when he was alive he took a lot of risks because all that he wanted to do , all that he said , all that he wrote was new and considered by normal people strange , crazy or even stupid .
Another example might be Dante Alighieri .
He is the father of the italian language and he started to write in italian language when other people were using the old one .
Probably he was considered mad too , but if he had n't written the `` Divina Commedia '' , we would n't have spoken how we are doing today .
He was really corageous and tried to explore other ways to do something and to improve his work and he finally did it .
He wrote one of the most important book of the italian literature .

At the end of the day , to achieve the success we have to take risks and to try new things .
In my opinion , we could n't and must n't continue to use and do what we already know how to do well and we have to follow the examples of our masters .
