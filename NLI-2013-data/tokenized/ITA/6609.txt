It is a common thinking that in few years there will be fewer cars in use then there are today ; it is not known if it will happen in twenty years or in a longer time but i definetely think that it will happen .
There are a lot of explanations and a lot of reasons about the inevitability of the problem but the main reason is to be found in the very different conditions which charchterize different parts of the world .
We live in a world were a little part of the population is rich , healthy and with an high standard of life .
But this part of the world live pretending that their condition is the major one and ignoring ( or pretending to ignore because they do n't want to face the truth ) that there is all the rest of the world which lives in a desperate situation of poorness , deases and death .

That 's why the occidental tradition allowed itself to do n't care about this dramatic situation and to exploit the resources of the third world in order to get benefits , money and interests .
This horrible situation is reflected very well in the problem of the petroul .
All the resources of the black gold are in these poor areas of the world and they could be a good chance of developing for the people of this areas but the problem is that they are in the hands of the multinational companies which abuse of the countries , which exploit the resourses and which have no respects for the inhabitants ' human rights .
The problem is so spread that it includes many problems which are for istance the politics envolved in the matter petroul .
This is a very important problem and it can be quantified that the most part of the wars of nowaday and of the wars to be have common points in the interest generated by the petroul .
The last point which is important to analize is the fact that the petroul , in the way it is produced and in the way it is used as gasoline , produces a huge and uncontrolled pollution which is the cause of enormous problems like the most known is theglobal warm .
Considering all these aspects and many others as important as the one analyzed it is obvious that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use then there are today .
It remains to decide if there will be fewer cars because we responsably decided to stop to cause problems to the earth and to the whole humananity or if there will be fewer cars because we used all the petroul available which means that we will live in a world destroyed by the pollution and the wors and conseguetely near to its end .
