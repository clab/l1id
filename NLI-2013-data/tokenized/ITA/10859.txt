While it is true that some people prefer not to take risks and experiment new things , someother believe that only those who dare exploring the unknown and continously improving themselves can acheive `` success '' .
I think that the successful people are required to try new things and take risk , because their knowledge may get outdated in a short time .

Let 's take the example of fashion .
Fashion is continously shifting and it is always changing according to the mass requests .
If a successful stylist would persist producing the same kind of products after a fashion shift , he would bankrupt in no time as noone would be interested .

Other cases of successul people can be scientist : what would be of humanity if scientist did n't make their experiment or tried unbelievable theories ?
The whole science is a always-changing subjuct as modern science differs heavily from just 50 years ago science .
In this very field we have great names such as Heinstein who carried out his experiment of the relativity in phisics , or Bell who could invent the phone only by trying different hypothesis in the radiowaves sector .

One of the most striking example is the technology field , especially the computer evolution : computers power doubles every 18 months , and the software is always more and more hungry of resources .
Would you consider possible some of the great mathematics achievement , or , on the other hand , some befautiful 3D film , without the growing calcolus power of the computer , obtained by continued research ?
In this field as well we can hear very big names , like Bill Gates , Steve Jobbs or Linus Torvalds , who were enabled to provide us with their great operating systems ( Microsoft Windows , Apple MacOs X and Linux ) only by going against what they already knew and trying hard new solutions .

In conclusion , the key for success is obtainable only by hard work in experimenting new theories and only by will to continue renewing oneself 's knowledge .
