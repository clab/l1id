I believe that is more important for students to learn fact in a real way , rather than learn only knowledge .
An example to support this idea is the comparison between university skills and work experiences .
If a student learns about something practical it will be helped in the all day life and in the work life .
On the contrary learning only concepts and ideas at the university is less useful in the real life .

The experience that a person can achieve during a period of work , it 's something that you ca n't learn everywhere .
Throughout the education , students ( for what concern the Italian system ) do n't achieve as many practical things as they can bring from a business environment .
For example I had a work period during the summer vacations in a marketing office of an international company , here I applied all my knowledge in the area .
In this company I learnt practical marketing techniques that my university professors have never thaught to me .
Then , when I came back to the University and the marketing professor give us a task on how to develop the brand image of a business , I was ready and with many skills on this field .

A thing that universities should do , it is to develop a better program of activities that students should be obliged to undertake .
For instance providing working period in a business , whether the university department is business and management ; field trip at caves , lakes or mountain in the geology university and so on .

In the real life learning practical issues is a very important part of people lives .
If a student practice his skills since he is in the early education , when he will enter the world of work he could be more prepared to struggle with the competion .
Therefore he could have a good curriculum in comparison with people that don-t have experience .
