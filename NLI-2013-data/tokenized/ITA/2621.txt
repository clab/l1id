I disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
I think they just enjoy different aspects of it .
Young people are more adventurous and older people are more wise .

When people are young they are still discovering what life is .
They have a lot of opportunities and not many responsabilities yet .
They seek for new experiences .
A young person usually enjoys having fun and spend time with his friends .
Success in school can bring joy to the life of a young student .
I personally enjoy the fact that i am creating my own future .
I love this season of my life .

Older people enjoy other things about life .
I think that being a father or a mother brings a lot of joy .
I think that the older enjoys more calm entertainment .
It a time in their life when people ponder more about what the past .
