probably in twenty years there will be fewer cars than there are today and this will be due to different reasons .
In fact there are already many problems for the traffic end for polluted air and it ' s easy that it will be something to resolv this problem .
There will be many more pubblic way to go aroun than today .
Modern cars need petrol wich is not an infinite source and it 's easy to think that there will be different kinds of works so that people will not need a car as much as today .

First a modern problem are the poluted air and the traffic , wich is too caotic .
So it ' s easy to think that scientists are trying to resolve these problem .
A possible solution is to make something to have cars that will not have such a bad effect to the air as it is today .
But to resolve both the problem of traffic and air there will be many more buses or trains .
In fact today there are so many cars around iven because there are not enough pubblic buses or trains , so it 's necessary to have a car to go to work or to every other place .

Then a big problem of cars is that they need petrol to go on .
But petrol is not an infinite source so in the future there will be less petrol than the one necessary for the great number of cars .
It means that petrol will cost too much till it will be too expansive for many people , that will decide to use other ways to go around instead of cars .

In addition new tecnologhyes are developping new kinds of works , In fact many people will work from their own house using their computers and internet .
So they will not need to go to work every day like they usually do now , and they will not need to have many cars in each family to go to work in different place .

So the fact that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today will be better for the condition of the air and for ourselves too .
and it will be easyer to go around spending less money than today
