I totally agree with this sentence .
Attracting a new client is the base of advertising and in a wider meaning of marketing techniques .
I graduated in Marketing two years ago and the first thing I have been taught during my lessons is that , as a future manager , I would have had to sell the idea of a product not the product itself .
This statement , that might sound quite absurd at first sight , has turned out to be very useful in my job .

The main reason to support this concept is that a customer , when gets in touch with a product , does not act in a rational way .
Many researches based on customers purchases have clearly demonstrated that the customer was n't sure of his choice after a few steps he had made out of the shop .
This example clarifies how it 's not important what a person thinks about a product after she has bought it .
The producer must focus his attention on what a customer wants to find in the product .

If a person in charge of a marketing department of a company fails to do this , he 'd hardly be able to sell the product .
Moreover , as the range of possible items is constantly increasing , advertisements help the customer to do his/her first choice .
If a product shows many possible upsides from its use and multiple possible utilisations it will attract a person for sure .

The more you exagerate in showing an item , the more you will catch the attention on it .
Of course , this does n't always works becouse you will always find a segmented target aware of the fact that you are probably hiding something .

To sum up , I would say that advertising is an art .
Something you cannot learn .
Something innate through which you lead people to buy everything you want , but ...
Something that can improve a product only in the fantasy of a consumer not in reality .
