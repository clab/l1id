I fully agree with the statement , because it 's just what I 've always done in my life , every time I had to learn a new thing .
I always try to focus on concepts and not on facts , so I can understand the reason why something happens and not simply how or when it happens .
In this way it 's much easier for me to remember the huge number of things I need to remember for my studies or even for my job .
I think that this way of learning lets you remember things for the rest of your life , because once you learn how to ride a bycicle , you cannot forget it anymore .
Even if you do not use it for many years , your brains can still remember how to ride it .
Maybe you need some minutes to revive your technique , but after only five minutes , you are able to ride it again as many years before .
In the same way , you can learn theoretical concepts , like long and appearently complicated formulas , just trying to understand what is behind them and how to re-create them from scratch , starting from the concept that they represent .
Instead , if you just concentrate on facts , like sequences of events , dates or other `` useless '' information , you may be able to remember them for a certain period of time , but definitely not as long as you live .
Actually there may be important facts to remember , but this is not the point .
In a few words , I would say that the most important question we have to ask ourselves as students is `` Why ? ''
.
