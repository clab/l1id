I think that for students is more important to understand ideas and concepts rather than learn facts .
When studying , and in life in general , it is important to comprehend rather than using the memory to repeat words or facts that eventually will not have sense in the near future .

Facts are still important and should not be forgotten .
Still , the ability to understand ideas and concepts makes it possible to reason and discuss about topics and matters .

We humans are able to make logical connections using our ( limited ) memory and few facts .
We can understand the real meaning of facts .
And we can reason on what it is behind a fact , we can tell why a fact has happend .

On the other hand , computers and the Internet are in a certain sense `` stupid '' , but they can come to our help and support when we look for facts .
With an Internet access we can consult online sources such as Wikipedia and Google .
These are some of the best tools for looking for facts and these are the tools we should know how to use .

To summarize , for students , in my opinion , is more important to understand and reason on concepts and ideas rather than memorize mechanically facts , dates and numbers .
Students will need to be able to think and reason , computer will help to `` connect the dots '' .
