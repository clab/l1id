I agree with the statement .
Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities , because time is changed .
With the grow of the population and the expansion of the cities the ideal of communities is different .
In the past people live togheter coperating , so young people could give an hand and a contribute to the society , but now there is an individualism society .
So young people do n't feel the need of helping their communities .

I think that young peole must know how important is give an hand to someone that need help .
Everyone must give his little contribute for the growing of the society .

Personally I spend some of my time to help children of primary school with their homeworks , because i think that it 's an important think to do .
During my summer holidays for a month my friends and I do the animation at the Youth Club , playing with children , taking them at the swimming pool , and making some mountain trips .

Children 's parents always thank us for our usefull service because without us they do n't know what can do .
also childern seems to be happy for these activities .
This is an example that with a little sacrifice everyone can give an hand to the community in particulary young people .
I think that the best solution is to incentivate young people to make some activities , for examples help old people or children .
in this way the communitie will grow b
