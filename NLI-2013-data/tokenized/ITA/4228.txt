I can say that I agree with the statement .
Nowadays , young people spend too much time for themself .
In fact , they stay a lot of time in own house to play with the video games or to watch the television and rarely to study something .
First of all , I believe that the tecnology and all the things around it have contribuited to damage the personality of the youth .
In the past , a boy or a girl had to help their family in the fields or in home because their family obligated them to do something of useful .
The boys improved very quickly their skills and they grown faster than the modern boys .
The girl learnd how to cook and how to repair the clothes of their parents because it was a necessity .

The modern young people have the possibility to get every things that they want because their parents do not oppose resistant over all requests .
In fact , I believe that the new parents are too much flexible and permissive .
They should be more strict to allow to understand to their sons what things are important and what are not .

So , nowadays , the young people are more material than in the past so they do not mind if the society around them is going to fall down in a big depression .

For example , I saw a lot of people do not interest of the news or the newspapers a little thing that push a person to think about the real world .

Finally , the modern young people are too much influenced to the society .
They see their friends behave in a particular way and understand that they can get some thing in that way .

They do not spend time to help their communities becouse the modern communities offer all thing that a young need .
Therefore , a boy or a girl does not look for something of interesting to do .
I think that it is the main reason in the decline of the youth .
