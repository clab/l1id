I strongly agree with the statement that says that young people Nowadays do not give enought time to helping their communities because our modern society is very corrupted , and one of these negative aspects is certainly social selfishness .
Whit this word I want to say that in our modern society every person tends to think only at his own life whitout spending time for the community or thinking to the other people .
This sense of selfishness was absent from society only a few decades ago , but whit the past of the time it is became a very common aspect of human behavior .
whit the past of the time in fact people have became more isoleted and worried about their own lifes that they have forgotten that around them there is a society , and that to mantein a general political and social balance every person has to solve a particular role in this society .
wit the past of the time in fact every person has tried to overcome the others to became a self made man satisfied of his or her leader behavior .
The most negative aspect is not that this idea is very spread in the society in wich we live , but the way in which this teory is speading : every family in fact tend to teach to their sons that the most important thing in a person 's life is become someone important and reach .
I belive that this negative teaching have corrupted our society and there is no possibility to return back ; we live in a world damaged and characterized by values completly different from the real values of the past , in whic friendship and sense of helping the community were the key ideas .

In conclusion I would like to underline that it is true that in our society is not present the sense of community helping by the young people , but at the same time it is not correct to accuse young people to be the initiators of this fact because it is only a conseqence of a proces started many decades ago .
I seriously belief that if we do not begin to rebalance the values of our society we will live in a very corrupted world in which the most difficult thing it will be simly to live in !
