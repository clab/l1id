I agree with the statement and there are many examples to support this idea .
Nowadays young people do not help their communities at all and inside the changes of society and culture can be found the answer of this behavior .
In my personal opinion , I think that the reasons for which young people do not help their communities are three .

First of all , it has become very common to live in cities which are not very small in size .
Living in a big city means that a young boy or girl do not have the usual places that there were in the past .
During the last decades , the church , for example , was the typical place where young people could help the others , for instance , they helped old people or the little community near the church .

Secondly , in the past it was usual to live in little houses and your neighbors became your friends and all this friendships formed a community in which everyone gave their help for the others , everyone did something to the overall benefit .
This was a great advantage because young people , living in this particular atmosphere , could see their work appreciated in the community which transformed itself in a big family .
Today this kind of situation is not possible because people usually live in a block of flats and everyone thinks only about his | her own bussiness , nobody thinks how can be important to have the possibility to have the help of the community .

Thirdly , today society and culture has changed very much and , of course , young people are changed too .
Every young boy or girl live in a world without the others , it menas that young people prefer to stay alone .
Nowadays young people thinks only about themselves , for example , about not intelligent things such as their games , their shoes or bags .
They are only concerned on them and not on other people and in particular on community .

In conclusion , all these three reasons can not explain this phenomenon in all its features , but can make easier to understand why young people are so far with their hearts from one of the most important thing inside the society : the community .
