The argument proposed compare two completely different way of thinking life .
For someone a fully way of living implies taking some risks .
Only facing risky choices people can improve their life status and their own satisfaction .
On the other hand , many other people think - and consequently organize their life - to minimize or avoid any kind of risk .
This type of people attribute a great value on safety .

My personal feeling and approach about this matter is flexible .
I think there is not an absolute best way of playing lives but it depends strictly on the attiutde of the people .

By the way , in my opinion trying new thinks is a wonderful experience and an important factor of human growth .
First of all , I think that a wide range of experiences get the people richer .
If I compare my point of view , my culture and my feelings with different one , my mindset could be more open .
This is the reason why I travel a lot and I have decided to work for some periods of my life abroad .

I think it is very limited to pass all our life in the native village .
Probably it is a safer choice but absolutely less interesting !
Second , if no one take risks in this world and try to experiment something new the progress does not exist .
In a world like this we could not appreciate all innovations .
I 'm thinking in particluar about technology improvements that in last decades have simplfied and improved dramatically our society and our lives .

We could find another example on pharmaceutical research industry .
If pharmaceutical industry continue to produce the same medicines and does not spend a lot of money on research there is any possibility to increase our life expectation .

Risky choices of scientist and manager in pharmaceuticals have delivered the possibility to do more , feel better , live longer for many people .
