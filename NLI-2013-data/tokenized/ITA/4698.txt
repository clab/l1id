I agree with the sentence that most advertisements and most negative spots make products seem much better than they really are .
This is real for lots of reasons .

Firstly , a company which product a good or a service want always show the best in its business expecially when it want to compete with another group wich sell to people the same article .
For this reason they often tell people lies about their good through television , city posters or magazines and people trust it , but when someone buys their famous thing , is not really how they describe to us !
For example , one day my mother had decided to buy an hair-phon which should resist to water and repared you from electrical waves but when it fall in the ground with some water drops she broke it .
She was so scared !

Secondly , for new objects we have not the idea of the name of who product it .
If I buy a Valentino 's dress I think it would be better then an H & M 's one because the name is very important and show you the past of a work group .
The companies which obtain the fame with their goods and their service have a best expectative in the consumer and the satisfaction of an expectative create fedelty in the buyer .

In conclusion , I think advertisements are often a lie or an enlargement of the real usefulness of an object but I think also that someone with their work have increase their fame in people in a good way .
