In the next future the number of cars in use will probably fall down .
These thesis can be proofed with some important facts .
Nowadays the cars ' number is getting bigger bigger , congestioning the road and the city .
Move by car in a big city it 's very difficult because of the traffic , and move by car in a metropoli like milan or new york it 's nowadays almost impossible .
In addition to this direct mobility problem , the pollution provided by the elevated number of cars it 's starting to cause very serious problem in city living .

Another relevant problem connected to growing cars ' number is the raise of petroleum price , that makes fuel the car more and more expensive .
To fight this problem many cities are trying to promote the pubblic transport use , to reduce pollution in city area provided by car .
To improve the dismissing of the car in many town expecially historycal town ( like rome and florence ) , the acr acces to the city center was very restriced to a very little number of people with special permission , in other cases the traffic in the city center was forbidden at all .

Many studies about cars alternative car fuel are in act to reduce pollution provided by them , but the continuos growth of city and metropolies , and their overpopulation let see that in a not very far future we 'll not be able to acces city by car .

Nowadays unfortunatly the pubblic transport are not so good at work at your own car is , so many people are also prevented to leave their car in benefit of pubblic transport use .

But also in this case many lot of studies and work are in progress to give the people a very good service that can really answer their needs .
In conclusion i agree with the statement , and in twenty years , i think that we 'll must leave our loved and hated car in garage .
