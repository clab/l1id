Every day we can see a lot of successful people in the street , in our school , in our place of work , in our house .
I think that successful people have a lot of courage because generally they take their success from try new things , new solutions , something that nobody have try before .
It is a great risk because no one can know if a solution is good or no .

The success of that people belong to this courage .
They have no fear to try something new .
It is good but it is also dangerous because in some cases it is more dangerous than pleople can think .

A lot of businnes men are famous , rich and successful because they try something new , and in a lot of cases dangerous .
In fact a lot of people lost everythink they have as conseguence of their take risks .
In the other hand doing what they already know is more simply .
Some people prefer doing something that they already know because they prefer to do it very well even that doing something that they do n't know .
If they do something that they do n't know the ca n't do it very well .

In my opinion it 's important to find a compromise of these two ideas .
It 's important to try new things in order to became successful and it 's not sufficient to do something that is already known .
But it 's also important be carefull and not to take risk that can be too dangerous .
It 's important to think a lot before doing something important for our success , and it 's also important to think about all variabilities than we can find , and all the problems that we can find when we try to do something that we have never do before .

I say these things because I am very carefull .
I do n't be the kind of person that try to do something new without thinking about all consequences that the action can produce .
