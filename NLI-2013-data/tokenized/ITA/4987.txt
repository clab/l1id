In my opinion advertisements make a product seems better than it really is , so I agree with the statement .
In the today 's world a great amount of advertisements is given to us , even if we do n't care of them we are often compelled to watch them .

I think advertisements can change a person tought about a thing , and for this reason we found advertisements everywhere .
It often happens that a person 's choice is changed because it had watched an advertisemts .
Some people buy only things that are showed on television because they are influenced by advertisements .
Advertisements make them think that these products are better than the others .

Fortunately I am not really this type of person because I do n't care of advertisements , just because I know that they could change my decisions .
So when I have to buy something , I ponder my decision and I look for the best price and the best object without thinking to what was showed on television or said in a radio program .
I do n't follow advertisements for another reason : all objects showed on them are more expensive than others of the same type .

That is because of the cost of the advertisements , but these cost seems to be repaied by the influence that advertisements have in people 's opinion .
When I look for buy something I always budget my money and I choose less expensive objects rather than more expensive ones , which are always the ones showed all day long in advertisements .

In conclusion , I think a great part of the people is influenced by advertisements , which make products seem to be much better than they really are , but I think that people have to choose with their own head and must not follow advertisements seen on television or heard from the radio .
