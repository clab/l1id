A key to answer to this question is to think about the different pourposes of study .
Certainly , a specialization in a specific academic topic is essential to do any research .
First because the specialization brings to a more deep knowledge , and then to a better comprehension .
Besides , if you want to say any orginal thing concerning a subject , you will have to know almost all has already been done or written .
In this sense , a focalized study is foundamental .

On the other hand , if you want to reasearch , a broad knowledge is surely useful .
Your mind will be more open , and outside of your topic you will find diffent approach to problems that can help you .
You will may also bring ideas from other fields to your specific one .
You will be able to use the analogy to resolve you problems , that is a very powerful method .
From these observations , is surely better not to specialize .

If the pourpose of the study is merely to stay in the world with more instruments , a person that has studied many different topics will be more cultured .
So he or she will be in a better position than anyone that has n't studied or that has studied only one thing .
It will also be more difficult to betray him or her .

Whatever are your pousposes , if you do n't stop studying , you will be always curious , and your brain will always be active .
Concernig this , there two other reasons that support the idea of not to restrict the fields of interest .
Once you have read all has been written on you topic , will you be able to start studying a different subject , or , on the contrary , you wo n't ?
It is known that any different topic involves a different part of brain ; it is vital for the development of the whole brain not to specialize , but to learn about very different subjects , like music , literature , sciences .

On conclusion , is better not to spend all you efforts on only one topic , but to study how much subjects as you can .
It will help you in your work , in your life , and will keep safe longer your brain .
