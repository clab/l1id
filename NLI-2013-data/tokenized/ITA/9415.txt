In these last years big discussions have been raised about the most effective methods of teaching .
Two main factions have resulted : one magnifying the advantages of learning concepts and ideas , and another stressing the importance of a solid knowledge .
I think that neither of the parts is definitely right , since I believe that `` the true lie in the middle '' .

The first faction highlights the importance of knowing facts in order to continue to advance in learning .
Moreover , they criticizes the counterpart asserting that without strong knowledge the most complex problems cannot be solved even with the strongest deduction .
For example , if a student needs to face any kind of study , he needs to know all the facts on which each argument is developed .

On the other side , their countepart contrasts such opinion affirming that teaching concepts and ideas permits students to reach automatically every kind of facts .
Moreover , it allows students to reinterpreting all the facts they learn from new points of view .
For instance , learning the basic concepts of the style of an author in literature allows students to understand well all his books without any strain .
Moreover , they can compare their own opinion with that of the author and can reinterpretate in a different manner the same arguments .
In fact , it is quite common in classe incentivijng students to discuss about social conditions in which Dante wrote its Commedia to obtain a different point of view .

In summary , many debates have been raised about the optimal method of teaching .
Many teacher asserts that facts are needed to learned in order to obtain a complete and strong knowlegde from school , while many other thinks that basic concept and indeas are enough for students to undestand and learn fast .
I personally believe that a strong knowledge should be integrated with a good possession of the underlying concepts , because in this way student can reach a real critical knowledge .
