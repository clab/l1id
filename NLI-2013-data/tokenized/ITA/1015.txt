I have a simple idea about this question , because there is not a subject more important than other .
I think that a person must know many academic subject because it is a important for all life .
For example in my school I study mainly lecterature , matematic and science .
Probably in my future life i will do not use the lecterature or the science but I will use more matematic because I want to do a architect .
This does not mean that I do not studi lecterature or science .
It means that , of this two materials i can not know specific subject but it is quite a general knowledge .

To difference , probably i will use more matematic in my future work and of this material i must know more specific subject .
My idea is this , It is more important knowledge of many academic subject but it is not important ( maybe impossible ( know all of all in specific .
It is important have a general know of all and know the specific materials and aspect of own intrest .
The specialize is a important aspect for the future work but it is impossible whitout a primary general knowledge .
Many materials are correlated and more aspect are interrelated , so it is important have a general know of this .
It is very erract think at general knowlwdge or at speific subject , both are important .
In my specific , i like know many academic subject because i have many and different intrest .
For example i like studies botany and pop music .
Naturally i can not studi this in specific way but i try to do it .

In conclusion i think that the peaple must know all in generic and some aspect in specific subject .
The important is study very hard and
