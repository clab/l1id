For a student like me that must choose his future , this question is the question that probably i present to myself every morning that i wake up .
From a side , probably have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better because in this way people have much opportunities .
The world of work will offer to us a small choose to do .
Infact , many times people do n't work for the specific subject that they have studied .
Perhaps , having a large knowledge of many academic subjects , can help the man to have and to accumulate experience from several fields .

I must say that specialize in one specific subject can present easily a great opportunity than have broad knowledge of many academic subjects : a beautiful carrier .
I think that having a great number of information on a specific subject can help the man to have a great vantage to other people .
He can work on the subject with all knowledge and he can discover or develop the material that has dealt of .
A man that has a broad knowledge of many subjects ca n't develop the material without a good experience .
He must work many time on the material for having the same preparation of a man that has specialized .
It must explain however that when to a specialized man is presented a material that he has n't study , he must search some help to a man that have broad knowledge or to a man that has studied that specific subject .
Probably in life is often a matter of luck , even if it must be considerate that everything that we 'll do in our life we must use our intelligency .
I do n't know what i want to do in my future , i do n't know if i will have broad knowledge in many subjects or i specialize in one specific subject but i know that i hold my life in my hand and i want to use every occasion that will present to me .
