The issue at hand is whether in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today .
It is an important problem , since it will affect humankind 's quality of life , exspecially if cars will continue to use polluting fuels .
In my opinion there hardly be fewer cars in use than today .
On the contrary , I believe that the number of cars will esponentially encrease .

One reason I think that cars will grow in number is that I am not acquainted with any effective policy to make cars decrease .
Of course there have been many attemps not to make people use their cars ( such as taxation to enter the downtown ) , but any decision have not been made to stop definitely the production of cars .
This would probably be harmful to many countries ' echonomical systems , and would mean the end of many car companies .

Another reason I believe that there will not be fewer cars in twenty years , especially polluting cars , is that the number of cars is related to petrol business .
As everyone may know , petrol business is one of the greatest in the world and it provides great financial gains to the `` petrol masters '' , who have a certain political influence .
Unless `` petrol master '' will renaunce to their incomes , there will never be any effective decision to make cars decrease .

The last reason I think that cars will not decrese is that nowadays there are many countries in the middle of an economical boom , and their populations , in order to satisfy their increasing need of comforts , are buying cars .
For example just think of China .
Its huge population on one hand is getting richer and richer , on the other hand is asking for a larger number of cars to be produced , since it needs them .

Ultimately I think that it is almost impossible that there will be fewer cars in the next twenty years .
Of course this is not the best option for Earth 's life , nevertheless there are not the right conditions to get a better one .
