Even though sometimes , in particular when travelling for a short amount of time , being in an organized group with a guide can be more effective , I generally prefer to travel on my own .

The main reason why I like travelling is the fact that it provides an opportunity to be close to very different people , learn a language and eat new , unusual food .
In summary , to experience a different culture .
When you travel in a group , you often end up with people from your country , who speak your language and want to eat known food , in known places .
Also , tour guides generally focus on the typical tourist attractions , because that 's what most people are interested in .
This is almost the exact opposite of what I am looking for when I travel .

I like to read books about my destination before I travel , so that by the time I am there , I already have a rough mental plan of what I would like to see .
Doing so offers much more flexibility than traveling in a group .
You can choose exactly where to go and when , regardless of what the majority considers interesting .
Some people like to visit churches , others museums or even shopping malls .
When you travel in a group you almost always have to find a compromise and rarely end up being completely satisfied .

My dream vacation includes plenty of time to wander the streets of a new city , without the help of someone who already knows the place .
I like to get lost in interesting streets , to try to interact with local people and to see how they walk , shop and talk in their own country .
Even when I am not fluent in the local language , I always do my best to use as many words and expressions as possible .
I find it much more satisfying , than just using English or Italian , my mother tongue .

Based on my experience , I also believe that people react much better when they see that you are travelling on your own and that you respect their culture and try to blend in , instead of being in a large group , looking at them through the reassuring cultural lens of a guide , as if they were exotic animals in a zoo .
