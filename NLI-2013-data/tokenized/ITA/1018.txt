Some believe it is better to know a lot on a specific subject or on a specific major , some other belive , instead , it is better to have broad knowledge of many accademic subjects .

For me , I can say with confidence that it is better to know many subjects in dept .
I have studied an enjeneering and I almost always take courses connected with my major , so courses related to enjeneering .
If I have a conversation with other enjeneers I feel good and I am sure about what I say .
You know , in situations like this I think that school did a good job and I think , also , this is great for my job .
But if one day I meet someone and we begin talking about somenthig else_ If he or she wants to talk about literature_ or art_ or music_Too bad , I cannot !

So , in this situation I feel not prepared , not well belanced as a persons and this is the biggest reason I think it is really important to study many and many other subject .
I think also that school that has an important influence on the background of students_life , must try to prepare belanced people who can look at theirs futur without fear .

If I have time in the future , I will want studying by myself what I have not studyied up to now .
