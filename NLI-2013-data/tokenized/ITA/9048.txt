The issue about whether understanding ideas is more important than learning facts is a complex one .
Personally , I am convinced that facts are less important than ideas .
In the following paragraphs I will try to explain the reason why I believe this .

First , understanding ideas is more difficult than merely memorizing facts .
Even a little child can memorize dates , names of famous battles , names of kings etc .
But it takes much more effort to understand the ideas and the implications behind these facts .
Take for example the French Revolution .
Anyone can memorize the year : 1789 .
But understanding the far-reaching outcome of it is a much more complex issue !
The french revolution 's results can still be observed in the world we are living right now , where governments rely on democracy rather than monarchy .
While remembering a date is something anyone could do , performing a profound analysis on the plethora of causes and the multitude of effects of such an important event is not so easy .

The second point I would like to stress is that learning facts is not so useful in everyday life as it is understanding concepts .
What I mean by this is : what is the point of learning the exact year of a battle or the death of an important person ?
It might only come useful when being on a TV quiz show or when playing `` Trivial Pursuit '' .
Instead , delving into the causes , the effects and the main idea behind it , can prove useful .
Understanding the main idea that lies behind a fact can help someone obtain precious insight on very important issues like , for example , human nature .
Many antropological studies in fact , rely on histrorical events when trying to explain human behaviour .

To summarize , I believe that ideas are more relevant than facts when it comes to studies and that the universities should be more focused on having students understanding ideas and concepts behind a fact , rather that the fact itself .
