I think that it is more important for students to understand ideas than to mechanical learn facts , especially for students that have to learn scientific concepts ( as for example math 's formulas or physic 's concepts ) .
While just learning facts might be good if you to have to prepare for a class test that will take place in a short period of time , you will probably not remember much of what you have study on the long run .
This because if you really understand why something happens or how does that happens you would know how to solve a particular problem also if you forgot the specific formula .

Another good reason to understand ideas other than just learning facts is that doing so they would be able to use their knowledge also outside the contest they learned it from .
From example a mathematical formula or theory could be applied in other areas as chemistry , biology or even medicine .
Such an advantage would not be possible by just learning a process and mindlessly apply it .

Understanding facts is very important but there are some fields where I think learning facts is not the main necessity .
This is the case of history or literature , although understanding facts can also be useful in some cases to understand , for example , why one nation invaded another or why one author has written one way instead of another and how he has been influenced by external factors .

Probably the best way to learn is to first understand the ideas and then to learn facts .
Doing so you will be able to remember what you have learned for much longer than either just understanding ideas or just learning facts .
