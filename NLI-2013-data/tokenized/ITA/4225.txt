Today are many the possibilities to do something to help the community and the society in wich we live .
Many are the centres organized to give an help to people with different type of problems .

At the same time , nowadays , are many the possibilities for young people to partecipate at this type of work , trought the civil assistance or volontary work , in wich a person decided to give a part of his time to the community .

I am desagree with people that said that young people of today do not give enough time to helping their communities .
On the contrary , I think that today young people are more responsable , and that have a mayor interest in social problems , problems that can refers to people with particoular phisical and mental problems , but also toward situations that refers to the environment and nature .

Maby is different the approch of a young people , in spite of an adult , toward these problems .
A young person has more dreams and aspectation than an adult person , and many times he tries to explain these aspectation with new strange alternative ways , that often are not understand from everybody ...

The younger has the necessity to go on the streets and across the squares to express his disase and his fantasy to change the world .
Is true that , many times , on the real side , he does nothing , but i think that is something .
An aspect that maby has the necessity to be renforced is try to convince young people that several times are more important facts than words and that there is the necessity to do something of more important than to go across the squares to shout what is important to do ...
