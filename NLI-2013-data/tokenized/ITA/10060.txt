It ' s very difficult for me to make an appropriate choice .
However , I think that to try and to risk is better than to remain to own level .
The history learn that this attitudes are to the base of the human life .
Without risk and without people that to risk , our society is not to be able to grow .
Technology , for example .
One man discovery the fire .
he try to tuch it .
The man burn your hand .
Now , the same man know the fire and can use it for cooking .
Maybe if primitive human do not try , he 'd to be evoluted .
According to me , to try mean to improve .
Nowaday , the society pull in this way .
The success is very important and for to reach it , the people must to run freneticly .
Stay permanent is no a good idea for me .
Honestly to change the path is risk but if you do n't have that you want is better to try to search and research in another place .
Already
