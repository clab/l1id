I totally agree with the opinion that most advertisements make products seem much better than how they actually are .

There are mainly three reasons why I support this idea .

First of all , I want to underline what I call `` the value of experience '' .
I think everybody has a bad memory of a product he/she bought .
Moreover , I think everybody could tell a story about how his/her expectations were not met by the purchase of goods and services advertised in the media world .
I think personal experiences can say a lot about how tricky advertisements can be .
As an example , I remember the first time I bought a new type of frozen pizza that was adveritized for a while all around Italy .
The images seen on TV showed a fine and elaborate pizza served with some fresh napolitan ingredients .
In reality , the pizza turned out to be a poor imitation of the original one that I was shown in the advertisement .

Second , I think that the types of advertisement on TV , newspapers and even on the web can never be completely reliable .
What I mean is that a product or service can not be perfectly reproduced on paper or through a photo .
This second point is pretty technical , but I believe it is important .

Finally , it appears clear to me that advertizing techniques are well known and designed for being tricky .
Even in a well-functioning market economy , you can not impose rules that prevent companies from describing or presenting a product in a way that increases its value .
Obviously , there are some limits that companies and advertising agencies must follow to be in line with the regulations and law enforcement , but in general I think there is enough room to induce a consumer to buy goods which are not how they are in reality .

In conclusion , I think it is inevitable to come across products , buy them and then regret to have done so because the products were not exactly what we thought .
