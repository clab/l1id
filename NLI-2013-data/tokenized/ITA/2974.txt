I 'm not agree with that affermation .
I have a grand-pa , 85 years old .
And he is planning to go with me in the north of Europe , for watching the ice-berg , next summer .
he would like to do that with his big old car , and doing this big trip along the Europe , alone , with only his grand-child , 18 years old .
He is , for sure , a person that is enjoying his life .

I know also people , that are in the best part of theire life and that love to stay in front of the tv , playing with the Play-station , waiting to became old .

We usually link young people to the energy , when I think about a baby , i think life , movement and when i think about an old person i think something slow , unlively .
Because that is the stereotype .
Since the ancient times the young people where the people in the spring of theire lives , unlike the old people that where in the winter of theire lifes .

But now I do n't think that that is true anymore .
If people want to feel alive inside , they can do that at all the age that they want .
I know a person in India , she is really old .
and the last time that a friend of mine went to visit her in her country , she asked to that friend to prepare some casset with word in italian , because she would like to learn Italian .
Is not that amazing ?

She has more than 80 years old , and she want to find the energy to learn Italian , and maybe one day visit our country .
That is something that stimulate me a lot .

To be young or to be old , at this time , it is not depending on the age of the person but it depends only on how a person feel like .
