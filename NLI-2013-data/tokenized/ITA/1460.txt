I really have to say < I do n't know > .
This is a question that I ' ve discussed in the past a lot of time , particullary at the school .

I think that the students often think studying like a great possibility to improve their knowledge but also their personality .

To have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects can make a better man or woman in this society .
An opened personal culture can give the possibility to have a lot of relationship .

The problem related to this opinion is the false dream that it gives to persons like me .
I do n't think that the current society can accept a man or a woman that love learning many things , but noone like specific .

To find a job today it 's more difficult than ever , and if you have not a specific competence you will only enlarge the big world of unemployed .

Now I 'm still studying so I ca n't speak about the job world thanks to my personal and direct experiencies , but I can see my friends and my brother 's life .
They have studied for a long time to be good workers , but I see this is not sufficient .
The job and the society require everyday a better work .

So like I usually have to do when I speak about the difference between a broad knowledge of many subjects and a specific one , I must write that today that 's impossible living in a dream , where everything in your opinion is interesting .

Today the only possibility to create a future is to leave at home the passions and all the rest , and thinking about a specific competence that you like and that can give you the possibility to realize a part of your dream .
