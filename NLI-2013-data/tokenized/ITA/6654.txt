I do n't agree with the affermation .
Today , the global popolation is cositituite of seven thousand of people and more people use the car .
I think that in twenty years , the popolation will be augmentation and thus , people will have more cars .

A medium family had today two or three cars and when the global popolation will be major , there will be three or four cars for family .
However , I would say that African `` s popolation , or however all poor popolation , will have major rich and thus it can takes a new car .
But exist also the problem of the petrolium .
This resource is n't infinite and likely , among twenty years do n't will be others fossil combustible .
Today , the people that study this problem think that it is important research a solution .
A possible solution is take energy `` s Sun for develop a car that it going with the light of the Sun .
An other solution is liquid hydrogen but it cost .
There are other solution for to try at limited the problem of the petrolium .
However , all this solution are realize also for the pollution , that it is a factor very important in the good life of the people .

Among twenty years there is more pollution than today if we continue to use the car each day .
Other scientist had propose of add more pubblic trasport , in way of to reduce the pollution .
In twenty years there will be more car for this motives .
Global popolation will have more rich and the popolation of the country more poor will be less weak .
