Some theories predict that in the next twenty years there will be a decrease in the number of the car in use .
I am not sure that this will be the future , but there are many reasons that suggest me that it would be a possible scenario .

The first main raison is the energitical problem .
Everyone knows that oil energy , based on petroleum , might be reduced in the next years and if the fuel for cars is rare , there will be not cars , or at least the cost of petrol will be too high to mantain a car .
Not everyone who today has got a car , might be able to afford these high expense .

The second point that indicates me a possible reduction of cars is related to the pollution .
I live in Milan , a big city in the north of Italy , where the quality of the air is very low because of cars .
Thus , it is raisonable to think that to solve this the government might forbid the circulation of cars in the city .
If it is happens , the number of cars will , certainly , decrease .

Finally the tecnology evolution allows to think that in the next future the need of cars will be lower and lower .
An example comes into mind .
In the past everyone had a horse to move , instead now nobody needs a horse because there are cars .
In the same way , in twenty years there will be other means of transport faster than cars .

In conclusion there are three good reasons to think that the reduction of cars is
