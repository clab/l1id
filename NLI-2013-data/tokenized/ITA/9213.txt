I truly convinced that the relation between `` ideas '' and `` facts '' is so strict that it does not make sense to discuss wheter it is more important for students to understand concepts or facts .

I am engineer and during my own experience I can provide some example to explain better what I think about this issue .
One of the most difficult course is Optical Communication , there are thousand equations to explain the trasmission of an optical signal from one point to another , I read the book and payed attention to all the lessons but althought all the mathematical implications were cleared to me , I was not able to apply them and in that semester I failed to pass the exam , I did not understand the reason for my failure after all I knew all the concepts .
I decided to ask my problems to the professor who took me immidiatly to the communication lab , showing all the applications of what I supposed to know .
Thought that experience , learning `` facts '' I deeply understand the main points of the course and passed exam in a relative simply way .
In this case the concepts could not provide me all the necessary information to a full understanding .

Sometimes could happen the countrary , we can start from theory to understand a fact .
Everyone knows the story of Newton , one red apple on his head represents and important fact : Newton learnt this facts and starting from that he introduced the concept of `` gravitation '' settin up ideas and concepts in order to explain that facts .

Galileo Galilei , one of the most famous scientist in the history , deals with the importance to support ideas and concepts with facts and experiments that could be replicated several times in order to very and prove the validity of a theory .

In conclusion I think that ideas and facts are two aspects of the same `` world '' and one can not claim that one aspect is more important than the other , but indeed they live toghter .
In my opinion a good student has to pay attention to both of these two aspects if he or she wants to have a full understant of an event .
