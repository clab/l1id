I think that theoretical concepts and ideas are very important to prepare a student and to help him to built his own method of study .
For example studying latin , with all those coniugations or maths give you a tool to develop your mind schematically .
In my opinion this is a good training , but it does n't make a professionist .

I believe that when a student reaches a certain level of theoretical preparation he needs facts : he needs to experience in first person what the issue he has studied is all about .

Learning from practical experiences is much easier and involving than studying a subject on a book .
For example ; if I had the opportunity to go to United States and study English , I would improve my language skills much better than I could do staying at home and reading an english edition of Oscar Wilde !

Moreover is very important to consider the kind of subject the student is learning : many subjects need more practical training ( for example biology ) and so other ( as philosophy ) are better understood with concepts .

Think about those people who did n't have the opportunity to get an education ; all they learnt was basically taken from real facts : I can say that the skills they have , for example in formulating a conversation , pheraps does n't follow a logical pattern but if they can apport facts to substain such conversation it is not hard to understand what they are talking about .

So I just partially agree with the statement and i think that the best choice would be to give to the student both the practical and theoretical training to ensure him a complete education .
