Nowadasys the rythm of life is becoming more and more frantic , and this is quite evident and clear to all of us .
Anyway I 'm not of the opinion that today we are losing values and dedicating our time to unuseful or trivial things .
I strongly desagree with the statement proposed and defenitely do n't want to believe that young people do n't spend time helping the community they live in .

First of all , I want to notice that the chances , offered by society , to join voluntary activities and projects , are much more publicized today than before .
Thanks to technological progresses , our wide and fast way of communication make it easier to know the great variety of opportunity for helping someone and somewhere that everyday comes out : from workcamps to sport events , from working with children to bringing help to old people who live alone , and so on .

The environment a young volunteer can find himself in , is never the same so he/she does n't get bored .

Moreover , the several opportunities are available for all the ages , there are not volunteers too young or to old , just volunteers that want to get on their bike and work a bit for the others .

I had a personal experience that gave me an important teaching and that I hope my children will desire to do too .
Last year I joined a group of 23 international volunteers in Kenya and the aim of the project was to build a road ( or may I should say a way ) in the middle of a forest to make children able to go to school .
It has been an experience unforgettable from many points of view : we were helping that african community and they were very kind with us , we lived in strict contact , so I got the chance to know a different culture in a deep way .

Concluding , I believe that today young people have in mind that every opportunity to help the community and to join a voluntary project , can be an extremely significant tool to mature and also a cultural exchange as much important as unexpected .
