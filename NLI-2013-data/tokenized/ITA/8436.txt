I think that learning is an everyday process that is determined by people 's attitudes , interests and experiences .

For this reason i think that a student can increase his knowledge throught different studying methods .

I think that it is very important for students to have a general knowledge of as many topics and possible .
Analyzing general topics presented under the form of concept and ideas , it could be a good way to learn new things without having to study every detail of that particular topic .
This is the case of subjects related to the humanities .
It is not necessary to learn to exact year in which a particular theory has been developed .
Simply knowing the period and the concept of a particular theory , it can be useful in every field .

When studying it is necessary to consider the topic analyzed .
In fact there are many subjects that can be explained by Professors using main ideas and concepts .
There is no need to go deeper exploring all the causes and effects .
In some courses the Professors only requires a general knowledge of a particular topic .

On the other hand there are subjects where learning facts is essential .
Some examples can be historic events .
Learning the facts is determining in order to increase the knowledge on the topic .
Scientific disciplines are another example that underlining the importance of learning facts , more that general concept .
Think that when a scientist does an experiment he really need to know about facts .

To conclude , i think that every subject needs to be treated differently , because i do not think that there is a gerenal rule that determines if it is more important for students to learn from general ideas , than from facts .
