It is generally believed that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
Our society tends to put older people in the corner and to see them as depressed and useless .
Such general point of view is misleading and I personally do not agree with the statement .
I will discuss why young people are considered to be happier than older and to explain why I do not agree wth the statement .

First of all , young people experience a lot of new emotions , both positive and negative , that are considered very positively in our minds .
Secondly , the physical strength of a young person allow them to do extraordinary things .
Nevertheless , experiencing a lot of emotion or being very strong does not imply being happy and it is not what older people are looking for .

In my opinion , older people do not need strong emotions or extraordinary thing to feel happy .
In general they choose to do what they really want to do .
In fact with their experience they are able to enjoy life simply reading a book or visiting a museum , things that are generally not considered exciting by young people .
I think that this changement is due to a physiologic evolution of the brain throughtout life and to the capability of understanding their own limits as well as their own source of pleasure .

In conclusion , I do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people , but I just believe that older people enjoy their lives simply in a different way .
As I wrote above this is strictly bound to the fact that human mind changes during life as well as human being does .
