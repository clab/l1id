I completely disagree with the wiew that young people do not spend enough time helping their communiy .
In fact I believe that the most active members of communities are young people .

Community needs are varied , and not are not just limited to helping out elderly people , or servicing in hospitals , or other typically welfare duties .
Nonetheless many of the young people I know spend much of their spare time volunteering on ambulances , or performing plays and music for elderly , thus contributing significantly to the total amount of time spent by the communty in general on these tasks , and often being the promoters of such activities .

On top of this I am firmly convinced that communities need spaces and occasions on which to gather , in order to strenghten their mutual ties , to get to know each other better , thus exchanging culture and knowledge .
It is my experience that young people are the best and the more commited to organize such events .
In fact many of the art displays in my community are organized , and kept running by people in their twenties ; and often the works displayed are also made by young people .
This shows that young people are helpful to their community in two different ways : they both organize cultural events and are the main cultural point of reference and innovation in the community .

I also know a lot of youngsters involved in politics , both trhough political parties and political associations .
I have been in a political association for many years too .
In the meetings that were frequently held , important topics regarding our city and province were usually discussed and debated , and often innovative and revolutionary ideas were developed , some of which were later successfully implemented by the local authorities .
Moreover an advancement in political and social beliefs will not be possible without the fundamental partecipation of young people to public life .

It is my opinion that this misconception of young people not helping their communities is mainly spread by old conservatives , who fear what new the young generation can bring , and always have their heads turned back , remembering how life was much better when they were young .
