Traffic , a rapid increase in fuel price and its scarcity , pollution and the related environmental threats , the number of accident : they are all elements that probably will lead in the next future to a sharp decrease in the number of cars .

As many people , and in particular the car industry , may think that , on the contrary , cars will continue to be increasingly used , I am confident new solutions will be applied .

It has to be said that the modern public services , with regard to ways of transport offered , have a better quality than the past years .
Trains and subways can now considered a reliable way to move from a place to another , with no risk to get there later .
Traffic jam , instead , is the first reason for people to be late and to increase their daily stress : this situation is the main reason for people to let their cars parked .

Using cars is also not convenient , from an economic point of view .
Today , fel costs , which increase at a pace rate , has a negative impact on a family income .
I can handle my personal experience .
My parents , for example , decided to reduce the times they use the car to move , or , at least , they try to combine their different necessities going out together , in order to save fuel .

Moreover , is has been proved that air pollution , due to cars - emissions , is the first cause of breath diseases , even in young people .
To contrast the indiscriminate use of cars , many Italian municipalities , decided to prevent cars from moving in periods when wheather conditions worsen the concentration of dangerous pariculates in the air .
And connected to this , somewhere fees to car entrance in the cities have been introduced .

For all these reason , I am confident that in the following years , an increasing number of people will be more aware of the positive outcome in not using cars and , as a consequence , their sale will be lower .
When the number of cars will be reduced , we all feel healthy ( as bikes will outspread in our cities with no consequences for the environment ) , happy with the money saved we would buy thing more useful and confident that it was the right thing to do .
