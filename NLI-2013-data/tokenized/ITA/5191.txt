I agree with this statement .
Advertaisement is taking an important place in the decision to buy for a customer .
I think that this fact is thanks to the popularity of television .
Spots are becoming more and more frequently and they continuosly influence who is whatching television .
Moreover , we can see advertaisement everywhere : on the bus , on the walls of underground , in the newspeapers ...

Thanks to all these reasons , companies are developing the sector of advertisement , becouse in this way they can reach the costumers and so they have more chance to sell products .
Also this tendence is effective to know how the people is influenced by advertise and how is necessary showing a product in the best way .

Sometimes the firms presents a product describing all its properties , in particular all its qualities .
But they put particular attention in hidding the negative characteristic becouse these are a sort of negative advertaisement .
In order to show goods desiderable and amazing they try to invent some good qualities and in this way they make a product much better than it really is .

As far as I am concerned I think that this false advertisement is a negative aspect of the business of ours days .
Companies should do everything in order to sell their products , sometimes they even lie , that is orrible becouse they do n't garantee the costumer .

When I want to buy something for me or especially for a present , I put all my attention in what I am buying , and a logical consquence is that I buy something that is famous , that is trendy .
Infact too not make any mistake I prefer to buy a product with a good brendt , that probabily should be better than one that is unknown .
Furthermore the brendt should give to the costumer sure characteristics , as good material for a dress , or good ingredients for a food .

Thus a direct consequence of this false advertaisement , according to me , is the increasing of product of a famous brendt that are more expensive and the small success of normal products .
