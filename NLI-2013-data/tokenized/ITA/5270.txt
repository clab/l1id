First of all I agree only partially with the statement above , and in particulary I think it ca n't be considered an always valid statment .
I think that the problem is very simple : the statement can be considered true if we want to do a generical analysation of the problem .
It 's well known that advertisements are done to try to sell a certain product , and so if they are not convincing how can the productor sell them ?
A second factor is that in the world we live now , we are completely submersed by products of every type , every form , every colour and every brand , how could we choose one of them without advertisements or explanations of what the product is consisting on ?

I have also to admit that sometimes the companies of medias exagerate in telling lies , but is in the intelligence of the person who have to buy something to not believe in everything they say , and first of all see the product with their eyes , ask for informations about it , compare the price and the features with that of the other products of the other companies , and finally buy the object .

Generally I apply the way of thinking I explained above , but I have to admit that sometimes they captured me in their advertisement ; I will give you an example : some months ago I had to go to london to improve my English language , and when I had to book the flight I checked on internet the different possibilities .

Flight sometimes are very expensive , expecially for a young girl like me and so I remembered I had seen an advertisement on a train in my city of a very low price company of flights .

Then I found it on internet and booked my flight at a very surprising price !
only 50 euros !
First I was very happy , but when I arrived at the aireport I had to paid 50 euros more for my luggages and 30 euros more for the overweight of my luggages !!!
I was very very very angry and I decided I wo n't believe anymore in the future in people who promit you something without asking anything !!
