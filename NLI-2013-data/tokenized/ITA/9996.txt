I always try new things in my life and I risk , because I do n't know if I will do these things very well .
In fact I have n't always success in the new things that I try to do .
But I agree with the statement that says that successful people try new things and risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and I have some reason to sustain this statement .

First of all , I think that if you do n't try or do n't risk , you 'll never know if you will be good to do a thing or if you will be happy to tryied this thing .
For example , last month a friend asked me `` Why do n't you try to sing in my music band ? ''
.
I though that maybe I had not the ability and the experience of sing and become as a leader in a music band , but he said me `` In my opinion , you must try or you 'll never know ! ''
.
So I trusted him and I decided to try .
Now I 'm very glad of this decision because I love sing and also if maybe I 'm not a very good singer I enjoy myself !
This is absolutely important .

Another example I can bring is about my sister .
She 's very insicure and she has n't much self-confidence .
She likes reading poems , but she did n't want to try to write one !
So my mother said her that she would be a good poet if only she wanted to try .
Now the poems of my sister are the best I ever heard .

In conclusion I think that try to do a new thing is never a bad idea .
In fact if also you will not have success you maybe will be happy !
