Nowadays we are completely surrounded by every kind of advertisements ; watching tv , listening to the radio or surfing the Web , it is almost impossible to skip advertisements .
They belongs to our society now ; they can be sometimes annoying but at the same time they are important for a company to improve the name of its brand and the knowledge of it on the consumers .

Personally I am not critic about advertisements ; sometimes I like to focus my attention on them , I do like buying some magazines just to take a look on fashion advertisements and I have to admit some of them are reallly funny and smart .
They are now so important that many companies tend to spend huge amounts of money and making cospicuous investments on them in order to gain customer trust and obviously profits .

Nevertheless all this I have just explained is not always supported by a good product in terms of quality : it happened to me many times in the past and I was really hungry about .
I bought a particular doll to give as a present to my little sister in-law , she was just 4 and according to the advertisement that nice doll had to walk and to use rollerblade only with three batteries .
I was absolutely enthusistic about the idea and I was sure that my littke sister for sure would appreciated .

Finally , she opened the box and our joy soon turned into rage since the doll did not work at all even with the batteries ; so the advertisemet was really tricky and mislead .
Moreover I felt really bad because my lovely sister was clearly disappointed .

In conclusion , this was just a personal experience but now since that day , I feel more mature and confident when I choose a product , sometimes we should trust on advertisements but not completely and always being aware .
