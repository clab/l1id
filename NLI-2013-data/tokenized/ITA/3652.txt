Helping communities is one of the most important thinks that can improve a state .
As a matter of fact some years ago people spent more of their time in helping the others .
Although nowadays people , and expecially young guys , are not used to spend free time for their own buisness rather than giving a social contribution .
In my opinion this behavior is not useful , because if all people go on thinking only about their owns , so many problems are going to increase .

I can give you an example to make you better understand my state .
First of all I would like to speak about the poors .
These people have a lot of problems that are linked with their economic health .
Worldwide there are people that prefer to spent their time in increasing their amount of money and in general their beneath , instead of investing some of their huge amount of money in the communities .

If all of the richest people in the world would invest some resources in helping others , I 'm sure that everyone could be happier , also the richest ones .
In fact one of the most important things that this kind of people cannot understant is the emotion and the sensation that they could feel when they help someone .
When people help someone else the benefits are not only for the poors or the receivers of the help but also for whom has given the help .

In conclusion I want to say that people , and in particular young people , would learn again that give is the best thought that someone can have .
If young people would improve the way to give help to the others I 'm sure that all of us could have a lot of benefits not only in the closed future but also in the far future .
In fact in this way people that now are guys will be able to teach this concept to the offspring and go on .
All the world would be better than it appeares now .
