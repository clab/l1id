I think it is more important understand ideas and concepts of the things than learns only the facts , but I also think it is important that you learn real facts of the ideas and the concept you have learned before .

When you study something that is not obvious or immediatly rapportable at the real life , for example math , if you are a student , you 'll ask to yourself why are you learning it ; on the other hand , if you plans a little information program , you 'll know immediatly what are you doing and why .

If a boy decide that he is n't interested much more on the why of the things , he should have to learn only how something is done .
This is the case of most of the physical jobs like sellers or something else .

Otherwise , if you are interested on ideas , you can learn a lot of things .
If you study properly something , you 'll discover that all in the wolrd , is strictly related , for example the same laws that govern electricity , govern also the the water flooding .

In spite of this , if you do n't learn any real facts , you might loose any capacity of use what you learned ; in facts I know a lot o people that are famous professor at university , that are n't able to take care of a flower , or they are not able to make most of the simplest house works .

When I was younger , I attended a technical school .
There , I learn how to make an information program , how to build a little integrated circuit , and similar things , but I did n't really understand what I was doing .
Only when I came to the University , I discovered that the things I was doing were not a `` God Present '' , but were something that came out from the laws I did n't studied .

Finaly , I think if you want to become somebody , you 'll have to study the ideas of the things but you will also learn the facts .
