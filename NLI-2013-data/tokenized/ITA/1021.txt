The statement propose could be considerate correct in some cases but incorrect in others .
The two possibilities rappresent two kind of ideas , and the use of the first one , in opposite of using of the second one is different case by case .
I prefear to have a specialize knowledge in one specific subject .
The motivation of my personal choose is the strong possibilities rappresented by this opportunities .
If you are the best in an argument you will be called everytime someone need help on it .
An example is the use of computers in general .
In my university group I am the best in using of computers and when some friends of mine have problem with computer , he ask me how he can to resolve his problem and if he need to repair it , he ask my help too .

They call me because they know I am able in using computer and they call me only in this cases .
I am able also to resolve maths problems , but my friends never call me to resolve this type of problem , because I have some friends of mine more able than me to resolve this kind of problem .

I use this example to demonstrate that if a person want to decide of use the second sentence he must be shure of to be very strong in the argument he choose else is better choose the first sentence .

The first sentence get opportunities for whom is able to organize himself .
the knowledges of many academic subjects permit of use everykind of knowledge in all type of academic subjects .
Is not easy do that and I think this kind of possibilities is for few persons .
In the end I can say that I use specialize myself in one specific subject , but I am not agree with second sentence , but I think everyone have to choose the best opportunities for himself .
