Nowadays it 's a very appropriate question because our lifes are caratterised by a lot of form of advertisements that try to induce us to buy something .
our economy is in large part based on this metod used by industry to show to the world their products .
I think that this big quantity of pubblicity is n't good and i 'm in particular disappointed by watching it on the television .
during a tv program or a movie people must watch a lot of advertisements also if they do n't like it and it disturbs realy much .
to appreciate something on the tv is very difficult cause of all the pubblicity interruptions .

I agree with the statement cause in the pubblicity every product seems perfect and is shown like if everybody need it also if in reality it is not true .
so the pubblicity is a disturb and also a sitting kind of lie .
people , in particular children an old people , start to think what the pubblicity induce them to think and feel the need to have something that they do n't really need .
for examples if a child sees an advertisement of a game a lot of time he starts to want that game only to show that he has it and because maybe he thinks that he will became more happy having that game also if he never liked games like that one .

i think that in the advertisements everything seem good or helpfull but we must think if we really need it and before making the decision to buy something we have to compare similar products in order to try to buy the best product and not the one we heard about in a pubblicity .

advertisements are good to show products and to have an idea of that exist in the world but we must look at them carefully in order to avoid to take decisiond without thinking .
