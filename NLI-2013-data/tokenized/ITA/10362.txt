I do n't agree completely with the statement .
I do n't believe that in order to be successful people have to take risks or try new experiences .
I mean , it would be more correct saying that these kind of people are brave , but I really rather not to use the word `` successful '' .

Let me explain myself : it is extremely complicated to define what does it mean being a successful person , people have such different goals and perspectives in life that there is n't a clear definition of the term !

I can feel that I made it or that I am extremely successful for something that maybe would be seen as a total disaster from someone else 's view .
So , I guess I admire both people who are always trying to make changes or experience new practices , and also , on the other hand , I truly respect those who feel much more confortable and self secure by repeting things they already know .

However , I must confess ...
I think I am more a `` new risks every day '' type of woman !
I love to feel the emotion when I do n't figure out what am I doing or I try all my best when it comes to dealing with new circumstances .
So , that is probably another reason why I do n't see as successful people who try new things : because I do n't see myself that way , using the word `` successful '' .
Maybe sometimes I wish I was wiser , more traditional and not afraid of everyday routine !
