Nowadays young people have many different kind to happiness and they are n't the problems that their parents had .
In my personal opinion is not true that the young people do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I disagrre to this statement .
Further , I want to say that the young people have a responsability and the possibility to study , then they became adult leater .
Then , they are few times for helping their comunities .

I realy true that many no profit organizationes ( ONLUS ) can doing their activites because many young people work free for their .
At this days , for a young person , is very difficult chosing to going in Africa , or in another pure zone of the world , for helping the population .
But a lot of young people do it .
Also many organizations of cities , for exemple churc or CRI , have help by the young peolpe .

Another point that I think is it important to mention is that in a world full of elettronic intrateniment , money and when the possibility to travel and enjoy yourshelf are more it is very difficult filling the need to help the comunities .

In my personal own opionion for improving the number of the young people that decided to helping their comunities is more important educating and teaching to children the importance of frendly , carity and love .
