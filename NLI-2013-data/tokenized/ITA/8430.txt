To understand ideas and concepts is very important , but not more important than to understand facts .
At the contrary , I would say that the order in which they know both things is the real point .
I think that if you want understand facts , you need to know before well ideas that are at the base of them .
Behind the facts there always are concepts .

That is why when the students go to school , they need an education from their parents before .
Mainly the education in family is the base which teachers can build on .
Exactly like when it needs the house to built the roof .

So , concepts and ideas , learnt when they were children , and improved by going to school , and reading books and studying , must be strong and very clear , to build the facts on .

A very good example is to study history .
When a student studies history , he/she would need to know some clear ideas , to understand well which are the causes of a war , which thinks and feelings were involved to cause a war .
When they know the ideas , they will figure out easily the consequence of the act of the war , caused by ideas .

But especially , to understand the very central concepts of every-day life is important to live in harmony with other people .
They should know which are the right behaviours to live in their society , and these they should learn by their parents , and by growing up with their friends .
As a consequence , they will be able to apply the ideas to their lifes , and to transform the concepts in acts .

However , if they had understood only the consequence of ideas , the facts , they would not deeply have comprehend what there is behind them .
In other words , if they know the causes , they can use them to figure out the facts .

To sum it up , I think it is important for students to have a deep and strong background of ideas and concepts about central points of which are the right and wrong behaviours , and about evrything about the life in general , to be able to use them and transform in and understand the facts , for all the duration of their life .
