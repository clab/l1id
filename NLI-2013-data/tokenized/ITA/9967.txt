In my opinion it is normal that successful people try new things and take risks because they see the world in a different way that is quite different than a normal worldwide .

For examle .
Rich people do n't care about money and for this reason the will never be warried about a kind of investment , they have enouth money to live however .

For poor people ( middle-class people ) doing investments is a very hard problem because they have a little quantity of money avaleable which is the result of years and years of work .

For this reason they will think several times befor doing something new taking risks .
I have mentioned this example because i 'm living a self experience about this topic .
I 'm studying in Milan ( but i 'm original of the south of italy ) and for me this is a great opportunity that my parent are giving to me , and i appreciate a lot the efforts they are doing to let me stay here .

So befor doing this choise me and my family spend a lot of time to plan togheter ( to convince them to .. )
my future .
Only at the and , after they have benn considered al risks , they agree with me .

This is n't the case of a friend of mine , with a very successful family , which had the opportunity to try new studying experiences abroad even if he was n't plenty convict .
He tried because the most he could lose was `` an year '' spent far away from the family .

Another radically different type of example could be the following .
Successful scientists are always pushed to try new theories , to discover new things because it is an innaturally aspect of their personality
