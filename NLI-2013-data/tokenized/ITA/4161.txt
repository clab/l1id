Young people often resemble an attitude of interest to the most important issues , regardless of the amount of the time they give to actually help their communities it is very difficult to meet someone that is completly not interested .
I personnaly find very important that there is a social awareness of what si going on in any specific community and probably the young people involved play a leading role in in what their communities will look like in the future .

Looking the communities with a positive and understanding eye is not something that only adults should do .
Lots and lots of activities are done in communities and the majority of them are well organized , young people in general attend to many of them and contribute significantly to the evolving proccess of communities .
Of course there is a lot done by the local religious communities in wich maybe there is sometimes a lack of young people .
I personally live inside a community where the local church organizes places where all the young , ages from seven to eighteen can play soccer and always attend mass as help for the priest .

The high sense in these cases of very strong religious factors can build up very strong communities and avoid the spreading of violence and indifference .
Looking in a positive way to my communitiy made me appreciate all of these organizations and participating to some activities and allowed me to instore some of the best friendships of my life .

Looking back at some of the best years of my childhood i see a lot my time in my community .
