In my opinion young people have to help their communities because in this mode the youngers can improve their personal experiences and this fact is very important for every work that they will do .

On the contrary , even if a young person might help community , he or she cannot do it because they have not time for this purpose .
Infact , usually school steals much time to students and free time is not fair to help community .
At the same time a person must enjoy her or himself in free time to not explose ! .

So , if a person wants to help community he or she renounces to free time and this question is very difficult to deal with .
Infact , after an hard week of study I believe that a young wants to go out with his friends or make some sports .

In my personal experience , I wanted to entry in Red Cross beacuse I think that it is important organization to improve our society .
The lessons of this organitazion are made at Monday and Friday evening in a period that I have to prepare exams and I cannot follow lessons .
So , I did not follow my purpose for school reasons .

Another experience in my life is related to Church activities that I don not want to follow because they are made on Saturday afternoon and this is the only free day of my week .
I am very sad for this , but after a week in a place not near to my home I want to visit my friends for example or to play tennis .

So , I believe that if school needs less time youngers can help community but in these conditions are very dfficult to realize it .
A purpose that can be made is to put in scholar schedules voluntaries activity like Red Cross or to help in hospital .
It might be a mode of stimulating youngers to be near to their community .
