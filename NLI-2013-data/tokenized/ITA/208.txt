I disagree with statement : `` in twenty yers there will be fewer cars in use than there are today '' , because I do not think that our society could live with less cars , even if I would be totally pleased if it happened .

I disagree with this statment , first of all because I can see , in every day life , that the number of the cars is increasing .
For example , when my mother was young her family was composed from four person and they had just one cars , but they were completely normal , now , in my family we are just three and we have two cars , and we would like to buy another car .
Another important fact is that industry are always trying to make new cars with new thecnologyes inside , to emit less pollution .
In this way , it would not be a problem if ther will be more cars .
In addiction , cars have become foundamental in our culture both in big and little cityes , and in particoular for whose who live far from the city .
Everyone nowadays who has an emergency need to have the car , to go to the supermarket , but also to the hospital etc .

There could be different solutions , instead of using cars , even if it is not easy to make people understand it .
In particoular in big cities people should use public transport wich do not creat any pollution , and they are quick and confortable .
In smaller cities , where there is not the possibility of using publing transports , people should use the bike or walk , when it is possible , wich are better both for the pollution of the enviroment and the health of the people .

In conclusion , unfortunately I do not think that in future there will be fewer cars in use than today .
However there are several solution to the problems given by the cars than can be adopted .
