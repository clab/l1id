The statement at issue is whether in a period of twenty years there will be less cars in use than today .
I disagree this statement and I 'll try to give some reasons and examples that will show why , for me , this is a wrong prediction .
If we look at our world today , at our everyday 's life , we can see that people do not use buses or other kind of methods to move .
They prefer to use cars .

I give a personal example .
When I 'm driving my cars I often take a look to the other cars to see how much people are in one car .
The very fact is that in most of the cases in one car there 's only one person driving ot .
I mean , what a waste of energies , time and money !
Giving this example I want to state that nowadys people using theirs cars as the principle way of moving .
And this , related to the question asked to me , it means that I do n't think that only in twenty years persons will learn to use buses or other ways of moving that cities and administrations often offer to they to prevent pollution , traffic and other problems creating by the wrong using of cars .

I want to give another reason to my disagreement with the statement at stake .
If we consider how much money does the factories that make cars spend in the making of spots and other communicational 's channel to make people buying their cars we can say that is impossible to consider the fact that only in twenty years ther wiil be less cars in use .

I give this opinions to say that this method of moving difficultly will change in a short period .
Because it imply that persons should learn to proctect his/her own enviromental , it imply that people should apprehend to ride a car carrying more than one person a time , so that we can learn to create less pollution and traffic .

A final argumentation .
I want to state also that industry and echonomic should stop provoking people to buy such a lot of cars and give and try to find other ways to let the people moving without create pollution and traffic .
