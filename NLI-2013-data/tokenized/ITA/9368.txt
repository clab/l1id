I think it is true this question because the students is more attention of the facts and for he is more interesting to learn the concepts and the ideas .
I think he is more interesting seeing the television because in the times means the concepts and ideas is very good for the preparation of the students .
For example you do n't see the reality rather we see the documentary , because the first is n't shapes the mind while the second in the times shapes the student or all to think and at the reason of the world .

Another example is in the university the students during the lesson learn this and in the end or during the lesson he asks questions and problems in those specifically .
He shows interesting for understand the concepts and the ideas , and the professor is more content to talk about your lesson .

I think he is for more reason that the students and the young he is appassioned at the facts in the world and to learn the what will be the future for we .
