I believe that facts can be learned in many different ways and that school has a different object than teaching students facts .
A school 's duty is to both prepare the student for his entrance in real life , and to open a student 's mind through the constant teaching of concepts and ideas everytime more difficult .

Facts must be examined and fully explored in order to understand what lies beneath them .
Facts are nothing more then the final chapter of many causes put together .
Why birds migrate every year , why people cry when they are sad or why the sky is clear or cloudy ?
All of these questions could not be answered only by observation .
The laws of cause and effect studied during the past centuries explain us the importance to know the basic concepts that rule the world .
Every phenomenon , every situation or consequence come from a precise cause .
If we can know that cause then we are able to control the consequence , weather we want to repete it or avoid it .

I believe that the primary objective of universities , or schools in general , is to give to their scholars as many informations as possible .
Then , it will be the studient who will decide how to use these informations .
Facts can teach you many things , they can show you all the possibile outcomes for every event , and they can help you to predict the future based on previous episodes .
But facts alone , I believe , can not be consider enough for somebody 's growth .
