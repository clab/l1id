I agree that successful people try new things and take risks rather

than only doing what they already know how to do well .

It 's important for example for a business man who his successful to

continue to be successful and to continue to increase his

businesses .

Firstly , a successful person is a person who never stop and always

try to do better than what he has done before .
A successful person is

generally an ambitious person , who has goals in his life , and it 's this strong ambition that pushes him to achieve the limits , to try new

things and take risks , iven if that could causes problems to him and

it 's a difficult task .

For example a successful builder entrepreneur normally will try to

improve his business .
So , he will try to build new houses for example

and sell them in order to have a gain , and he will risk his money ,

because maybe there will be problems or he will not arrive to gain

money ...
This person could do other kind of projets , with other people , and he will always take some risks , but he wants to continue to be

successful and feel proud of his work .

In contrast with successful people , other people feels comfortable

with what they already have and do n't take risks .

Secondly , other people do n't want to take risk .
They know something

to do well and have fear of the future , or are not enogh confident , and there is n't enogh ambition .

To conclude , i agree with the statement presented on the question

for the several reasons cited before .
