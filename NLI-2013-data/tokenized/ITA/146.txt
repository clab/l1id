In the last twenty years we are complitely driven by the power of the economy .
It is for this reason that it is not really important the quality of a product but it is important the message that that product gives .

It often appens that we become complitely blind when we are buyng something .
Infact we buy some product only because we have seen it on television even if we really do not need it .

I can say that because it also appen to me .
Two days ago watching the television I decided to buy a porticular product usefull for making sport because it helps you to get back your energies after the phisical effort .

I play basket with my friends during the weekend , firs of all during the saturday afternoon and we play for four or five hours long .
That is way I need that product but I bought it even if I did not know what it was composed of .

I thing that this sistm is very dangerous because the products controls are not accurate ant the final consumer is always the one who risks .
Today it is not imprtant what do we buy but it is only important the economy developing .
I think that in order to eliminate this problem we should pay more attention on the controls that the government shold do when allow anvertisement to do damns .
Now I also remember that last year , during the winter holidays , I went with to the market of my town whit my mother and there was a lot of people in front of a shop because they all wanted to buy a particoular cristmas food .
We also bought it just because we watchd an advertisemet , thinking that it was good .
However when we came home we took it for dinner but it was disgusting .
The problem was that we should have test it before .
