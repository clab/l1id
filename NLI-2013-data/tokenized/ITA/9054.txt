I think that tihs is a very important consideration but I don ' t agree because in my opinion practise and concepts are important at the same level .
For example during the prepararion for an exam the student has to understand base concepts but he has to know the way to applicate this ideas in practise .

It is necessary a global culture but he has to have the way to work in practise for show thier capacities .
For most student this is a great problem after the finish of the school because they go work and do n't know how to solve the problems in the reality .
In my opinion it is necessary to change the actual way of teaching , especialy in the scientific courses , because the teacher has to show practical things and not only explain the ideas .
To made this a school can organise external collaboration with industries and involves students to collaborate in stage and other activity .
I think that this way of teaching must be used not only in university but also in the previous institute so that a student can be ready for the working world .
Because of the high number of student it is necessary to spend a lot of money to build practise laboratories and to improve this new way of teaching .
A last consideration is that the students must show more interest in some fields in order to understand their own charateristics and they try to be more collaborative in the activity of the school .
