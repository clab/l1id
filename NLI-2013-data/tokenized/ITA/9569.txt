`` The risk is my game '' said James Bond in a movie and I think Bond is Successful .
The importance to improve myself is connected with trying new things and taking risks .
I believe that successful people are the ones who try new things and do n't complain about wrong choices .
Instead of doing always the same things , trying a new one is risky : you do n't know what is going to happend , where you are going to be .
But this makes people smarter and more intelligent .
In a completely new situation , a person could improves himself and this makes a better people .
I personally prefer to choice new things : for example at the restaurant .
It could be a stupid examples , but it is fondamental .

At the restaurant people is divided in two categories :
the gamblers and the `` abituee ''' .
The Gamblers always try new plates , new food and that excite them .
The feeling for a new flavor , new taste makes the choice both unaspected and exciting .
Of course there is the problem : `` What if the taste is not so good ? ''
.
But once you have choiced a new plate , you have to own the risk .

The `` abituee '' are the opposite of the Gamblers : when they go to restaurant , they already know what they are going to take .
They do not experience new thing and so they will not improve themself : they are too closed-minded to understand the thrilling of a possibility .

The gamblers have much more possibilities to find the perfect plate for the perfect dinner .
Only with the experiments on new food , people could understand what they like and what they do n't like .

I think this example , because it is strictly connected with life .
Successful people are successful , because they have risked and maybe they tried so new many things that , now , they know what is the best for them .
