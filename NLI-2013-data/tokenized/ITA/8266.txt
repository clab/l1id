At school and university , students are asked to study an enormous range of different subjects .
Also the way students confront classes differ widely according to what they 're being taught .
Some courses require that the students memorize facts ( e.g. , history classes ) , others try to develop students ' particular skills ( e.g. computer science classes , sculpture classes ) , and in others students are asked to concentrate on particular abstract concepts ( e.g.philosophy classes ) .
I therefore think that a successful method of studying depends on what is being studied and focused on .
It is not possible to state whether it 's more useful to understand ideas and concepts or learn facts , unless we consider what time of subjects is being taught .

The topic of one subjects may be mainly factual , while in other classes the focus is on the discussion of concepts .
If we take a cooking class for example , we see that both concepts and facts are important .
We may want to learn where and why Italian pizza was created , what the conditions of the land that concurred in its creation were , and why it is called pizza .
But at the same time , because we 're attending a cooking class , we want to know how to cook it .
The ingredients that we need and the kind of manual work required are the basic elements in our lesson .
So , in this case , both concepts and facts have the same importance , depending on the emphasis the teacher or student give to what they 're examining ( in this case , the creation of a simple but successful food ) .

This example demonstrates that there are more than just one way in which one could approach his/her subject of study .
Therefore giving more importance to one aspect ( fact ) rather than the other ( concept ) or viceversa is not a successful way to learn .
