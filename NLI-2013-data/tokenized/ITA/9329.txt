I think it is very difficult to say which one is more important .
However I agree that is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts because those are very useful to develop a critical approch to the world .
But I have to say that understand only the concepts have both advantages and disadvantage .
On the plus side , like It is written before , understanding deeply the concepts help you to see what is happening in the world with your own mind and to be critic too , so you can say what do you thing is running great and what is not .
You can also say your opinion and support the solution for a specific problem that you like more .

On the minus side it is also very important to learn fact , because history is based on facts , and only the knowledge of facts can help you to understand what happened and how can you act in order to avoind the bad things .

In addition many works are based on the facts , for example an administrator or a manager of a company must decide what is better to do based on what really happened .

On the contrary there are other jobs where I think it is more important to understand the concepts .
let 's consider an engeneer : he has to develop new products and he has to solve very difficult problem and also he is always looking for the best solution , so he must elaborate new solution based on what he already had learnt .

We can say the same things if we consider an artist .
An artist is always looking for new ways of expression , he wants to shock every times his fans presenting them something that is totally new so his job is based on concepts !

However we can say that the best solution for this problem is to give the right weight to both of ideas and facts , probably ideas is more important than facts , but without facts I think it is impossible to use the concepts you have learnt .
