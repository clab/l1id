In wealthy regions of the world , it is common that a typical family has more than a car per person .
Sometimes , especially when I am stuck in the traffic , I wonder if this situation will ever change .

I strongly believe that in twenty years the number of cars will decrease deeply .
And there are mainly two reasons that convice me contending that .
Firstly , enviromental protection is becoming a topic of paramount importance in governments policies .
Many people 's health has already been negatively impacted by the polluting effects of a too heavy circulation .
Therefore people are a lot more concerned in the prevention and limitation of this problem .
Public transportation is generally considered to be the most effective solution and car users seem more and more willing to take advantage of it .

Then , it is evident that having a car ( or more than one ) means wasting a large amount of money .
It is part of our daily routine reading that oil price has increased once again during the night .
Not to mention the huge insurance costs and the several and varous types of fees related to the use of a car .
Last but not least , it has to be taken in account that many municipalities , in order to reduce traffic in the city centers , usually come out with special permits to park in certain areas .
Such permits are generally perceived extremely expensive by the the majority of the population .

In conclusion , enviromental protection and incresing costs should convince all of us that a more limited use of cars would be a better solution for everyone .
Of course , also governments and educational systems should help , and it appears that they are on the way to sensibilize people to that effect .

These are the reasons why I am positive that in twenty years it will not happen to me to be stuck in traffic as often as it occurs to me now .
