I think that young people nowadays are more interested in building their future they have less interest in doing services for their city or for their family .
Nowadays the world is getting very little , young people can travel around the world faster than the precedent generations , they recive informations faster because they can use computers internet , and the television .

They are more interested in the facts that happen in other cities or also in other countries , they don not solve the problems that their comunities have because they think that they are less important than the other just because they are getting addicted and used to them .

They hear about the problems of their comunities everyday for that they need to listen to some news , somethig differet , and not the rutine that everyday live .
I don not mean that should happen somethig of trerrible in their comunities in order to make them know about the problems of their comunities , but relatives , parents and friends , better if older than them , should make them know , first , about of the problems thar are closer to them in order to impruve the future generations 's and their way of living .

They should understand that they cannot solve the problems of the world like the wars or the hungry in Africa but they should help first their communities .
I cannot understand the people who leave their country in order to solve problems in an othet , when their country is going bad maybe for stupid things .
In Italy is very commun this kind of behaviour :
Italian people and above all italy its-self have a lot of problems , they think that they are a reach and modern country , infact the italian govern has muved his army in order to help others , they sacrificated a lot of young people to help other countries and not to help theirs .
