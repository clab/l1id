I agree with this statement because the car 's industry it 's in full expensin .
I study engenering at the politecnico of milan and I studied the expention of the cars .
in the past the numbers of the cars was very little respect today , few people had the car only the most rich of the village , today everybody have the car .
Today each family has one or more car as the matter of fact the street are overcrowd .
today the car is became a status-symbol e people do n't move less car , also to do few step , people use the car .
when I go to the larger shopping center I do n't never find to parchege , when I go to the big city I become crazy because the city has became the jungle , I always find queue and the traffic will be always more chaotic .
people use the car to do everything , go to supermarket , take his or her son at the school .
many guys of my university they come at school with car so the streets around the campus have became more chotich and the rumor has became insostenible .
when I walk around my village I hear most noise and I look always more car .
in my opinion in twenty years the number of the car sure arise as the matter of fact the everybody want a car .
nowaday there is the tendency to by the big car called SUV .
this suv produce most pollution because use more gas and in the little village are more noisy and this suv break the landscape and the history center of the artistic city also
