I completely agree with the statement here expressed .
We are living in a world where the image of the products is more important of their value .
The philosophy of marketing is widely `` followed '' to sell any kind of products .
The advertisements now use famous people like actresses/actors or models to sell parfumes , dresses or make - up because the message has to be : if she/he uses that products and he/she is famous and beautiful and if i use the same i wil look like her/him so everybody will notice me as well .
This is a very unfair game played with `` regular '' people because sometimse nature has given us a unique physical apparence and we can not change what is unchangable unless we go for the plastic surgery ...

i do not want to make a general statement about the products and the way they are pictured , sometimes we have quality beyond the image and the words they are associated with .
Usually this is the case for very well known products , already in the market for years so this means that they have been tested for a long time and passed the exam made by the customers .

It is normal to be attracted by products associated to beautiful people or pictures but we should not forget that we are going to spend money in order to have that product , so it has to be worth it .
Sometimes the name of the brand is sufficient to sell a product because that name has become famous somehow , so everything associated with that has to be good .
It happens to be real in some occasions but it could be also not always true .
It is really difficult nowdays to be a smart customer beacuse we are made blind by so many aggressive and fascinating advertisements that drive us where they want us to go and they make us buying what they want .
Luckly we might have a budget so this can help us to keep under control the fever for buying the latest and the coolest product on the market , that this society is pushing higher and higher .
