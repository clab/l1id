I have a very close example in my family that it is important to try new things and to take risks .
In fact my father has adopted this rule , and he is a succcessful man .
But I think that you can try great challenges when you are able to manage all your skills , so to do well some things is necessary to be successful but not enough .

Moreover I think that to do new things in every situation in our life is an exciting way of life .
In fact this approach allows to open the mind and to think with a wide vision .
Therefore travelling a lot , meeting new people and frequently changing the job is a way to improve ourseves .
In fact it is possible to enhance our skills and to solve better every new problem .

On the other hand taking risk is an art and a personal skill , but it is essential to become successful .
In fact doing a challenging thing and being everey time under pressure probably can extract our best and compete with greater force .
I thing that an intresting example of `` taking risks '' is Napoleon , who was the greater General of History .
He was able every time to choice the winning way , which was a non conventional strategy , which presented many risk but also the possibility to gain a great success .
He was also able to communicate this approach to his army , so to transform the success of one man , to the success of an entire Country .

In conclusion I think that an aggressive and competitive approach is the best solution to try to reach success , even if it is also necessary to have some luck .
For these reasons , hoping to become a successful man , I 'll use this set of suggestions also on my normal life , both on work and during social realtionships .
In fact I like competition and taking reasonable risks and I want to learn and do new things every moment .
