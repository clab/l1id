I definitely do not agree with this statement .
According to me , understanding ideas and learnig from facts have the same importance .
Let 's take for example foreing language teaching .
It is self-understandind that first of all is required a base , something a student can rely on to move in his `` foreing environnment '' , for this reason teaching grammar , verbs , prepositions and so on is very important , but these things have to put into practice .

This practice cannot only be small speaches between students and teacher an between the students .
In my experience , I 've always preferred to be alone , in a foret \ ing country with no one around who speaks my same language .
This is the only way to learn a foreing language the proper way , to put into practice what you learned in class .
I can give another example ; some italian highschools that have the purpose to teach language as a second language , spend two over five years to teach grammar and the remaining three on literature .

Of course this is important , it 's only through books you can deeply understand the way people think .
But this is not enough , once an italian student finishes highschool , he is able to talk only about literature , sometimes he ai n't able neither to order a meal at the restaurant .

This is the reason why I think foreing language teaching should be `` both-side '' .
On one of ` em you give students the basics , then you encourage ` em to use these teachings : maybe schools could organize periods when a student goes abroad to work an live , so he/she can really be able to rely on himself , and not only on his way of speaking .

School has to be tha chance to grow , not only as a student , but also as men and women .
This is the reason why I think understanding ideas and learning from facts have the same importance .
