I agree with the statement that is more important for students to understand ideas than learn facts , but with some limitations .
I think that for young people is very important to understand concepts in a deep way because after the graduate they should use what they have learned .
So is good that university force students to study a lot and do conceptual exams .

But many of the people that attend university are not young , and for them i think that the lesson have to be more interactive and with facts .
Infact they need to match what they are studing with what they have learned from their experience .
For a young student this is not so important because we do not have work experience .

I attend the second year of undergraduate course in Bocconi , a university of economy in milan .
During the course often happend that the lesson is boring .
The lessons usually take about 2 hours each and it 's difficult to keep the concentration during all the time .
It will be better if sometimes the lessons contain facts because that help to hold the concentration and sometimes help to understand concepts .

With this type of lesson students can both learn concepts and facts , start to understand how the things they are studing are related to the work .
In my opinion good universities should prepare you with lots of concepts but also with some real example to apply what you have learned .
Moreover you can chage your idea during the life but before you have to understand that idea .
Ideas and concepts are better than facts for students but a preparation only with concepts will not make you able to join the world of work .
