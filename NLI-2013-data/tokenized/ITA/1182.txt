To say that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject '' is a lot like saying that someone should be good in everything but be perfect in nothing .

Does that make any sens ?
Everyone should have something they wish to know better ...
that 's why we all have different jobs .
I think we can find a perfect example of having to REALLY know something in particular , in Nipponic society .
Japan is famous for their experts and we have been trying to copy their way of studying for decades .
Does the fact that they know more about one subject in particular , make them less smarter than people who know something about everything ?

I think not .
Of course , having a good cultural background is important , but as long as we follow our desires and believe in the things we do , than there 's NOTHING wrong about neglecting other subjects .

Obviously , this does not apply in an academic enviorment .
as long as we are in school , we MUST study every required subject , but once that 's over , we should be free to expand our own knoledge in the fields we prefer .

If we all knew the same things , we could never teach each other anything !
