I sincerly can ' t say if I totally agree or disagree with this statement and I ' ll try to explain why .

Ideas and concepts are the base for a theory or a sociological movement , but if you don ' t remember facts , date and names to expose in a discussion , how can you explain or make other people ' s ideas changing ?

In this statement there ' s the same topic of difference between theory and experience .
I am an Engeneer , so I studied a lot of theory and was very important for me to understand concepts before learning facts .
But as I saw in my life everything must pass thru practice to really understand the value and the importance of lots of theories studied in the past .
Just think about Newton ' s discovery of gravity .

If I should explain people how do work all the forces interested in that phenomenon it would take much more time than making an experiment of an object ( maybe an apple ! )
falling down to the ground .
Surely now that I ' ve practiced the theory I can better understand all the concepts behind the main idea .

This scientific method I think it can be applied to every field of culture and maybe to lifestyles .

I can bring another simple example of what I mean about the difficult to agree or disagree with that statement and the differences between learning facts and understanding concepts .

In history there was a lot of important facts and if we don ' t try to study and understand the psychology behind some characters of an event , we can ' t surely have an our own opinion about it : so we see that are important the ideas .
But if we don ' t care about the timeline in which the facts happened we risk to lose the most important informations of `` when '' , `` where '' they happened !
Just think about the Wars .
Are important thearies , ideals , and strategies as well as the dates in which the wars started and ended .
