i agree with the statement as i believe that a person can be identified as a successful person only if it is able to face different situations and to take its own risks .

an example that can support what i wrote is the analysis of the attitude of one of the top manager as such people , to be identified as successful , have to be able to deal with every kind of situation .
thinking about a top manager we can conclude that its added value is to solve a problem when it appears by risking its own name .

reading newspapers we know , for example , that companies facing a difficult period look for people that can be able to find solutions .
the manager is able to analysis the problem finding a solution by using its own expertise and knowledge .
as the prblem is solved and that company is no more in trouble , the real successful person does not feel any more confortable with a calm reality and tend to look for something other .

successful people have the great skill to have something more that normal people and they have the `` moral duty '' to offer such knowledge to others .
trying new things and affording risks is the only way a person has to show others the skills it has and the capabilities it has to express .
i conclude by saying that if a skilled and potentially successfull person does not want to isk and to try new experiences losses a great opportunity and cannot be identified as a successful person .
