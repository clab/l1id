I agree with the statement .
Infact I believe that young people enjoy life more than older people because they find it more interesting , they still have to affront many life 's problems , they still have to feel every sensation , they still have to know how life could be horrible sometimes , they still have to know a lot of life-s part that old people already know .

For example sometimes my mother tell me how I could affront a problem because she have already affronted a situation like mine and I love when she does it .
Everyday young guys and girls feel that there is a big and awesome world in front of them which is waiting them .
I love this sensation .
I love have a lot of dreams about my future , I like think that I can do what I want about my life because everything depends by me .
I know that it 's not like this , there are a lot of problems that I will have to affront during my life , but I prefer to convince myself that with my forces I 'll be able to arrive where I want to .

Old men and women believe that their life is an habit ; for example , they already know what they will do next summer because they will do what they did last year and the year before .
I want that my mother and my father understand that they are still young , they have to live their life as I uually do with mine .
What they usually tell me about my life are important informations for me to resolve my problems , but they have to enjoy their life .
For example they could go away for two days without me and my brother or they could change habits and go out for dinner sometimes .
When they talk about what they did when they where younger I can see how much they miss that period and I feel bad ...
Maybe next Christmas I could ask to the Big Man , as we call him to remember to my parents
