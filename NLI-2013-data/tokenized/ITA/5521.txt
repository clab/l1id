In today 's life advertisements are everywhere , they are part of everyone 's life .
Everytime we go to a mall , we recognize some of products we see because we have already seen them on a commercial .
Advertisements play a fundamental role in marketing : they tell people what is worth buying and what not .
Most of the times the wonderful shiny product we can appreciate on a commercial is not what we expected it to be once we buy it .
That 's the power of advertising , and that 's why industries would pay several million dollars , for instance , to get a 10 seconds advertisement space during the American Football Superbowl .
Why would someone pay so much for ten seconds ?
It 's quite easy to understand ...

I do agree with the fact that most advertisement make products seem much better than they really are , and i think this is quite understandable .
People would never buy a product which can be classified as `` normal '' .
People need to improve their life by owning something better every day .
I believe this is a psychological strategy , and industries do exploit it to make their income grow as much as possible .

Sometimes I think that those who create commercials do n't believe their own words , or maybe do .
Maybe an advertisement is good when its own creator can tell what 's real from what 's a lie .

In my opinion , advertisements , particularly those based on lies , must not be trusted at all , even though it is also true that the customer really ca n't avoid beeing the victim of this strategy .
The customer has the right and the need to tell the good product from the bad one , in order to save money and buy what is best for him , not for those who sell these products .
