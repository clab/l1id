I agree that successful people have the ability , the courage or the skills to go beyond what they already know and they are able to do , for trying out new and sometimes risky things .

The history is itself full of examples of scientists , leaders or religious figures who gave a huge contribution to mankind by going further and passing the borders of what was known and widely accepted .
Their aim was finding out new ideas or new ways of doing things .

In Italy , in the 14th century for example , culture and science were still dominated by oscurantism and religion .
The Catholic Church was very powerful and many scientists were prosecuted and killed because they used to profess dangerous ideas for the system .
The world was believed to be flat and none was questioning this .
It was then when Columbus decided to move forward and , convincing the king of Spain to supply him with three small vessels , he sailed into the unknown , towards west to seach for a new passage for reaching the far east .
Eventually he discovered a whole new continent .

This is an example from history but also nowadays it is possible to see how people who look for what is undiscovered can be successful .
We live in a knowldege economy and big and well established companies are often challenged by men and women who discover new ideas and lead the market towards what has n't been explored yet .
An example is Google , whose inventors shown a new way of using internet search for market purposes .

Therefore , in our daily routine , we should keep on looking for what is new and we have n't tested yet .
We should not forget that taking risks is the way human beings develop or , in other words , like Steve Jobs , Apple CEO said we should `` Stay young , stay foolish ! ''
