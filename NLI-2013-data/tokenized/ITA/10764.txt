I think this is an interesting statement .
I can give a direct testimoniation of a succesful person that I konow very well and of whom I know how he works : this person is my father .
Mr.Dario ( I love call him for name ) is in this moment the General Directors of CARIPE bank , a bank tha is included in the BPI group .
I think that to arrive at this level one person always have to take risks not only `` rather than only doing what he already knows how to do well '' .
And I tell this not only at working level , but at personal level too .

I 'll explain this : we live in Ravenna , a city of northern Italy .
Now I 'm in Barcelona for my erasmus experience but normally I sudy in Milan that is far from Ravenna .
To do this work , my father have had tried a new type of life .
Every week , for 5 days a week , he goes away from home and lives by his own in Pescara , the city where the center of the bank is located .

The decision that has cought my father , I think , is the most difficult choose that a man with a brillant career from one part and a good and lovely family from the other can take .

The distant from Pescara and Ravenna is of 450 km but my father spends the maximum time that he can found at home .
For maximum time I mean inly the week end but a total week end .
To return in Pescara he starts on Monday morning at five a.m. and than he works hard for five days to return at home .
My became General Director 2 years ago , the risk to lost the family was great ( because the distance , the work , because during the week end the time to stay togeter is not much ... )
but I can tell and confirm with happines that every week end my father return at home only for us and during all the week he is in our hearts because for us is the most important person of the world ...
I think he has won his bet but I hope , one day , I 'll come back to work near home .
