In the last years this topic became very actualy in my country .
The last university reform changes a lot of things in university career .
We are going to a world that always wants students more and more specialized and this reform goes in this way .
I think that we need a right rate of both subjects .
A specific subject solely is not a good thing .
I think that because in my field , i study engeneer , tecnology changes very fast and it is possible you likely specialized yourself in a subject that only 2 years later is preistoric .

In other way a broad knowledge solely is too much out of world for students , which generally want to '' take by hand '' what they have just seen into books .
I think university must do more broad knowledge of many subjects than specific ones .
I think that knowledge of many subjects help students in the early ages of university to choose their way .
they can help their to choose their major and what they want to do in their life about work .

The specific subjects , after a good choosen , can help students to know good part of real situation of tecnology at the moment when they want to go in work world .

I think that the really important thing is how a student challenge his school problem .
I think that give yourself a good preparetion is the best thing to do .
it is very important to have a good mind to challenge problem of every nature in school like in life .
if you have the right '' forma mentis '' ( way of mind ) all things are more easy .
