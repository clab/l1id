I do not agree with this statement because I think that it is more useful to know only a few subjects deeply than many in a superficial way .
I think that everyone , especially students who go to the university , should have a general cultural knowledge but this is something that goes beyond the accademical role .

In my opinion it does not make any sense to attend a class about a course you are not interested in or that does not have anything to do with what you really want to study for your future job .

Unfortunately , I personally experienced something similar during the past three years because when I started University I did not know what I was going to study precisely and as i wanted to graduate in languages and litterature i thought , as most of the other people in my class , that I was not going to study anything else except from economics in which I wanted to specialise .
Could you immagine my delusion when I found out I had to study many useless subjects ?
Why did I have to study things like philosophy or history when I knew i was not going to use it in my future ?

In my opinion the decision of students to go to University is something very individual and it has to be respected , from the Governament as the Educational Institutions .
I believe that it is up to the secondary school the responsability of teaching the general subjects and when a student goes to the University this must be taken for granted .

Finally if you really want to be strong in your future job and you really want to do it in the best way you can , you have to focus on it and learn as much as you can about the subjects related to it .
Why should a future manager want to know something about
