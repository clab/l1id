Advertisments are driving the market .
In nowadays world , the best companies are esily recongnisible from their advertisments .
All the great companies have a fantastic advertisment campaign in order to promote their product/s .
On this direction , all the new emergents business are working on creating fantastic advertisments to break into the market and obtaining a huge amount of counsumers ready to consume teir product/service .
The only problem is that these new companies are focusing so much on the advertisement that they stop to take care of the quality of the product .
For these reasons we have on the market there well made advertisments promoting a product that is not so good .

It is true that the most important point of an advertisment is to give to the customer a sensation of a dream .
Companies want to convince customers that their product/service is the best on the market , but consumers , if are not satisfied in the product that they bought , they will never buy that product again .
From a sourvey that I road in the Economist , I discovered that the dissatisfaction in customers has incresed of 40 % these last twenty years .
The responsable is probably this new trend of exagiring the product/service quality to much by advertisments .

For example , I remembered when I bought a pair of tennis shoes from a new sport cloathing company called ttk .
I have been attracted to this pair of shoes from the desines enphasize on a billboard with a slogan on the buttom that was saying `` ttk ...
the shoes of the warriors ... ''
.
There was also written under the slogan that they were one of the most resisten shoes on the market .
After that I bought these shoes , I succed to play tennis just ten times : they were already completely destroyed !

I believe that if companies will not change the way of advertising , consumers will not trust them anymore , and also the big corprations will have a decrease in the sales .
