Today the society gives more input and opportunities to every young and older people .
The young people have more possibilities for to live a enjoy life , for example they use more fast the computer and the new thecnologies , the have more free time because the school or university , if they are beeing to schedule , are the only problems for the boys .
Another points is fot their are the enought of important life question to think ( family , home , tax , job , ect ... ) .
Only problem for the young people are the money !

The parties with friends , the trips in everywhere , the discos , the first love , the best friends and the time that you spend wit us , they are example of what the boys enjoy in this time .

For the older people should be different , but today the aspect of vision is more different : usually the older people have much free time when they finish the job , so they can live a more enjoy life .
Only problem is the health and the money as the young people , that 's not combination !

Infact if the young boys have a disco today , for the older people have a particular disco where is plays old music of 30 or 40 years ago .
The most important aspect is the companies that this people have around their .
To have a friends ( male or female ) give a possibility of out with him and to go to enjoy ever if the boy is only .
The important is not to be only .

The age is a relativity aspect that is different each other , a good life is a enjoy life in respect to other .
I think that it is possible enjoy to every age if a people want and have a good companies .
