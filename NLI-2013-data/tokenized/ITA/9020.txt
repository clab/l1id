I 'm from a coutry in which history is more than millenary , and it is absolutely true and right that 's always useful and needed to learn from the past to look up to the future , but in my personal life and experience I 've always found that the fact itself ca n't stick permanently in to our memory ( but this may be because I 'm not a huge fan of history too ! ) , more often it 's the exact contrary , we kind of filter what the fact was trough our senses and what most has captured our attention on the matter .
If nothing has captured our attention it 's more than probable that we wo n't remember it for as much time as needed for the growth of a critical mind .

I 've often been in the situation of having to choose between formation and information ( where for information I mean thetwo or three pointers that can help me in a short time , but wo n't leave me nothing for the future ) .

Well , I 've attended classical studies in high school and one of my professors , who has been a real menthor for most of our class , used to say that school has the primary objective to form people , not to inform them , and it can be done only by giving the instruments and possibility to approach a new fact with a proper critical sense .

In other words the students deserve to think with their own minds , preferably open minds .
It has to be assured to them the possibility to dig under the fact , understand it 's logic , by analyzing it from different points of view , discuss it , in a certain sense make it of proper own , infer the essential contents andthen desume a lesson for the future .

All in all if we want people thinking with their own minds we have to give them the right instruments and focuses , so it 's way better to understand t
