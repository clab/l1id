In this era , where it is possible to underline an increase of the production , most advertisements can make products seem much better than they really are .
This is a result of a great number of products that the owner of the companies has to sell to the consumers .
For this reason i agree with that statement .

I think that , in this period , everyone who have to sell anythinks wants to show it in a better way than it really is .
Is possible to find a products that have a very low price but at the same time it is problably not a very good items .

Now where Internet has increase its importance in selling products , all the people try to show them in a fantastic state with a beautifull pictures and one very accurate description .

For example one year ago I bought a support for mobile phone for the car .
When it arrived at home I observed it and I noted that was not well as in the computer .
The material that it was made was very very bad and an optional item , that I bought with the support , did n't arrive at home .

It ' s possible to find a lot of advertisements on television that show all the items in a very beautifull way and I think that anyone have to pay attention before buying a particular products .
I thinks is better to buy an items of a brand that is known .
In this way you are sure to buy a good item event if its price could be expensive .
The most important brands have a great experiece in working and they use all kind of machines or material they need .

In this capitalistic era infact there are many people that open an industry to selling a products .
To have a very low costs they use a material that is not good .
This is occurred for example in Cina where the prices of the products are very cheap .

I had a lot of experiences in buying a product that are not good as they are showed , for this reason I suggest to buy a very famous product !!
