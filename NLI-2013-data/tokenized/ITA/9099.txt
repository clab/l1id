I would say that I do not agree neither disagree with both of the statements .
Personally I think that the truth is in the middle , as also the romans used to say .
Ideas and concepts in order to be well explained need some facts to be related to .
An idea could be difficoult to be explained , but with a fact , an example , the idea will be more clear to the student and also easier to be memorized .

As an example , I can speak about the french revolution .
What was the idea at the base of the french revolution ?
Accorsing to this subjects , In a class many idea can be explained by the teacher ( I would add in a boring way ) .
Supporting ideas with facts ( for example explained the idea that led to the killing of the king ) would be more interesting for students and also more beneficial for their learning .
Many ideas can be well explained , but to really understand them , we need to surround ideas with facts , interesting facts , I would add .

Another example in which facts have to be strictly related to ideas is for example if you want to descride a marketing concept to a student .
Of course the idea is really important because everytihg starts from an idea , but also in this case in order to support the idea we need to drawn some conclusion speaking about facts .
Of course I am speaking about old ideas , becuase what I stated before clearly do not match with new ideas .
How is possible speaking about a subjective theme like marketing and separate the idea at the base of a marketing campaing from the results ( the facts ) .

in conclusion I would say that what I described is my opinion the best way of how to teach .
I do not believe neither in class full of ideas , neither in class full of real facts .
As already stated both are importants , but also more interesting is the connection between them .
