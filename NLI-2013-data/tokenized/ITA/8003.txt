Most of the people love travelling in order to discover new places , to rivisit places that they already know and maybe experience them in a new , different way , or just in order to relax by the beach .
Some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , some other people prefer to just buy a book , read something about the place they 're headed to and go by themselves .
Personally , I prefer to travel by myself , or with a few friends but absolutly without a tour guide .

Sure an organized trip is really nice but personally I do n't like the idea of jumping on a bus with people I do n't know and with a tour guide telling me all the time what to do , where to go and why .
I 'd rather drive with a few friends , a map and the idea to discover the true reality of the place we are going to visit .
I like this way of travelling because I think I 'd feel more free to organize my trip as I really want to .

The fact that I 'm not interested in being on a bus with people I do n't know might seem a little bit close minded and I would n't want it to be misleading .
It 's not that I do n't like meeting new people but if I go to a new place I 'd like to get in touch with local people in order for me to understand their culture , traditions , habits .
Waht I 'm looking for while travelling is a full immersion in a new , different reality from which I want to learn .
I do n't like much the idea of a tour guide because I think he or she will show me the most famous tourist destinations without really entering the culture itself .

All and all I can say that travelling is great either way .
I like to travel the way I described because I believe it really help us open up our horizons to different realties .
Italian food is great - I 'm Italian so .. !
- but if I went to Marocco , I 'd rather try Cous Cous than go the Italian restaurant and italian resort where there is nothing about the local culture .
