I agree with the statement , because only people who risk and do n't keep doing always the same things have some possibility to improve their own economic or social condition .
The risk is necessary , since this way you can find out a different activity you have more possibilities to succeed in .
For example , most of rich people have followed this lifestyle : they are probably curious and they love to prove and risk .
In some cases , they start new activities or invest some money hoping to be lucky in their choises .
If you want to succeed , even if fortune is a fundamental element , you need courage and bravery .
You must not remain thinking of what to do too much time , because this way you will not take ever any decision .
Nevertheless , this type of behaviour is very useful in common life too .
You should be sure of your opinions when you take a decision and then you should not change it , because it 's important to have certain values and ideas .
You have to accept the risk , considering the advantages and the positive aspects of your choise , and forgetting the negative ones after you have chosen .
It is useless and dangerous to keep thinking at your previous decisions .
For instance , when you get married you are trying a new experience and you are risking because you do n't know which problems there will be in your life after this fundamental decision , but you decide to get married because you correcty think that is a risk you can take to life a better life with a person you love .
You consider love , feelings and positive experiences more important than problems which accompany every marriage .
I think that taking risks is the only manner to heve a possibility of success , because behind a risk , there is always a good prospective and a wonderful occasion .
