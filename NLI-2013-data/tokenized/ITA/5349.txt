Advertising consists of convincing potential customers that a given commodity or service has some positive qualities that make it worth buying .
In some cases the advertised features of the product either exist or not .
For example , it is relatively easy to verify whether a claim stated in a commercial that - under some conditions - a car runs on some amount of gas per 100 kilometers can be true or not .
In this case advertising can make the commodity seem better than it is .
However , to my knowledge , these forms of advertisement are mostly forbidden in developed countries , since they essentially represent scams .

In many - perhaps most - other cases , the qualities claimed in a commercial cannot be univocally defined as true or faulse .
For example , a company could advertise a drink it markets as , say , the `` drink of the coolest people on earth '' .
In itself , this statement means nothing and cannot be verified .
However , if the advertising campaign is well designed and a number of people accept the view that drinking that specific drink makes you `` cool '' , then advertising - to some extent - creates the feature it claims .

In such cases , advertising changes the product itself and is part of it .
That is , a given item without advertising is in fact a different product than the otherwise identical item which has been advertised .
Therefore I would not agree with the statement that advertising makes products seem much better than they are in fact .
