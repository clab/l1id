I definetely agree with the statement ; in my opinion , ideas and concepts are indeed extremely more important for students than mere facts .
In fact , from my personal experience , being a law school student who went through a long school career , the primary scope of learning is getting a real deep idea of the topics and therefore being able to master and criticise them .

That has always been my attitude , since the day I started school .
In fact my mother , whose profession is teaching , always taught me that the concepts are the most important things for a student .
Thus , on the other hand , memoryzing facts , dates and names it 's completely useless because as time passes , they will soon become confused , unclear , oscure data until they will complete disappear from our mind .

There is no use of knowing a date / name if you do n't know what it relates to .
On the contrary , as you learn , if you focus on the ideas and the concepts , you wo n't ever forget the essence of any topic .
Accordingly , in my opinion , only by focusing on the substance of the different topics the students can form themselves with a serious knowledge .
Ultimately , I think that it 's really important for students to think about what they study , to identify the underlying problems that are brought along with every topic and to attempt to form their own opinion about them .

Only with this attitude , the students will be able to become knowledgeble human beings instead of a group of worthless sheeps that does n't know how to think on its own .
