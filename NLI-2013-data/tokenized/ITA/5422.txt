It would be really difficult not to agree with this statement .
Everyone of us has , at least one time in his or her life , experienced a supermarket and bought something from it .
It would be hardly the case not to have realized that a great part of the goods that we took home from that supermarket , showed to be much less satisfying or valuable than what we had been presented by advertisements .

It would be too naive to ask ourselves why it happens .
We all know the answer : producing companies stimulate and exploit our wishes and desires , about buying something nice , tastful or appealing , in order to elevate the selling figures and earn more .

Instinctively , one could say that it 's an immoral behaviour and that it could also be defined as heavily cheating .
The interesting fact , though , is that we perfectly know that it will happen and we are conscious what we will face , once confronted with the reality of the product we would buy .
It 's a sort of a theatral play , where every carachter has its place and role : the producing companies know that they will boost the qualities of their products in the advertisements , we know that we will have to reduce by half our expectations on the products we buy .

So much for the raw , actual situation .
But does this acknowledgement make any difference about the morality of this `` play '' ?
I do n't think so .
I consider such a behaviour , by the producing companies , higly deprecable and , at least , a-moral , if not immoral .
Profit has the upper hand over trustfulness , and that should n't happen .
But I consider myself pragmatic enough to live up with it .
