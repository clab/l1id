I disagree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
In fact I think it is much more better to be specialized in one subject , in order to plan a better carreer and be really good at it .
First of all , when a student applies to an university , he should have already thought carefully on which is the subject he likes most .
At the high school he had time to study several subjects and evaluate which is the right one to choose at the university .
Consequently , in my opinion an accademic student would not need to spend more time on studying many subject and focus on a specific one .

The second reason why it is better to focus on one subject is that in this way the student will not get confused among a lot of different datas to remember : if you study just one subject , it is easier to collect and organize all the notions you get and like that you will know better and deeply the subject .

Last , but not least , I think that if you know exactly which carreer you want to try and put all yourself in this purpose , you will not get distracted by anything else and you will reach your goal , the degree , much more faster .
Your passion for that specific subject will lead you to the success if you are really concentrated in what you are studying .

In conclusion , I support the idea that it better tho choose one academic subject than to study many of them , because an academic student has to be sure about what he wants to be in the future .
If he focuses himself on just one subject , he can study it better and faster and become a better member of the society .
