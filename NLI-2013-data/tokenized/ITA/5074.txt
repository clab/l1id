In my opinion a lot of advertisement increase the desire of particular things in people and then it seem much better than another that are equal .
Such as shoes , there are some brand of shoes that make an advertisement by television , journal , and then guys will prefer a specifical brand than others , but there are n't a lot of differences by one or another 's pair of shoes .
The television play an important role about this topic , all the day on TV we can see a lot of advertisements and our choose can be influenced by this .
A lot of people watch the TV and generally follow medias and the brands know this and then spent a lot of money for making them visible .
Sometimes if I am skilled about the thing ( such as computers , cars ... )
I can be aware that another unadvertise brand can be more efficiently , can be better , can have more quality than what I 've seen on TV , and this enforce the topic .
When a brand spent some money for make it 's advertise on TV the price of his products raise but not necessarly raise also the quality , but a lot of people buy him without knows the effectively quality , only because they have seem him on TV or others media .
The charateristics of a product can be the same ( or less ) than another but if a product have a specifical sign on it will be more desiderable .
Many times the person who buy an advertise object can be not very happy of his article simply because will see another brands with more better charateristics than him .
The advertise can be not exhaustive and can confuse the buyers , it making the product more better than it is really .
The people that do n't interest about the effective quality of products that them buy often are unhappy because they spent so much and have a lower quality product .
