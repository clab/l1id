I 'm not completely agree with this statement .
Today , in our world , I think that people ca n't do an activity without a general knowledge of many academic subjects .
Infact , our society impose to people to have a base cultural and economic knowledge to do every work or activity .
It 's also very important that people are n't only just like a computer specialized only about think they must use in their job .
For a big good society , it 's important also that people know a little bit of culture , economy , art , religion , history , and others ...

School must do all it .
But when a man decide his future , the job of his life , he need to specialized in his specifical subject .
He must know more think as possibile about the activity that he have choised .
Sure , he can change , always .
But if I go to an architect to ask him to project my house , he must have all the knowledge necessary to project me a house , and I do n't want that he studied Battle of Waterloo when he was at school !

Now , I think that better think is : everybody must know battle of Waterloo , or the important of artistical elements in a house .
Everybody must know most important notion of general culture , but it is also necessary that everyone found his road , and he start to walk to the destination that he have choise , he study more notion as possible about it .
At the end , he will be able to do an activity in the best way , and he will be very important to the other members of his society .
