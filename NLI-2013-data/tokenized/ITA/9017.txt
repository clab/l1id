I really agree with this statement .
I 'm studying engineering and even if the facts and infos can be important on every course and topic , they really do n't teach you anything but they just show you if you really understood the concepts and the ideas .
For example , if you are studying a physics course , it 's normal to find many experiments made by many persons but these experiments are made not only to give you some info about the results but to be sure that you really understood the meaning why they made these experiments and why they can be usefull or not .
I do n't want to say that learn facts is completely useless but i say that you ca n't just learn them , furthermore they 're useless if you do n't know the meaning of them .
That 's why concepts and ideas are so important for students .
Unfortunately , many teachers do n't think the same as me , that what happened to my own experience during my years at university .
If i have to be sincere , during the courses that a teacher put the attention on facts instead of cencepts , i completely lost my attention and i could n't follow the lesson .
Not only me acted this way but many of my mates too and the marks that we took by these kind of exams were n't that high .
So , that 's what made my opinion , my own experience and i think that once you have experience to support your opinion , it can be stronger and believed by many persons .
I even hope that my opinion will be read by many teachers even to help them to make their lessons more interesting and expecially useful for their students .
