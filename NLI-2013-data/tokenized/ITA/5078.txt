I think that the statement is correct !
In our consumistic society an object 's value is no more calculated by considering how much useful is or how good does its task !
Now for most of the goods have to be '' cool '' and have '' good looking '' .
In order to increase the '' coolines '' of an object the producer spend a great amount of money in advertising and promotions !
In example Apple computer pay a fee to major of the cinema in order to make machintosh computer appear in movies !
If you pay attention in films you can quite only see mac !
An other exemple [ excuse me for speeking always about computers but I 'm studing computer science engeneering ...
so I 'm a sort of computer geek ] again froma Apple is the '' look '' of macs ...
the apple 's coputer lines have always an extremely cured design !

An other way to convice people of the '' cooliness '' of a product is to associate the product to famous people that are known being fashion ! ''
Fashion '' ... this is a key word !
In our world in order to sell something you must get it become fashion !
Think about the iPod ...
it is the most popular mp3 readr of the world ...
and not for its technology ; it is famous due to the fact its design is '' cool '' !
So now having an iPod maks you a '' coolo '' person !

For the people of the 21st century being '' cool '' and fashion is the most important thing [ in particular for young people ..
in fact for the beeing par of a group , and in particular the cool one , it what they aim for ] .

Counting on the fact that most of people in the civilized world watch a minimum of 2 howr of television a day ...
the best way to let products be known is through tv !
Not only by spots ...
but also trough '' subliminal '' messagges !
This consumistic society want to keep us slave of : '' be cool or be nothing '' !
