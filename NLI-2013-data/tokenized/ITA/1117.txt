I think that is better to have broad knowlendge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject .
In my opinion when we have knowledge of many subjects we , in the future , will work on the different kinds of job .
I actualy study marketing but not only this subject becouse i know that is important to know another types of subjects ( for example maths , italian exetera ) to will arrive at the top of the management .

In fact for the total knowledge in my school teach a different kinds of subjects to prepare a future business manager , not only one subject but a lot of different subjects .

My friend , in the college , studyed only maccanical subjects and actualy he does n't find a good job for this preparation .
However if you specialize in one specific subject you have not a possibility to choose a different kinds of work but , if you is the better in your specialize , you will arrive quikly at the top of the your future job becouse you have the total knowledge of this specificaly job .

In conclusion i can say that the very important in the future life of any students is not how much academic subjects is know but how can we studyed it .
