School is a very important social structure where students can form their minds thanks to the information given by teachers .
Usually teachers believe that the exposition of facts is the most important part of what is called `` didactic '' .
They expect pupils to learn the facts and to repeat them exactly in the same way the teacher taught them .

This clealy creates a kind of disfunction of learning in the student who has to learn mere facts .

According to me the best way to improve both teaching and learning is the use of facts as the material support of a new element : the elaboration of ideas and concepts deriving from those facts .
Obviously it is also important to learn , sometimes also by heart , some specific facts , but what does matter is the ability to search and to find the sense of a fact .

People usually believe that learning facts is more important than elaborate them because people suppose that those facts carry the so called `` Truth '' .
Unfortunately the truth is not given one time forever , truth depends on who is speaking , namely thinking .

The mere exposition of facts is not a guarantee of truth .
Students should learn that ideas are more important than facts : for example is more important to understand the deep reasons that caused the two World Wars rather then the day in which they started .
It is clear that also the historical facts are important but they are senseless without a specific interpretation and knowledge of the ideas .

Ideas and concepts are what move the world , they are at the basis of what we define ideology .
Every society is based on a specific ideology which is , properly , the melting pot of the ideas and of the concepts that created that specific society .
