The school education is a very important part of people live .
The school education method changes among different cultures and It can influence the future life of persons .
It is not very easy to answer this question because either undestanding ideas and concepts or learning facts have pros and cons .
When a student is very young , it is very difficult to him to understand ideas and concepts .
For instance when I was in elementary class I rebember that the majority of lessons were explanations of facts .
I think it was a correct education method because I was not able to understand ideas and concepts .
Before beginning to understand ideas and concepts it is important to learn facts !

On the other hand a student in secondary class needs to be stimulated with lessons concentrated on ideas or concepts .
If a student of a secondary class follows only lessons full of fact , he can be very leasy and he can lose the interest in studies !

Nevertheless there are particular topics in wich the students must learn a lot of facts to try to understand .
For instance history is full of facts and is full of ideas and concepts too .
But a student can not understand historical ideas and concepts if he does not know before the crononogical sequence of facts !

In conclusion , I disagree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand ideas and concepts than learning facts .
I thing that both understanding ideas and concepts and learning fact are important parts of the student education .
In particular learning facts is the basic support for consequent understanding idesa and concepts .
