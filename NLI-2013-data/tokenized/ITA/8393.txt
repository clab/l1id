I 'm not completly agree with this statement .
It is quite general .
For my opinion there are two kinds of students .
For the first type is important understand ideas and concept and for the other type is important to learn fact .

There isn ' only this difference .
Exist two types of subjects .
To understand the first type the student must be understand the main idea and the main concept , to understand the second type of subjects the students must learn facts .

For example , for maths i must understand the idea and the concept to make an exercise but for italian lecterature i must learn fact to make an assignement .
For my opinion there are a lot of subjects that are impossible to understand only with the facts but with understand ideas and fact and learn facts , toghether .
In my personal experience i found subjects , i have needed to understand the main idea .
For example to understand economy the students must understand tha main concept and must learn facts .
There are concepts that importance and influence is really great and fot the students are most important to understand ideas and concepts than learn facts .
