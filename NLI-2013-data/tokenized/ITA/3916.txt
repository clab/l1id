I not agree with this statement .
I think there is much young people that help his community and spend a lot of his time for it .
For example there are some volountaries in many places : in hospitals , in centers for old people ...
and so on .
I know some people who works for the ambulance : they are volountaries who stay , some times also all night , at the ambulance to give his help in case of need , and the day later they are in office to work .
There are also some girls I know who give their help to centers where old people stay because they 're seek or need help .
Theese girls have a big sense of responsability in helping others , I think .
Moreover , my cousin is always around the community of her church ( she is much religious ) to give her help to guide and educate children .
In her blood and heart there is the force to do this .
She say me she feel much better when she helps the neighbours .

I talked about some people I know , but I did n't say nothing about myself .
That 's why I have never done something for my community .
This because I 've never had the occasion , or because I do n't think to be able to give help without nothing in change .
I think that are very admirable people who do this , but also that you must feel it .

I could give some time to my community for example cleaning natural parks when the community of my town organizes the event of cleaning the city ...
but I am sure I will forget it or I will decide do do something else that day ...
that 's why really I do n't feel to give my time to the community ...
I 'm not a good person like my friends .

So it 's true , there are many people like me who do n't spend enough time for the community .
It would be a better world if anyone would spend more of his time for that .

I think also that this behaviour of people is not only of nowdays , it has always been so .
But today there is more people who need help , also becouse the number of old ( and so seek ) people is larger than some years ago
