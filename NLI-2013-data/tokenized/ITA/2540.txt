When we are young we spend a lot of time following amusments and keeping enjoying , but when we grow we begin to leave these kind of entertainments .

The youngest people are less of problem or responsability and so they can spend time only to enjoy themselves .
In my humble experience when i was young , my life consisted in having fun .
I keep meeting with my friends and I was not interested in thinking about my future .

But while the time passed , I would keep growing and also my ideas and my kind of life .
In fact now I have many responsabilities and I must have the just maturity to decide when i can enjoy myself or not .

For instance , I 'm studing fashion design and I want to became an important fashion designer so sometimes i must make some renunciation to obtain my goal .
In according to my experience I agree with the statement that is , `` Young people enjoy life more than older people do '' .

But there are other cases in which also old people enjoy their life like child .
I disagree with these type of living because I think that when we are old we must reach a certain maturity .
We cannot enjoy ourselves forever .
