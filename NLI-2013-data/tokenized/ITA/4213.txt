I agree with the statement .
Today young people think only about themselves and their problems instead of giving time to helping their communities .
They want only enjoy themselves having a lot of hobbies and going out with their friends .
I know few young people who do activities for aThey withdraw from the reality which sometimes is full of people that is sad and have phisical or economic problems .
Young people do n't want to see that there are persons who have to be helped and are near to them .
But there are also a lot of associations that want to do something to help who is in a difficult condition .
I think that everyone should care their communities because he is part of society and if he tries to change a bad reality he lives better too .
Young people should have more respect to others because they are the future and it should have to be better than the present .
