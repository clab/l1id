In the last years the number of the families that have more than one car is increased a lot .
Nonetheless i think that in twenty years will be fewer cars in use .
There are a lot of reasons to explain this thing Firstly now we have too many cars per family , in fact every family has 2 or , sometimes , 3 cars .
In fact you need a lot of money to use your car every day .
The reason is that the petrol is nearly to finish and its cost is becoming higher every day .

Secondly there is a very big problem about using cars : the pollution .
In fact we are destroing our planet with the smog and if we want to save green areas we have to respect nature and animals .
For instance many countryes are trying to say that we have to walk sometimes and to use bycicles and pubblic transports .
However i think that , now , we are to lazy and that we do n't want to find another manner to go to work or to travel .
Nonetheless i think that in a few years we will be obligated to change our manner to travel and that we will understand the importance of the natural environment .
For example i am 24 but i do n't have a care and i do n't care about it bacause i like to walk and to use buses a
