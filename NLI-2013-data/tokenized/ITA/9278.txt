I completely agree with the statement which says that for students it is more important to understand ideas and concepts instead of learning facts .
I think that the basis for a wide personal culture , which stays forever with a person , are to find in what the person himself understands , not in the quantity of things he can learn ; obviously knowing facts , dates , names of historically relevant people is very important , but not much as the greater quality to understand the ideas which bring you to the fact .

For example , if you have to study a difficult subject as Macroeconomics , the most important thing is to understand what you are doing , not just studying all the models given by your text , because the concept are at the base , once you have made them yours you will be able to solve all the exercises without knowing all the models by heart .

I would light to highlight that learning by heart is , in fact , something I do n't really agree with , because I think it is just a loss of time , spendable in a more useful way , also for the long time you need to learn and the short time you use to forget !

It 's true that learning facts is a compulsory part in everyone 's study , absolutely not to avoid if you want to be really prepared , anyway I would like to underline that it is not enough , nor really useful , if you have n't understood what is behind the argument you are studying .

Even if you know all the facts , you have learned all the dates written in your book , if there is a lack of comprehension , in my opinion your study in an useless effort .

When I was young , my grandmother used to repeat me `` what you understand , none will never steal it to you '' : I really believe that a statement like this can support my opinion , because memory is something that can go away in a whisper , but once you got something , you have it .
