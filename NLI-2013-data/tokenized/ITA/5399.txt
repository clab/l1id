According to me it is quite true that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are .
The huge amount of industries that make the same or similar products have brought to a point where it is difficult to go on , so they has started to find ways to gain more money otherwise they will not be able to survive .

As a result they has begun to reduce cost of productions and this means also less quality in the products they make , but however to convince people to buy these products it is necessary they believes that this products are great ; to do this industries has started to make advertisements that present a certain object as one of the best ever produced and it does n't matter if it 's not true .

A clear example about what I 'm saying is about mobile phones : the first mobile phones are n't so glamour like those we can find now , but they were really resistant and they could be used for years without any problem ; the new ones instead are n't so resistant and has a lot of problems and it could happen we have to change them after only a couple of years , but the advertisments about them paint another reality .

According to these advertisements the product shown is the greatest ever sold and focus our attention on the innovations this object has and also assure us it wo n't have troubles .

Another example is about cars ; most of car producers when promote their new vehicle explains us all those things that they have done well and that contributes to make us interested in this car , like speed , horsepower , acceleration , optionals and maybe after , we buy it , we know that is not safe in certain conditions or it has n't passed some test
