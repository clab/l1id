It is very difficult to think about a situation in the future like this , thus it is impossible to state undoubtly an opinion infact one should only try to imagine a situation .

After thinking about this statement , I do n't believe there will be fewer cars in use than there are today ; instead there will be at least as much car as there are today .

I am not sure of that but I try to prove my opinion with some supporting points .

First there are n't reasons for thinking the cost of new cars will increase and thus there will be fewer people wanting to purchase new cars .
Infact the car factories in the industrialized part of the world produce an amouont of cars that has been constant since specialized robots , meccanization and automatione were developed .

Secondly , think that in the cars of next generation hidrogen will be used in the cars instead of oil , also with the purpose of make possible a decrease of pollution .

In this ways new cars moving by hidrogen will be promoted and a lot of people will want to buy one .
