I really do not agree that young people enjoy life more than the older do .
I think they enjoy different areas of life but with the same intensity .
It looks like that young people are having fun with a lot of physical activities because at that stage of their life the body is always full of energy and rich of sensations .

On the other side I see a lot of old people prefer mental activities such as reading , meditation and conversation .
This happens just because at their stage of life they learn and take advantage of their mental skills .

For exemple , you can see in the same park a group of kids having a blast during a soccer game , and their grandparents sitting on a bench and be completly immerse in a conversation or reading a book .

Even with music we have two different worlds : young generation enjoy fast and laud music that they dance till they drop on the floor .
Adults get excited with less hectic music that they can listen and dance as well .

But , if you go to a dance studio , you can see that regardless the age and the kind of music people is dancing , everybody is enjoing that activity .
The intencity they put in what they are doing and the reward they get from what they are doing is not related to their age .
They just get from different sorses of joy Sorses that are more fitting with their physical and mental status of the age they have .

My impression is that both , young and old people get a lot of joy from the activites that they choose .
Like I said at the begining , they choose very different ways to spend their time but the intencity and pleasure level they achive , I am sure is the same .
