I certainly agree with the stament .
All the famous people or the people who became self made men , tried new things taking their risks .
It is very hard being a succesfull people doing only what you already know how to do well .

All the Tycoons in the world like Bill Gates , Rupert Murdoch or the Italian Silvio Berlusconi began succesfull people discovering new ways of busisness or taking big risks in investiments of money .

This is the only way to become an important person in the busisnes 's world .
Another reason to support this thesis is on the fact that is quite harder to being a successful man in a busisness field where there is lot of competition .
So is much easier , once you have found an idea , to make money in a new field of the busisness world .
Because at the beginning you do not have any competitor and you could create a `` monopolio '' that gives you the possibility to earn a lot money .

For istance the richest person in the world , Bill Gates , had became himself by discovering and inventing a new kind of busisness that before him was n't operating , or it was operating but was not that famous .
He took a lot of risks at the beginning starting this new business but now he is the most rich in all the world , so we can say that he had a brilliant idea .

Another reason is t that the successful people who take risks usually have very determinated characters , that certainly help in the challenge .
And people who win challenges often became successful in their own field .

And last but not least there is a proverb that explain in few words exactly the reason of why I agree with the statement .
And the proverbn says : `` No pain no gain '' .
