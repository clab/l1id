I agree with the idea that is better to develop knowlegde in several subjects instead of specializing in one only .

The first reason to believe it is related to the impact of knowledge on the individual .
An extensive knowledge of a single subject confines a human being to its academic subject and does n't evolve its personality at large .
On the contrary , the study of several subjects expands the limits of a person 's undestanding of life as a whole .

A second reason , focusing on the scholarly impacts of knowledge diversification , is that it offers the opportunity of a comparative approach .
An academic who is educated in several different subjects will be able to identify interesting connections between distant disciplines , thus opening the way to new approaches .
This is true not only for the academic world .
Any person who expnds her/his areas of knowledge increases her/his possibility to be successful in life .

A third reason to prefer diversificationi is that it can prevent interest from drying up .
When a person concentrates for a long period on a single subject , he/she is exposed to the risk of losing dedication or flatly identifying with a specific point of view .
Dealing with different subjects , instead , generates a relativistic approach that helps creativity and encourages new points of view .

A clear example of how culture can positively expand in a single human being is offered by some Renassaince intellectuals .
A man like Leonardo da Vinci , for example , could with its knowledge embrace almost any subject known of the time .
Even if in the present days ' reality such cases are not possible anymore because of the incommensurate expansion of human studies , the case of Leonardo still represent a valid example of how a multidisciplinary approach to knowledge can boost human brain power .

In conclusion , even if a few men can aspire to reach the erudition of Leonardo , the arguments above effectively clarify how divesrification of knowledge can benefit intellectual work .
