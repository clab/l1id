I do n't agree with this statement if it is refered to car as a veichle used to go to work or during the summer holiday .
Today the car is the most important veichle adopted by the men to move between the cities .

The global population is growing and for this the car use should growth in twenty years .
Well , I agree to this statment if it is refered to use the cars during the motions between nations .
The big distance between che nation 's capital is very problem .
