I think that what is stated in this question is correct .
It is true that people who decide to specialize on a specific topic could perform in a particular field , allowing him to reach important goals in its professional life .
On the other side a person who do not has a wide knowledge on different subjects , could face some problems in his daily life .
A knowledge of different arguments could help someone to face a speach on multiple subjects showing its huge backgroung .
I think that university shoud avoid to focus their couses on a limited number of subjects and allow students to choose among different couses .
When I choose my univeristy cours I had the possibility choose a personal exam 's plan .
In that occasion I avoid to focalise my study plan on related subjects .
Even if it should be easier to study two similar exams , ( for example international marketing and international business )
I preferred to base my plan on different subject in order to let me the possibility to analise the different subjects and tho choose , in a second time , the argument on which I prefers to focus .
Thanks to this method I 've been able to improve my knowledge on certains subject that I ignored before .
This helped me in my post university environement letting me to chose a professional carrer not strcly related to the one I intendet to take at the beginning of my university cours .
For these resons I think that a specialized knowledje could be interesting for someone who has strong passion on specific subjects , but it should be always supported with a wider knowledge in differents topics .
