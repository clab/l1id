There are a lot of reasons to support this statement , but , in the other hand , there are also a lot of reasons to show big disadvantages in this type of knowledge .

Firstly , at the day of today , it 's very important to have a good specialization in evry type of work .
In fact more and more specializations are required in jobs related not only to high tecnologies but also in all type of work , from office worker to scientist .
If you are specialized in your work you will reach better positions and certainly you will have a big pay .
But there is also a big disadvantage in this type of specialization .
In fact in that way you often do n't know some important things also related to your work as a result of the type of study that you have had .
And there are a lot of situations in which only a more large view of the problem could solve it better than a specialized one .
Another big disadvantage is that it 's certainly better to have a knowledge of a wide range of subjects because it allows you to understand real society and the real knowledge of human beings .

It is useless have a very specialized understanding of complex arguments if you do n't understand all others things .
So I am convinced that with a broad knowledge of many academic subjects you can live in a better way , because you are really aware of the society that surround you .
For example , having only knowledge based on technic you do n't have cultural informations about art and literature and so on .

And , in conclusion , the clever man is not the one that knows all of something , but the one that know something of all .
