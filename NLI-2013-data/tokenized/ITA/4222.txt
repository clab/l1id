I do n't agree with the following statement :
young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities .
I know nowadays we are all selfish and we do n't have enough time to help others or to think or to take care about social conditions where we live in , but I know that some friend of mine spend their free time taking part in events community .

Helping others or taking part in social events brings gratifycation you feel usefull for the society .
Many young people are involved in collective activities in different places of the city .
Mainly these activities have the aim to help someone or to improve something which should be better .
Secondly I think many adults in my city do n't believe in young people and I think the governament should give voice and space avaible for all , in particular for younger .

The crime and deliquency rate 's increased especially between the younger , and I think the adults shoul be their teachers .
The teenager is not the only one guilty .
Finally I think the current daily life is faster than sooner and the living condition for young people are not better nevertheless I know many people help their communities .
It will be better to believe in young people
