I do not agree with this statement .
I believe that young people enjoy life , but I do n't think that young people enjoy life more that older do .
I am 26 years old , I should support the idea that young people enjoy life more that older people do .
However , in my personal experience I have an example that shows that there is one factor , that indipendently from the age can make people enjoy life .
This factor is in the spirit of the people that makes people enjoy the life in every age .
My grand father told me `` keep your spirit young , joyful , and be passionate about learn and listen new things and you will be young in the spirit and you will enjoy life forever '' .
I believe that this is the real key to be happy and enjoy the life in an young age , but continue to enjoy it in an older age .
Before I mention my Grand father .
Well , he his the person that had a great influence in my life and changed my point of view to see life and to enjoy it .
He was 93 years old .
I used to call him the older young boy .
So , he had an interesting life .
First , he fight in the first war , he was an italian spie for the italian government , when the italy fight the first war world .
In addition , he saved many people that were ready to be killed in Germany in the Secon world war .
He knew ten different languages and he travelled in all the world .
However , he was a simple man , humble in the spirit , always ready to listen young and older people .
I has a wonderful memories .
I remeber , when I was child he was showing me the earth , and he used to tell me , Raffaele , be simple like the earth and be always ready to learn new thing becasue this will be the medicine that will keep you young and will give you the elisir to enjoy life .
This example , shows how an old person could enjoy life , without being young , because it was the strenght in his heart .
the light of life in his soul that made him enjoy life .
Today I live in a difficolt world were young people try to enjoy life with drugs and other illunary ideal .
In conclusion , Many times I think about my older Grand father and I tried to fallow his advice .
I hope so !
